  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many of the earlier diversity hotspots studies have focused either on examining the spatial variation in patterns of species richness 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Myers1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Myers1">[37]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Hurlbert1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Hurlbert1">[39]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Gould1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Gould1">[82]</a>, the coincidence of hotspots in different taxa 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Prendergast1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Prendergast1">[38]</a>, or modelling of the relationships between species richness and environment at broad (e.g. 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Currie1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Currie1">[83]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Hawkins1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Hawkins1">[84]</a>) or regional 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Richerson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Richerson1">[85]</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Parviainen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Parviainen1">[87]</a> scales. Such studies provide important insights and preservation of diversity concentrations, but it is increasingly argued that longer-term planning needs to take into account the impacts of climate change on the diversity hotspots 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Milanovich1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Milanovich1">[31]</a> and species-based conservation activities 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Arajo2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Arajo2">[14]</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One commonly used approach for assessing the impacts of climate change on the efficiency of reserve networks is the use of bioclimatic envelope models to predict spatial changes in species distributions, and then relate these projections to the present-day structure of the network. In such studies the probabilities of species occurrences are often converted into plain presence/absence forecasts that can be employed to assess the turnover of species in protected areas 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Arajo1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Arajo1">[13]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Willis1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Willis1">[29]</a>,

   <a rid="pone.0063376-Arajo3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Arajo3">[33]</a>, or combined for different areas to determine future richness hotspots which are not covered by the present reserve network 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Coetzee1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Coetzee1">[11]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Huntley3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Huntley3">[41]</a> or fed into reserve selection algorithms to examine whether new protected areas are required to maintain species representation at an adequate level 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Hannah1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Hannah1">[10]</a>. Some climate change impact studies have specifically focused on projected changes in diversity hotspots, but this is usually done by employing forecasts of species presences/absences to assess species’ future range expansions and contractions 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Carvalho2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Carvalho2">[40]</a>,

   <a rid="pone.0063376-VelsquezTibat1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-VelsquezTibat1">[88]</a>. Such studies share the same potential shortcoming: the loss of information resulting from the conversion of probability values into plain presence/absence data, resulting in limited possibilities for comparing the forcefulness of the projected suitability changes between different areas.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recent studies have made important steps towards sharpening how projections from species climate-impact models are utilized when assessing the efficiency of the reserve network. As regards the problem of assessing species’ conservation status in grid cells with different amounts of protected surface area, an important recent improvement was the development of the joint index that integrates the projected climatic suitability of the cell (i.e. probability of occurrence) with the proportion of the cell that is conserved 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Arajo2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Arajo2">[14]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Alagador1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Alagador1">[34]</a>. In the field of climate change impacts on diversity hotspots, Milanovich et al. 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Milanovich1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Milanovich1">[31]</a> discussed the potential shortcomings of using only one threshold for developing species presence/absence projections and employed two different cut-off levels, whereas McClean et al. 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-McClean1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-McClean1">[89]</a> used species projections with an 11-point probability of occurrence scale to identify sets of grid cells in an African plant priority area for the species in the future. One of the most important studies is that of Marini et al. 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Marini1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Marini1">[35]</a>, where the authors used a wide range of models to generate species-specific cumulative (from the ensemble of 48 separate models) future projections to detect potential gaps in the reserve system for Brazilian Cerrado biome birds. The study culminates in the identification of areas where high future probabilities of occurrence coincide with several species, and the comparison of these hotspots with the current reserve system.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the present study, we also made an attempt to sharpen the BEM-based assessments of the efficiency of the reserve network by taking the predicted probabilities of occurrence as a continuous factor into account, but by integrating some hitherto very rarely applied measures in the process. This was done by considering the amount of protected habitat preferred by the study species in each grid cell (not just the total protected area), developing a joint habitat suitability index for each grid cell and species by multiplying the climatic suitability predictions with the cover of suitable habitat in the cell, and ultimately by combining the species-specific suitability values across all species to produce an overall suitability index for the species groups representing four major habitats. Without doubt, our study has limitations of its own, and it could be developed further by including more than one time slice into which the models are projected (e.g. 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Hannah1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Hannah1">[10]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Huntley3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Huntley3">[41]</a>), wider sets of climate predictor variables 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Synes1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Synes1">[90]</a>, more modelling methods 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Marini1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Marini1">[35]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Carvalho2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Carvalho2">[40]</a> and model selection criteria and envelope uncertainty assessments 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Platts1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Platts1">[86]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Parviainen2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Parviainen2">[91]</a>, for example, but such dimensions are beyond the scope of this work. By and large, the key methodological point put forward in this study is that instead of using plain presence/absence predictions, we should aim to increase the accurateness of the climate change-based assessments on species range changes vs. reserve networks. The consideration of a preferred habitat for the study species in and outside reserves and the integrated habitat suitability index employed here have the potential to provide an important tool for the enhanced analysis of the efficiency of the reserve system.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Patterns of Efficiency of Protected Areas</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a pan-European study, Araújo et al. 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Arajo2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Arajo2">[14]</a> found that a large proportion (58%) of European plant and terrestrial vertebrate species may lose more suitable climate space in presently occupied protected areas than they gain in new areas by 2080. However, so far only a few regional or national studies dealing with the effects of predicted climate change on the biodiversity of protected areas have been carried out in Europe 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Sieck1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Sieck1">[92]</a>. Our detailed analyses of Northern Europe shows that there is a significant between-habitat variation in the patterns of efficiency of the reserve network to preserve species in a future changing climate. There is also variation in the projected efficiency of the reserve network depending on the climate scenario, which in Northern European conditions is largely related to the velocity of climate warming.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results showed high correlations between the species-specific and overall habitat suitability index and the amount of protected focal habitat, which is particularly visible in the high proportion of protected habitat in the 5% hotspot squares based on the overall habitat suitability index for mire and marshland birds. It seems that the present reserve network is efficient or fairly efficient for the mire bird species in all boreal zones and under all the studied climate scenarios, for the marshland species in the southern and middle boreal zones, and for the Arctic mountain species in the northern boreal zone. This success reflects the fact that the conservation efforts of mires and marshlands have been largely targeted at areas where there are large concentrations of these ecosystems, especially in the southern and middle boreal zones.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the other hand, the protected area network for forests appears not to be as efficient as in the other habitats in preserving bird species of conservation concern under a changing climate. Neither the species-specific habitat suitability index of individual species nor the overall suitability index for forest species group positively correlated to any great extent with the occurrence of present protected areas. Therefore, in forests the protected area network is far from adequate for ensuring the survival of forest bird species of conservation concern in a changing climate. In the southern and middle boreal zones in particular the cover of protected areas is clearly too low (2.3–3.7% of forest protected) to provide efficient protection. These findings echo similar concerns put forward in a number of climate change - biodiversity impact assessments. A key point in earlier studies has been that climate change increases the demand for the extent of the reserve network (see, e.g. 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Mawdsley1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Mawdsley1">[6]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Noss1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Noss1">[93]</a>) because species have to disperse across fragmented, human-modified landscapes due to northward range shifts 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Reino1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Reino1">[94]</a>, and protected areas facilitate species’ range expansions 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Thomas2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Thomas2">[95]</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, in the northern boreal zone, a much larger proportion of forests are protected, but protected areas are largely concentrated in the northernmost part of the northern boreal zone. Due to the concentration of protected areas in the northern boreal zone (see 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063376-g003" href="#pone-0063376-g003">Figure 3B</a> and 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063376-g004" href="#pone-0063376-g004">Figure 4</a>), the efficiency of protected areas to preserve forest species is increasing with more pronounced climate warming, under scenario A2. However, this increase does not apply to all the forest bird species studied. In particular, under the A2 scenario the northern species of forests are predicted to decrease the most. Therefore, the distribution patterns of species (e.g. southern or northern) in a given habitat are crucial in analyzing the efficiency of a protected area network to preserve species in the focal habitat.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The importance of acknowledging the differences in species’ geographical ranges has also been demonstrated in the realized population trends in bird species in North Europe. For example, Virkkala and Rajasärkkä 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Virkkala7" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Virkkala7">[96]</a> observed that the population density of southern species had increased and northern species decreased in Finnish protected areas from 1981–1999 to 2000–2009. Moreover, there was a northward density shift of species in protected areas, as the population density of species distributed over the whole country had increased in northern protected areas and decreased in southern protected areas 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Virkkala8" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Virkkala8">[97]</a>. In agreement with this, Brommer et al. 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Brommer1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Brommer1">[98]</a> used broader-scale data from three nationwide bird atlases of Finland to demonstrate that the latitudinal centres of distributions of southern bird species show a clear and significant range shift northwards, and that there is also a tendency for a similar (but not statistically significant) shift in birds with northern ranges. A recent paper 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Hof1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Hof1">[99]</a> further illustrated the potential dangers of deriving confounded results from climate change impact studies when too little attention is paid to the effects of the species’ present-day geographical ranges on the results. Hof et al. 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Hof1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Hof1">[99]</a> reported that the (sub)arctic mammal species in Europe may benefit rather than face increased stress from future climate change, potentially leading to an increased species richness of mammals in northernmost Europe. The problem in this study is that it does not properly separate species with different present-day ranges, and thus mixes the few true Northern European Arctic and subarctic species (e.g. the Arctic fox 
   <span class="italic">Alopex lagopus</span> and the Norway lemming 
   <span class="italic">Lemmus lemmus</span>) with the majority of species which either have large European-wide ranges or which occur predominantly in hemiboreal or temperate regions in Central Europe (e,g, the red fox 
   <span class="italic">Vulpes vulpes</span> and the European rabbit 
   <span class="italic">Oryctolagus cuniculus</span>), and with some introduced alien species (e.g. the American mink 
   <span class="italic">Neovison vison</span>). Given this, the discrepancies between the findings by Hof et al. 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Hof1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Hof1">[99]</a> and the earlier studies 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Virkkala3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Virkkala3">[49]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Jetz1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Jetz1">[51]</a> are not surprising and can be explained by the delimitation of the species set used in the climate change impact modelling and the way the species present-day ranges are acknowledged.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, climate change effects on the bird species of boreal and Arctic habitats are largely habitat-specific, with large differences in response times and susceptibility 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Virkkala9" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Virkkala9">[100]</a>. The different patterns between mires, marshlands and forests are partly due to the fact that the assemblage of bird species of conservation concern is more variable in forests. Almost all bird species of marshlands are southern and all species of mires and Arctic mountains are northern, whereas bird species of forests include both southern and northern species. Thus, the acknowledgement of the variation in distribution patterns both within and between species groups with different habitat preferences is highly important in the assessments of efficiency of protected area networks to preserve biodiversity in the face of climate change.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Aichi biodiversity target for 2020 agreed at the Nagoya summit for the extent of protected areas is at least 17% of land area. Interestingly, our results with bird species of conservation concern are partly parallel with this target, as habitats having an efficient buffer against climate change, mires, marshland and Arctic mountain habitats had an overall higher proportion that was protected, 28%, 25% and over 80%, respectively. This issue, however, is not as straightforward as one might think, because the northern boreal zone, with 23% of forests protected, does not properly preserve forest species according to the different scenarios, due to the unequal location of protected areas and the variation in the forest species distribution pattern.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adaptation to Climate Change</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The protected area network is part of a climate adaptation strategy to preserve biodiversity in a changing climate 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Mawdsley1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Mawdsley1">[6]</a>,

   <a rid="pone.0063376-Wiens1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Wiens1">[102]</a>. In general, climate adaptation strategies to preserve biodiversity can be divided into resistance and resilience strategies. Resistance strategies attempt to maintain the status quo of biodiversity in the face of climate change, and resilience strategies to enhance species and ecosystems to accommodate disturbances caused by changing climate 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Heller1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Heller1">[101]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Poiani1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Poiani1">[103]</a>. Restoring degraded habitats (see also 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Mawdsley1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Mawdsley1">[6]</a>) can be included in resistance strategy, whereas resilience strategies might include translocating species beyond current range limits or actively creating new corridors to allow species movement.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The protected area network in Finnish mires, marshlands or Arctic mountain habitats is not situated at suboptimal sites in relation to predicted climate change, as measured by the probabilities of occurrences of bird species’ conservation concern and the hotspots of the most suitable areas for several species. In the future, protected areas seem to cover a fairly high or high proportion of occurrences of bird species, on average, in these habitats according to all scenarios, with only some slight decreases in the hotspots of predicted species occurrences. However, protected areas cannot ultimately prevent the predicted decrease in the northern species of mires, forests and Arctic mountain habitats 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Kujala1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Kujala1">[20]</a>,

   <a rid="pone.0063376-Virkkala3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Virkkala3">[49]</a> if the climate space for these species disappears. Both degraded mire habitats and forest habitats in terms of biodiversity have been restored in Finnish protected areas in a large programme 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Aapala1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Aapala1">[104]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Simil1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Simil1">[105]</a>, which also benefits the future survival of bird species in these habitats.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the forests of the southern and middle boreal zones, the proportion of habitat protected and the predicted habitat suitabilities of bird species in the 5% hotspots are so low that protected areas are likely to have only a limited impact on the species’ resistance to climate change. Our suitability hotspots results for forest birds suggest that the protected area network would benefit from its enlargement, particularly in the north-eastern part of the southern boreal zone and in the south-eastern and north-western part of the middle boreal zone.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the northern boreal zone the extent of protected areas is much higher, but due to the concentrated location of the areas, the significance of protected areas to preserve forest bird species of conservation concern only seems to come up in more advanced climate warming, particularly according to scenario A2. The concentrated forest protection in the northern boreal zone seems to raise an interesting question: in a mild climate change scenario, the protected area network is clearly inefficient, while in a strong climate change scenario it preserves, on average, species occurrences much more effectively (see, however, the disappearance of northern species, above). Thus, there is no single solution to preserving biodiversity in a changing climate – several future pathways should be considered (see 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Wiens1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Wiens1">[102]</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, the location of future protected areas should be planned in detail in relation to predicted climate change, although in the boreal zone, species have fairly large ranges and therefore species might not be so susceptible to the smaller-scale spatial variation of protected areas (see 
   <a rid="pone.0063376-Virkkala5" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0063376-Virkkala5">[60]</a>). A good example of the effects of the location of protected areas under climate change is the northern boreal zone in Finland, where forests have not been adequately protected, although almost a quarter of the forests are protected.
