 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The patterns in the overall habitat suitability index of species varied between the four species groups, the forest, mire, marshland and mountain bird species. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063376-g002" href="#pone-0063376-g002">Figure 2</a> shows the percentage of total protected habitat in each habitat type in the different vegetation zones, the percentage of protected habitat in the 5% hotspots of the overall habitat suitability index in 1971–2000 and under the three scenarios for 2051–2080. These results suggest that in forest species, the amount of protected forests in the 5% hotspot squares was considerably lower in the northern boreal zone in 1971–2000 compared to the average in the zone. This is due to the fact that in the northern boreal zone, forest protection is concentrated in the northernmost region, where southern forest bird species do not presently occur (

According to the ensemble mean scenario, the proportion protected in 2051–2080 in the 5% hotspots is much higher than in the hotspots of 1971–2000. In the A2 scenario, the proportion protected in the 5% hotspots is six times higher than in the 5% hotspots in 1971–2000 and also higher than the present average in northern boreal forests, indicating the increasing importance of northern reserves for forest species conservation under more severe climatic changes. Geographically, the 5% hotspots are concentrated in the eastern part of the country in the southern and middle boreal zones but not in the northern boreal zone (

The amount of habitat in this calculation was scaled in each square by dividing it by the largest amount of the given habitat in each zone. The probability of species occurrence was based on three different climate scenarios: B1 (CSIRO), ensemble mean of 19 GCM based on A1B (19GCM) and A2 (MIROC3). Squares in which the given habitat was absent were excluded from the correlation analyses. The number of squares included in each species group, in southern, middle and northern boreal zones, respectively: in species of forests 1539, 1164, and 1071, in species of mires 1509, 1159, and 1069, and in species of marshlands 1313, 989, and 636.

In the northern boreal zone there are more significantly (p&lt;0.001) negative (12) than positive correlations (9).
