 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The transmission dynamics of 
  <span class="italic">Flaviviruses</span> are based on a complex relationship among virus occurrence, host and vector species community composition, host behaviour, vector host preferences and competence, and environmental and climatic factors, making each spillover event a unique phenomenon resulting from the combination of all these factors [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B34" href="#B34">34</a>] and references therein.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since oro-fecal shedding is an important amplification route for these viruses, assessing the rate of oro-fecal shedding in various species is important to identify the amplification chain [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B7" href="#B7">7</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B8" href="#B8">8</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B10" href="#B10">10</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B11" href="#B11">11</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B34" href="#B34">34</a>] and references therein. Bird species differ in their susceptibility to WNV and USUV infection. For example, 
  <span class="italic">Passeriformes</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Strigiformes</span> are highly susceptible to USUV infection e.g.: [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B23" href="#B23">23</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B26" href="#B26">26</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B28" href="#B28">28</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B35" href="#B35">35</a>] and 
  <span class="italic">Passeriformes</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Charadriiformes</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Strigiformes</span> are the principal host reservoirs and amplificators of WNV, due to their long-lasting and high levels of viremia e.g.: [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B34" href="#B34">34</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B43" href="#B43">43</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B44" href="#B44">44</a>]. Moreover, it has been suggested that a single species can act as a super-spreader of WNV [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B6" href="#B6">6</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In previous studies, the oro-fecal shedding of USUV was detected in domestic goose (
  <span class="italic">Anser anser f. domestica</span>[
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B38" href="#B38">38</a>]) and domestic chicken (
  <span class="italic">Gallus domesticus</span>[
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B39" href="#B39">39</a>]). Alternatively, 14 out of a total of 39 bird species analysed (for e.g.: Greenfinch

  <span class="italic">Erithacus rubecula</span>) previously tested negative in study also carried out in Italy [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B36" href="#B36">36</a>]. Moreover, shedding was also not evident in the Eurasian Jay (

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With respect to WNV, the species tested by [

  <span class="italic">Corvidae</span> of British Colombia tested by [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B45" href="#B45">45</a>] resulted negative for WNV shedding. In India, 119 species belonging to 30 families and in particular

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B46" href="#B46">46</a>]. This further corroborates the results of the current study. A study carried out in Spain did not find oral shedding in species belonging to several families, namely 
  <span class="italic">Threskiornithidae</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Accipitridae</span>[
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B31" href="#B31">31</a>]. The tracheal and cloacal swabs tested in Germany were negative [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of our study further corroborate the results of a previous study also carried out in Italy, which found there was no evident oro-faecal shedding of USUV in the families 
  <span class="italic">Fringillidae</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Lanidae</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Paridae</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Muscicapidae</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Silvidae</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Turdidae</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Hirundinidae</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Picidae</span>[
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B36" href="#B36">36</a>]. Our results also seem to suggest that birds belonging to the families 
  <span class="italic">Motacillidae</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Prunellidae</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Emberizidae</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Cuculidae</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Egitalidae</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Strigidae</span>, previously never screened for USUV, may not be important shedders of this virus.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considering the migratory birds tested in Italy so far, what has been said for USUV is also valid for WNV. Moreover, this has also been confirmed in India in birds belonging to the families 
  <span class="italic">Cuculidae</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Motacillidae</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Silvidae</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Turdidae</span> (order 
  <span class="italic">Passeriformes</span>) and 
  <span class="italic">Strigidae</span> (order 
  <span class="italic">Strigiformes</span>) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B46" href="#B46">46</a>] and in Germany for 
  <span class="italic">Motacillidae</span>[
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B47" href="#B47">47</a>]. Of the studies that found oro-fecal shedding for WNV, only one was carried out in Europe, but is not possible to compare it with our research mainly for two reasons: firstly, it studied a species belonging to the order 
  <span class="italic">Galliformes</span> that was not included in the current study; and secondly, the birds were experimentally infected with the virus, and so the results may not reflect those seen in natural conditions in the wild [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B54" href="#B54">54</a>]. The other studies were carried out in America and Australia and principally focused on taxonomic groups that are different from the ones that were included in our research (orders: 
  <span class="italic">Columbiformes</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Psittaciformes</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Charadriiformes</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Gruiformes</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Galliformes</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Anseriformes</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Falconiformes</span>). Studies that have been carried out on 
  <span class="italic">Strigiformes</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Passeriformes</span>, also investigated different species to the ones included in our study (for e.g.: family 
  <span class="italic">Corvidae</span>, American Robin, Common Grackle, House Finch, House Sparrow, Cliff Swallow, Golden Eagle, 
  <span class="italic">Bubo</span> spp., 
  <span class="italic">Buteo</span> spp., 
  <span class="italic">Falco</span> spp.).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Accordingly, it seems that the oro-fecal shedding of USUV and WNV in 
  <span class="italic">Cuculiformes</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Piciformes</span> is not intense or it lasts only few days. Regarding 
  <span class="italic">Strigiformes</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Passeriformes</span>, their shedding seems low also for USUV, but for WNV, various families or species could have an important role, such as 
  <span class="italic">Corvidae</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Hirundinidae</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Icteridae</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Turdidae</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Fringillidae</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Passeridae</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Bombycillidae</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Mimidae</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Tytonidae</span>. There are several factors that could explain these different results, for example, the limited number of subjects that were tested and the taxonomical differences between the birds screened. Also, an additional reason could be the period of the year during which the study was carried out in relation to the bird’s physiology: migration requires morphological and physiological changes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B33" href="#B33">33</a>] that could interfere with the viral replication. Moreover, the oro-fecal shedding generally lasts less than 10 days [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B11" href="#B11">11</a>], thus being not easy to detect in clinically healthy animals as in those individuals who are migrating. Besides, the shedding is not always followed by virus transmission e.g.: [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B10" href="#B10">10</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B54" href="#B54">54</a>] and references therein.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Taking into account the need to identify the species and the timing of WNV and USUV amplification, the absence of active shedding detected in this study may also justify the absence of clinically reportable cases of spillovers events to human and animal in Trentino-Alto Adige. Furthermore, at present, no human or animal clinical case of diseases or infections caused by 
  <span class="italic">Flaviviruses</span> have been recorded in this region of Italy. Their circulation is then apparently very limited, in contrast to the high number of cases and the pathogenicity observed in animals, mosquitoes and humans in the neighbouring regions (Veneto, Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Friuli-Venezia Giulia: Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1</a>). A possible explanation of this observed epidemiological pattern could be due to the low density of mosquitoes observed in this area as a result of a low habitat suitability for 
  <span class="italic">Culex</span> spp.: a combination of low anthropization and mountainous orography of the territory, of which about 78% lies over 1,000 m above sea level, and about 55% is covered by coniferous and deciduous forests, with a temperate-oceanic climate, although a sub-Mediteranean climate can be found near Lake Garda. It is not the case that most of the detections of 
  <span class="italic">Flaviviruses</span> monitored in this region were obtained in the region around Lake Garda, which provides a suitable habitat for many species of mosquitoes, including 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Aedes albopictus</span>[
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B60" href="#B60">60</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B61" href="#B61">61</a>], Rizzoli A: personal communication. This is consistent with the observation that viruses transmitted by mosquitoes are more frequently linked to mild climate, irrigated areas, wetlands and marshes with abundant mosquito and bird populations, especially migratory birds for e.g.: [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B16" href="#B16">16</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B46" href="#B46">46</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B47" href="#B47">47</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B62" href="#B62">62</a>]. Another co-factor to be considered is the presence of a high avian biodiversity observed in the region compared to other neighbouring regions. The relationships among high host diversity and low virus spillover have been observed in several disease models, including WNV [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B6" href="#B6">6</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B63" href="#B63">63</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B65" href="#B65">65</a>].
