 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study we did not identify active oro-fecal shedding of WNV and USUV in 322 individual birds belonging to 18 transaharian and 21 intrapaleartic species. The lack of detection of active virus shedding in these species, however, does not exclude the circulation of these viruses within the Region of Trentino-Alto Adige, as noted in a previous study [
