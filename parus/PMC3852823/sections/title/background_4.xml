 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The genus 
  <span class="italic">Flavivirus</span>, family 
  <span class="italic">Flaviviridae</span>, contains more than 70 viruses subdivided into three groups, according to their route of transmission: 1) arthropod-borne, infecting a range of vertebrate hosts through mosquito or tick bites; 2) those spread by an unknown vector, presumed to be limited to infecting vertebrates only, or; 3) those spread by insects only, called ‘insect-specific flaviviruses’ or ‘mosquitoes-only flaviviruses’, because they replicate only in mosquito-derived cells. When considering their observed pathogenicity for humans, those with highest impact on human health in Europe belong to the first group, and include West Nile Virus (WNV), Usutu Virus (USUV), and Tick-borne Encephalitis Virus [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">WNV is a zoonotic agent that has been reported in Africa since the beginning of the 20
  <span class="sup">th</span> century and has since then radiated into Europe, India, Asia, Australia and America. During the last decade, new strains with various pathogenic characteristics have been discovered [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B3" href="#B3">3</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B5" href="#B5">5</a>]. WNV is maintained in nature by a cycle involving ornithophilic mosquitoes as the vector, principally 
  <span class="italic">Culex</span> spp., and birds that are the amplifying hosts. It infects a broad range of avian and mammalian species, but has also been reported to infect reptiles and amphibians. Other mechanisms of transmission include mites and ticks, organ transplant, blood transfusion, breastfeeding, intrauterine infection, and the fecal-oral route [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B6" href="#B6">6</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B11" href="#B11">11</a>] and references therein. In Italy, WNV lineage 1 has been circulating since 1998 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B12" href="#B12">12</a>]. Surveillance activities established in 15 Italian wetlands from 2001 to 2007 detected only sporadic WNV circulations in several areas through seroconversions in chickens and horses [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B13" href="#B13">13</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B15" href="#B15">15</a>] and references therein. Since 2008, WNV lineage 1 has been detected in animals, mosquitoes, and humans in an increasing number of Italian Regions each year, with clinical symptoms reported in horses and humans [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B16" href="#B16">16</a>]. In 2011, the first human infection of WNV lineage 2 was discovered in central Italy, and later detected in birds and mosquitoes in north-eastern Italy and Sardinia [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B17" href="#B17">17</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B18" href="#B18">18</a>]. Based on phylogenetic analyses, isolated strains were grouped in eight distinct lineages [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B19" href="#B19">19</a>]. WNV infection results in flu-like symptoms or neurological disorders with heavy sequelae and eventually death. Many studies, however, have shown that this virus can circulate silently, infecting animals and humans asymptomatically [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">USUV is another 
  <span class="italic">Flavivirus</span> isolated for the first time from 
  <span class="italic">Culex neavei</span> (
  <span class="italic">Cx. neavei</span>) mosquitoes in South Africa in 1959. It is maintained in nature by a mosquito-bird transmission cycle, with the genus 
  <span class="italic">Culex</span> as the main vector, and for several years it has been considered a virus with very low pathogenicity for humans and animals [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B22" href="#B22">22</a>]. It was historically only detected in tropical and subtropical Africa. However, the first European cases were confirmed in Italy in 1996 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B23" href="#B23">23</a>] and then in Austria in 2001 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B24" href="#B24">24</a>], resulting in the deaths of several species of resident birds, including Blackbirds (
  <span class="italic">Turdus merula</span>), Great Gray Owls (
  <span class="italic">Strix nebulosa</span>) and Barn Swallows (
  <span class="italic">Hirundo rustica</span>) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B23" href="#B23">23</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B24" href="#B24">24</a>]. In the following years, the virus was detected in birds and/or mosquitoes of several countries, including more cases in Italy [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B14" href="#B14">14</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B25" href="#B25">25</a>], Switzerland [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B26" href="#B26">26</a>], the UK [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B27" href="#B27">27</a>] and Germany [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B28" href="#B28">28</a>]. Moreover, the virus appears to have increased in pathogenicity, with fatalities in European wild birds [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B23" href="#B23">23</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B26" href="#B26">26</a>]. In 2009, the virus was linked to neurological disorders in humans for the first time in Italy [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B25" href="#B25">25</a>] and references therein.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wild birds are believed to have the potential to maintain, transport, and disperse several 
  <span class="italic">Flaviviruses</span>, as reviewed by some authors e.g.: [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B29" href="#B29">29</a>]. Wild birds living in Africa, Europe and Asia can be divided in migratory and non-migratory (or ‘resident’). The latter permanently live in the territory where they are born and travel only short distances to search for food and new ecosystems. Migratory birds annually undertake journeys, principally in spring and autumn, from their reproductive territory to where they will spend the winter (overwintering grounds) and viceversa. The former include intrapaleartic (or short-distance) migrants moving between Europe, Asia and North Africa; whilst others are long-distance or transaharian migrants, flying between Europe and southern Africa. Since the first appearance of WNV in North America in 1999 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B30" href="#B30">30</a>], much research has been carried out to understand the epidemiological role of bird species, demonstrating that migratory birds are implicated in the spread of diseases over long distances, such as from Africa into Europe, while the successive spread at a local level is mainly induced by resident and short-distance migrants, both for WNV and USUV e.g.: [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B23" href="#B23">23</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B26" href="#B26">26</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B29" href="#B29">29</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B31" href="#B31">31</a>] and references therein. At the stopover sites along their migratory route and once they reach their destination grounds, migratory birds share common habitats with resident species from which they are otherwise separated during the rest of the year, and this exposes them to a great range of vectors and pathogens. The physiological stress of migration can increase their susceptibility to WNV, and/or lead to the reactivation of latent and chronic infections [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B29" href="#B29">29</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B32" href="#B32">32</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B33" href="#B33">33</a>] and references therein.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among the non-vectorial transmission routes of WNV between birds, oral and fecal viral shedding plays a central epidemiological role for many reasons. The fecal-oral secretions and excretions can contaminate the environment, leading to a high number of individuals coming into contact with the virus. In addition, this transmission route can take place in several ways, such as direct and indirect contact (e.g.: inhalation of aerosols, ingestion of contaminated food, preening soiled feathers), intra- and inter-species socialization, feeding of the nestlings, cannibalism and scavenging of infected carcasses. In fact, the viremia in orally-infected animals is similar to the one reached after mosquito bites [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B7" href="#B7">7</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B8" href="#B8">8</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B10" href="#B10">10</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B11" href="#B11">11</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B34" href="#B34">34</a>] and references therein. Furthermore, oral and fecal shedding may last longer than the viraemic phase (usually less than 7 days [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B11" href="#B11">11</a>]), can occur without apparent clinical signs, and may play an important role in determining whether WNV can become established in areas or during seasons when the mosquito densities are too low to provide significant vector-borne transmission [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B14" href="#B14">14</a>]. Oral and fecal shedding and/or oral infection have also been reported in some species of mammals and reptiles [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B10" href="#B10">10</a>] and references therein.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Very little is currently known about USUV, mainly because it was historically confined to Africa, and because its pathogenicity to humans and animals has only recently been recognised. Moreover, these studies have focused in detecting the virus in dead birds e.g.: [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B23" href="#B23">23</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B28" href="#B28">28</a>], through serological tests e.g.: [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B27" href="#B27">27</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B31" href="#B31">31</a>] or through virological or biomolecular testing of blood samples [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B35" href="#B35">35</a>]. Fewer studies using oral and cloacal swabs have been carried out to detect USUV [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B36" href="#B36">36</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B37" href="#B37">37</a>], and only two studies to date have detected the virus [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B38" href="#B38">38</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B39" href="#B39">39</a>], although in another study it was detected in gastrointestinal tract and kidneys of birds using a biomolecular test [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B40" href="#B40">40</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Trentino Alto-Adige, a mountainous Region in northern-eastern Italy, is located on many of the short- and long-distance routes of migratory birds that, from northern Europe, cross the Alps on their way to western Asia or Africa and viceversa [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B41" href="#B41">41</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B42" href="#B42">42</a>]. So far, only a silent circulation of WNV and USUV in this Region has been detected [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B14" href="#B14">14</a>], but the animal species are involved in this cycle have not yet been determined. Despite WNV and USUV sharing some ecological characteristics, knowledge of the natural transmission cycle and of the importance of non-vectorial transmission of USUV are still lacking. Due to the strategic position of this Italian Region in relation to migratory flyways, and the possible role played by migratory birds in the introduction and dispersion of these two 
  <span class="italic">Flaviviruses</span>, we carried out a biomolecular survey to detect if active virus shedding occurs in migratory birds captured during their seasonal migrations, and to evaluate the role of different species in spreading these viruses.
