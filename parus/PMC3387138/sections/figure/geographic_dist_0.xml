  <p>One point represents an individual or a group of individuals sampled in the same location, and large circles represent geographical regions the samples were grouped into. The samples were assigned to subpopulations delimited based on allele frequencies at 14 microsatellite loci (NUC 1 and NUC2), and frequencies of mtDNA haplotypes (MIT1-MIT4) based on the analysis of a larger dataset in Pilot
