  <div class="title">Graphical illustration of correlations between genetic and dietary differentiation and geographic distance.</div>
  <p>Correlations are presented at a population (left) and individual (right) level. (A) The correlation between genetic and stable isotope differentiation. Genetic distances between populations were represented by pairwise 
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>ST</sub> values. Genetic distances between individuals were calculated using a method implemented in GenAlEx. Isotopic distances between populations and individuals were calculated by treating 
   <span class="italic">δ</span>
   <span class="sup">13</span>C and 
   <span class="italic">δ</span>
   <span class="sup">15</span>N values as two-dimensional Cartesian coordinates. Both correlations are significant (see Results). (B) The correlation between genetic and geographic distances. Only the correlation at individual level is significant (
   <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.04). (C) Correlation between stable isotope differentiation and geographic distances. Subpopulation MIT4 was represented by only one individual, and it was excluded from the population-level analysis.
