 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stable isotope abundance values were used as a quantitative measure of dietary differences between individuals and populations that could be related to genetic differentiation and geographical distances between them. This relationship was analyzed using a distance-based redundancy analysis, which is a form of multivariate multiple regression that can be performed directly on a genetic distance response matrix 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-McArdle1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-McArdle1">[28]</a>. For the population-level analysis, we used a matrix of pair-wise 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>ST</sub> values between geographical regions calculated based on the data on genetic variability of all 317 individuals from the earlier study 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Pilot1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Pilot1">[7]</a>. The population-level DISTLM analysis was performed using the published microsatellite DNA data for local populations from 14 geographical regions (CHAR region with stable isotope data for one individual only was excluded from this analysis). For the individual-level analysis, we used pair-wise genetic distances between individuals calculated in GenAlEx 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Peakall1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Peakall1">[29]</a>. For this analysis we used only the genetic data on the same individuals for which stable isotope values were measured. We used wolf diet composition represented by 
  <span class="italic">δ</span>
  <span class="sup">13</span>C and 
  <span class="italic">δ</span>
  <span class="sup">15</span>N values of tissue samples, and geographic distance (latitude and longitude) as predictor variables. We then tested two additional predictor variables: vegetation types and presence/absence of the moose. Moose was the only species for which geographical range did not cover the entire study area, so that the presence/absence criterion could be applied.

  <a rid="pone.0039341-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Anderson1">[30]</a>, we performed the marginal tests on the correlation between stable isotope composition as a proxy for diet composition (hereafter referred to as ‘dietary differences’) and genetic distances between populations or individuals. We also performed the conditional test, where geographical distance was included as a co-variable. This allowed us to examine the extent to which dietary differences explain genetic diversification over and above that explained by geographic distance alone. We also performed the forward selection procedure on both sets of variables, using the program DISTLM 
  <span class="italic">forward</span>
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Anderson2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Anderson2">[31]</a>. The forward selection procedure consists of sequential tests, fitting each set of variables one at a time, conditional on the variables that are already included in the model. This approach allowed us to estimate the proportion of the genetic variation explained by both dietary differences and geographical distance, while controlling for their correlation.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additionally, we analyzed the correlation between genetic distance and dietary differentiation between individuals and populations, using the Mantel test implemented in GenAlEx, which allowed us to graphically illustrate the dependence between these variables. In this analysis, we used the same measures of genetic distances between individuals and populations as in DISTLM analysis, a matrix of pair-wise genetic distances between individuals calculated in GenAlEx, and a matrix of isotopic distances between individuals, that was calculated by treating

  <span class="sup">15</span>N values as two-dimensional Cartesian coordinates.
