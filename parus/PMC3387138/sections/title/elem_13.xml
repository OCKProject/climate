 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The individual-based DISTLM analysis showed that genetic distances were highly correlated with both dietary differentiation and geographical distances (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.0001 in each case). The conditional test showed that dietary differentiation was correlated with genetic distances over and above the influence of geographical distance (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.0002). However, the forward selection procedure fitted geographical distance before dietary differentiation in the multiple regression model. Both variables altogether explained 10% of the genetic variability (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0039341-t004" href="#pone-0039341-t004">Table 4</a>). The moose presence/absence also was highly correlated with genetic distance (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.0001), while no significant correlation was shown for the vegetation types. In the sequential test, both these variables were significant, and they were fitted after the stable isotopic measure of dietary differentiation in the multiple regression model, with the vegetation types being the least important variable (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The population-level DISTLM analysis showed that genetic distances between local populations were correlated with both dietary differentiation (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.005) and geographical distances (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.019), and they explained 46% and 39% of the variation, respectively. The conditional test showed that dietary differentiation was correlated with genetic distances over and above the influence of geographical distance (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.033) and explained 29% of variation. The forward selection procedure fitted dietary differentiation before geographical distance in the multiple regression model. Both variables altogether explained 68% of the genetic variability (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0039341-t004" href="#pone-0039341-t004">Table 4</a>). When latitude and longitude were considered as two separate variables, only latitude was correlated with the genetic distance (P = 0.03), suggesting that the correlation is due to environmental factors that in Europe change along the latitudinal gradient rather than geographical distance alone (see 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Pilot1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Pilot1">[7]</a>). Accordingly, stable isotope differentiation was fitted before latitude by the forward selection procedure (P = 0.02). We also assessed the correlation between isotopic variation among local populations and geographic distance while controlling for genetic distance. This conditional test showed no significant correlation (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.34), suggesting that there is little variation in the stable isotope signal due to geographic distance alone.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moose presence/absence also was highly correlated with the genetic distance (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.0006) and explained 31.5% of the genetic variation. However, in the sequential test, this variable was fitted after the dietary differentiation and geographical distance, and was non-significant (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0039341.s006" href="#pone.0039341.s006">Table S4</a>). Vegetation types were not significantly correlated with genetic distances, and did not increase the genetic variation explained by the predictor variables in the sequential test. When considered separately, 
  <span class="italic">δ</span>
  <span class="sup">13</span>C and 
  <span class="italic">δ</span>
  <span class="sup">15</span>N explained a similar proportion of genetic variability (28% for 
  <span class="italic">δ</span>
  <span class="sup">13</span>C, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.02 and 25% for 
  <span class="italic">δ</span>
  <span class="sup">15</span>N,

  <span class="sup">13</span>C and 
  <span class="italic">δ</span>
  <span class="sup">15</span>N was significantly correlated (R = 0.61, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.02).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Mantel test confirmed the significant correlation of genetic distances with dietary differentiation at both individual (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.008) and population level (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.045), and also showed that at the population level dietary differentiation explains a large percent of genetic variation (R = 0.46; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039341-g003" href="#pone-0039341-g003">Figure 3</a>). There was a marginal correlation between isotopic and geographic distances, not significant at the 0.05 level (Mantel test, R=0.102, P=0.06 for individual-based data and R=0.205, P=0.10 for populations Figure 3).
