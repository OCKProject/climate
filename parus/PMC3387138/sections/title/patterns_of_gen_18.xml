 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Geographic distance is a common factor associated with genetic differentiation. In this study however, correlation data in support of isolation by distance was weak. For example, large geographic distances from east to west sometimes showed low differentiation while small distances north to south showed stronger differentiation. Even when considering latitude and longitude separately, latitude (which unlike longitude showed a significant pattern) still explained less of the genetic variance than the stable isotope data. Our correlations with geographic distance considered straight-line distances, but there are no credible impediments to wolf dispersal over the study range that would suggest a more appropriate pathway 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Pilot1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Pilot1">[7]</a>. Within the study area, there are no altitudinal barriers (elevation across the range varies from zero to about 200 m), most river systems in the region run north to south (and freeze during the winter), and forest habitats are interconnected and form a continuous network. A further possibility is historical vicariance and isolation in allopatry, followed by reconvergence. However, phylogeographic analyses based on mtDNA data do not support such a scenario 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Pilot1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Pilot1">[7]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Pilot2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Pilot2">[44]</a>. Our data show a consistent relationship between genetic differentiation and isotopic values (a proxy for diet) that was greater than correlation with geographic distance, which suggests that ecological factors are important in defining these genetic populations.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The level of neutral genetic differentiation among populations reflects the long-term patterns of effective dispersal, and an association between non-random dispersal based on prey or habitat preferences and genetic differentiation is a likely mechanism. The preference of dispersing individuals toward habitats similar to their natal habitat has been observed in a broad range of animal species 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Davis1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Davis1">[16]</a>. Various authors have proposed that these types of preferences may translate into discretely subdivided populations along physically unobstructed habitat boundaries

  <a rid="pone.0039341-Hoelzel2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Hoelzel2">[12]</a>. Such cryptic population structure was observed in various carnivorous mammals

  <a rid="pone.0039341-Hoelzel2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Hoelzel2">[12]</a>, including grey wolves from North America 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Geffen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Geffen1">[3]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Carmichael1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Carmichael1">[8]</a>â€“
  <a rid="pone.0039341-MuozFuentes1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-MuozFuentes1">[10]</a> and Eastern Europe 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Pilot1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Pilot1">[7]</a>. In carnivores, the availability (i.e. presence, abundance, and conditions affecting hunting success) of familiar prey species is considered as an important habitat cue (e.g. 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Stenseth1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Stenseth1">[2]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Pilot1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Pilot1">[7]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Carmichael1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Carmichael1">[8]</a>). In the grey wolf, it was demonstrated that learning and experience improve hunting success 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Mech1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Mech1">[45]</a>, which may result in individual preferences for particular prey types (though wolves are known to be able to adjust to new prey in some cases, e.g. after translocations). These preferences may affect dispersal decisions, either directly or indirectly (by choosing habitats with familiar characteristics that are correlated with the prey composition). As reviewed in the introduction, this relationship between prey choice and dispersal is also found in various other species, such as other carnivores and cetaceans. It has even been proposed as a mechanism for directed dispersal in micro-organisms (see review in 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Crespi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Crespi1">[46]</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The key role of diet in shaping evolutionary processes in carnivores was also indirectly inferred based on genetic and isotopic analyses of late Pleistocene and early Holocene grey wolves. It has been shown that the Pleistocene wolves in North America and Europe mainly preyed on megafaunal species like large bovids and horses 47,48, and the substantial decline of these prey species at the beginning of the Holocene coincided with complete (North America) or partial (Europe) replacement of wolf mtDNA lineages 44,47.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our study we use a metric related to diet that can be quantified from the same individuals that were also genotyped. This allows a direct comparison between the genetic differentiation among individuals and their diet (to the extent that diet is well represented by the stable isotopic values). We find a stronger signal for diet correlated to genetic distance than found in an earlier study on the same populations 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Pilot1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Pilot1">[7]</a>, and propose that this is due to the greater precision made possible from the stable isotope data (which will reflect total individual diet rather than regional average prey composition) and from the inclusion of data for both metrics from the same set of individual animals. There is some signal for a correlation with geographic distance, as found in an earlier study 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Pilot1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Pilot1">[7]</a>, and other factors are also likely to be affecting our results (such as noise from an imprecise relationship between stable isotope signal and diet, as discussed above).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also found a significant correlation between genetic distance and presence/absence of the moose, which supports the hypothesis that differences in availability of particular prey types constitute an important factor shaping genetic differentiation in wolf populations. However, the forward selection procedure in DISTLM classified this variable as less important than stable isotope data, suggesting that overall dietary differentiation explains wolf genetic variability better than the presence/absence of any single species. Vegetation types were not correlated with genetic variability, unlike in the earlier study 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Pilot1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Pilot1">[7]</a>. However, the earlier study included samples from a wider geographical area, spanning several different habitats, while the present study area included only two habitat types: temperate mixed forest and forest-steppe. This result suggests that within similar habitats, genetic differentiation of wolves may depend directly on differences in prey composition, likely associated with microhabitat differentiation affecting herbivore species distribution and abundance.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The integration of ecology and evolution is a necessary step towards major advances in our understanding of the processes that shape and maintain biodiversity 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Pelletier1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Pelletier1">[49]</a>. Our data provide evidence based on carefully controlled correlations that support a growing literature indicating a relationship between prey or habitat choice and population genetic structure. The inference is consistent and clear, however further data could help determine that there is a causative relationship. The next step towards understanding this system should include tracking studies where individual foraging behavior in natal and post-dispersal locations can be assessed. It may be also worth testing whether the observed patterns are associated with local differential selection.
