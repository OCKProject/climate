  <span class="sup">15</span>N values of potential prey. Stable isotope profiles are presented as mean and standard deviation for: (A) The entire wolf population. Contribution of each prey species to the diet is reported as the 25th to 75th percentile ranges of the estimated feasible distributions; (B) Subpopulations delimited based on microsatellite loci (NUC 1 and 2); (C) Subpopulations delimited based on mtDNA (MIT 1-4); (D) All analyzed individuals. Subpopulation MIT4 was represented by only one individual, and it was excluded from DISTLM analysis (see
