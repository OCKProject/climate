 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both individual-based and population-based analyses consistently showed a correlation between dietary and genetic differentiation. While individual dietary differences explained a comparatively small percentage of the genetic variation (which could be due to strong individual variation in wolf diet, e.g. 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Urton1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Urton1">[32]</a>), the population-level data showed that dietary differences explain a large proportion of genetic differentiation. This association remained significant (with the largest proportion of the genetic variance explained by the diet) after the influence of geographical distance was accounted for. This suggests that ecological factors determining wolf diet (e.g. habitat type and the associated composition of the ungulate community) are contributing to the structuring of wolf populations. We discuss this in the context of alternative interpretations after considering the utility of our stable isotope data as a reliable marker of dietary differentiation in wolves across the study range.

   <a rid="pone.0039341-Urton1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Urton1">[32]</a>. The broad ranges of stable isotope values of Eastern European wolves suggested a highly varied diet and dietary differences among individuals, which is consistent with the results of stable isotope studies on North American wolves

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some portion of wolf isotopic variability potentially could be due to geographic variation (e.g. resulting from variation in plant or soil isotopic values) rather than dietary niche differences between populations. For example, there is an observed gradient in 
   <span class="italic">δ</span>
   <span class="sup">13</span>C values for C
   <sub>3</sub> and C
   <sub>4</sub> terrestrial plants over broad latitudinal ranges

   <sub>4</sub> plants. However, the trophic relationships relevant to our study will be dominated by C
   <sub>3</sub> plants at the base, and do not show a trend over the relevant latitudinal range (50°–60° North) in C
   <sub>3</sub> plants 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Korner1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Korner1">[33]</a>, herbivores or carnivores 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Kelly1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Kelly1">[34]</a>. There is also the potential for a ‘canopy effect’ leading herbivores in open habitat to have different isotopic values than those in forested habitat 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Drucker1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Drucker1">[35]</a>. However, red and roe deer compared among relevant geographic regions in Europe showed no clear difference 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Drucker1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Drucker1">[35]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Stevens1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Stevens1">[36]</a>, and no evidence for a simple canopy effect was found in European red deer 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Stevens1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Stevens1">[36]</a>. Further, a key aspect of the results was the lack of significant correlation between stable isotope signal and geographic distance (see 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039341-g003" href="#pone-0039341-g003">Figure 3</a>), which would not be expected if the signal for a given prey species varied with geographic distance (or would require some unlikely counterbalancing of signals among prey species). We also showed that there was no correlation between isotopic values and geographic distance when we controlled for genetic diversity.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lack of evidence for the correlation between stable isotope composition of wolf tissues and geographic distance is consistent with studies suggesting that variation in ungulate stable isotope signal is not an important factor over the relevant geographic range. We cannot exclude the possibility that plant or soil isotopic values may vary in a non-linear manner, independent of geographical distance, but such variation is much more likely to decrease the strength of the correlation between genetic differentiation and the inferred dietary differentiation than to produce a false signal for a significant correlation. Furthermore, for non-linear variation due to factors other than diet, we could expect inconsistent patterns between the two isotopes (see 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Kelly1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Kelly1">[34]</a>). However, in our study differentiation calculated separately for 
   <span class="italic">δ</span>
   <span class="sup">13</span>C and 
   <span class="italic">δ</span>
   <span class="sup">15</span>N is significantly correlated, and each of these two variables separately explains a similar proportion of the genetic variability.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stable isotope composition of muscle tissue reflects the diet within a period of several weeks 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Rubenstein1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Rubenstein1">[37]</a>, and so seasonal changes in wolf or prey diet 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Darimont1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Darimont1">[38]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Kielland1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Kielland1">[39]</a> could potentially affect the results. We controlled for this by sampling individuals in the winter season only, and there is no evidence for significant variability of wolf diet during the winter season in Eastern Europe 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Filonov1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Filonov1">[20]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Jdrzejewski1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Jdrzejewski1">[22]</a>,

   <a rid="pone.0039341-Sidorovich1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Sidorovich1">[40]</a>. Moreover, all but three regions were sampled in multiple years, so the results represent average diet over several winter seasons. However, we found no correlation between the year of sample collection and diet, as expressed in stable isotope values.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If seasonal patterns or variation in the stable isotope signal of prey species among the geographic regions covered by this study were significantly confounding our analyses, the effect should be to disrupt our ability to detect a particular prey species in multiple regions, and the apparent prey composition in the estimated diets should be inconsistent with data from other sources. The average wolf diet in Eastern Europe during the winter season as estimated from our stable isotope data consisted mainly of ungulates, with an admixture of beaver and hare. Stable isotope studies on North American wolves indicated similar prey choice 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-FoxDobbs1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-FoxDobbs1">[17]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Urton1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Urton1">[32]</a>. This result is also consistent with the studies on wolf feeding ecology in Eastern Europe based on traditional methods such as observational data, stomach and scat analyses 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Filonov1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Filonov1">[20]</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Zunna1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Zunna1">[25]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Sidorovich1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Sidorovich1">[40]</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The differences in the diet composition between local populations estimated using IsoSource also are consistent with these earlier studies, as well as with the data on prey species distribution (though we have not tested for and do not mean to imply a direct match with relative abundance): In north-eastern Europe, the moose is an important part of the ungulate community (in terms of frequency and biomass), and it is an important wolf prey 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Filonov1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Filonov1">[20]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-GadeJorgensen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-GadeJorgensen1">[41]</a>. In the middle latitudes of Eastern Europe, where the moose is less common, and the red deer, roe deer, and wild boar dominate in the ungulate community, a positive selectivity for the red deer and strong functional response to an increase in red deer densities have been observed 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Okarma1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Okarma1">[21]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Jdrzejewski1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Jdrzejewski1">[22]</a>. In southern Europe, where the moose does not occur and the red deer is less abundant, the roe deer and the wild boar dominate in the wolf diet, and in some locations the wild boar is the only wild prey of wolves 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Mattioli1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Mattioli1">[42]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Migli1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Migli1">[43]</a>. Overall the data reflect a pattern of prey choice that is credible based on earlier studies. Various factors may be important in the choice of a particular set of prey in a given location, including but not restricted to relative abundance. As is evident from our IsoSource analyses, the different genetic populations (e.g. MIT1-3) showed diets that included different proportions of key prey species (see 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0039341-t003" href="#pone-0039341-t003">Table 3</a>). These patterns were consistent with but not strictly determined by the geographic distributions of the prey. For example, populations MIT1 and MIT2 are distributed across a similar geographic range (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039341-g001" href="#pone-0039341-g001">Figure 1</a>) and yet their apparent proportional take of different prey species varies (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0039341-t003" href="#pone-0039341-t003">Table 3</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to IsoSource, the MixSIR model did not give precise estimates of wolf diet due to multimodal probability distributions of prey composition. This was the effect of explicitly incorporating the uncertainty associated with dietary discrimination and isotope signatures, and analysing prey with similar isotope profiles 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Moore1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Moore1">[27]</a>. A simulation study showed that results from the MixSIR model converge to IsoSource results when sources of uncertainty are reduced 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Moore1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Moore1">[27]</a>. In our study, the main source of uncertainty was a large variance of prey isotopic signatures resulting from small sample sizes, and therefore more comprehensive prey sampling is needed to obtain precise diet estimates from this model. However, even our limited prey dataset provided a clear support for substantial differentiation between the wolf subpopulations from the northern and southern part of our study area.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Patterns of Genetic Differentiation</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Geographic distance is a common factor associated with genetic differentiation. In this study however, correlation data in support of isolation by distance was weak. For example, large geographic distances from east to west sometimes showed low differentiation while small distances north to south showed stronger differentiation. Even when considering latitude and longitude separately, latitude (which unlike longitude showed a significant pattern) still explained less of the genetic variance than the stable isotope data. Our correlations with geographic distance considered straight-line distances, but there are no credible impediments to wolf dispersal over the study range that would suggest a more appropriate pathway 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Pilot1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Pilot1">[7]</a>. Within the study area, there are no altitudinal barriers (elevation across the range varies from zero to about 200 m), most river systems in the region run north to south (and freeze during the winter), and forest habitats are interconnected and form a continuous network. A further possibility is historical vicariance and isolation in allopatry, followed by reconvergence. However, phylogeographic analyses based on mtDNA data do not support such a scenario 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Pilot1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Pilot1">[7]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Pilot2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Pilot2">[44]</a>. Our data show a consistent relationship between genetic differentiation and isotopic values (a proxy for diet) that was greater than correlation with geographic distance, which suggests that ecological factors are important in defining these genetic populations.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The level of neutral genetic differentiation among populations reflects the long-term patterns of effective dispersal, and an association between non-random dispersal based on prey or habitat preferences and genetic differentiation is a likely mechanism. The preference of dispersing individuals toward habitats similar to their natal habitat has been observed in a broad range of animal species 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Davis1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Davis1">[16]</a>. Various authors have proposed that these types of preferences may translate into discretely subdivided populations along physically unobstructed habitat boundaries

   <a rid="pone.0039341-Carmichael1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Carmichael1">[8]</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0039341-MuozFuentes1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-MuozFuentes1">[10]</a> and Eastern Europe 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Pilot1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Pilot1">[7]</a>. In carnivores, the availability (i.e. presence, abundance, and conditions affecting hunting success) of familiar prey species is considered as an important habitat cue (e.g. 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Stenseth1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Stenseth1">[2]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Pilot1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Pilot1">[7]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Carmichael1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Carmichael1">[8]</a>). In the grey wolf, it was demonstrated that learning and experience improve hunting success 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Mech1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Mech1">[45]</a>, which may result in individual preferences for particular prey types (though wolves are known to be able to adjust to new prey in some cases, e.g. after translocations). These preferences may affect dispersal decisions, either directly or indirectly (by choosing habitats with familiar characteristics that are correlated with the prey composition). As reviewed in the introduction, this relationship between prey choice and dispersal is also found in various other species, such as other carnivores and cetaceans. It has even been proposed as a mechanism for directed dispersal in micro-organisms (see review in 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Crespi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Crespi1">[46]</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The key role of diet in shaping evolutionary processes in carnivores was also indirectly inferred based on genetic and isotopic analyses of late Pleistocene and early Holocene grey wolves. It has been shown that the Pleistocene wolves in North America and Europe mainly preyed on megafaunal species like large bovids and horses 47,48, and the substantial decline of these prey species at the beginning of the Holocene coincided with complete (North America) or partial (Europe) replacement of wolf mtDNA lineages 44,47.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our study we use a metric related to diet that can be quantified from the same individuals that were also genotyped. This allows a direct comparison between the genetic differentiation among individuals and their diet (to the extent that diet is well represented by the stable isotopic values). We find a stronger signal for diet correlated to genetic distance than found in an earlier study on the same populations 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Pilot1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Pilot1">[7]</a>, and propose that this is due to the greater precision made possible from the stable isotope data (which will reflect total individual diet rather than regional average prey composition) and from the inclusion of data for both metrics from the same set of individual animals. There is some signal for a correlation with geographic distance, as found in an earlier study 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Pilot1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Pilot1">[7]</a>, and other factors are also likely to be affecting our results (such as noise from an imprecise relationship between stable isotope signal and diet, as discussed above).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also found a significant correlation between genetic distance and presence/absence of the moose, which supports the hypothesis that differences in availability of particular prey types constitute an important factor shaping genetic differentiation in wolf populations. However, the forward selection procedure in DISTLM classified this variable as less important than stable isotope data, suggesting that overall dietary differentiation explains wolf genetic variability better than the presence/absence of any single species. Vegetation types were not correlated with genetic variability, unlike in the earlier study 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Pilot1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Pilot1">[7]</a>. However, the earlier study included samples from a wider geographical area, spanning several different habitats, while the present study area included only two habitat types: temperate mixed forest and forest-steppe. This result suggests that within similar habitats, genetic differentiation of wolves may depend directly on differences in prey composition, likely associated with microhabitat differentiation affecting herbivore species distribution and abundance.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The integration of ecology and evolution is a necessary step towards major advances in our understanding of the processes that shape and maintain biodiversity 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Pelletier1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Pelletier1">[49]</a>. Our data provide evidence based on carefully controlled correlations that support a growing literature indicating a relationship between prey or habitat choice and population genetic structure. The inference is consistent and clear, however further data could help determine that there is a causative relationship. The next step towards understanding this system should include tracking studies where individual foraging behavior in natal and post-dispersal locations can be assessed. It may be also worth testing whether the observed patterns are associated with local differential selection.
