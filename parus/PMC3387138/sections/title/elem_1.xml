   <span class="sup">15</span>N values) of muscle tissues of 110 grey wolves from Russia, Belarus, Latvia, Ukraine, and Poland. They represented a subsample of 317 individuals from 15 geographical regions that were analyzed for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region and 14 microsatellite loci by Pilot

The number of samples analyzed per region was limited by the availability of the suitable material (i.e. muscle tissue samples preserved frozen). Other types of tissue could not be used in the comparative analysis due to differences in the isotopic turnover rate, and ethanol-preserved samples were not suitable for the analysis. As shown in the study on North American grey wolves, the sample sizes of n ≥4 should correctly reflect the stable isotope profiles of the local populations 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-FoxDobbs1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-FoxDobbs1">[17]</a>. These results are consistent with another study performed for the black-tailed deer 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Clementz1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Clementz1">[18]</a>. All samples were collected in the winter season (November-March) over a period of 9 years between 1995 and 2004. All individuals were adults or subadults, i.e. all were weaned. Individuals of both sexes were analyzed: 68 (62%) males and 42 (38%) females.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We analyzed muscle tissue samples which have a relatively fast turnover rate (a few months), because this allowed us to assess the diet obtained from an individual within a single locality, and to thereby avoid confounding signals from diet during earlier life stages (as would be reflected in bone collagen). Most wolves disperse from their natal packs, and they are able to move over distances up to 1000 km 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Wabakken1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Wabakken1">[19]</a>. Therefore, using muscle tissue instead of bone collagen allowed us to control for geographic location when comparing isotopic variation against genetic diversity. The short time span represented in the muscle tissues is compensated by the fact that the samples from all but three regions were obtained in multiple years, and from a range of dates through the winter months. Therefore they represent averaged diet signals from several winter seasons and provide a good representation of the full winter season. Our data are thus season-specific yet time-averaged.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additionally, in order to check whether stable isotope profiles accurately reflect wolf diet, we analyzed muscle tissue samples from the most common wolf prey species in Eastern Europe: moose 
   <span class="italic">Alces alces</span> (5 individuals), red deer 
   <span class="italic">Cervus elaphus</span> (5), roe deer 
   <span class="italic">Capreolus capreolus</span> (5), wild boar 
   <span class="italic">Sus scrofa</span> (4), beaver 
   <span class="italic">Castor fiber</span> (5), and brown hare 
   <span class="italic">Lepus europaeus</span> (9). These species accounted for a majority of biomass consumed by wolves in Eastern European ecosystems, as inferred from feces or stomach content composition

   <a rid="pone.0039341-Zunna1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Zunna1">[25]</a>. The prey tissues were also sampled in Central-Eastern Europe, but did not cover all the geographic range of the wolf samples. Small sample size and geographic coverage of prey species (due to the limited availability of contemporary samples for this study) limits our resolution for determining diet composition, but this is not a primary objective for this study where our focus is instead on comparing a proxy to diet (wolf

To extract lipids, dried powdered samples were placed in glass tubes and immersed in 1.5 ml of 2∶ 1 mixture of chloroform : methanol. Samples were left in a shaker for 24 hours, then left undisturbed for 30 min, centrifuged for 10 min at 8 000 rpm and the supernatant was then discarded.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The differences in isotopic abundance values for carbon and nitrogen among wolves in different geographical regions and subpopulations were evaluated using Kruskal–Wallis test. Relative consumption of different prey species by wolves was estimated using a dietary mixing model implemented in the program IsoSource 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Phillips1">[26]</a>. IsoSource uses isotopic ratios to quantitatively determine the proportional contribution of several sources to a mixture, i.e. in this case the proportion of different prey species in the wolf diet. To calculate dietary endpoints corresponding to specific prey items, we used the mean isotopic signatures of muscles of each prey species corrected for dietary discrimination by adding the wolf-diet trophic enrichment values of 1.3±0.6‰ for

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also applied a Bayesian stable isotope mixing model implemented in the software MixSIR 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Moore1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Moore1">[27]</a>, which allowed us to account for uncertainty associated with multiple prey, and uncertainty in isotope values of each prey and the predator. Because we wanted to test how informative our data is, rather than precisely reconstruct the diet, we used uninformative priors. We performed 100,000,000 iterations in each run, which was sufficient to obtain a good performance of the model (see

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stable isotope abundance values were used as a quantitative measure of dietary differences between individuals and populations that could be related to genetic differentiation and geographical distances between them. This relationship was analyzed using a distance-based redundancy analysis, which is a form of multivariate multiple regression that can be performed directly on a genetic distance response matrix 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-McArdle1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-McArdle1">[28]</a>. For the population-level analysis, we used a matrix of pair-wise

   <sub>ST</sub> values between geographical regions calculated based on the data on genetic variability of all 317 individuals from the earlier study 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Pilot1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Pilot1">[7]</a>. The population-level DISTLM analysis was performed using the published microsatellite DNA data for local populations from 14 geographical regions (CHAR region with stable isotope data for one individual only was excluded from this analysis). For the individual-level analysis, we used pair-wise genetic distances between individuals calculated in GenAlEx 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Peakall1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Peakall1">[29]</a>. For this analysis we used only the genetic data on the same individuals for which stable isotope values were measured. We used wolf diet composition represented by 
   <span class="italic">δ</span>
   <span class="sup">13</span>C and 
   <span class="italic">δ</span>
   <span class="sup">15</span>N values of tissue samples, and geographic distance (latitude and longitude) as predictor variables. We then tested two additional predictor variables: vegetation types and presence/absence of the moose. Moose was the only species for which geographical range did not cover the entire study area, so that the presence/absence criterion could be applied.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the program DISTLM v.5 
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Anderson1">[30]</a>, we performed the marginal tests on the correlation between stable isotope composition as a proxy for diet composition (hereafter referred to as ‘dietary differences’) and genetic distances between populations or individuals. We also performed the conditional test, where geographical distance was included as a co-variable. This allowed us to examine the extent to which dietary differences explain genetic diversification over and above that explained by geographic distance alone. We also performed the forward selection procedure on both sets of variables, using the program DISTLM 
   <span class="italic">forward</span>
   <a rid="pone.0039341-Anderson2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Anderson2">[31]</a>. The forward selection procedure consists of sequential tests, fitting each set of variables one at a time, conditional on the variables that are already included in the model. This approach allowed us to estimate the proportion of the genetic variation explained by both dietary differences and geographical distance, while controlling for their correlation.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additionally, we analyzed the correlation between genetic distance and dietary differentiation between individuals and populations, using the Mantel test implemented in GenAlEx, which allowed us to graphically illustrate the dependence between these variables. In this analysis, we used the same measures of genetic distances between individuals and populations as in DISTLM analysis, a matrix of pair-wise genetic distances between individuals calculated in GenAlEx, and a matrix of isotopic distances between individuals, that was calculated by treating
