 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our study, the mean 
  <span class="italic">δ</span>
  <span class="sup">13</span>C value for muscle tissue in Eastern European wolves was the same order as that reported for North American wolves from Minnesota 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-FoxDobbs1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-FoxDobbs1">[17]</a>. However, the mean 
  <span class="italic">δ</span>
  <span class="sup">15</span>N value in North American wolves was 2.1‰ lower. This may result from the lack of wild boar (which as an omnivore has higher tissue 
  <span class="italic">δ</span>
  <span class="sup">15</span>N values than primary consumers such as cervids and hares) from the diet of North American wolves, and from lower 
  <span class="italic">δ</span>
  <span class="sup">15</span>N values of the same or sister prey species in North America as compared to Europe 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-FoxDobbs1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-FoxDobbs1">[17]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Urton1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Urton1">[32]</a>. The broad ranges of stable isotope values of Eastern European wolves suggested a highly varied diet and dietary differences among individuals, which is consistent with the results of stable isotope studies on North American wolves 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-FoxDobbs1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-FoxDobbs1">[17]</a>,

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some portion of wolf isotopic variability potentially could be due to geographic variation (e.g. resulting from variation in plant or soil isotopic values) rather than dietary niche differences between populations. For example, there is an observed gradient in 
  <span class="italic">δ</span>
  <span class="sup">13</span>C values for C
  <sub>3</sub> and C
  <sub>4</sub> terrestrial plants over broad latitudinal ranges 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Korner1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Korner1">[33]</a>, most pronounced in C
  <sub>4</sub> plants. However, the trophic relationships relevant to our study will be dominated by C
  <sub>3</sub> plants at the base, and do not show a trend over the relevant latitudinal range (50°–60° North) in C
  <sub>3</sub> plants 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Korner1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Korner1">[33]</a>, herbivores or carnivores 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Kelly1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Kelly1">[34]</a>. There is also the potential for a ‘canopy effect’ leading herbivores in open habitat to have different isotopic values than those in forested habitat 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Drucker1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Drucker1">[35]</a>. However, red and roe deer compared among relevant geographic regions in Europe showed no clear difference 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Drucker1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Drucker1">[35]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Stevens1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Stevens1">[36]</a>, and no evidence for a simple canopy effect was found in European red deer 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Stevens1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Stevens1">[36]</a>. Further, a key aspect of the results was the lack of significant correlation between stable isotope signal and geographic distance (see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039341-g003" href="#pone-0039341-g003">Figure 3</a>), which would not be expected if the signal for a given prey species varied with geographic distance (or would require some unlikely counterbalancing of signals among prey species). We also showed that there was no correlation between isotopic values and geographic distance when we controlled for genetic diversity.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lack of evidence for the correlation between stable isotope composition of wolf tissues and geographic distance is consistent with studies suggesting that variation in ungulate stable isotope signal is not an important factor over the relevant geographic range. We cannot exclude the possibility that plant or soil isotopic values may vary in a non-linear manner, independent of geographical distance, but such variation is much more likely to decrease the strength of the correlation between genetic differentiation and the inferred dietary differentiation than to produce a false signal for a significant correlation. Furthermore, for non-linear variation due to factors other than diet, we could expect inconsistent patterns between the two isotopes (see 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Kelly1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Kelly1">[34]</a>). However, in our study differentiation calculated separately for 
  <span class="italic">δ</span>
  <span class="sup">13</span>C and 
  <span class="italic">δ</span>
  <span class="sup">15</span>N is significantly correlated, and each of these two variables separately explains a similar proportion of the genetic variability.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stable isotope composition of muscle tissue reflects the diet within a period of several weeks 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Rubenstein1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Rubenstein1">[37]</a>, and so seasonal changes in wolf or prey diet 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Darimont1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Darimont1">[38]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Kielland1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Kielland1">[39]</a> could potentially affect the results. We controlled for this by sampling individuals in the winter season only, and there is no evidence for significant variability of wolf diet during the winter season in Eastern Europe 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Filonov1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Filonov1">[20]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Jdrzejewski1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Jdrzejewski1">[22]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Andersone1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Andersone1">[24]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Zunna1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Zunna1">[25]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Sidorovich1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Sidorovich1">[40]</a>. Moreover, all but three regions were sampled in multiple years, so the results represent average diet over several winter seasons. However, we found no correlation between the year of sample collection and diet, as expressed in stable isotope values.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If seasonal patterns or variation in the stable isotope signal of prey species among the geographic regions covered by this study were significantly confounding our analyses, the effect should be to disrupt our ability to detect a particular prey species in multiple regions, and the apparent prey composition in the estimated diets should be inconsistent with data from other sources. The average wolf diet in Eastern Europe during the winter season as estimated from our stable isotope data consisted mainly of ungulates, with an admixture of beaver and hare. Stable isotope studies on North American wolves indicated similar prey choice 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-FoxDobbs1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-FoxDobbs1">[17]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Urton1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Urton1">[32]</a>. This result is also consistent with the studies on wolf feeding ecology in Eastern Europe based on traditional methods such as observational data, stomach and scat analyses 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Filonov1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Filonov1">[20]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Zunna1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Zunna1">[25]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Sidorovich1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Sidorovich1">[40]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The differences in the diet composition between local populations estimated using IsoSource also are consistent with these earlier studies, as well as with the data on prey species distribution (though we have not tested for and do not mean to imply a direct match with relative abundance): In north-eastern Europe, the moose is an important part of the ungulate community (in terms of frequency and biomass), and it is an important wolf prey 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Filonov1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Filonov1">[20]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-GadeJorgensen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-GadeJorgensen1">[41]</a>. In the middle latitudes of Eastern Europe, where the moose is less common, and the red deer, roe deer, and wild boar dominate in the ungulate community, a positive selectivity for the red deer and strong functional response to an increase in red deer densities have been observed 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Okarma1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Okarma1">[21]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Jdrzejewski1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Jdrzejewski1">[22]</a>. In southern Europe, where the moose does not occur and the red deer is less abundant, the roe deer and the wild boar dominate in the wolf diet, and in some locations the wild boar is the only wild prey of wolves 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Mattioli1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Mattioli1">[42]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Migli1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Migli1">[43]</a>. Overall the data reflect a pattern of prey choice that is credible based on earlier studies. Various factors may be important in the choice of a particular set of prey in a given location, including but not restricted to relative abundance. As is evident from our IsoSource analyses, the different genetic populations (e.g. MIT1-3) showed diets that included different proportions of key prey species (see 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0039341-t003" href="#pone-0039341-t003">Table 3</a>). These patterns were consistent with but not strictly determined by the geographic distributions of the prey. For example, populations MIT1 and MIT2 are distributed across a similar geographic range (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039341-g001" href="#pone-0039341-g001">Figure 1</a>) and yet their apparent proportional take of different prey species varies (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0039341-t003" href="#pone-0039341-t003">Table 3</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to IsoSource, the MixSIR model did not give precise estimates of wolf diet due to multimodal probability distributions of prey composition. This was the effect of explicitly incorporating the uncertainty associated with dietary discrimination and isotope signatures, and analysing prey with similar isotope profiles 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Moore1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Moore1">[27]</a>. A simulation study showed that results from the MixSIR model converge to IsoSource results when sources of uncertainty are reduced 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Moore1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Moore1">[27]</a>. In our study, the main source of uncertainty was a large variance of prey isotopic signatures resulting from small sample sizes, and therefore more comprehensive prey sampling is needed to obtain precise diet estimates from this model. However, even our limited prey dataset provided a clear support for substantial differentiation between the wolf subpopulations from the northern and southern part of our study area.
