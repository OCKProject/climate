 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The differences in isotopic abundance values for carbon and nitrogen among wolves in different geographical regions and subpopulations were evaluated using Kruskal–Wallis test. Relative consumption of different prey species by wolves was estimated using a dietary mixing model implemented in the program IsoSource 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Phillips1">[26]</a>. IsoSource uses isotopic ratios to quantitatively determine the proportional contribution of several sources to a mixture, i.e. in this case the proportion of different prey species in the wolf diet. To calculate dietary endpoints corresponding to specific prey items, we used the mean isotopic signatures of muscles of each prey species corrected for dietary discrimination by adding the wolf-diet trophic enrichment values of 1.3±0.6‰ for

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also applied a Bayesian stable isotope mixing model implemented in the software MixSIR 
  <a rid="pone.0039341-Moore1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0039341-Moore1">[27]</a>, which allowed us to account for uncertainty associated with multiple prey, and uncertainty in isotope values of each prey and the predator. Because we wanted to test how informative our data is, rather than precisely reconstruct the diet, we used uninformative priors. We performed 100,000,000 iterations in each run, which was sufficient to obtain a good performance of the model (see
