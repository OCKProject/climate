  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Blood sampling was performed at six sites in two watersheds in Georgia, USA. Three sites were in Tift County in the Little River watershed, which drains Tifton, Georgia and from which 
   <span class="italic">Salmonella</span> spp. is often recovered (
   <a rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0200">Haley et al., 2009</a>). This area is considered a key agricultural region, with nearly 40% in crops, 45% forested, and &lt;15% pastures, urban areas and water. Topographically, it follows the characteristics of the coastal plain (heavy vegetation, flood plains, and stream channels). The altitude in this watershed varied from 700 to ∼5300 ft. Sampling stations were selected to include 1st to 4th order streams with assorted levels of flow during the course of the year. Three additional sites were located in the Oconee River watershed, which has an average altitude of 1000 ft, and is surrounded by a rural landscape, composed primarily of poultry, dairy and beef farming. Sampling stations were located along the North Oconee River and its tributaries (including Sandy Creek) in Madison, Jackson and Clarke Counties (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sampling took place in two biologically-relevant seasons for birds: breeding (April–June) and non-breeding (September–March) in 2010 and 2011. Birds were captured using 12 and 18 m long, 38 mm mesh nylon mist nets, extended to a maximum height of 3 m from the ground. To control for body condition-biases in sampling (
   <a rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0190">Gorney et al., 1999</a>), we did not use food as lure for bird captures. Different numbers of mist nets were set, depending on the number of locations identified at a site with high bird activity, site capacity, and capture opportunity. Nets were checked every 15–20 min. All birds were identified to species, and banded with a butt-end metal Federal band. Each bird captured was physically examined and the following information was recorded: date of capture, gender (if possible), stage-based age (hatch year (HY) or adult), and standard morphometric measurements (body weight, wing cord, culmen, tarsus-metatarsus, tail length) (
   <a rid="b0355" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0355">Pyle, 1997</a>). The BMI was calculated by dividing body mass by the wing cord (
   <a rid="b0265" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0265">Jones et al., 2009</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Blood was obtained with syringes with 27- or 29-gauge needles (BD insulin syringes; Becton Dickinson, 1 Becton Drive, Franklin Lakes, NJ 07417, USA) from the right jugular vein in songbirds, except for Columbiformes, from which blood was collected from the brachial vein. The volume of blood collected was never &gt;1% of the total body weight. Two thin blood smears were immediately made from each sample and a portion of whole blood in heparin was used to calculate a PCV value by centrifuging a heparizined microhematocrit tube (StatSpin Microhematocrit tubes; StatSpin Technologies Inc., 60 Glacier Drive, Westwood, MA 02090, USA) at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. Remaining whole blood was frozen at −80 °C for future studies. Fecal samples were collected from disposable paper bags used to individually hold birds until they could be processed. For isolation of 
   <span class="italic">Salmonella</span>, approximately 1 g of feces was enriched by inoculation into Dulcitol Selenite media (pre-prepared in house) and incubated at 41.5 °C for 18 h. Enrichment broths were streaked on 
   <span class="italic">Salmonella</span> differential media XLT4, BGN and MacConkey agars (Remel, Lenexa, KS 66215, USA) followed by 37 °C incubation overnight. Colonies with appropriate colony morphology for the selective plate were isolated and further characterized with biochemical tests. A delayed-secondary enrichment was carried out for all samples that cultured negative after the first primary enrichment.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All birds were immediately released at the site of capture following sampling. The capturing, processing and handling procedures were review and approved by the University of Georgia IACUC committee (#A2010 08-159).</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Blood smears were air-dried, fixed with 100% methanol, and stained using a modified Romanowsky staining technique (Diff Quick®, Jorgensen Laboratories, 1450 Van Buren Ave., Loveland, CO 80538, USA). The entire slide was scanned for microfilaria at 100×, and the monocellular layer was examined at 400× and 1000× (with oil immersion) for 10 min for haemoparasites, which were identified to genus based on morphology (
   <a rid="b0425" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0425">Valkiunas, 2005</a>). Polychromasia was determined by counting the number of polychromatophilic erythrocytes per 200 erythrocytes.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A subset (
   <span class="italic">n</span> 
   <span class="italic">= </span>113) of samples positive for haemotozoan parasites on blood smear was tested using a nested PCR that targets the cytochrome 
   <span class="italic">b</span> (cyt 
   <span class="italic">b</span>) gene. DNA was extracted from whole blood using DNeasy kit (Qiagen, Germantown, Maryland, USA) and amplification of partial cyt 
   <span class="italic">b</span> gene was conducted using primers HaemNFI and HaemNR3 and HaemF and HaemR2 (
   <a rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0225">Hellgren et al., 2004</a>). Initially the PCR was conducted using a 55 °C annealing temperature; however, due to poor amplification of known positive samples, the annealing temperature was decreased to 50 °C. Amplicons were then sequenced bi-directionally at the University of Georgia Genomics Facility (Athens, Georgia, USA). Sequence chromatograms were analyzed in Sequencher v5.1 (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and cleaned sequences were then aligned using MEGA v5.1 (
   <a rid="b0420" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0420">Tamura et al., 2007</a>) using the clustalW algorithm. Samples were characterized to genera using BLAST and a Neighbor Joining phylogenetic analysis. A minimum spanning tree was then calculated based on differences among haplotypes using Arlequin v3.11 (
   <a rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0135">Excoffier et al., 2005</a>). Only sequences that contained the full 479 bp between the HaemF and HaemR2 primers and did not contain any ambiguous bases where used for haplotype analysis. Comparison of number of haplotypes by site location (north vs. south), migratory status (resident vs. migratory), and foraging guild was done using Fisher’s exact test using R v2.15.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data analysis</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although we captured and processed 53 species of birds, five were chosen for complete analysis because these species were most frequently captured and their life histories varied which may have altered exposure to vectors (e.g. foraging guild, migratory status) (
   <a rid="t0005" ref-type="table" href="#t0005">Table 1</a>). These target species were the Northern Cardinal (
   <span class="italic">Cardinalis cardinalis</span>), Tufted Titmouse (
   <span class="italic">Baeolophus bicolor</span>), White-throated Sparrow (
   <span class="italic">Zonotrichia albicollis</span>), Carolina Wren (
   <span class="italic">Thryothorus ludovicianus</span>) and Indigo Bunting (
   <span class="italic">Passerina cyanea</span>). For measures in which the covariate “species” was not statistically important, we ran the analysis with the total number of species that were captured. All analyses were performed using the statistical software SAS/STAT, Version 9.3 (
   <a rid="b0260" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0260">SAS Institute, Inc., 2011</a>). Due to insufficient sample size of hatch-year and after-hatch-year birds, these two age classes were grouped together and compared to adults. Birds were also placed in three different foraging guilds: ground, low-middle and middle-upper canopy according to 
   <a rid="b0405" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0405">Sibley (2003)</a>. A significance level of 0.05 was used for all analyses.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Logistic regression was used to model the probability of infection from particular parasites based on all available information (e.g., species, age, sex, capture location, BMI and breeding season). All haemoparasites included in the study were used individually as dependent variables in separate logistic regression models. Polychromasia and PCV were not included in this analysis because of large number of missing values for these variables. An ordinal logistic regression was used to model the probability of different levels of infection. The response variable in this case is number of infections, with 3 categories: 0 for no infection, 1 for only one parasite present, and 2 for more than one parasite present. We used an ordinal logistic regression in order to model the ordinal response variable of infection, which records the number of infections of a single bird as 0, 1, or greater than 1. Two models are then created in this type of analysis (one for predicting the probability of having infections with two or more groups of parasites, and a second for predicting the probability of having infection with at least one parasite type). We worked under the proportional odds assumption that the odds ratio of having a higher level of infection for any particular predictor is the same for each of the two models.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine if there was any significant association between prevalence of infection with a particular haemoparasite and bird species (which includes migratory status and foraging guild), to test the association between prevalence of infection with each type of haemoparasite and breeding season, and to identify associations between prevalence of infection and the sites in which birds were sampled, we performed a Fisher’s exact test. Comparison of number of haplotypes by site location (North vs. South), migratory status (Resident vs. Migratory), and foraging guild was done using Fisher’s exact.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine if there was any significant relationship between the prevalence of infection with a particular haemoparasite and the PCV and polychromasia, and, whenever possible, whether age or gender influenced PCV or polychromasia, we performed 
   <span class="italic">t</span>-tests. Before each 
   <span class="italic">t</span>-test was run, a test of equal variances of the two groups (those with and without infection) was performed using a Folded 
   <span class="italic">F</span>-test. Then, a method for the 
   <span class="italic">t</span>-test (Pooled or Satterthwaite) was determined based on the outcome of the 
   <span class="italic">F</span>-test. The pooled method for the 
   <span class="italic">t</span>-test was used for the equal variance assumption, whereas the Satterthwaite method was used when unequal variances occurred (
   <span class="italic">p</span>-value of the Folded 
   <span class="italic">F</span>-test &lt;0.05).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine if there was any relationship between the species of the bird and PCV and polychromasia, we performed an ANOVA 
   <span class="italic">F</span>-test as a preliminary test. If differences were noted, we conducted a multiple comparison test (Tukey’s test). We used a 
   <span class="italic">t</span>-test to assess the associations between PCV, polychromasia, and BMI with breeding season and separately, with location. 
   <span class="italic">T</span>-tests were also used to identify a relationship between prevalence of infection and BMI.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lastly, we were interested in knowing whether there was any correlation between PCV and polychromasia, thus we utilized a Pearson correlation to examine this relationship.</p>
