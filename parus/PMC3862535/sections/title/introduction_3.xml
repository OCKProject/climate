 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Blood parasites have long been recognized as common in many wild bird species; however, their potential role as disease agents and their influence on avian ecology has been widely discussed (
  <a rid="b0295" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0295">Loye and Zuk, 1991</a>). The variation in the prevalence of blood parasites among species of birds has been used to test hypotheses about the effects of sexual selection, parental investment in disease resistance, and how vector abundance influences infection. In fact, infections with macro and micro-parasites are recognized as one of the most important selective pressures on birds (
  <a rid="b0400 b0025" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0400 b0025">Seegar et al., 1976; Arriero et al., 2008</a>). However, many factors (including environmental parameters that can influence vector abundance) related to this variation in prevalence are still poorly understood (
  <a rid="b0395" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0395">Scheuerlein and Ricklefs, 2004</a>). Although several studies have focused on describing the prevalence of avian parasitism in North American birds, most of the information available comes from controlled environments and/or with domestic bird species and most focus on describing prevalence alone and few examine differences in seasonality, geographic location, co-infections, or differences among free-ranging species (
  <a rid="b0195 b0030 b0125 b0205" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0195 b0030 b0125 b0205">Greiner et al., 1975; Atkinson and van Riper, 1991; Deviche et al., 2005; Ricklefs et al., 2005; Hamer et al., 2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With some exceptions, haematozoa infections are rarely associated with significant mortality of wild birds infected with native parasites, but some studies suggest that these infections can have measurable effects on host fitness which may translate to population-level effects (
  <a rid="b0375 b0320" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0375 b0320">Richner et al., 1995; Oppliger et al., 1996</a>). For example, most passerines are altricial (are born less developed, highly dependent on progenitors), thus, factors that decrease progenitor performance would affect their offspring. Seasonal fluctuations of hormones (some with immunosuppressive activity) during breeding periods may make birds even more vulnerable to pathogens, especially if co-infected and/or exposed to other stressors, such as environmental extremes (
  <a rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0025">Arriero et al., 2008</a>). Blood parasites have been associated with higher levels of stress hormones (
  <a rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0025">Arriero et al., 2008</a>), increased disease susceptibility, and reduced survival rates because of increased predation (
  <a rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0035">Atkinson et al., 2008</a>). In addition, parasitized avian hosts have been demonstrated to have lower fat scores and mean body mass (
  <a rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0175">Garvin et al., 2006</a>). Parasitism has also been demonstrated to impair immunological response, decrease nest success and clutch size, decrease survival of yearlings, increase feather asymmetry and decrease expression of secondary sexual characteristics (
  <a rid="b0245 b0180" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0245 b0180">Hõrak et al., 2001; Gilman et al., 2007</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study focused on five groups of haemoparasites including three genera of Haemosporidae (
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span>), larvae of filarioid nematodes (microfilaria), and 
  <span class="italic">Trypanosoma</span> (Order Trypanosomatida). Parasites in the Order Haemosporida are intracellular protozoans found within blood cells and tissues of birds and although disease is uncommon in natural hosts, infections of unnatural hosts and/or susceptible age classes may result in death even in absence of clinical signs (
  <a rid="b0035 b0130" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0035 b0130">Atkinson et al., 2008; Donovan et al., 2008</a>). 
  <span class="italic">Trypanosoma</span> spp. are extracellular haematozoa that are considered non-pathogenic, but can cause serious clinical signs in rare cases (
  <a rid="b0300" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0300">Mandal et al., 2008</a>). Filarioids are highly specialized nematode parasites of the tissues and interstitium of birds and other vertebrates and are often associated with non-specific clinical signs such as depression and weight loss (
  <a rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0040">Bartlett, 2008</a>). The clinical importance of filarial infection for wild birds seems to be associated with concomitant infections (
  <a rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0040">Bartlett, 2008</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the potential effects to individuals infected with haemosporidian parasites is anemia caused by different mechanisms, including parasite-synthesized factors and increased erythrolysis and phagocytosis (
  <a rid="b0275 b0270" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0275 b0270">Kocan and Clark, 1966; Kocan, 1968</a>). In addition, the packed cell volume (PCV) (i.e., hematocrit) has been used as a variable to evaluate overall avian condition, although most studies have been descriptive (
  <a rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0115">Dawson and Bortolotti, 1997</a>). Studies investigating the direct relationship between PCV and haemoparasitism are scant and results are often contradictory (
  <a rid="b0325 b0075 b0140" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0325 b0075 b0140">Ots and Hõrak, 1998; Booth and Elliott, 2003; Fair et al., 2007</a>). Signs of a regenerative anemia, such as increased numbers of polychromatophilic erythrocytes, are also widely used in veterinary medicine in an attempt to measure bone marrow responses to a decrease in the numbers of erythrocytes from haemolysis, increased uptake of erythrocytes by the reticuloendothelial system, or other causes. Thus, measuring polychromasia may be a sensitive way of detecting evidence of previous anemia (
  <a rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0085">Campbell, 2004a</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ecology and transmission dynamics of haemoparasites can vary widely between locations and avian species because these parasites utilize haematophagous vectors with specific biting and habitat preferences (
  <a rid="b0305" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0305">Martens et al., 1999</a>), although the vector for many haemoparasite species is unknown. For example, habitat changes (e.g., agriculture) have the potential of changing the range, density and diversity of blood parasite vectors (
  <a rid="b0005 b0285" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0005 b0285">Afrane et al., 2008; Lambin et al., 2010</a>), which would alter the risk of birds becoming infected (
  <a rid="b0370" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0370">Reiter and LaPointe, 2009</a>). Specific portions of the annual cycle of avian hosts, such as the breeding period, can be associated with immunological changes that may influence the probability of infection and development of clinical disease from haemoparasites. For example, infections with 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> spp. tend to decrease to chronic levels and remain dormant in the organs of hosts, leaving the blood circulation (
  <a rid="b0430" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0430">van Riper et al., 1994</a>), yet resume their haemoparasitic stage at the onset of the breeding season (
  <a rid="b0020 b0055" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0020 b0055">Applegate and Beaudoin, 1970; Beaudoin et al., 1971</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The interaction between various pathogens within a host has received considerable recent attention, as it may influence host morbidity,mortality and population dynamics. Multiple infections of haemoparasites or concurrent infections with other pathogens (e.g. 
  <span class="italic">Salmonella</span> spp.) may significantly change host and pathogen dynamics (
  <a rid="b0120 b0205" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0120 b0205">del Cerro et al., 2010; Hamer et al., 2013</a>). As part of a larger study to describe the spatial and temporal prevalence of infection of birds with 
  <span class="italic">Salmonella</span> spp., we examined the interaction of haemoparasite prevalence and diversity with bird species, capture site, season, and 
  <span class="italic">Salmonella</span> infection status. In order to better understand the sublethal effects of these parasites, we documented body mass index (BMI), and selected haematologic values (PCV and polychromasia). Specifically, we hypothesized that BMI and PCV would be lower in birds parasitized with a single or multiple parasite species and that polychromasia would be higher in infected birds.
