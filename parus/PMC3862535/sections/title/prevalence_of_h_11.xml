  <span class="italic">Salmonella</span> by species
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 786 birds of 53 species were sampled, including 381 birds of the five target species (
  <a rid="t0010 t0015" ref-type="table" href="#t0010 t0015">Tables 2 and 3</a>). All Carolina Wrens were negative for haemoparasites. Among the four target species infected with parasites, the prevalence of 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> was significantly higher in Northern Cardinals compared to Indigo Buntings (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.0011) and Tufted Titmice (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.0041) while prevalence in White-throated Sparrows was significantly higher than Indigo Buntings (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.024) (
  <a rid="t0010" ref-type="table" href="#t0010">Table 2</a>). For 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span>, significantly higher prevalences were noted in Tufted Titmice and Northern Cardinals compared to the other species (all 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.032). Among the three infected species, 
  <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span> prevalence was highest in White-throated Sparrows (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.0075 and 0.0508 respectively). Prevalence of 
  <span class="italic">Trypanosoma</span> was significantly higher in Tufted Titmice compared to the other three species (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.027, 0.0061, and 0.0076). No differences were noted in the prevalence of microfilaria.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">No differences in prevalence were noted for any parasite species between male and female or between after hatch year (adult) and HY Northern Cardinals. Also, no differences were noted in prevalence of any parasite genus between adult and HY for Indigo Buntings and Tufted Titmice. For White-throated Sparrows, no differences between age classes were noted for 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span>, but significantly more adults (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 67, 18%) were infected with 
  <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span> compared to HY (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 24, 0%).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although limited analyses were conducted on the non-target species because of limited sample sizes or distribution among capture sites, great variability was noted in prevalence of infection for the five haemoparasites (
  <a rid="t0015" ref-type="table" href="#t0015">Table 3</a>). Prevalences of 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> were generally higher and no single species of the non-target species was infected with all five groups of parasites.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Only five birds (one Northern Cardinal, one Brown-headed Cowbird (
  <span class="italic">Molothrus ater</span>), one European Starling (
  <span class="italic">Sturnus vulgaris</span>), one House Sparrow (
  <span class="italic">Passer domesticus</span>), and one Great-crested Flycatcher (
  <span class="italic">Myiarchus crinitus</span>) were positive for 
  <span class="italic">Salmonella</span> spp. Of these, only the Great-crested Flycatcher was positive for a haemoparasite (microfilaria). Because of the low prevalence, no additional comparisons were possible.
