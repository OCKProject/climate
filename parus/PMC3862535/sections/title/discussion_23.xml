 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The five groups of parasites found in this study are all common parasites of wild birds, including the five target species (
  <a rid="b0290 b0195 b0170 b0380 b0215 b0310 b0205" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0290 b0195 b0170 b0380 b0215 b0310 b0205">Love et al., 1953; Greiner et al., 1975; Garvin et al., 1993; Ricklefs and Fallon, 2002; Hartup et al., 2008; Martinsen et al., 2008; Hamer et al., 2013</a>). The prevalences for the target species, except Carolina Wrens, were within ranges reported from previous surveys based on analysis of blood smears. The lack of haemoparasites in Carolina Wrens was surprising because infections have been reported previously in this species (
  <a rid="b0380" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0380">Ricklefs and Fallon, 2002</a>) and infections other close members of the Troglodytidae in the southeast USA have been reported (
  <a rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0170">Garvin et al., 1993</a>). It is possible that infections were missed due to low parasitemias or because of the lower sample size for this species. Among the non-target species, the very low prevalence in House Sparrows was similar to a previous study that found this invasive species has a low prevalence in non-endemic regions (
  <a rid="b0315" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0315">Marzal et al., 2011</a>). Our data were similar for the invasive European Starlings, although samples size was small (5) and additional sampling would be needed to see if they have also have experienced “enemy release” from their native parasites.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The initial intent of this study was to examine the effects of these haemoparasites on the health of birds and the effects of various factors on parasitism, and also to determine if there were interactions between haemoparasite infections and shedding of 
  <span class="italic">Salmonella</span>. Salmonellosis can be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality for songbirds (
  <a rid="b0235" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0235">Hernandez et al., 2012</a>) and it is likely that there could be interactions between 
  <span class="italic">Salmonella</span> and other pathogens. Despite the low prevalence of 
  <span class="italic">Salmonella</span> infection detected in our sampled birds, we encourage future investigations to consider the impacts of co-infections on avian health as wildlife are rarely infected with any single agent.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because all of the haemoparasites in this study are vector-borne, the probability of infection for birds is strongly related to vector presence, diversity, and abundance. Vector-host relationships have not been fully described for all North American haemoparasite species, but it is known that particular vector species partition vertical strata, which would make some birds more susceptible to transmission than others (
  <a rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0160">Garvin and Greiner, 2003</a>). In fact, the correlation between nesting height and prevalence of haemoparasite infection tends to be higher than the relationship between infection prevalence and plumage brightness (
  <a rid="b0165 b0125" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0165 b0125">Garvin and Remsen, 1997; Deviche et al., 2005</a>). We found that birds in the low-middle stratum were more likely to be infected with 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> spp. and birds in the middle-upper strata were more likely to be infected with 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Trypanosoma</span>. In contrast, birds foraging on the ground were more likely to be infected with 
  <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span> spp. These findings contradict a recent study on the vertical distribution of ornithophilic bloodsucking Diptera (Culicidae, Simuliidae and Ceratopogonidae) conducted using bird-baited traps set at both ground and tree canopy levels (
  <a rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0100">Cerny et al., 2011</a>). 
  <span class="italic">Culex pipiens</span> (Diptera: Culicidae), a vector of 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span>, was found to prefer ground-level habitats, whereas biting midges [
  <span class="italic">Culicoides</span> spp. (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae); vector for 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span>] and 
  <span class="italic">Eusimulium angustipes</span> (Diptera: Simuliidae; vector for 
  <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span>) preferred the canopy (
  <a rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0100">Cerny et al., 2011</a>). Although 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> prevalence, specifically in the southeastern USA, has been reported at approximately 10%, a correlation with foraging stratum has not previously been found (
  <a rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0195">Greiner et al., 1975</a>; 
  <a rid="b0390" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0390">Rohner et al., 2000</a>). However, the positive relationship between 
  <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span> spp. infection and ground foragers or nesters has been established and is related to black-fly (Simuliidae) activity (
  <a rid="b0145 b0390" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0145 b0390">Fallis and Bennett, 1966; Rohner et al., 2000</a>). However, this effect appears to vary by host species as ducks had a much higher prevalence of infection when nesting near the ground and the opposite was true for turkeys (
  <a rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0145">Fallis and Bennett, 1966</a>; 
  <a rid="b0455" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0455">Ricklefs, 2000</a>; 
  <a rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0155">Forrester and Spalding, 2003</a>). Interestingly, Great Horned Owls (
  <span class="italic">Bubo virginianus</span>) shift their roosting preferences from mid-canopy in winter to ground level in summer in what appears to be timed with the spring emergence of black flies which are most active in the mid-canopy (
  <a rid="b0390" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0390">Rohner et al., 2000</a>). In addition, some studies have failed to find any relationship betwen infection and foraging or nesting height (
  <a rid="b0450" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0450">Ricklefs et al., 2005</a>). The differences noted between the different studies could be explained by variation in haemoparasite haplotypes, most of which have unknown vectors. Co-infection with multiple haplotypes or sequential infections with different haplotypes are common in passerines (
  <a rid="b0450" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0450">Ricklefs et al., 2005</a>). Each of these haplotypes likely has a unique natural history with different vectors with variable host and habitat preferences. To address these discrepancies, a comprehensive study on haplotypes present in birds and vectors at different strata is needed.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to our results, breeding season was correlated with a higher prevalence of infection with 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> spp., 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> spp. and 
  <span class="italic">Trypanosoma</span> spp. This is likely explained by either differences in vector abundance during the breeding season due to warmer temperatures or “spring relapse” of parasitemias due to hormonal changes or trade-offs between reproduction and parasite susceptibility (
  <a rid="b0010 b0415" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0010 b0415">Allander, 1997; Stjernman et al., 2004</a>). Importantly, seasonal variation can vary significantly between different species or haplotypes (e.g., 
  <span class="italic">P. relictum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. circumflexum</span> in Blue Tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus caeruleus</span>)) (
  <a rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0105">Cosgrove et al., 2008</a>). Similar to previous studies, we found no differences in the prevalence of most haemoparasites by migratory status, except for 
  <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span> in White-throated Sparrows, which migrate north to breed where black flies are in high abundance (
  <a rid="b0170 b0395" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0170 b0395">Garvin et al., 1993; Scheuerlein and Ricklefs, 2004</a>). This finding was also supported by the absence of infection from HY White-throated Sparrows, suggesting that this species is infected on the breeding grounds. In contrast, we found no differences in 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> prevalence between HY and adult birds indicating that transmission of these genera occurred at the breeding sites. We did find that more birds in northern Georgia were infected with 
  <span class="italic">Trypanosoma</span>, but the reason for this difference is unknown. Generally, we would not expect significant differences in vector diversity or abundance related to climate between the two sites tested; however, the sites did differ in basic habitat type (one primarily agricultural, one riparian forest), which may alter vector presence. More likely, the majority of 
  <span class="italic">Trypanosoma</span> infections were detected in Tufted Titmouse, and ∼82% of our samples from this species came from the northern sites in Georgia, likely influenced these results.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Causes and effects of the variation in the PCV of birds are difficult to explain but some researchers consider it a good measure of body condition and/or fitness (
  <a rid="b0080 b0255 b0345" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0080 b0255 b0345">Brown, 1996; Hurtrez-Boussès et al., 1997; Potti et al., 1999</a>), while others imply that the relationship does not exist, and that higher PCV levels may actually fluctuate with metabolism, workload or genetics (
  <a rid="b0115 b0110 b0340" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0115 b0110 b0340">Dawson and Bortolotti, 1997; Cuervo et al., 2007; Potti, 2007</a>). Significantly higher average PCV values were detected for Indigo Buntings compared to other species. This species is a long-distance migrant, flying over 1000 miles to its breeding grounds (
  <a rid="b0405" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0405">Sibley, 2003</a>). In some migratory species, PCVs can increase up to 60%, especially at the time of arrival to breeding grounds and post-nuptial molt (
  <a rid="b0435" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0435">William, 2012</a>). Thus, having a higher concentration of circulating erythrocytes may be a physiological adaptation to fulfill this demand (
  <a rid="b0340" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0340">Potti, 2007</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The PCV of birds is known to be sensitive to environmental influences (
  <a rid="b0410" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0410">Simon et al., 2005</a>), which may vary with ambient temperature, presumably due to differences in demand of thermogenesis depending on the season (
  <a rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0095">Carey and Morton, 1976</a>). However, our results suggested that there was no difference between season and PCV. Reproduction is directly related to several endocrinological changes in birds. In terms of erythropoiesis, thyroid hormones enhance erythrocyte production and oxygen uptake, as triggered by exposure to light, affecting regulation of gonadal response to photoperiods (
  <a rid="b0440" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0440">Yoshimura et al., 2003</a>). Additionally, sex steroids are known to exert effects on erythropoiesis (
  <a rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0185">Gordon et al., 1970</a>), which may increase the release of immature erythrocytes to the peripheral circulation, perhaps explaining why polychromasia levels were higher during breeding season.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In wild birds, PCV is also known to fluctuate with gender, time of day, age, hydration and nutritional status and as a response to various environmental factors (
  <a rid="b0240 b0360 b0220 b0350 b0050 b0365" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0240 b0360 b0220 b0350 b0050 b0365">Hodges, 1977; Rehder and Bird, 1983; Hawkey et al., 1984; Puerta et al., 1989; Bearhop et al., 1999; Reissig et al., 2002</a>). Several studies have determined a positive correlation between PCV and age, but our results were not consistent with those findings (
  <a rid="b0330" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0330">Palomeque et al., 1991</a>). We could not find an explanation for why polychromasia levels would be higher in adults because, where this has been examined in other taxa (i.e., reptiles), the opposite is true (
  <a rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0090">Campbell, 2004b</a>). Equally, although we found no relationship between PCV and gender, polychromasia was higher in males, which may be explained by the effect of testosterone on the differentiation of stem cells into erythroid cells, which is documented in many vertebrate species.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Birds in this study had higher BMI during the breeding season, which is considered normal at the beginning of the breeding season, although fluctuations often occur during care of young (
  <a rid="b0015 b0445" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0015 b0445">Alonso-Alvarez et al., 2002; Zillich and Black 2002</a>). However, we did not find a significant correlation between BMIs and PCV. This agrees with other studies that have failed to detect a similar relationship (e.g. 
  <a rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0115">Dawson and Bortolotti, 1997</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found few effects of parasitism on the health markers measured in this study. Our results did suggest that songbirds infected with microfilariae species are in poorer body condition. Although most filarial nematodes are not typically pathogenic for wild birds, some species can be lethal, causing chronic inflammation of pulmonary arteries, which may lead to impaired tissue oxygenation and decreased general metabolism (
  <a rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0040">Bartlett, 2008</a>). Interestingly, our data also showed that birds infected with 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> spp. had a higher average BMI than uninfected birds, but no differences were noted for other parasites. These findings are similar to previous studies conducted in European passerines, (
  <a rid="b0395" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0395">Scheuerlein and Ricklefs, 2004</a>) but are in contrast to others that found no differences (
  <a rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0065">Bennett et al., 1988</a>). In general, PCV is considered the most reliable measure of red blood cell numbers (
  <a rid="b0240 b0085" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0240 b0085">Hodges, 1977; Campbell, 2004a</a>) and values between 35% and 55% are considered normal for birds, whereas a PCV below 35% indicates anemia (
  <a rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0085">Campbell, 2004a</a>). Only one bird in this study, a Brown Thrasher (
  <span class="italic">Toxostoma rufum</span>), infected with 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> spp. was anemic (PCV = 32%). Two additional birds were anemic (PCV = 34%) but neither was infected (Brown Thrasher and Northern Mockingbird (
  <span class="italic">Mimus polyglottos</span>). Equally, polychromasia levels did not help in identifying health effects of infected birds. In future studies, other haematological parameters, such as haemoglobin levels and mean corpuscular volume might prove to be more sensitive (
  <a rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0050">Bearhop et al., 1999</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although we only genetically characterized parasites from our four infected focal species, numerous novel 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> haplotypes and seven previously identified haplotyes were detected. Among these seven, only one had been previously reported from one of our host species (SEIARU01 (
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span>) from Northern Cardinals). In our study, this particular haplotype was only found in Northern Cardinals but based on data from the MalAvi database, it has been reported from numerous bird species from North America including 13 species of Passeriformes and 3 species of Strigiformes and has been associated with mortality of a captive Green Jay (
  <span class="italic">Cyanocorax yncas glaucescens</span>) in Texas (
  <a rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0150">Ferrell et al., 2007</a>). The other six previously reported haplotypes were new host records for five 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> haplotypes and one 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> haplotype. All but two (WW7 and CATUST05) of the 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> haplotypes have been reported from numerous host species (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 4–15) from North and South America, Europe, and Asia. The previously reported 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> haplotype (SIAMEX01) has been reported from the United States in eight species of native Passeriformes and was associated with mortality in a captive exotic Montezuma Oropendola (
  <span class="italic">Psarocolius montezuma</span>) and a lesser flamingo (
  <span class="italic">Phoeniconaias minor</span>) from a zoo in Texas (
  <a rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0150">Ferrell et al., 2007</a>). Interestingly, this haplotype had not previously been reported east of Missouri and Texas, thus, our report expands the host and geographic range of this potentially pathogenic 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> haplotype. Although the novel haplotypes detected in this study were only detected in a single species, additional studies are needed to determine the host specificity of these haplotypes because our sample size was limited and most haplotypes were infrequent; however, 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> haplotype ZONALB01/GA/2011 was common and only detected in White-throated Sparrows. Host specificity of avian haemosporidians has been shown in several other large-scale studies (
  <a rid="b0045 b0230" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0045 b0230">Beadell et al., 2009; Hellgren et al., 2009</a>). However, these studies and others have also shown several haplotypes are not host specific and can infect a broad host range (
  <a rid="b0380 b0060" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0380 b0060">Ricklefs and Fallon, 2002; Belo et al., 2011</a>). Interestingly, the White-throated sparrow, a migratory species, had the highest diversity of haplotypes; however, this species only migrates within North America, similar to the Indigo Bunting, which had a lower diversity of haplotypes. Because no differences were noted in haplotype diversity between our study sites, nor among bird species with different migratory behaviors or foraging heights, additional studies are needed that incorporate molecular analysis, host biology, and vector biology into comprehensive models of parasite ecology. Finally, careful and detailed morphological examination of these parasites is necessary to determine if closely related haplotypes in this study (e.g., A, B, C or N and O) represent single species or morphologically distinct, but closely related, haplotypes.
