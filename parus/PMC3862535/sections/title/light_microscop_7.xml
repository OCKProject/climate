 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Blood smears were air-dried, fixed with 100% methanol, and stained using a modified Romanowsky staining technique (Diff Quick®, Jorgensen Laboratories, 1450 Van Buren Ave., Loveland, CO 80538, USA). The entire slide was scanned for microfilaria at 100×, and the monocellular layer was examined at 400× and 1000× (with oil immersion) for 10 min for haemoparasites, which were identified to genus based on morphology (
