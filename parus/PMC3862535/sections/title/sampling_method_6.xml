 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sampling took place in two biologically-relevant seasons for birds: breeding (April–June) and non-breeding (September–March) in 2010 and 2011. Birds were captured using 12 and 18 m long, 38 mm mesh nylon mist nets, extended to a maximum height of 3 m from the ground. To control for body condition-biases in sampling (
  <a rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0190">Gorney et al., 1999</a>), we did not use food as lure for bird captures. Different numbers of mist nets were set, depending on the number of locations identified at a site with high bird activity, site capacity, and capture opportunity. Nets were checked every 15–20 min. All birds were identified to species, and banded with a butt-end metal Federal band. Each bird captured was physically examined and the following information was recorded: date of capture, gender (if possible), stage-based age (hatch year (HY) or adult), and standard morphometric measurements (body weight, wing cord, culmen, tarsus-metatarsus, tail length) (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Blood was obtained with syringes with 27- or 29-gauge needles (BD insulin syringes; Becton Dickinson, 1 Becton Drive, Franklin Lakes, NJ 07417, USA) from the right jugular vein in songbirds, except for Columbiformes, from which blood was collected from the brachial vein. The volume of blood collected was never &gt;1% of the total body weight. Two thin blood smears were immediately made from each sample and a portion of whole blood in heparin was used to calculate a PCV value by centrifuging a heparizined microhematocrit tube (StatSpin Microhematocrit tubes; StatSpin Technologies Inc., 60 Glacier Drive, Westwood, MA 02090, USA) at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. Remaining whole blood was frozen at −80 °C for future studies. Fecal samples were collected from disposable paper bags used to individually hold birds until they could be processed. For isolation of 
  <span class="italic">Salmonella</span>, approximately 1 g of feces was enriched by inoculation into Dulcitol Selenite media (pre-prepared in house) and incubated at 41.5 °C for 18 h. Enrichment broths were streaked on 
  <span class="italic">Salmonella</span> differential media XLT4, BGN and MacConkey agars (Remel, Lenexa, KS 66215, USA) followed by 37 °C incubation overnight. Colonies with appropriate colony morphology for the selective plate were isolated and further characterized with biochemical tests. A delayed-secondary enrichment was carried out for all samples that cultured negative after the first primary enrichment.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All birds were immediately released at the site of capture following sampling. The capturing, processing and handling procedures were review and approved by the University of Georgia IACUC committee (#A2010 08-159).</p>
