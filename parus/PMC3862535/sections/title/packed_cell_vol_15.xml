 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Average PCV levels were similar between infected and non-infected birds of the same species for 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.4115; non-infected birds 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 184, mean PCV = 47%; infected birds 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 68, mean PCV = 46.4%),

  <span class="italic">n</span> = 226, mean PCV = 46.9%; infected birds 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 26, mean PCV = 46.7%), 
  <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span> (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.9610; non-infected birds 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 239, mean PCV = 46.9%; infected birds

  <span class="italic">n</span> = 9, mean PCV = 48.6%).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interestingly, there were different average PCV values for the target species (
  <span class="italic">F</span> = 22.13, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0001) (
  <a rid="f0010" ref-type="fig" href="#f0010">Fig. 2</a>). Significantly higher average PCV values were detected for Indigo Buntings (52.4 ± 5.5) compared to other species, while Tufted Titmice (48.3 ± 3.4) had significantly higher average PCV than White-throated Sparrows (44.8 ± 4.2) and Carolina Wrens (42.2 ± 3.4), and Northern Cardinals (46.3 ± 5.6) had significantly higher average PCV than Carolina Wrens.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An analysis of age showed that the mean value of PCV was significantly higher in HY birds (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 61) compared to adult birds (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 185) (
  <span class="italic">F</span> = 25.54, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = &lt;0.0001); however, average PCV levels did not differ significantly between male (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 59, mean 47.4 ± 6.24), female (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 48, mean 46.4 ± 6.16), and unknown gender (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 139, mean 46.9 ± 5.3; 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.6374). There was a negative correlation (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = −0.17) between PCV and BMI: as PCV decreased, BMI increased (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.0068).
