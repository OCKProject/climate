 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Association of polychromasia with haemoparasite infections, bird species, age, gender, BMI, and PCV</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">No significant differences in the average levels of polychromasia were found between birds infected and non-infected with 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.1731), 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.3798), 
  <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span> (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.1923), microfilaria (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.5394) or 
  <span class="italic">Trypanosoma</span> (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.0676). Interestingly, Northern Cardinals (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 68, mean 4 ± 2.3) had a significantly higher average polychromasia level compared to White-throated Sparrows (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 59, mean 2.9 ± 1.1) (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.0043), yet no other species differences were noted for these levels.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Polychromasia levels were significantly higher in adult birds (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 140, mean 3.59) compared to HY birds (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 42, mean 3) (
  <span class="italic">F</span> = 4.19, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.0084). While there was no difference in polychromasia levels between males (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 44, mean 4 ± 2.2) and females (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 32, mean 3.7 ± 2.2), they were higher than the unknown gender group (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 105, mean 3.1 ± 1.1) (
  <span class="italic">F</span> = 4.64, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.0108). Interestingly, although there was a negative correlation between PCV and BMI, we found a positive correlation (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.15) between polychromasia and BMI (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.04) with polychromasia levels increasing at higher BMI levels.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There was no correlation between the PCV and polychromasia in any bird species (all 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &gt; 0.05).
