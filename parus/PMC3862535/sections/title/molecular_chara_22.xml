  <span class="italic">b</span> gene was amplified from 87 of 113 (77%) samples screened by PCR. A total of 19 unique haplotypes of 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> (
  <span class="italic">n</span> 
  <span class="italic">= </span>7) and 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> (
  <span class="italic">n</span>

  <a rid="t0040" ref-type="table" href="#t0040">Table 8</a>). Two of the haplotypes (
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> SAIMEX01 and 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> PADOM11) were detected in more than one species of birds (
  <a rid="f0015" ref-type="fig" href="#f0015">Fig. 3</a>, 
  <a rid="t0040" ref-type="table" href="#t0040">Table 8</a>); however, several of the previously detected haplotypes have been found in other bird species. Interestingly, based on a minimum spanning tree, several of the 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> haplotypes detected in White-throated Sparrows were closely related (
  <a rid="f0015" ref-type="fig" href="#f0015">Fig. 3</a>). There were no differences in the number of unique haplotypes detected regardless of site location, migratory status, or foraging guild (
  <a rid="t0040" ref-type="table" href="#t0040">Table 8</a>). An additional 18 sequences were obtained from other birds but were not included in the haplotype analysis because they either had ambiguous bases (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 11), only sequenced in one direction (
  <span class="italic">n</span> 
  <span class="italic">=</span> 3), or sequenced in one direction but were identified as 
  <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span> (
  <span class="italic">n</span> 
  <span class="italic">=</span> 4). Interestingly, one Northern Cardinal had two distinct 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> haplotypes (PADOM11 and SEIARU01) that were obtained from two independent PCR runs (one conducted with an annealing temperature of 55 °C and another at 50 °C), the chromatograms from these two PCR runs were bi-directional and did not contain any ambiguous bases.
