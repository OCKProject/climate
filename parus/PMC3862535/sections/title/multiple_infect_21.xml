 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Multiple infections were noted in three of the four target species that were infected with haemoparasites (
  <a rid="t0035" ref-type="table" href="#t0035">Table 7</a>). In Northern Cardinals, the most common combination was 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span>, which was also common in White-throated Sparrows (tied with 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span> co-infections). Co-infection with 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Trypanosoma</span> was most common in Tufted Titmice. Only a single bird (Northern Cardinal) was infected with three groups of parasites and a single White-throated Sparrow was infected with all five groups of parasites (
  <a rid="t0035" ref-type="table" href="#t0035">Table 7</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Only single infections were noted in the Indigo Bunting (
  <a rid="t0035" ref-type="table" href="#t0035">Table 7</a>) which results in odds of this species having a multiple infections being lower than Northern Cardinals (0.364 times, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.0391) and White-throated Sparrows (0.248 times, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.0023), but not for Tufted Titmice (0.33 times, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.0562).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also established a comparison of breeding and non-breeding season with respect to the probability of higher levels of infection. The odds of a bird having a higher level of infection during the breeding season are 3.516 times those of being infected in non-breeding season (
  <span class="italic">z</span> = 5.16, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0001).
