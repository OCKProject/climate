 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Blood sampling was performed at six sites in two watersheds in Georgia, USA. Three sites were in Tift County in the Little River watershed, which drains Tifton, Georgia and from which

This area is considered a key agricultural region, with nearly 40% in crops, 45% forested, and &lt;15% pastures, urban areas and water. Topographically, it follows the characteristics of the coastal plain (heavy vegetation, flood plains, and stream channels). The altitude in this watershed varied from 700 to ∼5300 ft. Sampling stations were selected to include 1st to 4th order streams with assorted levels of flow during the course of the year. Three additional sites were located in the Oconee River watershed, which has an average altitude of 1000 ft, and is surrounded by a rural landscape, composed primarily of poultry, dairy and beef farming. Sampling stations were located along the North Oconee River and its tributaries (including Sandy Creek) in Madison, Jackson and Clarke Counties (
