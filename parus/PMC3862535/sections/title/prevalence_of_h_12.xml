 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prevalence of haemoparasites by foraging guild</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interesting differences in probability of haemoparasite infections were noted between different foraging guilds (
  <a rid="t0020" ref-type="table" href="#t0020">Table 4</a>). Bird species foraging in the low-middle vertical stratum were more likely to be infected by 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> spp. compared to those in the middle-upper vertical stratum (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.0301). In contrast, bird species foraging in the middle-upper vertical stratum were more likely to be infected with 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> spp. compared to those that forage at ground level (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.0058). 
  <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span> infections were more likely in bird species foraging in the ground vertical stratum compared to other vertical stratum levels (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.0062) and 
  <span class="italic">Trypanosoma</span> infections were higher in bird species utilizing middle-upper vertical stratum compared to other strata (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.0015). No differences were noted for microfilaria prevalence and foraging guilds (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.0822).
