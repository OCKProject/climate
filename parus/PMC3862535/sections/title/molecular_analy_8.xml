 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A subset (
  <span class="italic">n</span> 
  <span class="italic">= </span>113) of samples positive for haemotozoan parasites on blood smear was tested using a nested PCR that targets the cytochrome 
  <span class="italic">b</span> (cyt 
  <span class="italic">b</span>) gene. DNA was extracted from whole blood using DNeasy kit (Qiagen, Germantown, Maryland, USA) and amplification of partial cyt 
  <span class="italic">b</span> gene was conducted using primers HaemNFI and HaemNR3 and HaemF and HaemR2 (
  <a rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0225">Hellgren et al., 2004</a>). Initially the PCR was conducted using a 55 °C annealing temperature; however, due to poor amplification of known positive samples, the annealing temperature was decreased to 50 °C. Amplicons were then sequenced bi-directionally at the University of Georgia Genomics Facility (Athens, Georgia, USA). Sequence chromatograms were analyzed in Sequencher v5.1 (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and cleaned sequences were then aligned using MEGA v5.1 (
  <a rid="b0420" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0420">Tamura et al., 2007</a>) using the clustalW algorithm. Samples were characterized to genera using BLAST and a Neighbor Joining phylogenetic analysis. A minimum spanning tree was then calculated based on differences among haplotypes using Arlequin v3.11 (
  <a rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0135">Excoffier et al., 2005</a>). Only sequences that contained the full 479 bp between the HaemF and HaemR2 primers and did not contain any ambiguous bases where used for haplotype analysis. Comparison of number of haplotypes by site location (north vs. south), migratory status (resident vs. migratory), and foraging guild was done using Fisher’s exact test using R v2.15.
