  <p>Minimum spanning network for 
   <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b haplotypes detected in four species of passerines from Georgia (USA). Circles are drawn proportional to the frequency at which haplotypes were observed. Color represents the host species from which haplotypes originated: red for Northern Cardinal (
   <span class="italic">Cardinalis cardinalis</span>), blue for Indigo Bunting (
   <span class="italic">Passerina cyanea</span>), yellow for White-throated Sparrow (
   <span class="italic">Zonotrichia albicollis</span>), and grey for Tufted Titmouse (
   <span class="italic">Baeolophus bicolor</span>). A single mutation separates nodes unless explicitly indicated by number. Letters within each node refer to 
   <a rid="t0040" ref-type="table" href="#t0040">Table 8</a> which indicates the haplotype name, sampling location, and other factors associated with hosts.
