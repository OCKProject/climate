 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Disrupted seasonality and infectious disease dynamics</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One important area for future research is the effect of disrupted seasonality on the dynamics of infectious disease. A recent review has highlighted the unprecedented rate at which vector-borne diseases have changed over the past decade, and has alerted a wide audience to the impact of changes in the climate [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C64" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C64">64</a>]. The review details consequences of modified environmental seasonality, for example release from severe winters at higher latitudes and extended phases of seasonal activity. Environmental seasonal drivers of disease incidence include climate-sensitive pathogen dissemination and survival; seasonal variation in host recruitment, contact rates and susceptibility, and seasonal changes in vector abundance [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C65" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C65">65</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C66" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C66">66</a>]. Directly transmitted and epidemic-prone diseases such as influenza, measles, polio, rotavirus and cholera exhibit pronounced seasonality and substantial heterogeneity in time and space [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C65" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C65">65</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C66" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C66">66</a>]. The dominant seasonal drivers vary not only by disease, but also by geography. The best understood examples of climate-driven infections are influenza and cholera. Influenza is best transmitted when temperature and humidity are low, yielding winter epidemics in temperate regions [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C67" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C67">67</a>], whereas cholera outbreaks are intensified by local increases in temperature during El Niño events [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C68" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C68">68</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Vector-borne pathogens—including those responsible for malaria, dengue, Lyme disease, Chagas, West Nile and sleeping sickness—present some of the most notable examples of seasonally driven infection [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C65" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C65">65</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C66" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C66">66</a>]. Vector-borne diseases are particularly sensitive to phenological change, because numerous aspects of vector behaviour, demography and population dynamics are crucially dependent on environmental conditions [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C69" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C69">69</a>]. For example, the growth rate of malaria vector populations in Africa explodes during the rainy seasons owing to the expansion of vector-larval habitat [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C70" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C70">70</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C71" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C71">71</a>]. Temperature also has a strong impact on larval development rate, survival and the duration of the gonotrophic cycle in a wide range of Diptera [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C72" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C72">72</a>–
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C75" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C75">75</a>]. Further complexity is introduced by seasonality in host populations. Examples include seasonal variation in the immune responsiveness and nutritional quality of plant hosts to their vectors [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C72" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C72">72</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C75" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C75">75</a>]; herd immunity in cattle to tick-borne 
  <span class="italic">Babesia</span> [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C76" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C76">76</a>] and demonstration that the timing of peak human exposure to West Nile virus in North America is driven by seasonal patterns of avian migration [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C77" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C77">77</a>]. The complexity of the seasonal interactions between vectors, pathogens and hosts is probably responsible for the lack of consistent evidence on how climate change will influence vector-borne disease [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C64" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C64">64</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C71" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C71">71</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C74" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C74">74</a>]. While there is compelling evidence that some vector-borne diseases are being enhanced by climate change (e.g
  <span class="italic">.</span> Lyme disease; [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C78" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C78">78</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C79" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C79">79</a>]; avian malaria; [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C80" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C80">80</a>]), there are several other examples of diseases that have failed to expand as originally predicted (e.g. malaria; [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C69" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C69">69</a>]). The least understood seasonal drivers of infection are those potentially governed by rhythms of host susceptibility and susceptible recruitment [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C47" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C47">47</a>], although recent data suggest that annual cycles in human immune pathways may indeed affect susceptibility to specific diseases [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C3" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C3">3</a>]. In summary, there is a need for a detailed understanding of how climate will affect all aspects of the pathogen life cycle before the consequences for transmission can be predicted.
