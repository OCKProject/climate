 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In many tropical and equatorial areas, including the savannah–woodlands where humans are thought to have originated, seasonality is highly pronounced although there is little variation in day length. Indeed, striking seasonal patterns in behaviour are observed in the migration and breeding rhythms of many equatorial species, such as the flowering of trees [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C49" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C49">49</a>] and the reproductive seasonality of some primates and traditional human societies [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C50" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C50">50</a>]. Although at a 
  <span class="italic">population</span> level many species appear to breed asynchronously with respect to the calendar year, 
  <span class="italic">individuals</span> tend to be seasonally cyclical [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C51" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C51">51</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C52" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C52">52</a>] when studied over a full life history. Environmental stimuli that provide seasonal cues in the tropics are often related to local non-photic cues, such as rainfall patterns that in turn determine food abundance (electronic supplementary material, figure S1
  <span class="italic">c</span>). In the Pleistocene, humans radiated out of the tropics to higher latitudes where they encountered novel seasonal environments, in particular marked annual rhythms in day length and ambient temperature (electronic supplementary material, figure S1
  <span class="italic">a</span>–
  <span class="italic">c</span>). However, because the underlying internal mechanisms that govern annual rhythms preceded the hominin lineage, humans probably possess much of the ancient molecular and cellular machinery characteristics of other seasonal species, potentially including genetic variation in seasonality [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C53" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C53">53</a>]. Even today, human reproduction is not evenly spread across the year ([
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C33" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C33">33</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C54" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C54">54</a>]; electronic supplementary material, figure S4
  <span class="italic">a</span>–
  <span class="italic">c</span>). For example, a recent analysis indicated that human birth pulses across the USA fluctuate seasonally with an amplitude of about 10% ([
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C33" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C33">33</a>]; electronic supplementary material, figure S4). Despite the decline in birth seasonality (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20151453F1" href="#RSPB20151453F1">figure 1</a>
  <span class="italic">d</span>; cf. [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C15" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C15">15</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C17" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C17">17</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C32">32</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C33" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C33">33</a>]), it is still substantial for a species that effectively lives under conditions of eternal summer in its immediate habitat. Notably, the amplitude of these rhythms and the timing of their maxima vary with latitude, which strongly suggests an underlying physiological regulatory mechanism. These patterns of birth pulses have longer-term relevance because of the strong evidence [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C55" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C55">55</a>] that birth month has lifelong impacts on health, including the likelihood of general, psychiatric or neurological illnesses ([
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C17" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C17">17</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C54" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C54">54</a>]; electronic supplementary material, table S1). That these time-of-birth effects may reflect day-length-dependent mechanisms is signified by the observation that some diagnoses, e.g. schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis, show an inverse pattern in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres (electronic supplementary material, table S1).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seasonal human morbidity is observed in non-infectious diseases, including heart disease [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C56" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C56">56</a>], cerebrovascular disease [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C57" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C57">57</a>] and lung cancer [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C58" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C58">58</a>]. Behaviour-driven mortality is also seasonal; cycles in the monthly numbers of suicides are one of the oldest and most replicated findings, with most, but not all, studies finding a peak in late spring/early summer (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20151453F2" href="#RSPB20151453F2">figure 2</a>
  <span class="italic">a</span>). Interestingly, aggression and other violent acts such as homicide have a marked seasonal pattern of occurrence nearly coincident with that found for suicide (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20151453F2" href="#RSPB20151453F2">figure 2</a>
  <span class="italic">b</span>). Seasonal patterns in aggression are not limited to the individual level. Historical records indicate a strong rhythm in population-level forms of aggression measured in onset of battles ([
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C59" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C59">59</a>]; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20151453F2" href="#RSPB20151453F2">figure 2</a>
  <span class="italic">c,d</span>). Whether rhythms represent simple direct responses to seasonal environmental changes and/or the manifestation of endogenous seasonal timing mechanisms, these findings indicate that seasonality continues to be an important factor in human lives.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Humans also show seasonal changes in immunity and in the occurrence of infectious diseases [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C47" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C47">47</a>]. Changes in immunity include seasonal variation in cytokine production [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C60" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C60">60</a>], bacterial killing activity [

  <a rid="RSPB20151453C62" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C62">62</a>]. The most comprehensive characterization so far of annual cycles in human immunity comes from a recent study by Dopico 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C3" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C3">3</a>]. This study presented extensive data from geographically and ethnically diverse human populations, including mRNA expression in white blood cells and adipose tissue, inflammatory markers and blood count data. It reports seasonal differences in the expression of up to 23% of genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Furthermore, the seasonal patterns of gene expression were inverse in Australia relative to the USA and the UK. The reverse pattern in Australia supports the idea that in humans, as well as in other animals, some immune responses may be modulated by day length [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C63" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C63">63</a>]. Seasonal infections thus probably mirror internal rhythms of immunity as well as patterns of exposure. The relative importance of these mechanisms as drivers of any human infection remains to be established.
