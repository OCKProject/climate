 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ecological studies have identified potential problems associated with disruption of seasonality, owing to the desynchronization of key seasonal interactions among wild species (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20151453F1" href="#RSPB20151453F1">figure 1</a>
  <span class="italic">b</span>). However, our existing understanding of the ecological implications of disrupted seasonality is mostly based upon studies of impacts upon single predator–prey relationships (such as the mismatch that can develop between the timing of seasonal coat colours and the annual duration of snow cover [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C81" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C81">81</a>] and more recently also on plant–pollinator interactions [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C82" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C82">82</a>–
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C86" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C86">86</a>]). Importantly, reproductive success in many species increases when reproductive timing and peak food availability are matched. Examples include egg hatching date in piscivorous seabirds, such as the Atlantic puffin (
  <span class="italic">Fratercula arctica</span>) [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C87" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C87">87</a>], and in winter moths (
  <span class="italic">Operophtera brumata</span>) relative to tree budburst [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C88" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C88">88</a>]; or calving date relative to vegetation growth in caribou (
  <span class="italic">Rangifer tarandus</span>) [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C89" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C89">89</a>] or roe deer (
  <span class="italic">Capreolus capreolus</span>; [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C90" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C90">90</a>]). An example that has been developed in some detail is the reducing match between the timing of breeding of forest songbirds, such as great tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) and blue tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus caeruleus</span>), and the time that their prey, caterpillars feeding on oak leaves, are most abundant ([
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C19" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C19">19</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C91" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C91">91</a>–
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C93" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C93">93</a>]; electronic supplementary material, figure S5). Great tits that are most mismatched with the food peak have the fewest surviving offspring [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C94" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C94">94</a>–
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C96" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C96">96</a>]. These ecological studies provide clear examples of how disrupted seasonality can affect the fitness of individuals living in an environment in which internal and external rhythms no longer match. The studies give numerous insights into how disrupted seasonality might also affect human and agricultural health.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Disrupted seasonality in natural systems can also be expected to affect ecosystem health. However, the effects at the ecosystem scale are more poorly understood than those at the individual level, because most studies have adopted the paradigm of the food chain (e.g. a single consumer population and a single resource species). While this has rendered the problem more tractable, patterns of species interaction in nature are in fact complex networks. Therefore, a major challenge is to move beyond relatively simple, mostly pairwise ecological interactions to consider the consequences of disrupted seasonality on population and community dynamics within broader, multispecies, interaction networks that include humans.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the limitations of studies on dyadic interactions, there are already some clues that disrupted seasonality may affect ecosystem health. Under global change, the flowering phenology of plants and the seasonal activity phase of pollinators may shift to a different extent or even in opposing directions (electronic supplementary material, figure S2), thereby potentially leading to temporal mismatches and the disruption of existing interactions [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C97" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C97">97</a>–
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C99" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C99">99</a>]. However, recent studies based on long-term phenology data indicate that bee emergence keeps pace with advanced plant-flowering, at least under current climatic conditions and for generalist plant–pollinator interactions [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C100" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C100">100</a>]. Importantly, species-rich pollinator communities may also be able to buffer negative consequences of global warming [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C101" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C101">101</a>], because plant pollinator networks exhibit plasticity with lost interactions being capable of replacement by new ones [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C102" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C102">102</a>]. This underpins the importance of sustaining biodiversity for mitigating the impact of global climate change. Clearly, while there is ample scope for disrupted seasonality to strongly affect ecosystems, the few existing examples suggest that at present the sum impacts appear relatively small. In vertebrates, genetic variation in seasonality in wild populations of mammals and birds may not be sufficient to track changes in climate [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C103" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C103">103</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C104" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C104">104</a>]. It remains to be seen if our collective perspective will hold once long-term research has been conducted as global climate change continues.
