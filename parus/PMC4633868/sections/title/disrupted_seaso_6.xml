 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ecological, physiological and epidemiological considerations suggest that seasonal disruption could also lead to substantial problems in agricultural industries, impacting both crop production and livestock viability, and hence, food security. The two most prevalent drivers of altered crop yields are changes in pollination and pest infestation. Notably, 70% of major crops and 35% of global crop production volume [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C82" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C82">82</a>], with an estimated global economic value of $189 billion (€153 billion) per year [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C105" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C105">105</a>], depend on seasonal pollination by bees and other insects. The spread of pest insects is a significant threat to human food security. For example, aphid outbreaks are expected to intensify owing to extended growing seasons (

  <span class="italic">c</span>) permitted by altered seasonal environmental conditions (reviewed by Bale &amp; Hayward [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C106" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C106">106</a>]). The peach–potato aphid and the grain aphid are examples of vectors of devastating plant virus diseases. In the past 20 years, increased occurrences of mild winters have resulted in earlier spring migrations of the winged form of these aphids into crops during their most vulnerable stages, resulting in epidemic outbreaks. The complex interactions between crops, pests and pathogens in the context of climate change urgently need more research [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Neglect of seasonal physiology and of the consequences of its disruption, negatively impact livestock health. Agricultural industries, notably the poultry industry, diminish seasonality by choosing light and temperature conditions to maximize reproduction and growth and thus profitability on an industrial scale (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20151453F1" href="#RSPB20151453F1">figure 1</a>
  <span class="italic">d</span>). Some livestock, especially hens (
  <span class="italic">Gallus gallus</span>), may therefore be instructive models of longer-time effects of aseasonal conditions. Without the opportunity to seasonally pause laying and regenerate, notably by moulting [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C108" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C108">108</a>], these hens become morbid and are typically slaughtered; only by allowing or forcing a moult can these effects be reversed. In other species used for human food production, breeding practices that select for animals which are capable of year round reproduction have also reduced seasonal rhythms. Farmed cattle (
  <span class="italic">Bos primigenius taurus</span>) have the ability to reproduce year round, but despite selection for decreased seasonal physiology, some ancient patterns remain, including the expression of poorly understood genes relating to hibernation and seasonal biology [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C109" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C109">109</a>]. Many sheep breeds (
  <span class="italic">Ovis aries</span>) are excellent models for seasonal reproduction (electronic supplementary material, figure S6
  <span class="italic">a</span>) because they exhibit marked seasonal changes that are driven by internal rhythms synchronized by environmental factors [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C4" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C4">4</a>]. Similar to the seasonal variation in humans discussed above, both sheep and cattle exhibit seasonal changes in disease diagnoses (electronic supplementary material, figure S6
  <span class="italic">b</span>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To exemplify the possible implications of seasonal biology for morbidity and management of livestock, we highlight provisional data from passive surveillance in the UK on nutritional diseases (electronic supplementary material, figure S6
  <span class="italic">b</span>). Selenium (Se)-related deficiencies are common in farmed ruminants [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C110" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C110">110</a>], so that sheep and cattle are commonly given supplementary Se. This perceived risk of deficiency and consequent timing of supplementation is driven by expected environmental supply and climatic- or management-driven challenge rather than by knowledge of underlying physiological processes that drive vulnerability. The contrasting peak months of diagnosis of Se deficiency syndromes in sheep versus cattle (electronic supplementary material, figure S6
  <span class="italic">b</span>) could be driven by different factors such as livestock management or disruptions in internal annual rhythms. Se deficiency is apparent in humans and is directly linked to viral pathology [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C111" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C111">111</a>]. Seasonal variations in Se deficiency or supplementation in agriculture could, therefore, have significant implications for livestock health and human food systems.
