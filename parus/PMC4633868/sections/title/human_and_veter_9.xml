 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seasonal patterns in health and physiology can be powerful indicators of possible underlying pathways, e.g. the neuroendocrine regulation of metabolism and obesity [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C113" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C113">113</a>]. Data from human and veterinary pathology are often poorly integrated. Both are frequently only locally available, making it difficult to gain a broad understanding and to identify possible aetiologies. For example, revealing the seasonality of human diseases is now becoming possible as powerful epidemiological approaches are developed [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C33" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C33">33</a>], but data often need to be tediously compiled from dispersed and poorly accessible sources. We encourage unified collection of seasonal health data, including possible use of big data analytics [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C114" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C114">114</a>]. Analysis using improved empirical and epidemiological tools can help to identify drivers of seasonality (e.g. through trends in ambient temperature, latitude and day length) and also seasonal periods of particular vulnerability.
