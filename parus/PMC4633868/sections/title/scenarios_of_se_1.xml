 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seasonal changes in environmental variables play a significant role in the regulation of many physiological and behavioural processes. Annual changes in day length, temperature and rainfall can all act as cues; they provide vital information used in the timing of seasonal behaviour and the synchronization of internal rhythms (electronic supplementary material, figure S1 and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20151453F1" href="#RSPB20151453F1">figure 1</a>). In this way, organisms' behaviour and physiology is timed to optimize fitness in a given season [

  <a rid="RSPB20151453C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C13">13</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C19" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C19">19</a>]. However, the use of these cues to synchronize (entrain) biological rhythms is effective only to the extent that temporal relationships between the external and internal rhythms are predictable. Timing systems are therefore highly vulnerable to changes in the constellation of environmental factors under which they have evolved (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20151453F1" href="#RSPB20151453F1">figure 1</a>). Changes in the seasonal timing of organismal functions provided some of the earliest evidence for biological effects of global climate change [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C25" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C25">25</a>]. Such changes have now been documented across a wide range of habitat types and taxonomic groups (electronic supplementary material, figure S2 and [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C26" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C26">26</a>]). Crucially, species and populations of wild plants and animals have demonstrated different rates of change in their overt seasonality [

    <p>Schematic of annual rhythms. (
     <span class="italic">a</span>) All organisms on earth have evolved to time their physiology and behaviour (internal rhythm; blue) with seasonal changes in local climates/resources (external rhythm; green line). These internal rhythms can precede or follow those of resources, but for adaptive timing, the internal and external rhythms need to match. There are three theoretical scenarios that can account for disruptions of the match between seasonal timing to local climates: (
     <span class="italic">b</span>) phase shifts between internal and external rhythms; (
     <span class="italic">c</span>) increased (or decreased) duration of favourable environmental conditions (e.g. rising above the red line, which could indicate a rise in minimum temperature and day length); or (
     <span class="italic">d</span>) reduction of the amplitude (e.g. under ‘eternal summers’) and/or change in mean levels of seasonal rhythms. Red lines indicate the average seasonal mean of the rhythms in panel (
     <span class="italic">a</span>) for reference. Arrows indicate changes in rhythms. (Online version in colour.)

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are multiple, mutually non-exclusive and potentially interactive mechanisms by which altered external cues could disrupt the relationship between external and internal rhythmicity. For example, climate-change-induced shifts in the timing of the seasons can result in an abnormally delayed or advanced internal rhythm with respect to the environment (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20151453F1" href="#RSPB20151453F1">figure 1</a>
  <span class="italic">b</span>). Such mismatches in the timing of critical life-history events can have a large impact on the reproductive output of plants and animals. Alternatively, disruptions might be induced if the durations of specific phases of an external rhythm become extended (e.g. longer growing season) or reduced (e.g. shorter time of snow cover). This could occur, for example, if local minimal winter temperatures increase, resulting in higher means in local annual temperatures with reduced amplitude of seasonal differences (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20151453F1" href="#RSPB20151453F1">figure 1</a>
  <span class="italic">c</span>). A scenario with changes in the amplitude of seasonal differences is particularly relevant for humans (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20151453F1" href="#RSPB20151453F1">figure 1</a>
  <span class="italic">d</span>). Cultural developments, including the ability to control local environmental conditions through the use of fire at night for heat and light, marked the beginning of human manipulation of natural day–night cycles. The seasonality experienced by humans in developed societies (and that of some closely associated species) is already largely damped by modern artificially induced photic and indoor climate conditions reminiscent of eternal summers [
