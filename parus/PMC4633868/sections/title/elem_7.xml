 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although our appreciation of the critical role of seasonal biology in the health and welfare of organisms (including humans), natural ecosystems and industries is growing, our ignorance of the effects of seasonal disruption on these systems is profound. We call for the development of an integrated, interdisciplinary, seasonality-focused research agenda (electronic supplementary material, table S3), inspired by a one health approach [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C24" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C24">24</a>]. We propose three primary aims: understanding the internal seasonal clock, studying seasonality in human and veterinary clinical settings, and gaining ecological network perspectives.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Understanding the internal seasonal clock</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mechanistic basis of the seasonal clock, including its conserved and variable elements across vertebrates, remains largely unknown. This is in contrast to remarkable advances in our understanding of the circadian clock where the expanding knowledge of individual genetic variation is paving the way to personalized medicine [
   <a rid="RSPB20151453C112" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C112">112</a>]. Obtaining a similar level of detail about genes and physiological processes involved in the seasonal timing mechanisms and functional variation in these genes, would aid in identifying people, livestock and crops susceptible to the impact of seasonal disruption. This research should include genomic and transcriptomic investigation of seasonal biology across seasonal gradients in nature and also long-term studies of human and animal health. The current research focus on short-lived animal models offers limited answers for long-term health management of humans, relative to the value of incorporating studies of long-lived seasonal species. Beyond animal systems, manipulating plant clocks might also enable the development of crops (by either artificial selection or transgenic approaches) that are more resistant to temporal mismatches owing to climate change, preserving and possibly improving crop production systems.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seasonal patterns in health and physiology can be powerful indicators of possible underlying pathways, e.g. the neuroendocrine regulation of metabolism and obesity [
   <a rid="RSPB20151453C113" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C113">113</a>]. Data from human and veterinary pathology are often poorly integrated. Both are frequently only locally available, making it difficult to gain a broad understanding and to identify possible aetiologies. For example, revealing the seasonality of human diseases is now becoming possible as powerful epidemiological approaches are developed [
   <a rid="RSPB20151453C33" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C33">33</a>], but data often need to be tediously compiled from dispersed and poorly accessible sources. We encourage unified collection of seasonal health data, including possible use of big data analytics [
   <a rid="RSPB20151453C114" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C114">114</a>]. Analysis using improved empirical and epidemiological tools can help to identify drivers of seasonality (e.g. through trends in ambient temperature, latitude and day length) and also seasonal periods of particular vulnerability.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gaining ecological network perspectives</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because organisms are sensitive to changes in the rhythms of species with which they interact, consequential mismatches propagate across ecological networks. Most research focuses on pairwise predator–prey, plant–herbivore or plant–pollinator interactions, but pairwise interactions need to be scaled up to more complex food webs and host–vector–pathogen systems. We emphasize the value of longer-term monitoring in ecological studies, with a view of multiple components and ‘neighbours’ in the network of species of particular interest. There is a real need for large-scale experimental approaches to understand the ecosystem-level consequences of shifted or disrupted seasonal timing.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, in our view: (i) understanding the internal seasonal clock, (ii) enhancing seasonal analyses in human and veterinary settings, and (iii) integrating data across ecological and agricultural networks, will enable an integrative platform for addressing seasonal disruptions in a rapidly changing world.</p>
