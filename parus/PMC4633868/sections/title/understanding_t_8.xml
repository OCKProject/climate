 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Understanding the internal seasonal clock</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mechanistic basis of the seasonal clock, including its conserved and variable elements across vertebrates, remains largely unknown. This is in contrast to remarkable advances in our understanding of the circadian clock where the expanding knowledge of individual genetic variation is paving the way to personalized medicine [
  <a rid="RSPB20151453C112" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20151453C112">112</a>]. Obtaining a similar level of detail about genes and physiological processes involved in the seasonal timing mechanisms and functional variation in these genes, would aid in identifying people, livestock and crops susceptible to the impact of seasonal disruption. This research should include genomic and transcriptomic investigation of seasonal biology across seasonal gradients in nature and also long-term studies of human and animal health. The current research focus on short-lived animal models offers limited answers for long-term health management of humans, relative to the value of incorporating studies of long-lived seasonal species. Beyond animal systems, manipulating plant clocks might also enable the development of crops (by either artificial selection or transgenic approaches) that are more resistant to temporal mismatches owing to climate change, preserving and possibly improving crop production systems.
