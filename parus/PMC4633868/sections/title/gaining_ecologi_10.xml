 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because organisms are sensitive to changes in the rhythms of species with which they interact, consequential mismatches propagate across ecological networks. Most research focuses on pairwise predator–prey, plant–herbivore or plant–pollinator interactions, but pairwise interactions need to be scaled up to more complex food webs and host–vector–pathogen systems. We emphasize the value of longer-term monitoring in ecological studies, with a view of multiple components and ‘neighbours’ in the network of species of particular interest. There is a real need for large-scale experimental approaches to understand the ecosystem-level consequences of shifted or disrupted seasonal timing.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, in our view: (i) understanding the internal seasonal clock, (ii) enhancing seasonal analyses in human and veterinary settings, and (iii) integrating data across ecological and agricultural networks, will enable an integrative platform for addressing seasonal disruptions in a rapidly changing world.</p>
