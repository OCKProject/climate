  <p>Schematic of annual rhythms. (
   <span class="italic">a</span>) All organisms on earth have evolved to time their physiology and behaviour (internal rhythm; blue) with seasonal changes in local climates/resources (external rhythm; green line). These internal rhythms can precede or follow those of resources, but for adaptive timing, the internal and external rhythms need to match. There are three theoretical scenarios that can account for disruptions of the match between seasonal timing to local climates: (
   <span class="italic">b</span>) phase shifts between internal and external rhythms; (
   <span class="italic">c</span>) increased (or decreased) duration of favourable environmental conditions (e.g. rising above the red line, which could indicate a rise in minimum temperature and day length); or (
   <span class="italic">d</span>) reduction of the amplitude (e.g. under ‘eternal summers’) and/or change in mean levels of seasonal rhythms. Red lines indicate the average seasonal mean of the rhythms in panel (
   <span class="italic">a</span>) for reference. Arrows indicate changes in rhythms. (Online version in colour.)
