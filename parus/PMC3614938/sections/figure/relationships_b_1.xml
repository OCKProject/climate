  <div class="title">Relationships between spring temperatures, breeding initiation date, and fecundity of black-throated blue warblers.</div>
  <p>Warblers (a) initiated breeding earlier in warmer springs (β(temperature) = −2.3±0.30; t
   <sub>307</sub> = −8.2; p&lt;0.001); and (b) fledged more offspring when breeding initiation date was earlier. Fecundity was higher for birds with an earlier breeding initiation dates among birds that attempted second broods (open squares), but not among single brooders (closed squares; linear model with mean number of offspring fledged as the response, and clutch initiation date, double brooding (yes/no), and the interaction between initiation date and double brooding as predictors (F
   <sub>3, 48</sub> = ; p&lt;0.001; R
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.68)). Regression lines based on the above models are given here for the purpose of illustration. Results in the text are based on generalized linear mixed models with year as a random effect.
