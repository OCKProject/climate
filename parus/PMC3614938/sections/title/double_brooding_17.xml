 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Breeding initiation date is important in double brooded species because birds that get an early start are generally more likely to produce multiple broods 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Ogden1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Ogden1">[40]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Nagy1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Nagy1">[42]</a>. Species that produce multiple broods might therefore benefit from a warming climate because of earlier start dates and extended breeding seasons. A recent analysis of 20 bird species in Denmark 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Mller3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Mller3">[19]</a> suggested that the breeding season of double brooders lengthened in warm years, whereas breeding season of single brooders contracted. In one of these double brooding species, the long-distance migratory barn swallow Hirundo rustica, temperature-related extension of its breeding season was linked to a longer interclutch interval, which in turn increased fledging success 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Mller2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Mller2">[18]</a>. In a resident population of song sparrows on Mandarte Island, temperature-linked early breeding had a positive effect on fledging success because females successfully produced more broods when they started earlier 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Wilson1">[5]</a>. Likewise, in a Polish population of the double brooded reed warbler Acrocephalus scirpaceus, the percentage of birds producing second clutches appears to have increased since the 1970s, which the authors attribute to a temperature-linked increase in breeding season duration 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Halupka1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Halupka1">[43]</a>. In general, double brooded species might be more resilient to climate change than single brooded species, as suggested by the positive effect of double brooding on climate-linked population trends among 71 bird species in France 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Jiguet1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Jiguet1">[17]</a>. Double brooding could have thus contributed to the stable population trends of black-throated blue warblers 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Sauer1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Sauer1">[44]</a>. Although many Nearctic-Neotropical migratory passerines are classified as single brooded 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Morse1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Morse1">[45]</a>, the incidence of double brooding is poorly known for most of these species 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Holmes6" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Holmes6">[35]</a>. Better information about this important life-history trait among long-distance migratory birds would shed light on interspecific variation in population responses to changing climate.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Not all double brooded species appear to benefit from warming climate trends, however. In four populations of great tits in the Netherlands, for example, the fitness benefits and frequency of double brooding have declined with increasing spring temperatures, apparently because of increasing asynchrony between offspring food requirements and peak abundance of the caterpillars of a single moth species 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Husby1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Husby1">[20]</a>. Such trophic mismatches might be less likely to occur in species that, like the black-throated blue warbler 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Holmes3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Holmes3">[30]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Rodenhouse1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Rodenhouse1">[32]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Goodbred1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Goodbred1">[46]</a>, exploit a species-rich community of prey, among which a single temporal peak of abundance during the breeding season is improbable 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Both1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Both1">[7]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Dunn2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Dunn2">[22]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because earlier breeding initiation date predicted double brooding and annual fecundity in black-throated blue warblers, future trends toward earlier breeding could confer a population-level advantage, as long as sufficient food is available 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Nagy1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Nagy1">[42]</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Nagy2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Nagy2">[47]</a>. Annual fecundity in this species is positively linked to yearling recruitment in the subsequent year, as well as to maintaining the size of the breeding population 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Holmes1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Holmes1">[23]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Sillett1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Sillett1">[48]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Sillett2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Sillett2">[49]</a>. We note, however, that previous work, conducted over a much shorter time series (1995–2001), suggested that food availability later in the season was a more important predictor of double brooding and annual fecundity than breeding initiation date 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Nagy1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Nagy1">[42]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Nagy2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Nagy2">[47]</a>. Breeding initiation date and food availability were not independent variables, however: birds began breeding earlier on territories with more food 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Nagy1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Nagy1">[42]</a>, potentially masking the effects of lay date on the probability of double brooding. Population projections should therefore consider variation in food availability along with directional changes in lay date.
