 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found that black-throated blue warblers at Hubbard Brook initiated breeding earlier in warmer springs. Birds that bred earlier in the season had a fecundity advantage over later-breeding birds: early breeders were more likely to attempt a second brood than birds that started breeding later in the season, and double brooding and lay date were linked to higher annual fecundity. Black-throated blue warblers generally appeared to be under pressure to breed earlier in the season, although selection pressure for early breeding was not significantly stronger in warmer springs. These warblers therefore appeared able to adjust mean lay date appropriately to the 3.3-fold range of variation in spring temperature observed among the 25 years of this demographic study. The fitness responses to warm springs observed for this long-distance migrant were very similar to those documented for a resident population of another North American songbird, the song sparrow 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Wilson1">[5]</a>. In contrast, several other long-distance migratory species in Europe have experienced increasing selection pressure for early breeding in concert with warming climate trends

  <a rid="pone.0059467-Goodenough1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Goodenough1">[13]</a>, implying that they were unable to advance their lay date to match warmer springs. Our results suggest that black-throated blue warblers might not experience the same fecundity declines as the European migratory songbirds that are unable to adjust their timing of breeding in pace with springs temperatures.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Double Brooding, Early Breeding, and Resilience to Climate Change</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Breeding initiation date is important in double brooded species because birds that get an early start are generally more likely to produce multiple broods 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Ogden1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Ogden1">[40]</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Nagy1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Nagy1">[42]</a>. Species that produce multiple broods might therefore benefit from a warming climate because of earlier start dates and extended breeding seasons. A recent analysis of 20 bird species in Denmark 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Mller3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Mller3">[19]</a> suggested that the breeding season of double brooders lengthened in warm years, whereas breeding season of single brooders contracted. In one of these double brooding species, the long-distance migratory barn swallow Hirundo rustica, temperature-related extension of its breeding season was linked to a longer interclutch interval, which in turn increased fledging success 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Mller2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Mller2">[18]</a>. In a resident population of song sparrows on Mandarte Island, temperature-linked early breeding had a positive effect on fledging success because females successfully produced more broods when they started earlier 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Wilson1">[5]</a>. Likewise, in a Polish population of the double brooded reed warbler Acrocephalus scirpaceus, the percentage of birds producing second clutches appears to have increased since the 1970s, which the authors attribute to a temperature-linked increase in breeding season duration 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Halupka1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Halupka1">[43]</a>. In general, double brooded species might be more resilient to climate change than single brooded species, as suggested by the positive effect of double brooding on climate-linked population trends among 71 bird species in France 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Jiguet1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Jiguet1">[17]</a>. Double brooding could have thus contributed to the stable population trends of black-throated blue warblers 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Sauer1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Sauer1">[44]</a>. Although many Nearctic-Neotropical migratory passerines are classified as single brooded 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Morse1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Morse1">[45]</a>, the incidence of double brooding is poorly known for most of these species 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Holmes6" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Holmes6">[35]</a>. Better information about this important life-history trait among long-distance migratory birds would shed light on interspecific variation in population responses to changing climate.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Not all double brooded species appear to benefit from warming climate trends, however. In four populations of great tits in the Netherlands, for example, the fitness benefits and frequency of double brooding have declined with increasing spring temperatures, apparently because of increasing asynchrony between offspring food requirements and peak abundance of the caterpillars of a single moth species 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Husby1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Husby1">[20]</a>. Such trophic mismatches might be less likely to occur in species that, like the black-throated blue warbler 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Holmes3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Holmes3">[30]</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Rodenhouse1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Rodenhouse1">[32]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Goodbred1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Goodbred1">[46]</a>, exploit a species-rich community of prey, among which a single temporal peak of abundance during the breeding season is improbable 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Both1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Both1">[7]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Dunn2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Dunn2">[22]</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because earlier breeding initiation date predicted double brooding and annual fecundity in black-throated blue warblers, future trends toward earlier breeding could confer a population-level advantage, as long as sufficient food is available 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Nagy1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Nagy1">[42]</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Nagy2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Nagy2">[47]</a>. Annual fecundity in this species is positively linked to yearling recruitment in the subsequent year, as well as to maintaining the size of the breeding population 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Holmes1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Holmes1">[23]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Sillett1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Sillett1">[48]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Sillett2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Sillett2">[49]</a>. We note, however, that previous work, conducted over a much shorter time series (1995–2001), suggested that food availability later in the season was a more important predictor of double brooding and annual fecundity than breeding initiation date 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Nagy1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Nagy1">[42]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Nagy2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Nagy2">[47]</a>. Breeding initiation date and food availability were not independent variables, however: birds began breeding earlier on territories with more food 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Nagy1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Nagy1">[42]</a>, potentially masking the effects of lay date on the probability of double brooding. Population projections should therefore consider variation in food availability along with directional changes in lay date.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Selection for Early Breeding</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Black-throated blue warblers, on average, had higher reproductive success when they initiated breeding earlier, and they were under apparent selection pressure to breed earlier in most years of this study. However, the strength of selection on breeding initiation date appeared to fluctuate across years: the correlation between the residuals of the strength of selection on earlier breeding (φ) was −0.54, suggesting that years with relatively strong, negative selection differentials (i.e., strong selection for earlier breeding) were frequently followed by years with relatively weak or even positive selection (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059467-g003" href="#pone-0059467-g003">Fig. 3A</a>). The reasons for these fluctuations in the strength of selection are unclear, but nonetheless breeding date did not advance over time despite overall selection for earlier breeding. At least three non-exclusive reasons could explain this lack of response to selection for earlier breeding 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Price1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Price1">[50]</a>. First, delayed breeding might be a conservative strategy (i.e., “conservative bet-hedging;” 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Goodenough1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Goodenough1">[13]</a>) that persists because of the potentially high, but unpredictable, costs of beginning too early, such as nest failure due to late spring storms and unseasonably cold temperatures. Such weather-related nest failures have been observed at Hubbard Brook 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Holmes3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Holmes3">[30]</a>. Second, birds in poor condition due to non-heritable causes might be unable to breed as early in the season as birds in superior condition, or they might have a later optimal breeding initiation date, leading to a mean first lay date that is later than the population-level optimum 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Price1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Price1">[50]</a>. Indeed, yearling males initiated first clutches later than older birds, and indirect evidence indicates that yearlings might be in poor condition relative to older birds at the time of arrival: yearlings arrive later on the breeding grounds at Hubbard Brook 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Holmes3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Holmes3">[30]</a> and settle on territories of poor quality 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Holmes2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Holmes2">[29]</a> relative to older birds. Such delayed arrivals have been linked to poor physiological condition on non-breeding grounds in another Neotropical-Nearctic migrant, the American redstart S. ruticilla 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Marra1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Marra1">[26]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Reudink1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Reudink1">[27]</a>. Last, selection pressures may differ across this warbler’s broad range 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Webster1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Webster1">[51]</a>. Because natal dispersal in this species is broad 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Holmes3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Holmes3">[30]</a> and the population is well mixed 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Webster1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Webster1">[51]</a>, selection pressure in one area might be muted or balanced by opposing pressures in other areas.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inter-annual Weather Variation vs. Climate Trends</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the substantial inter-annual variation in spring temperature, rather than trend over time, to infer possible responses to climate change, as have numerous other studies 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Wilson1">[5]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Chase1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Chase1">[52]</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Gibbs1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Gibbs1">[55]</a>. Our analyses did not reveal a trend towards earlier breeding or an increase in selection pressure from 1986–2010, which is unsurprising because we saw no trend towards warmer springs within this 25-year interval. However, mean spring temperatures did increase significantly over a longer (53-year) time-series at Hubbard Brook (i.e., since the start of collection of weather data in 1957; see also 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Reynolds1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Reynolds1">[24]</a>). Such warming climate trends have been linked to advancing spring leaf phenology at Hubbard Brook 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Richardson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Richardson1">[25]</a>. With the continued, directional increases in spring temperature that have been projected for New England in the coming decades 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Hayhoe1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Hayhoe1">[56]</a>, our results suggest that a future trend towards earlier breeding likely. Selection pressure for earlier breeding could intensify as well, if this migratory warbler is ultimately constrained from continual advancement of breeding initiation date by fixed spring migration cues 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-MillerRushing1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-MillerRushing1">[10]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Both3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Both3">[12]</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the link between variation in spring temperature and earlier breeding, and the link between early breeding and reproductive output, spring temperature was not a direct predictor of double brooding or annual fecundity. A suite of other environmental and ecological factors limit and regulate annual fecundity in this species 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Rodenhouse2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Rodenhouse2">[57]</a>, including insect abundance 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Nagy2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Nagy2">[47]</a>, predators 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Nagy3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Nagy3">[58]</a>, conspecific density 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Sillett2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Sillett2">[49]</a>, understory foliage density 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Holmes2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Holmes2">[29]</a>, precipitation 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Rodenhouse1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Rodenhouse1">[32]</a>, and global climate cycles 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Sillett1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Sillett1">[48]</a>, and any of these could interact with or mask the effect of temperature on annual fecundity. One such interaction involves conspecific density, climate, and insects: the strength of density dependence on warbler fecundity appears to be stronger in El Niño years, which are characterized by low insect abundance, than in La Niña years 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Sillett3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Sillett3">[59]</a>. Interactive effects of these climatic and ecological factors, as well as events and conditions during migration and wintering, must also be taken into consideration when predicting the effects of climate change on population trends in long-distance migrants. Spring temperatures alone might have little power to predict annual fecundity and population trends in this species.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conclusions</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Multi-decade studies that examine the fecundity effects of advancing lay date on bird populations are rare, with results that have varied among species studied 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Dunn1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Dunn1">[4]</a>. Our study suggests that black-throated blue warblers that breed earlier in the season have a fecundity advantage over later breeding birds. However, possible future trends towards warmer springs, advancing lay date, and increasing annual fecundity might not necessarily translate to population growth in this species, because a number of different demographic parameters contribute to population change 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Wilson1">[5]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Wilson2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Wilson2">[60]</a>. Furthermore, warming climate trends could lead to a decline in habitat quality, particularly in prey abundance, over time 
   <a rid="pone.0059467-Rodenhouse3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Rodenhouse3">[61]</a>. An understanding of the indirect effects of climate variation on the abundance and phenology of prey, as well as the long-term effects of climate trends on habitat structure and quality, will be necessary to project the effects of climate change on populations of Nearctic – Neotropical migratory songbirds.
