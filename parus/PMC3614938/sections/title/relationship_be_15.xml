 <div class="title">Relationship between selection for earlier breeding (standardized selection differentials), year, and mean spring temperature (15 Marchâ€“18 May).</div>
 <p>Points below the zero lines (indicated by dashed lines) indicate selection for earlier breeding. The strength of selection for earlier breeding did not increase (a) over time or (b) with spring temperature. The latter result suggests that black-throated blue warblers were adjusting their lay date sufficiently to the observed variation in spring temperature. Parameter estimates, based on a multiple linear regression model with an AR-1 autocorrelation structure, are given in the text.</p>
