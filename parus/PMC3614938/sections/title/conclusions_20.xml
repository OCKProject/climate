 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Multi-decade studies that examine the fecundity effects of advancing lay date on bird populations are rare, with results that have varied among species studied 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Dunn1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Dunn1">[4]</a>. Our study suggests that black-throated blue warblers that breed earlier in the season have a fecundity advantage over later breeding birds. However, possible future trends towards warmer springs, advancing lay date, and increasing annual fecundity might not necessarily translate to population growth in this species, because a number of different demographic parameters contribute to population change

  <a rid="pone.0059467-Rodenhouse3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Rodenhouse3">[61]</a>. An understanding of the indirect effects of climate variation on the abundance and phenology of prey, as well as the long-term effects of climate trends on habitat structure and quality, will be necessary to project the effects of climate change on populations of Nearctic â€“ Neotropical migratory songbirds.
