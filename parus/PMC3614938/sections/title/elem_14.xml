 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Selection favored earlier breeding at Hubbard Brook in most years. Negative selection differentials occurred in 72% (18/25) of years (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059467-g003" href="#pone-0059467-g003">Fig. 3a</a>) and were significantly more likely to occur than positive differentials (sign test, p&lt;0.04). Moreover, mean annual standardized selection differential across years was negative (−0.09±0.03; range −0.44–0.18), indicating overall selection for earlier breeding. However, in multiple linear regression model with “corAR1” autocorrelation structure, we found no significant effect of year (with temperature held constant: β [year] = 0.00±0.00, t

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059467-g003" href="#pone-0059467-g003">Fig. 3a</a>), or spring temperature (with year held constant: β [temperature] = −0.03±0.02, t
  <sub>23</sub> = −2.0, p = 0.06; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059467-g003" href="#pone-0059467-g003">Fig. 3b</a>) on the strength of selection. The correlation between residuals separated by one year (φ) in this model was −0.54, suggesting that the strength of selection on earlier breeding tends to fluctuate from high to low in consecutive years.

   <p>Points below the zero lines (indicated by dashed lines) indicate selection for earlier breeding. The strength of selection for earlier breeding did not increase (a) over time or (b) with spring temperature. The latter result suggests that black-throated blue warblers were adjusting their lay date sufficiently to the observed variation in spring temperature. Parameter estimates, based on a multiple linear regression model with an AR-1 autocorrelation structure, are given in the text.</p>
