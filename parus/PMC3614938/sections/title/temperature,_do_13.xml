 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found no evidence that mean spring temperature directly affected warbler double brooding or fecundity. Probability of laying a second clutch did not increase with temperature (GLMER: β [temperature] = 0.03±0.20 logit[double brooding], z = 0.20, p = 0.86). Likewise, annual fecundity did not increase with mean spring temperature (GLMER: β [temperature] = 0.03±0.04 log[offspring], z = 0.76, p = 0.44). Yearling pairs were less likely to attempt a second brood than pairs of older breeders in this model (
