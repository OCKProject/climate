  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Birds that initiated breeding earlier were more likely to double brood and had higher annual fecundity than birds that bred later in a season (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059467-g002" href="#pone-0059467-g002">Fig. 2</a>). Double brooding was common: 31% (97/309) of all females laid second clutches after successfully fledging young from the first clutch. The sample size of breeding pairs and percentage that attempted double broods at each first lay-date is given in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0059467-t003" href="#pone-0059467-t003">Table 3</a>. The probability of laying a second clutch declined with increasing first lay date (GLMER: β [lay date] = −0.11±0.03 logit[double brooding], z = −3.6, p = &lt;0.001; observations = 309 pair-years; number of groups = 25 years for this and all subsequent analyses unless otherwise stated), and the mean annual fecundity (3.7±0.1; range = 0–8 offspring) declined with later first lay date (GLMER: β [lay date] = −0.02±0.005 log[offspring], z = −2.9, p = 0.004). The relationship between lay date and annual fecundity appeared to be mediated, at least in part, by the positive relationship between double brooding and fecundity (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059467-g002" href="#pone-0059467-g002">Fig. 2</a>): significantly more offspring were fledged per territory-year when double broods were attempted (GLMER: β [double brooding] = 0.7±0.06 log[offspring]; z = 11.0, p&lt;0.001). In contrast, first clutches were not larger for birds that initiated breeding earlier (GLMER: β [lay date] = −0.002±0.004 log[eggs], z = −0.6, p = 0.52; n = 361 clutches, groups = 25 years). Pair age class did not affect the probability of double brooding, annual fecundity, or clutch size, and was removed from these models.
