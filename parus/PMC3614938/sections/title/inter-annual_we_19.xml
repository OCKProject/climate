 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the substantial inter-annual variation in spring temperature, rather than trend over time, to infer possible responses to climate change, as have numerous other studies 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Wilson1">[5]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Chase1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Chase1">[52]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Gibbs1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Gibbs1">[55]</a>. Our analyses did not reveal a trend towards earlier breeding or an increase in selection pressure from 1986–2010, which is unsurprising because we saw no trend towards warmer springs within this 25-year interval. However, mean spring temperatures did increase significantly over a longer (53-year) time-series at Hubbard Brook (i.e., since the start of collection of weather data in 1957; see also 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Reynolds1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Reynolds1">[24]</a>). Such warming climate trends have been linked to advancing spring leaf phenology at Hubbard Brook 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Richardson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Richardson1">[25]</a>. With the continued, directional increases in spring temperature that have been projected for New England in the coming decades 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Hayhoe1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Hayhoe1">[56]</a>, our results suggest that a future trend towards earlier breeding likely. Selection pressure for earlier breeding could intensify as well, if this migratory warbler is ultimately constrained from continual advancement of breeding initiation date by fixed spring migration cues

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the link between variation in spring temperature and earlier breeding, and the link between early breeding and reproductive output, spring temperature was not a direct predictor of double brooding or annual fecundity. A suite of other environmental and ecological factors limit and regulate annual fecundity in this species 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Rodenhouse2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Rodenhouse2">[57]</a>, including insect abundance 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Nagy2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Nagy2">[47]</a>, predators 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Nagy3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Nagy3">[58]</a>, conspecific density 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Sillett2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Sillett2">[49]</a>, understory foliage density 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Holmes2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Holmes2">[29]</a>, precipitation 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Rodenhouse1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Rodenhouse1">[32]</a>, and global climate cycles 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Sillett1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Sillett1">[48]</a>, and any of these could interact with or mask the effect of temperature on annual fecundity. One such interaction involves conspecific density, climate, and insects: the strength of density dependence on warbler fecundity appears to be stronger in El Niño years, which are characterized by low insect abundance, than in La Niña years 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Sillett3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Sillett3">[59]</a>. Interactive effects of these climatic and ecological factors, as well as events and conditions during migration and wintering, must also be taken into consideration when predicting the effects of climate change on population trends in long-distance migrants. Spring temperatures alone might have little power to predict annual fecundity and population trends in this species.
