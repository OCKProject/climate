 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the present study, we investigated variation in laying date in two tit species, the Great Tit and the Blue Tit, in two extremely different, subsequent years (2013 and 2014), showing that laying date is a highly plastic trait that is strongly dependent on spring temperature. Because higher latitudes have larger climatic variation than lower latitudes, natural selection should promote broader climatic adaptability and thermal tolerance in individuals at higher latitudes as postulated by the climatic variability hypothesis (Allee et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1949</a>). This hypothesis may be considered in the context of avian breeding phenology and recent climate changes. The birds we studied adjusted their laying dates in accordance with changes in spring temperature, thus corroborating results from other tit populations (Charmantier et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2008</a>; Thorley and Lord 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">2015</a>; Wesołowski et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">2016</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Timing of the breeding in tits is clearly correlated with the ambient temperature prior to breeding initiation (van Balen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">1973</a>; Perrins and McCleery 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">1989</a>). Higher temperature directly reduces energy costs associated with thermoregulation and causes faster growth of gonads and formation of eggs. The leafing phenology of trees directly influences the occurrence of the most important component of the diet of chicks—caterpillars (Bańbura et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">1999</a>). Glądalski et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">2014</a>) previously showed that the mean date of the first laid egg in Great Tits and Blue Tits was highly negatively correlated with the warmth sums in the parkland and in the forest areas. Two consecutive breeding seasons analyzed in this paper demonstrated large flexibility in decisions about when to start reproduction in both species of tits (e.g., the difference between first laid egg in 2013 and 2014 in one individual Great Tit female was 24 days; unpublished data). Tits were able to shift their timing of egg laying by about 3 weeks between 2 years. Similar extremes in the same years were recorded in the Marsh Tit (
  <span class="italic">Poecile palustris</span>) in Białowieża (eastern Poland) by Wesołowski et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">2016</a>). Wesołowski et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">2016</a>) showed that individual March Tits from Białowieża were able to shift their timing of breeding more than 3 weeks between 2013 and 2014. Those authors suggest that large inter-annual variation of breeding dates that they observed in Białowieża (see also Wesołowski and Cholewa 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">2009</a>) could be accounted for by individual plasticity, and invoking other mechanisms would be redundant. Our present results confirm the existence of large plasticity in the timing of laying in Great Tits and Blue Tits. It seems probable that even if springs proved to be still warmer in the future (as climatologists predict), tits would be already prepared—they posses physiological and behavioral mechanisms that allow them to adjust to such a challenge, as suggested by Wesołowski et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">2016</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The later initiation of breeding by tits in forest areas compared to nearby urban areas was shown by many authors (Lack 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">1958</a>; Dhondt et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">1984</a>; Cowie and Hinsley 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">1987</a>; Glądalski et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">2015</a>; Wawrzyniak et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">2015</a>). Early breeding in urban populations was shown to be caused mainly by food availability. Human-provided food may induce earlier laying through improving the body condition of females (Chamberlain et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">2009</a>). On the other hand, taxonomic composition of tree flora in our study parkland may result in earlier leafing as suggested by Marciniak et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2007</a>). Buds and, then, larvae on oaks in the forest appear later than on birches and poplars in the parkland. In 2014 (warm, early breeding season), there was no snow cover, the temperatures were relatively high during March, and the conditions for breeding were favorable. In 2013 (cold, late breeding season), the snow cover was present until mid-April, but in the parkland, the snow melted at least 1 week before the forest. This could also lead to a difference in the abundance of food for females. Probably, urban heat island effects partly influenced the phenology of urban population of tits (Rebele 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">1994</a>). The lack of sufficient food for females restricts their early breeding (Perrins 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">1970</a>; Nager and van Noordwijk 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">1995</a>). Additionally, because snail shells are the main source of calcium necessary for females to form the shells of their eggs (Bańbura et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">2010</a>; Reynolds and Perrins 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">2010</a>), snow cover may make it more difficult to find them. A tit nest consists of moss layer (sometimes with dry grass and roots) and the lining layer (animal material including wool, silk, fur, feathers, or hair; Glądalski et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2016b</a>). Snow and low temperatures can also make it difficult to obtain the material to build nests and, in this way, may delay breeding (Britt and Deeming 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">2011</a>; Deeming et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">2012</a>; Wawrzyniak, unpublished data).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The timing of breeding was shown to be the most crucial factor influencing the decision on having a second brood in the current breeding season in Great Tits (Verboven and Verhulst 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">1996</a>). The frequency of second clutches was also shown to be dependent on habitat. Because the period of peak caterpillar abundance is short and food availability notably declines after the first brood in deciduous forests, second clutches are less frequent there than in urban and suburban green spaces, where food availability remains more stable during the entire breeding season (Lack 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">1958</a>; Gosler 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">1993</a>; Mägi and Mänd 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">2004</a>). Orell and Ojanen (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">1983a</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">1983b</a>) showed that female tits that decided to have a second clutch produced their first clutch earlier than females that did not have a second clutch. The natural experiment described in the present paper shows that Great Tits tend to have second clutches when the breeding season starts early (warm spring, 2014), and they tend to avoid second clutches when the breeding season starts late (cold spring, 2013).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, the breeding date of Great Tits and Blue Tits turned out to be a flexible trait. Populations of both tit species may tune their egg-laying dates to diverse weather conditions by about 3 weeks. As suggested by Wesołowski et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">2016</a>), this rather large range of plasticity has developed in reaction to challenges imposed by irregular inter-annual climatic variation. It should suffice to adjust bird’s breeding decisions to the forecasted climate changes. Further investigations should focus on the impact of extreme events on adjustment of tits to match breeding with timing of peaks in spring caterpillar abundance across the latitudes.
