 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The patterns of variation in temperature were strikingly different between the study years (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). In 2013, temperatures below zero were prevailing in March and at the beginning of April. The snow cover started to disappear in mid-April, and in the parkland, the snow melted at least 1 week before the forest (Glądalski, personal observations). In 2014, there was no snow cover during March and April and the temperatures were much higher than in the previous year (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The warmth sum in 2013 was the lowest in 40 years (1975–2014), 90.2 °C (the second coldest was in 1997, 185.3 °C), whereas the warmth sum in 2014 was the highest in 40 years, 425.0 °C (the second warmest was in 1990, 417.3 °C; Fig.

Blue Tits also started laying eggs late in 2013, mean for the parkland 24 April (55.3 days from 1 March) and mean for the forest 29 April (60.2 days from 1 March), and very early in 2014, mean for the parkland 6 April (36.8 days from 1 March) and mean for the forest 8 April (38.6 days from 1 March; Fig.

The mean difference in the Blue Tit laying date between the years was 18.5 days for the parkland and 21.6 days for the forest. In 2013, the earliest individual female Great Tit started to lay on 18 April in the parkland (in 2014, it was 1 April) and on 19 April in the forest (in 2014, it was 2 April). The earliest individual Blue Tit started to lay on 20 April 2013 in the parkland (in 2014, it was 1 April) and on 27 April 2013 in the forest (in 2014, it was 3 April).
