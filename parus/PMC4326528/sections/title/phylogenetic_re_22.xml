 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, the phylogenetic trees based on different datasets support the monophyly of 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> and the close genetic relationships of 
  <span class="italic">C. auritum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>], 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>]. Our analysis of the gene sequences of 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> based on different datasets confirms that 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> is the sister group to 
  <span class="italic">Lophura</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>], indicating their closer relationship.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The genetic distance is rather small among some 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> species, for instance, between 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span>, 
  <span class="italic">C. auritum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span>. Morphological, ecological and behavioural studies have revealed the high similarity between 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span>, but with different plumage coloration [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]. Their distributions are overlapping, and 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> routinely hybridises with 
  <span class="italic">C. c. drouynii</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>], which indicates their reproductive compatibility. Furthermore, the distribution of 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> is limited between the Himalayan and Nyenchen Tanglha ranges, which provided the geographical isolation required for the formation of a subspecies or species. Therefore, the taxonomic status and its relationship to 
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span> are much questionable, which need to be re-evaluated by multiple markers and population genetics in the further studies.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on their significant differences in many aspects such as morphology and behaviour, 
  <span class="italic">C. auritum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span> are commonly considered to be independent species. However, the genetic distance of 0.002 indicates that they have a much closer genetic relationship. Consistent with this observation, Tsam et al. (2003) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>] observed that the interspecific differentiation between 
  <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. auritum</span> (0.18%) is less than the degree of differentiation among the 
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span> subspecies.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some Phasianidae species were found in the Pliocene epoch, and several modern taxa had already appeared in the Quaternary Pleistocene. The earliest fossils of 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> were found in the Cenozoic Zhoukoudian strata of Beijing, and in the Pleistocene strata at Yanjinggou in Wanxian of Sichuan Prov. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>]. The evolution of 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> mainly occurred corresponding to the Tibetan Plateau intensive uplift during the Tertiary Pliocene and the alternation of the glacial and interglacial periods in the Quaternary, which created profound and complex changes in the geographical and ecological environments [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>] and was thought to have greatly affected its topography and avian species diversification [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>]. Based on our results, the spliting time between 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span>-
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span>-
  <span class="italic">C. auritum</span> is consistent with the uplift during the Tertiary Pliocene and the fossil record in the Sichuan Wanxian Yanjinggou Pleistocene strata, which is approximate to the divergence times estimated by Jiang et al. (2014) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>] (3.78 Mya, 95% HPD = 1.17-6.56 Mya). Our study shows that 
  <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. auritum</span> are relatively ancient groups, while 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span> diverged later; these observations are not consistent with the 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> evolution hypothesis proposed by Lu et al. (1998) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lu et al. (1998) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>] suggested that the ancestor of 
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> originated in Sichuan Prov., Yunnan Prov., and the Tibetan border area. They noted that the clade containing the 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> plesiomorphy migrated to the hinterland plateau and subsequently differentiated into the ancestor of 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. auritum</span>. The ancestor of 
  <span class="italic">C. auritum</span> dispersed in the northern plateau, and differentiated into 
  <span class="italic">C. auritum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span>. Based on the divergence time and distribution characteristics of 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> species, our results support the ancestor of 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> was initially distributed in Sichuan Prov., Yunnan Prov., and the Tibetan border area. The 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> first diverged into the ancestor of 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span>-
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span> and the ancestor of 
  <span class="italic">C. auritum</span>-
  <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span>. Considering the geographical distribution of 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">66</a>], we propose that the ancestor of 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span>-
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span> might migrated to platform of the plateau, and then splitted into two lineages during the last uplift of the Tibetan Plateau [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>], one adapted the high altitude environment to form 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> in east Tibet, and the other evoluted into 
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon,</span> while the ancestor of 
  <span class="italic">C. auritum</span>-
  <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span> dispersed to the northern plateau and further differentiated nearly the same period with 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span>-
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span>.
