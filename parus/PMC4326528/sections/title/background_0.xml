 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phasianidae is a family of Galliformes containing 38 genera and approximately 138 species, which is grouped into two tribes based on their morphological features, the Pheasants and Partridges. Several studies have attempted to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of the Phasianidae, but many questions still remain unaddressed, such as the taxonomic status and phylogenetic relationships among 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> species. The mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) has been extensively used to infer avian genetic diversification with reasonable resolution. Here, we sequenced the entire mitogenomes of three 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> species (
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span>, 
  <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span>) to investigate their evolutionary relationship among 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> species.
