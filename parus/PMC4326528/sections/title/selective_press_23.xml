  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> species
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Ka/Ks values in most protein-coding genes are less than 1 (Ka is lower than Ks) with P-values less than 0.001, which indicates that these genes in 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> are under purifying selection. The Ka/Ks values of each gene among 
  <span class="italic">C.har</span>-
  <span class="italic">C.man</span>, 
  <span class="italic">C.man</span>-
  <span class="italic">C.cro</span>, 
  <span class="italic">C.har</span>-
  <span class="italic">C.aur</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C.cro</span>-
  <span class="italic">C.aur</span> are similar. The Ka/Ks value of the 
  <span class="italic">atp8</span> gene is 50 in five groups except for 
  <span class="italic">C.har</span>-
  <span class="italic">C.cro</span>, which reveals the strong positive selection. However, only the P-value for 
  <span class="italic">C.man</span>-
  <span class="italic">C.aur</span> is far less than 0.01 (P = 0), which indicates significant differences. In contrast, the Ka/Ks values of the 
  <span class="italic">atp6</span> and 
  <span class="italic">cytb</span> genes in 
  <span class="italic">C.har</span>-
  <span class="italic">C.cro</span> are 50 with P-values less than 0.001, which also indicates strong positive selection. Previous studies have shown that 
  <span class="italic">atp6</span> gene is highly variable in the mitogenomes of humans living in extremely cold areas [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">68</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">71</a>], the 
  <span class="italic">atp6</span> gene faces strong selection pressure with increasing altitude [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">72</a>], and the variation of 
  <span class="italic">atp6</span> gene in 
  <span class="italic">Artemia tibetiana</span> is the result of adaptation to the cold and hypoxic environment of the plateau [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">73</a>]. The variation in 
  <span class="italic">atp6</span> may reflect the adaptation of 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> to the plateau environment; 
  <span class="italic">cytb</span> might also play an important role in this process. The 
  <span class="italic">atp8</span> gene in 
  <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. auritum</span> may also have experienced a strong selection in adaption to the plateau environment.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, the further study showed that only four amino acid sites of atp8 in the 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> are positively selected sites, and accordingly this gene may have experienced strong selective pressure for plateau adaptation. The corresponding TM-helix (IN- &gt; OUT) or outside position might be important for the 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> adaptation. After discarding groups (
  <span class="italic">C.har</span>-
  <span class="italic">C.cro</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C.man</span>-
  <span class="italic">C.aur</span>) and genes (
  <span class="italic">cox1</span>, 
  <span class="italic">atp8</span> and 
  <span class="italic">nad4l</span>) with obviously different Ka/Ks values to others, the average value (0.0431) is similar with the strongly locomotive group (0.04) in the study of Shen et al. (2009) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">74</a>], which indicates the 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> accumulates fewer nonsynonymous mutations and is corresponding to their strong running ability.
