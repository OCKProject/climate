  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span>, belonging to Phasianidae in Galliformes, is a rare but important genus endemic to China. The four previous recognised 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> species are 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span>, 
  <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span>, 
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. auritum</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> is only distributed in a typical alpine and taiga habitats at elevations of 3500–3900 meters of southeastern Tibet. 
  <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span> is mainly distributed in Lvliang Mountains of Shanxi Prov., Xiaowutai Mountains of Hebei Prov., Dongling Mountains of Beijing and some other local areas [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span> is only present in western Sichuan Prov., northwestern Yunnan Prov., southeastern Qinghai Prov. and eastern Tibet at high mountain areas [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>]. It is common at high altitudes (3000–4300 m) and exists in coniferous forests, mixed broadleaf-conifer forests and alpine scrubs [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">C. auritum</span> is only encountered in the mountainous regions of Qinghai, Gansu and Sichuan provinces and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The taxonomic status and phylogenetic position of 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> are controversial [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. Whereas some studies have proposed that it is an independent species [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>], others have suggested that it is a subspecies of 
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>]. The 
  <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span> taxon is believed to have diverged first, and 
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. auritum</span> are considered more closely related than the other species [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. Other studies have suggested that 
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span> is a relatively original species and that 
  <span class="italic">C. auritum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span> are more closely related genetically [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies on 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> species have focused on their distribution, ecology and behaviour. Some studies have used single gene or partial sequences in reconstructing their phylogenetic relationships [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>], but a comprehensive study of the entire mitogenomes has rarely been attempted. To reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships among 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> and other Phasianidae species, the entire mitogenomes of 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span>, 
  <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span> were sequenced, and thus four species of the genus 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> were thoroughly compared. Furthermore, the estimated divergence times of the four 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> species were calculated, and a Ka/Ks analysis was used to estimate the adaptation of the 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> mitogenome to different environments.
