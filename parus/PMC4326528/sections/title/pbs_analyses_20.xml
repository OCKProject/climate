 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PBS analyses were performed to better understand the contributions of different parts of the mitogenomes to the genome phylogeny based on the mitogenome-ML tree. The relationships among the PBS value, length, singleton sites (S), parsimony informative sites (Pi), variable sites (V) and conserved sites (C) in different partitions are also studied. Ranking individual protein-coding genes by their respective contribution to the total PBS values shows that some genes, such as 
  <span class="italic">nad5</span> and 
  <span class="italic">nad4</span> provide a higher contribution compared to other markers, while 
  <span class="italic">atp8</span> and 
  <span class="italic">nad4L</span> contribute less. But analysis also shows that PBS values are roughly correlated with gene lengths. The variable sites are closely related to parsimony informative sites, which follow the same trend. The third codon has a high PBS value but with less conserved sites, while the tRNA gene cluster IQM has a lower PBS value with more conserved sites compared to other partitions.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The third codon has a high PBS value and therefore contributes most to the mitogenome-ML tree. The NADH genes have secondary high PBS, which might be the effect of the third codon in the relatively long sequence. To further understand the contribution of the 3rd codon, we reconstructed the phylogenetic tree using this single partition.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the phylogenetic trees based on the third codon (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM8">8</a>), the structure of the ML tree is similar to the BI with the exception of 
  <span class="italic">Phasianus</span>. The positions of 
  <span class="italic">Pucrasia macrolopha</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Bonasa bonasia</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Meleagris gallopavo</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Polyplectron bicalcaratum</span> in the 3rd-MP tree are different compared to the BI tree. The 3rd-BI tree is identical to the mitogenome-ML with relative high support except for the position of 
  <span class="italic">Polyplectron bicalcaratum</span>.
