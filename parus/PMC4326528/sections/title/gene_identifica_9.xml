 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Staden sequence analysis package [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>] was used for sequence assembly and annotation of 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> mitogenome. The complete genome assemblies for the mitogenomes of 
  <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span> were performed using the SOAP de novo software. Most tRNA genes were identified using tRNAscan-SE 1.21 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>] under the ‘tRNAscan only’ search mode, with the vertebrate mitochondrial genetic code and ‘mito/chloroplast’ source. The protein-coding genes (PCGs), rRNA genes and the remaining putative tRNA genes that were not identified by tRNAscan-SE were identified by sequence comparison with other Galliformes species. The 
  <span class="italic">rrnS</span> secondary structure of 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> was predicted based on the structure of 
  <span class="italic">Gallus gallus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Anas platyrhynchos</span> obtained from the Comparative RNA Web (CRW) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>], and 
  <span class="italic">Pseudopodoces humilis</span> (now as 
  <span class="italic">Parus humilis</span>) structure [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>]. The 
  <span class="italic">rrnL</span> secondary structure was predicted based on the structure of 
  <span class="italic">Xenopus laevis</span> obtained from the CRW database, 
  <span class="italic">Bos taurus</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>] and 
  <span class="italic">P. humilis</span> structures [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>]. The RNAstructure software was used to identify and draw potential secondary structures in the single-stranded control region. The nucleotide compositions of the mitogenomes and amino acid information were analysed using MEGA 4.1 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>].
