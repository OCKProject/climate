 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 13 protein-coding genes of 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> genomes are similar to most other Phasianidae species, with 
  <span class="italic">nad5</span> and 
  <span class="italic">atp8</span> being the longest and shortest genes, respectively. The total length of the PCGs in each 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> species is 11358 bp after removing termination codons, containing approximately 3786 codons. The A + T content of the 13 PCGs is 53.4% in 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span>, and 53.3% in 
  <span class="italic">C. auritum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span>. Analysis of the base composition at each codon position of the concatenated PCGs shows that the second codon position has a higher A + T content (57.9% in 
  <span class="italic">C. auritum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span>, 58.1% in 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span>, and 58.0% in 
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span>, respectively) than the first and third codon positions. The amino acid frequencies in the 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> PCGs are similar, with Leu significantly more frequent than other amino acids. The different codon positions have the same base distributions, with C and G as the most and least frequent bases in the third codon, respectively.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All PCGs in 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> species start with the typical ATG codon, except the 
  <span class="italic">nad5</span> gene in 
  <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span> and the 
  <span class="italic">cox1</span> gene in four 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> species, which start with GTG. Four types of stop codons are used by the coding genes, including TAA and TAG for most genes, AGG for 
  <span class="italic">cox1</span> in 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> and 
  <span class="italic">nad6</span> in 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span>, and an incomplete stop codon T- for 
  <span class="italic">cox3</span>, 
  <span class="italic">nad4</span> and 
  <span class="italic">nad2</span> in four 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> species, respectively.
