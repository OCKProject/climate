 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Along with the PCG dataset obtained in this study, 42 Galliformes sequences were used to estimate the divergence time of the 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> species. The divergence time of 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> species was calculated using the Bayesian procedure implemented in BEAST v. 1.7.2 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>]. A relaxed clock was used with rates complying with a log-normal distribution [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>]. The GTR + I + G model and a Yule prior were used in the analysis. The calibration points were based on the fossil records showing that stem Numididae-Phasianidae split at 50–54 Mya (million years ago) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>]; 
  <span class="italic">Arborophila rufipectus</span> diverged from the other lineages in the Galliformes around 39 Mya [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>]; 
  <span class="italic">Coturnix</span>-
  <span class="italic">Gallus</span> split at 35 Mya [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>]. The results of runs of 10 million generations were used after a burn-in of 100.
