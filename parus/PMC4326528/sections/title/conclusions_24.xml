 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, the mitogenomes of the 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> species contain the same gene arrangements and similar compositions including base contents and secondary structures. According to the phylogenetic trees, 
  <span class="italic">C. auritum</span> with 
  <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> with 
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span> form two pairs of sister groups. 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> have a closer relationship with 
  <span class="italic">Lophura</span>. Based on the genetic distances, 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> is more closely related with 
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon,</span> and is the most recent diverged descendent of 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> as a result of the plateau adaptation. According to the molecular dating results, the divergence time between 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span>-
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span>-
  <span class="italic">C. auritum</span> is consistent with the uplift of the Tibetan plateau and the subsequently climate change during the Tertiary Pliocene. The Ka/Ks analysis showed that 
  <span class="italic">atp8</span> gene in the 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> species may have experienced strong selection for the plateau environment adaptation.
