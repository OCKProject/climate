The ratio of nonsynonymous substitution rate (Ka) to synonymous substitution rate (Ks) is widely used as an indicator of selective pressure at the sequence level among different species. It is commonly accepted that Ka &gt; Ks, Ka = Ks, and Ka &lt; Ks generally indicate positive selection, neutral mutation, and negative selection, respectively [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>]. To calculate Ka, Ks and Ka/Ks, a model averaging method was selected. This method includes 14 different models for calculation and derived the average values for Ka, Ks, and Ka/Ks [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>]. The genetic code selected was the ‘vertebrate mitochondrial code’. To further study the selective pressure acted on each protein-coding gene in the genus 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span>, CodeML in PAMLX software [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>] was used to find sites under strong selective pressure. The secondary structure analysis of amino acid was performed by using an online software TOPCONS [
