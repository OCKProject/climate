 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The PCRs were performed under the following conditions, 2 min initial denaturation at 93°C, 40 cycles of: 10 s denaturation at 92°C, 30 s annealing at 58–53°C, 10 min elongation at 68°C in the preliminary 20 cycles, and 10 s denaturation at 92°C, 30 s annealing at 53°C, and 10 min elongation at 68°C with 20 s per cycle added to the elongation step in the succeeding 20 cycles, and finally an extension for 7 min at 68°C. The amplifications were performed in 15 μL reactions containing 2.4 μL of 2.5 mM dNTPs, 2.1 μL of each primer at 10 μΜ, 1.5 μl of 10× LA PCR Buffer I (Mg
  <span class="sup">2+</span>-free), 1.5 μL of 25 mM MgCl
  <sub>2</sub>, 1 μL of DNA template, 0.18 μL of 5 U/μl LA Taq polymerase (Takara, Dalian, China) and 4.22 μL ddH
  <sub>2</sub>O.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sequences of the primers used for PCR amplification and sequencing of the mitochondrial genes were obtained from Sorenson (2003) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>] with minor changes (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). The mitogenome of 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> was amplified in seven parts and the gaps were bridged using other adjacent primers. The PCR products were purified using the DNA Agarose Gel Extraction Kit (Bioteke, Beijing, China) after separation by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel. After separation and purification, the PCR products were sequenced by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai) Co., LTD. using the Primer-Walking method. The 
  <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span> mitogenomes were amplified in 12 or 13 fragments, and sequencing was performed using the Illumina Hiseq2000 high-throughput sequencing system of Shenzhen Huada Gene Technology Co., LTD. The gaps in the assembly after high-throughput sequencing were filled in by direct sequencing using the ABI 3730 DNA sequencer by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai) Co., LTD., using adjacent PCR primers.
