 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similar to previously sequenced mitogenomes, the genomes sequenced in this study contain 2 rRNA genes encoding the small and large rRNA subunits, which are located between 
  <span class="italic">trnF</span> and 
  <span class="italic">trnL(UUR)</span> and separated by the 
  <span class="italic">trnV</span> gene. The lengths and A + T contents of the 
  <span class="italic">rrnS</span> and 
  <span class="italic">rrnL</span> in the 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> genomes are within the range observed in other Phasianidae species. The rrnS contains three domains with 46 predicted stems, and the rrnL contains six domains with 59 stems (Additional files 
  <a rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM4">4</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM5">5</a>). The secondary structures of the rrnS in 
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> are identical; the rrnL secondary structures differ by only 2 bp in length. However, there are many differences in the rrnL secondary structures among the four 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> species, specifically in the loop near stem 44, which contains several substitutions and indels.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The complete mitogenome sequence contains 22 interspersed tRNA genes. All the tRNA sequences have the potential to fold into typical cloverleaf secondary structures except for 
  <span class="italic">trnS(AGY)</span>, which lacks the DHU arm (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM6">6</a>). The secondary structures of 
  <span class="italic">trnF</span>, 
  <span class="italic">trnL(UUR)</span>, 
  <span class="italic">trnQ</span>, 
  <span class="italic">trnM</span>, 
  <span class="italic">trnC</span>, 
  <span class="italic">trnY</span>, 
  <span class="italic">trnS(UCN)</span>, 
  <span class="italic">trnH</span>, 
  <span class="italic">trnL(CUN)</span>, 
  <span class="italic">trnT</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">trnP</span> are relatively conserved. However, the structure of 
  <span class="italic">trnS(AGY)</span> is different in 
  <span class="italic">C. auritum</span> relative to the other three 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> species (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM6">6</a>); the structure in 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span>, 
  <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span> contain two additional bases (G and A) in the amino acid acceptor arm. The most frequent mismatch is G-U; other mismatches are also present, including U-U in 
  <span class="italic">trnM</span> and 
  <span class="italic">trnG</span>, C-C in 
  <span class="italic">trnD</span> and 
  <span class="italic">trnL(UUR)</span>, C-U in 
  <span class="italic">trnF</span> and 
  <span class="italic">trnI</span>, and A-C in 
  <span class="italic">trnS(AGY)</span>. The 
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> tRNA structures are almost identical, with the exception of 1 bp. The A + T content of the tRNA genes is 57.6% in 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span>, 57.4% in 
  <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. auritum</span>.
