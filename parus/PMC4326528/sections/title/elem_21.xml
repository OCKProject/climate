   <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> species
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, the phylogenetic trees based on different datasets support the monophyly of 
   <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> and the close genetic relationships of 
   <span class="italic">C. auritum</span> and 
   <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span> [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>], 
   <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> and 
   <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span> [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>]. Our analysis of the gene sequences of 
   <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> based on different datasets confirms that 
   <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> is the sister group to 
   <span class="italic">Lophura</span> [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>], indicating their closer relationship.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The genetic distance is rather small among some 
   <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> species, for instance, between 
   <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> and 
   <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span>, 
   <span class="italic">C. auritum</span> and 
   <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span>. Morphological, ecological and behavioural studies have revealed the high similarity between 
   <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> and 
   <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span>, but with different plumage coloration [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]. Their distributions are overlapping, and 
   <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> routinely hybridises with 
   <span class="italic">C. c. drouynii</span> [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>], which indicates their reproductive compatibility. Furthermore, the distribution of 
   <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> is limited between the Himalayan and Nyenchen Tanglha ranges, which provided the geographical isolation required for the formation of a subspecies or species. Therefore, the taxonomic status and its relationship to 
   <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span> are much questionable, which need to be re-evaluated by multiple markers and population genetics in the further studies.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on their significant differences in many aspects such as morphology and behaviour, 
   <span class="italic">C. auritum</span> and 
   <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span> are commonly considered to be independent species. However, the genetic distance of 0.002 indicates that they have a much closer genetic relationship. Consistent with this observation, Tsam et al. (2003) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>] observed that the interspecific differentiation between 
   <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span> and 
   <span class="italic">C. auritum</span> (0.18%) is less than the degree of differentiation among the 
   <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span> subspecies.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some Phasianidae species were found in the Pliocene epoch, and several modern taxa had already appeared in the Quaternary Pleistocene. The earliest fossils of 
   <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> were found in the Cenozoic Zhoukoudian strata of Beijing, and in the Pleistocene strata at Yanjinggou in Wanxian of Sichuan Prov. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>]. The evolution of 
   <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> mainly occurred corresponding to the Tibetan Plateau intensive uplift during the Tertiary Pliocene and the alternation of the glacial and interglacial periods in the Quaternary, which created profound and complex changes in the geographical and ecological environments [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>] and was thought to have greatly affected its topography and avian species diversification [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>]. Based on our results, the spliting time between 
   <span class="italic">C. harmani</span>-
   <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span> and 
   <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span>-
   <span class="italic">C. auritum</span> is consistent with the uplift during the Tertiary Pliocene and the fossil record in the Sichuan Wanxian Yanjinggou Pleistocene strata, which is approximate to the divergence times estimated by Jiang et al. (2014) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>] (3.78 Mya, 95% HPD = 1.17-6.56 Mya). Our study shows that 
   <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span> and 
   <span class="italic">C. auritum</span> are relatively ancient groups, while 
   <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> and 
   <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span> diverged later; these observations are not consistent with the 
   <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> evolution hypothesis proposed by Lu et al. (1998) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lu et al. (1998) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>] suggested that the ancestor of 
   <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span> and 
   <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> originated in Sichuan Prov., Yunnan Prov., and the Tibetan border area. They noted that the clade containing the 
   <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> plesiomorphy migrated to the hinterland plateau and subsequently differentiated into the ancestor of 
   <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> and 
   <span class="italic">C. auritum</span>. The ancestor of 
   <span class="italic">C. auritum</span> dispersed in the northern plateau, and differentiated into 
   <span class="italic">C. auritum</span> and 
   <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span>. Based on the divergence time and distribution characteristics of 
   <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> species, our results support the ancestor of 
   <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> was initially distributed in Sichuan Prov., Yunnan Prov., and the Tibetan border area. The 
   <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> first diverged into the ancestor of 
   <span class="italic">C. harmani</span>-
   <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span> and the ancestor of 
   <span class="italic">C. auritum</span>-
   <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span>. Considering the geographical distribution of 
   <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>-
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">66</a>], we propose that the ancestor of 
   <span class="italic">C. harmani</span>-
   <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span> might migrated to platform of the plateau, and then splitted into two lineages during the last uplift of the Tibetan Plateau [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>], one adapted the high altitude environment to form 
   <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> in east Tibet, and the other evoluted into 
   <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon,</span> while the ancestor of 
   <span class="italic">C. auritum</span>-
   <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span> dispersed to the northern plateau and further differentiated nearly the same period with 
   <span class="italic">C. harmani</span>-
   <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span>.

   <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> species
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Ka/Ks values in most protein-coding genes are less than 1 (Ka is lower than Ks) with P-values less than 0.001, which indicates that these genes in

   <span class="italic">C.cro</span>,

   <span class="italic">C.aur</span> and 
   <span class="italic">C.cro</span>-
   <span class="italic">C.aur</span> are similar. The Ka/Ks value of the 
   <span class="italic">atp8</span> gene is 50 in five groups except for 
   <span class="italic">C.har</span>-
   <span class="italic">C.cro</span>, which reveals the strong positive selection. However, only the P-value for 
   <span class="italic">C.man</span>-
   <span class="italic">C.aur</span> is far less than 0.01 (P = 0), which indicates significant differences. In contrast, the Ka/Ks values of the

   <span class="italic">C.har</span>-
   <span class="italic">C.cro</span> are 50 with P-values less than 0.001, which also indicates strong positive selection. Previous studies have shown that 
   <span class="italic">atp6</span> gene is highly variable in the mitogenomes of humans living in extremely cold areas [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">68</a>-
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">71</a>], the 
   <span class="italic">atp6</span> gene faces strong selection pressure with increasing altitude [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">72</a>], and the variation of 
   <span class="italic">atp6</span> gene in 
   <span class="italic">Artemia tibetiana</span> is the result of adaptation to the cold and hypoxic environment of the plateau [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">73</a>]. The variation in 
   <span class="italic">atp6</span> may reflect the adaptation of 
   <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> to the plateau environment; 
   <span class="italic">cytb</span> might also play an important role in this process. The 
   <span class="italic">atp8</span> gene in 
   <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span> and 
   <span class="italic">C. auritum</span> may also have experienced a strong selection in adaption to the plateau environment.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, the further study showed that only four amino acid sites of atp8 in the 
   <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> are positively selected sites, and accordingly this gene may have experienced strong selective pressure for plateau adaptation. The corresponding TM-helix (IN- &gt; OUT) or outside position might be important for the 
   <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> adaptation. After discarding groups (
   <span class="italic">C.har</span>-
   <span class="italic">C.cro</span> and 
   <span class="italic">C.man</span>-
   <span class="italic">C.aur</span>) and genes (
   <span class="italic">cox1</span>, 
   <span class="italic">atp8</span> and 
   <span class="italic">nad4l</span>) with obviously different Ka/Ks values to others, the average value (0.0431) is similar with the strongly locomotive group (0.04) in the study of Shen et al. (2009) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">74</a>], which indicates the 
   <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> accumulates fewer nonsynonymous mutations and is corresponding to their strong running ability.
