  <span class="italic">C. auritum</span> with 
  <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> with 
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span> form two pairs of sister groups. The genetic distance between 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span> is far less than the interspecific distance and is close to the intraspecific distance of 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span>, indicating that 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> is much more closely related to 
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span>. Our mito-phylogenomic analysis supports the monophyly of 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> and its closer relationship with 
  <span class="italic">Lophura</span>. The uplift of Tibetan Plateau is suggested to impact the divergence between 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span>-
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span> clade and 
  <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span>-
  <span class="italic">C. auritum</span> clade during the Tertiary Pliocene. 
  <span class="italic">Atp8</span> gene in the 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> species might have experienced a strong selective pressure for adaptation to the plateau environment.
