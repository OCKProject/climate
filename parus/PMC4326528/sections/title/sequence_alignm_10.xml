 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Along with the entire mitogenomes obtained in this study, 42 Galliformes sequences were used in the phylogenetic analysis, including two outgroups (
  <span class="italic">Numida meleagris</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Alectura lathami</span>). The DNA sequences of the other species used in the phylogenetic analyses were downloaded from GenBank (the accession numbers and key information are shown in Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">2</a>). The tRNA and rRNA genes and the CR were individually aligned using ClustalX 1.83 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>] with the default settings. All 13 protein-coding genes were translated into amino acids, and then aligned using MEGA 4.1 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>] with default parameters for each gene, and finally retranslated into nucleotide sequences.
