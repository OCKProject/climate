 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The complete mitogenomes of 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span>, 
  <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span> are 16682 bp, 16690 bp and 16680 bp in length, respectively, encoding a standard set of 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, and a putative control region. 
  <span class="italic">C. auritum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span> are more closely related genetically, whereas 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span> is more closely related to 
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon. Crossoptilon</span> has a closer relationship with 
  <span class="italic">Lophura</span>, and the following phylogenetic relationship was reconstructed: ((
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> + 
  <span class="italic">Lophura</span>) + (
  <span class="italic">Phasianus</span> + 
  <span class="italic">Chrysolophus</span>)). The divergence time between the clades 
  <span class="italic">C. harmani</span>-
  <span class="italic">C. crossoptilon</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. mantchuricum</span>-
  <span class="italic">C. auritum</span> is consistent with the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau during the Tertiary Pliocene. The Ka/Ks analysis showed that 
  <span class="italic">atp8</span> gene in the 
  <span class="italic">Crossoptilon</span> likely experienced a strong selective pressure in adaptation to the plateau environment.
