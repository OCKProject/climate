The 1000 replicates bootstrap support was also performed in the ML analysis. Bayesian analysis with Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling was run for 1000000 generations saving a tree every 100 generations, with one cold and three heated chains, and the burn-in time was determined by the time to convergence of the likelihood scores.
