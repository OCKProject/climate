While numerous studies support a role for circulating T in promoting the production of song in male birds, this understanding is based primarily on evidence from seasonally breeding northern temperate species, leaving it unclear whether this mechanism generalizes to other regions of the world. Here we investigate whether variation in circulating levels of T can explain the marked within- and among-individual variation in male song performance observed in a subtropical population of the year-round territorial white-browed sparrow weaver (<italic>Plocepasser mahali mahali</italic>). Our findings reveal that both circulating T and male song production peaked at a similar time point, halfway through the population-level breeding season. However, while dominant males were more likely to sing and sang for longer than subordinate males, within-group paired comparisons revealed no dominance-related differences in circulating T. Moreover, comparisons both among and within individual dominant males revealed that song duration, syllable rate and proportion of time spent singing were all unrelated to circulating T. Together, our findings suggest that natural variation in male song production, at least in this population of white-browed sparrow weavers, is achieved principally through mechanisms other than variation in circulating T concentration. More widely, our results are in line with the view that male song production is not exclusively regulated by gonadally synthesized steroids.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kg005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Tropical endocrinology</kwd><kwd>Sexual signalling</kwd><kwd>Circulating testosterone</kwd><kwd>Seasonality</kwd><kwd>Dominance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Male vertebrates produce a wide variety of sexually selected behaviours to repel rivals or attract mates and a central question in evolutionary endocrinology is whether the mechanisms that regulate the expression of such behaviours are conserved or divergent across species (<xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">Hau, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Hau et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">Hau et al., 2010</xref>). In particular, the circulating androgen testosterone (T) has been a key focus of research seeking to understand how male sexual signalling behaviours are regulated (<xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">Ball, 1999</xref>, <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">Fusani, 2008</xref>, <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">Garamszegi et al., 2008</xref>). While there is a weight of evidence supporting a fundamental role for circulating T in male sexual signalling behaviour, there has been a significant bias towards northern temperate zones in the species studied (<xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">Garamszegi et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">Goymann et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Hau et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="b0335" ref-type="bibr">Wingfield et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Fundamental differences in life-history traits between temperate and tropical birds have long been recognised (<xref rid="b0270" ref-type="bibr">Stutchbury and Morton, 2008</xref>, <xref rid="b9005" ref-type="bibr">Macedo and Machado, 2013</xref>). Recent research also suggests that the underlying physiological mechanisms associated with life-history trade-offs exhibit similar latitudinal contrasts (<xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">Garamszegi et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">Owen-Ashley et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="b0330" ref-type="bibr">Wingfield et al., 2007</xref>). Together, this evidence has led to the generalisation that birds in the tropics exhibit a slower &#x02018;pace of life&#x02019; than their temperate counterparts (<xref rid="b0315" ref-type="bibr">Wikelski et al., 2003</xref>) and indicates the importance of considering latitudinal contrasts when investigating the evolution of endocrine mechanisms in the context of life-history theory (<xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">Hau, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">Hau et al., 2010</xref>). Despite their potential value, however, detailed empirical investigations of the role of circulating T in regulating investment in sexually selected behaviours remain rare for tropical species and rarer still from those inhabiting the subtropics (<xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Hau et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Early studies of circulating T in tropical passerines revealed average circulating T concentrations an order of magnitude lower than those of temperate birds (<xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">Levin and Wingfield, 1992</xref>, <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">Hau, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Hau et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">Hau et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, circulating T levels remain low throughout the breeding season in many tropical species, whereas temperate species typically exhibit testosterone peaks during a brief breeding window (<xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">Levin and Wingfield, 1992</xref>, <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">Hunt et al., 1995</xref>, <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Hau et al., 2000</xref>, <xref rid="b0315" ref-type="bibr">Wikelski et al., 2003</xref>); a limited number of within-species comparisons support this latitudinal pattern (<xref rid="b0240" ref-type="bibr">R&#x000f6;dl et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">Goymann et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="b0330" ref-type="bibr">Wingfield et al., 2007</xref>; but see: <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">Ryder et al., 2011</xref>). While numerous potential ecological drivers of latitudinal patterns have been proposed (<xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">Cardillo, 2002</xref>, <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">Garamszegi et al., 2008</xref>), key among these with regard to circulating T may be the extent of seasonality in territorial behaviour and its implications for seasonal patterns of social instability (<xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">Hunt et al., 1995</xref>). Many temperate species are exposed to brief windows of intense intra-sexual conflict over access to mates and territory establishment, and circulating T is thought to play a key role in upregulating these behaviours (such as male song production and aggression) during these periods (<xref rid="b0320" ref-type="bibr">Wingfield, 2012</xref>). By contrast, tropical and subtropical zones may include a higher proportion of year-round territorial species and this lifestyle may be associated with different seasonal patterns in circulating T (but see: <xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">Ryder et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Male bird song is one of the most extensively studied vertebrate sexual signalling systems, both in the laboratory and in ecologically relevant contexts, and therefore provides an excellent opportunity for latitudinal contrasts (<xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">Ball, 1999</xref>, <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Catchpole and Slater, 2008</xref>, <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">Gahr, 2014</xref>). Correlative evidence from wild temperate birds indicates that population-level elevations in circulating T in spring are coincident with population-level elevated song expression (<xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Foerster et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="b0285" ref-type="bibr">Van Duyse et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, experimental manipulations have revealed that artificially induced variation in circulating T levels can indeed influence the production of song by males in both laboratory and wild birds (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Similarly, studies that experimentally inhibited T reception have largely shown the opposite effect of reducing song production (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, demonstrating that song production is altered by manipulating circulating T and/or T reception does not, in isolation, confirm that natural variation in song production is actually achieved in the wild through variation in the levels of circulating T, given that plausible alternative mechanisms exist (<xref rid="b0265" ref-type="bibr">Soma et al., 2008</xref>). It is therefore important to also investigate whether natural within- and among-male variation in song production is predicted by natural variation in circulating T in wild populations. While rather fewer studies have investigated this association during breeding periods, there is some evidence of positive correlations between circulating T and song from wild populations of northern temperate birds (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). There is, however, a conspicuous lack of similar studies investigating the link between circulating T and song production in wild populations of tropical and subtropical songbirds (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigate whether natural variation in circulating T predicts natural variation in male solo song production in a subtropical population of wild white-browed sparrow weavers (<italic>Plocepasser mahali)</italic>; a year-round territorial songbird that is distributed across sub-Saharan Africa. White-browed sparrow weavers live in cooperatively breeding groups of 2&#x02013;12 individuals, in which a dominant female entirely monopolises maternity, a dominant male largely monopolises paternity (12&#x02013;18% of paternity is lost exclusively to extra-group dominant males), and subordinates of both sexes help to rear their young (<xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">Harrison et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">Harrison et al., 2013b</xref>). Males produce solo song at dawn during the breeding season almost exclusively at dawn (<xref rid="b0310" ref-type="bibr">Voigt et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="b0340" ref-type="bibr">York, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="b0345" ref-type="bibr">York et al., 2014</xref>). Previous studies of this species suggest that the mean circulating T concentrations of males may vary in relation to latitude, as while very low mean circulating T concentrations were first reported in a tropical subspecies (<italic>P. m. pectoralis</italic>, Northern Zambia; <xref rid="b0325" ref-type="bibr">Wingfield et al., 1991</xref>), higher concentrations were found in a population of the more southerly subspecies (<italic>P. m. mahali,</italic> Southern Zimbabwe; <xref rid="b0305" ref-type="bibr">Voigt and Leitner, 2013</xref>). Studies of the latter sub-species suggest that circulating T does play a role in the development and initial expression of male solo song production, based on the stimulatory effect of experimentally induced T elevation in females (<xref rid="b0305" ref-type="bibr">Voigt and Leitner, 2013</xref>), and have revealed pronounced dominance-related differences in male solo song production (subordinate males were not known to sing in the Zimbabwean population; <xref rid="b0310" ref-type="bibr">Voigt et al., 2007</xref>). Whether these dominance-related differences in solo song production are associated with dominance-related differences in circulating T remains unclear, as dominance-related differences in T have been detected in the more northerly subspecies for which solo song studies are lacking (<xref rid="b0325" ref-type="bibr">Wingfield et al., 1991</xref>) but were less clear in studies of the more southerly subspecies in which these song patterns were recorded (<xref rid="b0305" ref-type="bibr">Voigt and Leitner, 2013</xref>, <xref rid="b0310" ref-type="bibr">Voigt et al., 2007</xref>). The matched sampling of T levels and solo song production is required to establish whether the marked among and within-individual variation in male song production in this species is indeed associated with natural variation in their circulating levels of T.</p><p>Specifically, we test three sets of predictions that would be made if male solo song production was regulated by variation in circulating T in a concentration-dependent manner. We do so using our subtropical South African study population of <italic>P. m. mahali</italic>, which lies at a more southerly latitude than both the Zambian and Zimbabwean populations studied to date (see above). First, we investigate whether the circulating T levels and solo song production of dominant males show comparable patterns of temporal variation over the course of the breeding season (as has been reported in temperate birds; <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Foerster et al., 2002</xref>). Second, we investigate whether dominant and subordinate males in this most-southerly population also differ in their solo song production characteristics and whether such differences are mirrored by dominance-related differences in circulating T. Third, we investigate whether natural variation in the circulating T levels of dominant males predicts natural variation in their solo song performance characteristics (performance duration, syllable rate and proportion time spent singing) using both among- and within-male contrasts.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>General methods</title><p>This field study was conducted between October 2010 and April 2011 in the context of a long-term project monitoring a population of over 40 cooperatively breeding groups of white-browed sparrow weavers at the Tswalu Kalahari Reserve, South Africa (27&#x000b0;15&#x02032; S, 22&#x000b0;26&#x02032; E, elevation: 1195&#x000a0;m; see <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> for species geographic range).

Males were identified during the dawn chorus using their ring combination and a black dye mark applied to feathers on the lower abdomens of dominant males during routine captures.

The dawn solo song performance typically begins in the roost chamber and the male then emerges to continue singing around the territory from one or more song perches, until the performance ends shortly before sunrise. Performance &#x0201c;start time&#x0201d; was defined as the time at which the first notes of dawn song were produced, and performance &#x0201c;end time&#x0201d; as the time at which the last notes of dawn song were produced. Total &#x0201c;performance duration&#x0201d; was calculated as the difference between these times. Males were continuously observed from their performance start time (typically in the roost chamber) until they could be visually identified using their colour rings and feather dye mark and any occasions where male identity could not be confirmed were excluded from the analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><label>2.3</label><title>Song file recordings and song analysis</title><p>Recordings of pre-emergence song (song produced prior to the male&#x02019;s emergence from his roost chamber) were made from within 10&#x000a0;m of the male, using a Sennheiser ME66 directional microphone with a K6 power module (2004 Sennheiser), and a Marantz PMD660 solid-state recorder (D&#x00026;M Holdings Inc.). Avisoft-SASLab Pro 5.1.16 (R. Specht, Berlin, Germany) was used to generate spectrograms (Hamming window, FFT of 1024 points, time resolution of 5.8&#x000a0;ms and 50% overlap). We focused our attention on song performance characteristics that previous studies have most commonly found to be impacted by the manipulation or blockade of circulating T (see <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for examples). Male song has a variable structure that consists of syllables produced either alone or arranged in phrases (see <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> for an example; <xref rid="b0310" ref-type="bibr">Voigt et al., 2007</xref>). &#x0201c;Syllable rate&#x0201d; (number of syllables/min) and &#x0201c;proportion of time spent singing&#x0201d; (cumulative duration of syllables) were calculated for the 5-min sample period following the performance start time (during which time the male remained within his roost chamber). This sample period was selected as a standard time point during the song performance for contrasts within and between males, and because males were guaranteed to be stationary during this period, ensuring that the quality of recording files was consistent.</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><label>2.4</label><title>Capture and blood sampling</title><p>Captures were conducted at night, prior to the dawn chorus, whilst the males were in their roost chambers, by flushing them into a customised catching net (SAFRING license 1444). Males could not be caught at dawn as they were highly sensitive to disturbance immediately before and during song production. Therefore, to avoid effects of capture on our assessments of male song characteristics, males were captured for blood sampling on the night following their matched dawn song recording session. A blood sample was taken from the brachial vein with a 26&#x000a0;g needle (approx. 160&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l whole blood was collected). All samples were collected rapidly following capture (duration from initiation of capture to the end of sample collection: mean&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5.8 8 2.4&#x000a0;min) and the capture-to-bleed lag duration was never found to be significant in the analyses of circulating T (see Results), therefore it is unlikely that capture stress induced a rapid increase in testosterone that would influence our findings (<xref rid="b0295" ref-type="bibr">Van Hout et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">Deviche et al., 2012</xref>). Blood sample collection took place between 20:00 and 05:00; time of sampling (the time elapsed since sunset, to standardise for effects of seasonal variation in day length) was never found to be significant in the analyses of circulating T (see Results). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in T concentrations between a set of blood samples collected from dominant males on three evenings (21:00 &#x02013; midnight; n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;9 males; T concentration mean&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.90 8 0.64&#x000a0;ng/ml) and a set of samples collected on the three ensuing dawns before the dawn chorus (03:00&#x02013;05:00, n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10 males, T concentration mean&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;SD 8 0.58&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.28&#x000a0;ng/ml; Welch two sample <italic>t</italic>-test: t&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.35, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.20).

Repeated measures of groups and individuals were controlled for as required, by fitting group and individual identity as random terms, as detailed below. The residuals were checked for normality and homoscedasticity, and if they did not meet these assumptions the response terms were transformed to resolve this (see details below).</p><p>For each of the five main models detailed below, each data point was attributed a &#x02018;season day&#x02019;, with season day 1 being October 1st 2010. Season day was fitted as both a quadratic (abbreviated to: season day<sup>2</sup>) and a linear (season day) term, to allow for the predicted curved relationship between the date during the season and the two response terms (circulating T and song production). Wherever season day<sup>2</sup> proved significant, both the quadratic and the linear term were retained in the model (<xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">Crawley, 2007</xref>).</p><sec id="s0045"><label>2.6.1</label><title>Does song production vary in relation to dominance status and timing during season?</title><p>A generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) with binomial error was used to investigate the probability of dawn song production by dominant and subordinate males. On 216 mornings over the course of the breeding season (October to April), and at a total of 24 social groups that contained one or more adult subordinate males (&#x0003e;1&#x000a0;year old) at the time of sampling, it was determined whether the dominant male sang (binomial response: 0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;did not sing; 1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;sang) and whether one or more subordinate males in the group sang (0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;did not sing; 1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;one or more sang).

All measures of circulating T and dawn song performance characteristics were collected on the same day for a given male (dawn song in the morning, with capture for blood sampling on the ensuing night; see above).

We conducted two within-male analyses for each of the three song parameters (performance duration, syllable rate and proportion of time spent singing).

Male song production and circulating T varied in a comparable way with timing in the breeding season, as has been reported for northern temperate species (<xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Foerster et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="b0285" ref-type="bibr">Van Duyse et al., 2003</xref>), but in contrast to the seasonal decoupling of male dawn song and circulating T observed in an equatorial songbird (<xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">Quispe et al., 2016</xref>). However, dominant males were more likely to sing than subordinate males in all months of sampling and sang longer performances than their subordinates in paired within-group comparisons that rule out social environment and territory confounds, despite having comparable levels of circulating T to subordinates in both population-wide and again, in paired within-group comparisons. We also found no evidence that natural variation in the focal song performance characteristics of dominant males (performance duration, syllable rate and proportion of time spent singing) were predicted by their levels of circulating T in either among- or within-individual comparisons. Together these findings suggest that the natural variation in male song performance observed in this population is not achieved principally via variation in circulating T concentration.</p><p>Our results contrast with those from a previous study of a more northerly population of this subspecies in Zimbabwe, in which subordinates were never documented to sing and did show significantly lower levels of circulating T than dominants (<xref rid="b0305" ref-type="bibr">Voigt and Leitner, 2013</xref>); though not in all studies (<xref rid="b0310" ref-type="bibr">Voigt et al., 2007</xref>). All of the findings to-date for this species are consistent with T playing a role in song <italic>acquisition</italic> and <italic>seasonal onset</italic> of song expression. First, circulating T concentrations and song production rise in tandem at the start of the breeding season (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, this paper). Second, experimentally-induced T elevations are sufficient to induce the production of male solo song by females (<xref rid="b0305" ref-type="bibr">Voigt and Leitner, 2013</xref>). Third, subordinate males have lower circulating T levels than dominants in the population in which subordinates never produce song (the Zimbabwean population; <xref rid="b0310" ref-type="bibr">Voigt et al., 2007</xref>) but comparable T levels to dominants in the population in which subordinates do produce song (our South African population; this study). However, our findings that (i) dominants exceeded subordinates in both the probability and duration of song despite having comparable levels of circulating T, and (ii) that natural variation in the circulating T levels of dominant males did not predict variation in any of the focal song metrics in either among- or within-male comparisons, are not consistent with the hypothesis that variation in circulating T concentration is the key regulator of <italic>within- and across-male variation</italic> in song performance in this species.</p><p>It is conceivable, despite the weight of evidence from both among- and within-individual comparisons in the current study, that circulating T and song output actually are correlated in our study population and that this correlation was not detected because we could not catch males to sample circulating T actually while they were producing song. However, failure to detect such a correlation cannot be readily attributed to circadian variation in mean T levels between the time of song production and blood sampling, as we found no evidence of a systematic change in circulating T levels with sample timing while males were roosting overnight, and the circulating T levels of males sampled in the late evening were comparable to those of males sampled on the following dawn (prior to dawn song production). Consistent circadian variation in T was also not found in previous studies of this species (<xref rid="b0325" ref-type="bibr">Wingfield et al., 1991</xref>, <xref rid="b0310" ref-type="bibr">Voigt et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, previous studies of other species have managed to identify positive correlations between circulating T and song production characteristics, despite time lags ranging from 24&#x000a0;h up to 14&#x000a0;days between song sampling and blood sampling (<xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Foerster et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">Galeotti et al., 1997</xref>, <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">Johnsen, 1998</xref>). Consequently, while it is difficult to rule out comprehensively a role for circulating T in regulating song output, our findings certainly suggest a need to consider additional and/or alternative mechanisms that may account for variation in song production.</p><p>It is possible that the observed variation in male song production and performance characteristics in our population may be attributable to variation in other components of T-mediated endocrine pathways such as hormone receptor densities. There could be among-individual variation in the densities of T (and/or E2) receptors in relevant brain areas, leading to individual variation in sensitivity to circulating T and thus the effectiveness of circulating T in enhancing song production. For example, if dominant males had more numerous T receptors in the brain centres (HVC, RA) associated with song production this might account for their higher levels of song production despite comparable levels of circulating T. It is therefore notable that a previous study of the Zimbabwean population of this subspecies found that <italic>subordinate</italic> males actually had higher mRNA expression levels for both androgen receptor (AR) and oestrogen receptor (ER) in their HVCs, than dominant males (despite no difference in HVC cell density between the classes), running counter to the rank-related pattern that might otherwise have been expected (<xref rid="b0310" ref-type="bibr">Voigt et al., 2007</xref>). Although, it is important to note that mRNA levels are not always strong predictors of final protein levels and receptor expression density (<xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">Gygi et al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">Quispe et al., 2016</xref>). Our within-male comparisons also failed to detect correlations between within-male changes in circulating T and within-male changes in song production characteristics over time, suggesting that reconciling our findings with a key role for circulating T would require one not only to invoke among-male differences in key components of endocrine pathways (such as T receptor levels), but also within-male changes in such components over time. Indeed, in equatorial silver-beaked tanagers (<italic>Ramphocelus carbo</italic>) seasonality in song expression appears to be associated with seasonality in androgen receptor expression in HVC, although within-individual changes in AR expression remain to be demonstrated (<xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">Quispe et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Perhaps a more likely explanation for the absence of any relationship between circulating T and dominance status-related song production is that more complex mechanisms than a simple positive effect of circulating T underlie the regulation of male song behaviour in this species (<xref rid="b0265" ref-type="bibr">Soma et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">London et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, castration studies have demonstrated that a number of aspects of singing behaviour are not under control of circulating testosterone alone, for example in male European starlings non-courtship song does not appear to be regulated by testosterone while courtship song is (<xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">Pinxten et al., 2002</xref>). At least two key additional mechanisms could be at play. First, circulating T (and other circulating androgens) can be locally converted to oestrogen, by aromatase, which may then regulate the expression of song behaviour by binding to oestrogen receptors in the brain (<xref rid="b0265" ref-type="bibr">Soma et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="b0235" ref-type="bibr">Remage-Healey et al., 2009</xref>). Such an indirect mechanism of action by circulating T could explain our findings, if marked variation in aromatase expression and/or oestrogen reception existed both among and within males. Indeed, such a mechanism would also be consistent with the findings of the many experiments in which manipulating circulating T impacts song production in temperate birds (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), because increasing circulating T would also be expected to alter local oestrogen concentrations within target cells if aromatase expression levels remained unchanged. Second, testosterone and other steroids are also locally synthesised in the brain, via neurosteroidogenesis, and so the actual concentration of a given steroid to which receptors are exposed may reflect a combination of steroids that originate both centrally and peripherally (<xref rid="b0265" ref-type="bibr">Soma et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">London et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">Remage-Healey et al., 2010</xref>). Together, a key role for these neuroendocrine mechanisms in the regulation of song production could readily account for the lack of an evident relationship between circulating T concentrations and song production in this and other studies.</p><p>As comparatively few studies (even of temperate species) have considered the role that these alternative neuroendocrine mechanisms may play in the regulation of song production (<xref rid="b0260" ref-type="bibr">Soma et al., 1999</xref>, <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">Cordes et al., 2014</xref>), it is still too early to assess whether the endocrine or neuroendocrine basis for regulating the production of male song is conserved or divergent across songbird species worldwide. Nevertheless, it is notable that the experimental elevation of circulating T in non-temperate superb fairy wrens (<italic>Malurus cyaneus</italic>) did not result in greater song production relative to controls (<xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">Peters, 2002</xref>), a pattern that contrasts with the typical outcome of this manipulation in temperate birds (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). While both superb fairy wrens and white-browed sparrow weavers are cooperative breeders, it is more likely that the lack of response to circulating T manipulation in superb fairy wrens is due to latitudinal variation in the role of circulating T in relation to song production, given that white-browed sparrow weavers are cooperative breeders throughout their range, but circulating T varies with latitude in this species (see <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), providing a a potential system for more detailed latitudinal contrasts in future. However, on closer inspection, it is also notable that the evidence for relationships between natural song production and circulating T even in temperate species is mixed (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), highlighting the possibility that the alternative neuroendocrine mechanisms outlined above could conceivably play a wider role in the regulation of song production even in temperate species than is currently widely appreciated. Future studies of song regulation in wild birds might therefore fruitfully combine both correlative analysis of the relationship between natural circulating T and song production with refined experimental manipulations, in an attempt to tease apart the relative contributions of central and peripheral sources of androgens and oestrogens to the regulation of male song production.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b0005"><element-citation publication-type="book" id="h0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ball</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name></person-group><chapter-title>Neuroendocrine basis of seasonal changes in vocal behavior among songbirds</chapter-title><source>The Design of Animal Communication</source><year>1999</year><publisher-name>MIT Press</publisher-name><publisher-loc>Cambridge MA</publisher-loc><fpage>213</fpage><lpage>253</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="b0010"><element-citation publication-type="book" id="h0010"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bates</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Maechler</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Dai</surname><given-names>B.</given-names></name></person-group><chapter-title>lme4: linear mixed-effects models using S4 classes.
