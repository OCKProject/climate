  <p>(a) Song production by dominant and subordinate males across the breeding season (commencing 1st October 2010) showing the probability that one or more subordinate males (solid grey line), and the probability that the dominant male (solid black line), in a group sang on a given morning, dashed lines indicate 95% CIs (using GLMM predictions, based on data from 216 dawn observation sessions at 24 groups containing at least one subordinate male); (b) plasma testosterone concentration (square root-transformed) across the breeding season for subordinate (open circles, n = 61 samples from n = 37 males) and dominant males (black circles, n = 72 samples from n = 40 males; solid black line represents predictions from LMM, dashed lines represent 95% CIs).</p>
