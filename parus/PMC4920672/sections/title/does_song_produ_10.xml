 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Does song production vary in relation to dominance status and timing during season?</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) with binomial error was used to investigate the probability of dawn song production by dominant and subordinate males. On 216 mornings over the course of the breeding season (October to April), and at a total of 24 social groups that contained one or more adult subordinate males (&gt;1 year old) at the time of sampling, it was determined whether the dominant male sang (binomial response: 0 = did not sing; 1 = sang) and whether one or more subordinate males in the group sang (0 = did not sing; 1 = one or more sang). As such, the dataset for this analysis contained two lines per group per observation session, which were assigned a unique ‘session ID’ number; both ‘session ID’ and ‘group ID’ were included as random terms.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A paired analysis was also conducted to establish whether dominance status predicts dawn song performance duration. The performance durations of the dominant male and his singing subordinate male were calculated during the same dawn session (so as to control for variance in song production arising from either the day or location of sampling) for 10 social groups, where song performance duration was determined for both males.</p>
