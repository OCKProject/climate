 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Captures were conducted at night, prior to the dawn chorus, whilst the males were in their roost chambers, by flushing them into a customised catching net (SAFRING license 1444). Males could not be caught at dawn as they were highly sensitive to disturbance immediately before and during song production. Therefore, to avoid effects of capture on our assessments of male song characteristics, males were captured for blood sampling on the night following their matched dawn song recording session. A blood sample was taken from the brachial vein with a 26 g needle (approx. 160 μl whole blood was collected). All samples were collected rapidly following capture (duration from initiation of capture to the end of sample collection: mean ± SD = 5.8 8 2.4 min) and the capture-to-bleed lag duration was never found to be significant in the analyses of circulating T (see Results), therefore it is unlikely that capture stress induced a rapid increase in testosterone that would influence our findings (

Blood sample collection took place between 20:00 and 05:00; time of sampling (the time elapsed since sunset, to standardise for effects of seasonal variation in day length) was never found to be significant in the analyses of circulating T (see Results). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in T concentrations between a set of blood samples collected from dominant males on three evenings (21:00 – midnight; n = 9 males; T concentration mean ± SD = 0.90 8 0.64 ng/ml) and a set of samples collected on the three ensuing dawns before the dawn chorus (03:00–05:00, n = 10 males, T concentration mean ± SD 8 0.58 ± 0.28 ng/ml; Welch two sample 
  <span class="italic">t</span>-test: t = 1.35, p = 0.20). To allow paired comparisons of the T concentrations of dominant and subordinate males within the same group, blood samples were collected from both individuals on the same night. Whole blood samples were immediately separated in the field via centrifugation (12,000
  <span class="italic">g</span> for 3 min; Haematospin 1400; Hawksley Medical and Laboratory Equipment). The plasma was then drawn off and stored initially on ice (for 1–4 h), before being transferred to liquid nitrogen on return to the field base. The plasma samples were then shipped internationally on dry ice and stored at −80 °C until analysis five months later.
