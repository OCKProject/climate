 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Does circulating T predict song characteristics in dominant males?</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three LMMs were used to investigate whether a dominant male’s circulating T concentration predicts three performance characteristics of his solo song (performance duration, syllable rate and proportion of time spent singing). Syllable rate and proportion of time spent singing were square-root transformed prior to analysis. All measures of circulating T and dawn song performance characteristics were collected on the same day for a given male (dawn song in the morning, with capture for blood sampling on the ensuing night; see above). The models included the random term ‘individual ID’ to account for repeated measures of the same male.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The above analyses were conducted to establish whether among-individual variation in T levels predicts among-individual variation in song performance characteristics. We therefore conducted a complementary set of analyses to establish specifically whether natural within-individual variation in circulating T predicts within-individual variation in song performance characteristics, using a sub-sample of nine dominant males for which two sessions of matched dawn song and T measures had been collected within a fortnight of each other in the at the mid-point of the population-level breeding season (the period between season day 100–150). We conducted two within-male analyses for each of the three song parameters (performance duration, syllable rate and proportion of time spent singing). First, we conducted a paired comparison to establish whether the focal song performance characteristic was significantly higher on the day when the male showed their higher T concentration (of the two T measures taken for that male on the different sampling days) than on the day when the male showed their lower T concentration. Second, we conducted a linear regression to investigate whether the within-male change in circulating T from their first to their second sampled day predicted the within-male change in the focal song performance characteristic from the first to the second day.</p>
