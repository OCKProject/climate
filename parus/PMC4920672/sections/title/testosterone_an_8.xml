 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">T was extracted from the plasma following a previously validated protocol (
  <a rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0090">Goerlich et al., 2009</a>). Briefly, the samples were extracted twice using diethyl-petroleum ether, 70:30 (vol/vol), snap-frozen, dried under a stream of nitrogen and then stored in a −20 °C freezer until a single assay was conducted for all samples. T concentration was then determined via a single coated tube competitive-binding radioimmunoassay (Orion Diagnostica, Spectria: 68628; detection limit: 0.02 ng/ml; cross-reactivity: 100% with testosterone, 4.5% with 5α-dihydrotestosterone, 0.007% with androstenedione). The average recovery rate (81.7%) for T was calculated by counts of tritiated T (20 μl), which was added to the initial plasma sample before the extraction step. All T values were adjusted for the recovery rate for the focal sample. Pooled samples were used to create dilution curves so that parallelism could be confirmed, all samples were analysed in a single assay, and the intra-assay coefficient of variation was 3.03%.
