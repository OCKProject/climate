 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observation sessions began 2 h before sunrise, which is well before the earliest dawn song performance has been recorded to start in this population (
  <a rid="b0345" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0345">York et al., 2014</a>). The dawn solo song performance typically begins in the roost chamber and the male then emerges to continue singing around the territory from one or more song perches, until the performance ends shortly before sunrise. Performance “start time” was defined as the time at which the first notes of dawn song were produced, and performance “end time” as the time at which the last notes of dawn song were produced. Total “performance duration” was calculated as the difference between these times. Males were continuously observed from their performance start time (typically in the roost chamber) until they could be visually identified using their colour rings and feather dye mark and any occasions where male identity could not be confirmed were excluded from the analyses.
