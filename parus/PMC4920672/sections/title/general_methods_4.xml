 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This field study was conducted between October 2010 and April 2011 in the context of a long-term project monitoring a population of over 40 cooperatively breeding groups of white-browed sparrow weavers at the Tswalu Kalahari Reserve, South Africa (27°15′ S, 22°26′ E, elevation: 1195 m; see 
  <a rid="f0005" ref-type="fig" href="#f0005">Fig. 1</a> for species geographic range). All individuals in the population have unique colour-ring combinations for identification purposes (

  <a rid="b0345" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0345">York et al., 2014</a>). Males were identified during the dawn chorus using their ring combination and a black dye mark applied to feathers on the lower abdomens of dominant males during routine captures. Dye marks were used as an additional criterion to confirm individual identification, as the low light levels at dawn can reduce the reliability of colour-ring discrimination (
