 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recordings of pre-emergence song (song produced prior to the male’s emergence from his roost chamber) were made from within 10 m of the male, using a Sennheiser ME66 directional microphone with a K6 power module (2004 Sennheiser), and a Marantz PMD660 solid-state recorder (D&amp;M Holdings Inc.). Avisoft-SASLab Pro 5.1.16 (R. Specht, Berlin, Germany) was used to generate spectrograms (Hamming window, FFT of 1024 points, time resolution of 5.8 ms and 50% overlap). We focused our attention on song performance characteristics that previous studies have most commonly found to be impacted by the manipulation or blockade of circulating T (see 
  <a rid="t0005" ref-type="table" href="#t0005">Table 1</a> for examples). Male song has a variable structure that consists of syllables produced either alone or arranged in phrases (see 
  <a rid="f0010" ref-type="fig" href="#f0010">Fig. 2</a> for an example; 
  <a rid="b0310" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0310">Voigt et al., 2007</a>). “Syllable rate” (number of syllables/min) and “proportion of time spent singing” (cumulative duration of syllables) were calculated for the 5-min sample period following the performance start time (during which time the male remained within his roost chamber). This sample period was selected as a standard time point during the song performance for contrasts within and between males, and because males were guaranteed to be stationary during this period, ensuring that the quality of recording files was consistent.
