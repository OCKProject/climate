However, the estimation of reaction-norm properties (i.e., elevation, linear slope, and higher order slope terms) and the selection on these is statistically challenging. We here advocate the use of random regression mixed models to estimate reaction-norm properties and the use of bivariate random regression to estimate selection on these properties within a single model. We illustrate the approach by random regression mixed models on 1115 observations of clutch sizes and laying dates of 361 female Ural owl <italic>Strix uralensis</italic> collected over 31 years to show that (1) there is variation across individuals in the slope of their clutch size&#x02013;laying date relationship, and that (2) there is selection on the slope of the reaction norm between these two traits. Hence, natural selection potentially drives the negative covariance in clutch size and laying date in this species. The random-regression approach is hampered by inability to estimate nonlinear selection, but avoids a number of disadvantages (stats-on-stats, connecting reaction-norm properties to fitness). The approach is of value in describing and studying selection on behavioral reaction norms (behavioral syndromes) or life-history reaction norms. The approach can also be extended to consider the genetic underpinning of reaction-norm properties.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Bird</kwd><kwd>clutch size</kwd><kwd>natural selection</kwd><kwd>phenotypic plasticity</kwd><kwd>reaction norm</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Reaction-norm theory states that covariance of life-history traits occurs when individuals experience a heterogeneous environment, where the optimal combination of life-history traits depends on the environmental context an individual finds itself in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Stearns 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Koz&#x00142;owski 1992</xref>). For example, in practically all temperate avian species, birds that lay later in the breeding season have a lower clutch size than individuals which produce earlier in the breeding season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Klomp 1970</xref>). The negative covariance of these two life-history traits (clutch size and laying date) is generally viewed as a reaction norm in response to environmental heterogeneity. Under poor environmental conditions, it is optimal for an individual's fitness to reproduce late in the season and produce a small number of eggs compared to individuals that experience good conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Daan et al. 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Rowe et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Brommer et al. 2002a</xref>). Consider, for example, a linear increase over time <italic>t</italic> in the potential clutch size <italic>C</italic> of individual <italic>i</italic> as 
<disp-formula id="e1"><graphic xlink:href="ece30002-0695-m1"/><label>1</label></disp-formula>
where potential clutch size <italic>C</italic> can be considered a common currency to express differences across individuals in the environmental conditions they experience, for example, due to the food supply in their territory. All interindividual variation in this example is fully due to variation in the initial potential clutch size experienced by individual <italic>i</italic>, C<sub>0,<italic>i</italic></sub> (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Rowe et al. 1994</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Brommer et al. 2002a</xref> for other scenarios). The reproductive value <italic>V</italic> of an egg produced at time <italic>t</italic> declines as

As the season advances (Time), environmental conditions and thus the potential clutch size <italic>C</italic> increase (Equation [1]; dotted line), but individuals experience different trajectories characterized by the initial condition <italic>C</italic><sub>0</sub>. Because the reproductive value of offspring <italic>V</italic> declines seasonally (Equation [2]), there is an optimal switching curve (solid line) that describes when an individual should stop increasing in condition and reproduce (filled dots). This switching curve is the optimal reaction norm maximizing <italic>V</italic>(<italic>t</italic>)<italic>C</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), showing a seasonal decrease in reproduction (Equation [3]). Timing reproduction earlier has fitness costs, because reproductive output decreases (gray squares), more so than offspring reproduction increases.

<disp-formula id="e3"><graphic xlink:href="ece30002-0695-m3"/><label>3</label></disp-formula></p><p>Hence, the individually optimized reaction norm is a decline in clutch size with advancing laying date at rate &#x003b1;. Although this concept is here illustrated with clutch size and laying date, the same arguments apply to other seasonal life-history traits such as, for example, size at maturation (related to fecundity) and seasonal developmental time in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kawecki and Stearns 1993</xref>).</p><p>The above example of the theory behind reaction norms implies that individuals that do not follow the optimal reaction norm suffer reduced fitness compared to those that follow the norm. In the above example, if an individual advances laying date relative to the reaction norm (gray squares in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>), fecundity is reduced and this reduction exceeds the gain in reproductive value of the offspring produced. If the individual delays and produces a larger clutch size relative to the reaction norm (gray dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>), fitness costs occur in terms of reduced reproductive value of the offspring produced which outweigh the increase in fecundity. Thus, evaluation of empirical reaction-norm data should reveal selection on the properties describing the reaction norm. In particular, theory predicts that the slope of the trait&#x02013;trait relationship should be under selection. Despite the intuitive appeal of the theory, empirical demonstration that a certain covariation of traits is under selection is challenging. This is because it requires two steps:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Quantification of the variation across individuals or genotypes in their reaction-norm properties. In its simplest form, a reaction norm is a linear function (Trait Y = elevation + slope &#x000d7; Trait X), thereby requiring estimation of the variance of at least two properties. Whereas the &#x0201c;elevation&#x0201d; is clearly related to the mean value of the trait, the &#x0201c;slope&#x0201d; (within-individual covariance between two traits) is an emergent property of the observed data and is therefore sensitive to choice of statistical procedure used to estimate it. Some of these procedures will have more power to describe variation in slope than others.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Selection on a reaction norm requires the calculation of the fitness of these reaction norm properties, rather than the fitness of the expression of a trait itself (for more discussion on this notion, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Weis and Gorman (1990)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Spitze and Sadler (1996)</xref>). Because fitness is a trait of the individual, this implies that, in statistical terms, a description of reaction-norm fitness must allow for the covariance between fitness and reaction norm slope, where the latter is an emergent property (a &#x0201c;meta-trait&#x0201d;) defined by the within-individual covariance of two traits.</p></list-item></list></p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Brommer et al. (2003)</xref> noted that for labile traits for which expression changes across an individual's lifetime, measurement of life-history traits (under varying environmental conditions) and lifetime fitness can be obtained for each individual. Hence, selection on plasticity can be calculated for such traits. Nevertheless, calculation of selection on plasticity has thus far been based on regression of estimates of an individual's reaction-norm slope (describing the covariance between two traits or between a trait and an environmental value) on an individual's fitness, thereby doing stats-on-stats, either on slope estimates derived from linear regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Brommer et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Nussey et al. 2005a</xref>) or derived from a linear mixed model (as Best Linear Unbiased Predictor [BLUP] values, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Brommer et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Nussey et al. 2005b</xref>). Linear regression of data on each individual requires a certain minimal number of repeated records per individual (e.g., five in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Brommer et al. 2005</xref>; four in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Nussey et al. 2005a</xref>), thereby discarding a potentially sizeable proportion of the data consisting of observations on individuals with relatively few repeated records. In terms of selection analysis, this introduces a possible bias as only the longest lived individuals are included. Mixed model BLUP values of a response variable are based on the assumption that all covariates that may have an effect on the response variable have been included (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Pinheiro and Bates 2000</xref>). Hence, using BLUP values to explore covariation with another trait (e.g., fitness), violates the assumption under which they were generated in the first place. Typically, both approaches ignore the often large uncertainty inherent in estimating slope when quantifying selection on the slope estimate, which may produce spurious estimates of selection.</p><p>Here, we use random regression mixed models to calculate both the reaction-norm properties and selection on these in an integrative manner that circumvents the above-described problems. Random regression is an implementation of the infinite-dimensional model (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Kirkpatrick and Heckman 1989</xref>), which presents a simplification of the character state approach by allowing trait variation to be described as a function of a covariate. As all mixed models, random regression is robust for analyzing unbalanced data, which data from natural populations often are (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Crawley 2002</xref>). Here, we argue that a mixed model random regression can be used to explore variation in the properties underlying a trait&#x02013;trait reaction norm. Random regression mixed models have mostly been used in the study of trait&#x02013;environment relationships in natural populations, both on the phenotypic and genetic levels (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Nussey et al. 2007</xref>), but have&#x02014;to our knowledge&#x02014;not been implemented in the study of covariance between traits. Furthermore, we demonstrate how multivariate random regression can be used to estimate selection on reaction-norm properties. Multivariate random regression models have been rarely used in ecology, with the exception of exploration on how the covariance between traits changes over an environmental gradient (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Robinson et al. 2008</xref>) and in formal comparison of trait&#x02013;environment reaction norms in two populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Husby et al. 2010</xref>).</p><p>We illustrate our approach by a consideration of selection on the properties describing the clutch size&#x02013;laying date relationship. Our study species, the Ural owl (<italic>Strix uralensis</italic> Pall.), experiences a highly variable environment, and shows high plasticity in clutch size (one to eight eggs) and seasonal timing of laying (more than 2 months) (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Pieti&#x000e4;inen 1989</xref>). Previous work (based on linear regression and analysis of covariance) has shown that there is variation across Ural owl females in their clutch size&#x02013;laying date relationship in terms of elevation and slope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Brommer et al. 2003</xref>). Here, we quantify the variation in these properties and selection on them using random-regression analysis. We discuss the applicability of this method in the study of phenotypic integration of behavioral and life-history traits.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods: Random-Regression Approach</title><p>We outline the model approach in terms of the analysis of clutch size and laying date. We here adhere to this specific scenario, instead of a more generic one, in order to facilitate understanding the approach and linking it to the example scenario presented in this paper and the code for implementing this model, which is presented in the Supporting Information. Nevertheless, the approach is applicable to also other combinations of traits that are expressed repeatedly during an individual's lifetime.</p><p>Model construction and evaluation was performed in two stages. We started by modeling the clutch size&#x02013;laying date relationships, such that 
<disp-formula id="e4"><graphic xlink:href="ece30002-0695-m4"/><label>4</label></disp-formula>
where <italic>c<sub>yr,i</sub></italic> denotes the clutch size of female <italic>i</italic> in year <italic>yr</italic>. The &#x0201c;&#x000b5;<sub>c</sub>&#x0201d; fits the overall fixed effects mean clutch size, <italic>Age</italic>F<italic><sub>yr,i</sub></italic> is a fixed effect that denotes the factor age of individual <italic>i</italic> in year <italic>yr</italic>, <italic>d<sub>yr,i</sub></italic> the laying date of female <italic>i</italic> in year <italic>yr</italic>, and <italic>b</italic> the fixed-effect slope of clutch size as a function of laying date. Any annual variation that is not explained by the fixed effects is modeled by the random effect <italic>yr</italic>. The random regression element is given by the polynomial function <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="ece30002-0695-mu1.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="e4">Equation (4)</xref>, which specifies the individual-specific deviations from the fixed-effect slope <italic>b</italic> of clutch size on laying date. For each individual <italic>i</italic>, a polynomial function of increasing order <italic>x</italic> is specified. Thus, when <italic>x</italic>= 0, the variance across individuals (<italic>ind</italic><sub>0</sub>) is estimated at the average laying date value. When <italic>x</italic>= 1, the variance in the coefficients <italic>ind</italic><sub>0</sub> (elevation) and the variance in <italic>ind</italic><sub>1</sub> (slope) of the function <italic>ind</italic><sub>0</sub>+<italic>ind</italic><sub>1</sub><italic>d<sub>year</sub></italic> is estimated and the covariance between these, and so on for higher order polynomials. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="e4">Equation (4)</xref> is a standard random regression model, with the exception that typically an environmental variable is used as explanatory variable (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Schaeffer 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Nussey et al. 2007</xref>).</p><p>To decide the order <italic>x</italic> of the random regression, we assumed that the most parsimonious random regression model was reached when higher order polynomials did not achieve a significant increase in log-likelihood. That is, the order <italic>x</italic> of the random regression polynomial function was increased stepwise, and its significance was tested by a likelihood ratio test, which is two times the difference in log-likelihood between hierarchically nested models, tested against a chi-square distribution assuming that the degrees of freedom are given by the additional number of (co)variances estimated. Based on the most parsimonious random regression model, estimates of variance in clutch size at each laying date and its approximate standard error can be calculated following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Fischer et al. (2004)</xref>.</p><sec><title>Selection on reaction-norm properties</title><p>Having determined the most parsimonious order of the polynomial random regression, we extended the univariate random regression (Equation[4]) to a bivariate one by in addition to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="e4">Equation (4)</xref> considering that 
<disp-formula id="e5"><graphic xlink:href="ece30002-0695-m5"/><label>5</label></disp-formula>
where <italic>w<sub>i</sub></italic> is the relative fitness of individual <italic>i</italic>. The &#x000b5;<italic><sub>w</sub></italic> denotes the overall fixed effect mean fitness, and <italic>Cohort</italic>F<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> a fixed effect denoting the year of first breeding of individual <italic>i</italic>, which is entered to correct for temporal variation in fitness and the possible truncation of lifetime fitness in the last cohorts considered in the analysis. The bivariate element in the random regression is specified by the polynomial <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="ece30002-0695-mu2.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. Thus, for order <italic>x</italic>, the variances in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="ece30002-0695-mu3.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="ece30002-0695-mu4.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> are both estimated, in addition to all possible covariances between these parameters. Nevertheless, because each individual has only one estimate of lifetime fitness, only the variance in elevation (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="ece30002-0695-mu5.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>) is estimable and all other variances (including the residual variance) must be constrained to zero. Thus, for a first-order random regression, the mixed model procedure needs to estimate the (co)variances (written in matrix form, omitting the upper diagonal that is symmetric to the lower diagonal). 
<disp-formula id="e6"><graphic xlink:href="ece30002-0695-m6"/><label>6</label></disp-formula>
where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="ece30002-0695-mu6.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> denotes the selection differential on the elevation of the clutch size&#x02013;laying date relationship (<italic>S</italic><sub>elevation</sub>) and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="ece30002-0695-mu7.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> the selection differential on the slope of the clutch size&#x02013;laying date relationship (<italic>S</italic><sub>slope</sub>). These selection differentials can be expressed as a selection gradient by dividing them with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="ece30002-0695-mu8.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="ece30002-0695-mu9.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, respectively, or as selection intensity (standardized selection gradient) by dividing them with the square root of these variances.</p><p>Higher order polynomials can be introduced as an extension of this matrix. Thus, bivariate random regression allows estimating directional selection on the properties of a polynomial individual-specific relationship between labile life-history traits. Testing the formal significance of the selection differential can be performed by constraining the appropriate covariance to zero and performing a likelihood ratio test between the unconstrained and constrained models. The procedure does not, however, allow description of nonlinear selection. In order to evaluate the potential for nonlinear selection on these properties, we suggest investigation of the map of relative fitness on the BLUP values for all reaction-norm properties. Under the paradigm of optimal reaction norms, one would expect that variation in slope may be under stabilizing selection, which can hereby be graphically evaluated.</p><p>All random regression models were solved using Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) in the programe ASReml (VSN International). This programe uses the delta method (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Lynch and Walsh 1998</xref>) to estimate the standard errors of functions of variances. The code used in this paper and example file of data is provided in the Supporting Information. In the implementation of the above equations in AsReml, the following need to be observed. (1) In random regression with a linear covariate, the variances of first-order and higher order terms are dependent on the scaling of the covariate (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Pinheiro and Bates 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Schaeffer 2004</xref>), which is dependent on the software used to implement the models. AsReml standardizes the covariate such that its minimal value is &#x02013;1 and the average of the covariate values is zero. Hence, variances in elevation are defined for the average of all the covariate values (which may or may not equal the average covariate when taking the number of observations into account). Random-regression slope is then defined as change in response variable per unit equal to the difference between minimum and mean value of the covariate. (2) The within-individual variance and variance in slope(s) of lifetime fitness cannot be constrained to exactly zero and must, in practice, be constrained to a very small value. See the Supporting Information for additional details.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Example of the Random-Regression Approach: Ural Owl Clutch Size&#x02013;Laying Date Reaction Norms</title><sec><title>Ural owl data</title><p>A nest-box breeding population of Ural owls was studied in P&#x000e4;ij&#x000e4;t-H&#x000e4;me, southern Finland, in an area of 1500 km<sup>2</sup> during 1977&#x02013;2009. Laying date of the first egg was established either by finding the incomplete clutch and calculating back assuming that eggs are laid at 2 days interval or by backdating first the hatching date of the nestlings (based on a daily growth curve) and assuming an incubation period of 32 days for the first egg (largest nestling). Any error in establishing laying date using these approaches is likely to be small in comparison to the length of the period of laying, which spans 2 months. See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Pieti&#x000e4;inen (1989)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Kontiainen et al. (2010)</xref> for details.

We included data on clutch size and laying date on all females that started their breeding career between 1978 and 2008 (31 years). We included age as a fixed-effect factor with three levels (1, 2, 3+ years old). Laying date was standardized relative to the all-time median laying date of 31 March (= 0), such that 1 April was 1 and 30 March was &#x02013;1.</p><p>As an estimate of lifetime fitness, we used the total number of fledglings that a female has produced during her entire breeding career, which in this population correlates with the number of descendants after several generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Brommer et al. 2004</xref>).

Not surprisingly, the selection differential on the elevation of clutch size (expected clutch size at the average of laying date values) showed clear selection for increased clutch size. There was an insignificant selection differential for a steeper (more negative) slope of the clutch size&#x02013;laying date relationship. Lastly, there was significant positive selection for the second-order random regression term of the clutch size&#x02013;laying date relationship. That is, female whose clutch size&#x02013;laying date relationship was more concave had higher lifetime fitness. Because these selection differentials take into account the whole (co)variance matrix (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), selection on the second-order term occurred in addition to the selection on its correlate elevation. Because the bivariate random regression can only describe linear selection, we investigated the plots of relative fitness versus the BLUP values for the reaction-norm properties to find evidence for stabilizing selection on linear slope or elevation. One may expect stabilizing selection on the reaction norm in case both shallower and steeper slopes reduce fitness (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>).

This variation across individuals is important, because it creates the potential for selection to shape the plasticity in clutch size as a function of laying date. We indeed show that selection operates on this plasticity, such that (1) females enjoy greater fitness when they have a larger elevation. That is, a larger clutch size at the mean value of observed laying dates, which is a close correlate of an individual's mean clutch size (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Brommer et al. 2003</xref>), (2) females whose clutch size declines steeper with advancing laying date and who show a stronger nonlinear (concave) curvature in their clutch size&#x02013;laying date relationship have higher fitness. Inspection of the interindividual clutch size&#x02013;laying date relationship estimated by random regression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>) shows that individuals with a concave curvature are those which have a relatively moderate clutch size at the early laying dates (before the median) and a relatively low clutch size during late laying dates (after the median). In the Ural owl, fledging success in brood sizes exceeding five offspring generally is poor, because hatching asynchrony increases rapidly with increasing clutch size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Kontiainen et al. 2010</xref>). For example, in a brood of 5, the smallest offspring is already 4&#x02013;6 days younger than its oldest sibling and mortality of the youngest nestling in such a large brood is likely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Kontiainen et al. 2010</xref>). Therefore, the production of large clutch sizes adds little to lifetime fledgling production. In addition, late broods are typically found under poor environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Pieti&#x000e4;inen 1989</xref>) and it may be a good strategy to reproduce conservatively under those conditions. Thus, we believe that our selection analysis captures biologically plausible processes in this species. The main finding is, nevertheless, that there is selection on properties that describe the plasticity of seasonal adjustment in clutch size. Provided part of this latter variation across females in plasticity is heritable, selection has the potential to shape the clutch size&#x02013;laying date relationship in this species.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Theory states that the covariation in seasonal life-history traits such as clutch size and laying date arises from individual-specific fitness optima, suggesting that deviation from the reaction norm reduces fitness. Here, we advocate an approach based on random regression to first describe and test whether there is variation across individuals in the properties describing a trait&#x02013;trait reaction norm and to further test for selection on these properties. We show that this approach indeed is effective in describing variation in Ural owl clutch size&#x02013;laying date relationships and detects selection on the reaction-norm properties. Using a random regression mixed model to describe trait&#x02013;trait reaction norms and selection on them avoids having to first extract information on reaction-norm properties from individual-specific regression and then regressing these estimates on fitness (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Brommer et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Nussey et al. 2005a</xref>). Hence, uncertainties in the estimate of an individual's reaction-norm properties are incorporated and selection on the mean trait (i.e., elevation) is considered simultaneously to the within-individual covariation between traits as well as their codependency by considering the complete matrix of variances and covariances between the trait under investigation and fitness. The approach works especially well on data consisting of repeated measures of traits on a set of individuals, of which the seasonal life-history traits in the case scenario considered is but one example.</p><p>Selection acts on phenotypes, and, in case of phenotypic plasticity, the phenotype is an environment-specific realization of the genotype. Empirically measuring the fitness of the reaction norm requires integrating the fitness of all the phenotypes produced by a genotype over the entire environmental gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Weis and Gorman 1990</xref>). However, in the case of labile traits, we consider trait expression by a set of individuals. Although each individual is a unique genotype, the variance between individuals in the properties describing the trait&#x02013;trait reaction norms includes both the additive genetic variance and also other, nonheritable, consistent differences across individuals (so-called permanent environmental effects, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Lynch and Walsh 1998</xref>). In our example, environmental effect associated with individuals may arise because Ural owls are strongly territorial and essentially breed their entire career in the same territory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Saurola 1987</xref>). Thus, variation across territories is confounded with variation across individuals and it is therefore possible that the variation in reaction-norm properties we here document is entirely caused by environmental differences across individuals. Nevertheless, provided sufficient pedigree information is available, a random regression animal model can be used to further partition the phenotypic properties into their additive genetic versus permanent environmental components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Nussey et al. 2007</xref>). Such a random regression animal model would allow estimation of the additive genetic (co)variance matrix G for the reaction-norm properties.</p><sec><title>Nonlinear selection on reaction norm properties</title><p>A major downside of the bivariate random regression approach in quantifying selection on plasticity is that it does not allow for nonlinear selection. For a single trait, nonlinear selection is estimated by calculating the covariance between the square of the trait and relative fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Falconer and MacKay 1996</xref>). The reaction-norm slope is an emergent property determined by the within-individual covariance between the traits and cannot be directly measured. Selection on higher order polynomial terms, as we found in our example case for the second-order polynomial of the Ural owl clutch size&#x02013;laying date relationship, refer to linear selection on specific curvature of the reaction norm itself rather than the shape of natural selection. Stabilizing selection on slope would be expected in case the reaction norm is maintained by selection. Nevertheless, there is generally a component of directional selection, except in the very restrictive case of completely symmetrical reductions in fitness if the slope deviates from the optimal reaction norm. Furthermore, comparative studies underline that directional selection is typically stronger than stabilizing selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Kingsolver et al. 2001</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Stinchcombe et al. 2008</xref>). Investigation of the mapping of fitness to the BLUPs of the reaction-norm properties, as we did here, should reveal whether stabilizing selection on reaction norms may occur (although it does not allow a formal test). We advice that the estimates of selection on reaction-norm properties are considered with caution, but also emphasize that alternative approaches may lead to spurious findings, especially when the uncertainty of the slope estimate is ignored.</p></sec><sec><title>Applications of the random-regression approach in evolutionary ecology</title><p>The approach used here to quantify selection on trait&#x02013;trait reaction norms is equally useful for reaction norms of trait versus environment. The typical use of random regression mixed models is to model the covariance of a trait and an abiotic variable. For example, reaction norms in laying date and temperature have been explored in several studies in wild populations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Brommer et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Nussey et al. 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Charmantier et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Husby et al. 2010</xref>). Such random regression models can be readily extended to a bivariate form where fitness is also considered (Equation [6]) in order to analyze selection on the trait&#x02013;environment reaction-norm properties. Understanding selection on trait&#x02013;environment plasticity may be crucial, because under environmental change organisms may be selected to alter the plasticity in their trait&#x02013;environment relationship, rather than merely their mean trait value. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Nussey et al. (2005b)</xref> showed that selection on the BLUPs of the slope of laying date&#x02013;temperature relationships of great tits <italic>Parus major</italic> in the Netherlands increased as the local spring climate warmed during the last decades.</p><p>Studies that consider repeated measures of different behaviors collected on a set of individuals may benefit from the approach outlines in this paper. The level of integration of several behaviors within an individual is increasingly receiving attention in ecology and evolutionary biology, because it captures &#x0201c;&#x02018;behavioural syndromes,&#x0201d; consistency in behaviors across different contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79">Sih et al. 2004</xref>). Under this paradigm, correlated behaviors (e.g., between &#x0201c;boldness&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;aggression&#x0201d;) arise because individuals are relatively inflexible with respect to environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">R&#x000e9;ale et al. 2007</xref>). Hence, explicit consideration of &#x0201c;behavioural reaction norms&#x0201d; and understanding selection on their properties has been recently advocated as a potentially fruitful line of research for understanding how natural selection shapes behavioral syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Dingemanse et al. 2010</xref>). In particular, the notion that behavioral syndromes are maintained in the population because plasticity, that is, reaction-norm slope, is genetically constrained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79">Sih et al. 2004</xref>) as opposed to being shaped by selection can be explicitly explored using the random regression approach advocated here.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Phenotypic plasticity is a central concept in evolutionary ecology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Schlichting 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Scheiner 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Schlichting and Pigliucci 1998</xref>). The seminal work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Weis and Gorman (1990)</xref> has clarified that quantification of natural selection on the level of the reaction norm is pivotal in understanding the evolution of plasticity. From this perspective, repeated observations on long-lived organisms under natural conditions in combination with the methodology we here presented constitute a powerful approach to quantify variation in the reaction-norm properties and linking them to variation in fitness.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank H.
