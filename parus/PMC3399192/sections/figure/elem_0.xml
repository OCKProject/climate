  <p>Illustration of the main theoretical background of the reaction-norm concept in terms of two seasonal life-history traits. As the season advances (Time), environmental conditions and thus the potential clutch size 
   <span class="italic">C</span> increase (Equation [1]; dotted line), but individuals experience different trajectories characterized by the initial condition 
   <span class="italic">C</span>
   <sub>0</sub>. Because the reproductive value of offspring 
   <span class="italic">V</span> declines seasonally (Equation [2]), there is an optimal switching curve (solid line) that describes when an individual should stop increasing in condition and reproduce (filled dots). This switching curve is the optimal reaction norm maximizing 
   <span class="italic">V</span>(
   <span class="italic">t</span>)
   <span class="italic">C</span>(
   <span class="italic">t</span>), showing a seasonal decrease in reproduction (Equation [3]). Timing reproduction earlier has fitness costs, because reproductive output decreases (gray squares), more so than offspring reproduction increases. Delaying reproduction increases reproductive output (gray dots), but has fitness costs because late-produced offspring are of lower value.
