 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reaction-norm theory states that covariance of life-history traits occurs when individuals experience a heterogeneous environment, where the optimal combination of life-history traits depends on the environmental context an individual finds itself in (

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">Kozłowski 1992</a>). For example, in practically all temperate avian species, birds that lay later in the breeding season have a lower clutch size than individuals which produce earlier in the breeding season (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" href="#b20">Klomp 1970</a>). The negative covariance of these two life-history traits (clutch size and laying date) is generally viewed as a reaction norm in response to environmental heterogeneity. Under poor environmental conditions, it is optimal for an individual's fitness to reproduce late in the season and produce a small number of eggs compared to individuals that experience good conditions (

  <span class="italic">C</span> can be considered a common currency to express differences across individuals in the environmental conditions they experience, for example, due to the food supply in their territory.

   <p>Illustration of the main theoretical background of the reaction-norm concept in terms of two seasonal life-history traits. As the season advances (Time), environmental conditions and thus the potential clutch size 
    <span class="italic">C</span> increase (Equation [1]; dotted line), but individuals experience different trajectories characterized by the initial condition 
    <span class="italic">C</span>
    <sub>0</sub>. Because the reproductive value of offspring 
    <span class="italic">V</span> declines seasonally (Equation [2]), there is an optimal switching curve (solid line) that describes when an individual should stop increasing in condition and reproduce (filled dots). This switching curve is the optimal reaction norm maximizing 
    <span class="italic">V</span>(
    <span class="italic">t</span>)
    <span class="italic">C</span>(
    <span class="italic">t</span>), showing a seasonal decrease in reproduction (Equation [3]). Timing reproduction earlier has fitness costs, because reproductive output decreases (gray squares), more so than offspring reproduction increases. Delaying reproduction increases reproductive output (gray dots), but has fitness costs because late-produced offspring are of lower value.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hence, the individually optimized reaction norm is a decline in clutch size with advancing laying date at rate α. Although this concept is here illustrated with clutch size and laying date, the same arguments apply to other seasonal life-history traits such as, for example, size at maturation (related to fecundity) and seasonal developmental time in insects (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" href="#b17">Kawecki and Stearns 1993</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The above example of the theory behind reaction norms implies that individuals that do not follow the optimal reaction norm suffer reduced fitness compared to those that follow the norm. In the above example, if an individual advances laying date relative to the reaction norm (gray squares in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1</a>), fecundity is reduced and this reduction exceeds the gain in reproductive value of the offspring produced. If the individual delays and produces a larger clutch size relative to the reaction norm (gray dots in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1</a>), fitness costs occur in terms of reduced reproductive value of the offspring produced which outweigh the increase in fecundity. Thus, evaluation of empirical reaction-norm data should reveal selection on the properties describing the reaction norm. In particular, theory predicts that the slope of the trait–trait relationship should be under selection. Despite the intuitive appeal of the theory, empirical demonstration that a certain covariation of traits is under selection is challenging. This is because it requires two steps: 
  <div list-type="order" class="list">
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>Quantification of the variation across individuals or genotypes in their reaction-norm properties. In its simplest form, a reaction norm is a linear function (Trait Y = elevation + slope × Trait X), thereby requiring estimation of the variance of at least two properties. Whereas the “elevation” is clearly related to the mean value of the trait, the “slope” (within-individual covariance between two traits) is an emergent property of the observed data and is therefore sensitive to choice of statistical procedure used to estimate it. Some of these procedures will have more power to describe variation in slope than others.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>Selection on a reaction norm requires the calculation of the fitness of these reaction norm properties, rather than the fitness of the expression of a trait itself (for more discussion on this notion, see 
     <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b44" href="#b44">Weis and Gorman (1990)</a>, and 
     <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" href="#b41">Spitze and Sadler (1996)</a>). Because fitness is a trait of the individual, this implies that, in statistical terms, a description of reaction-norm fitness must allow for the covariance between fitness and reaction norm slope, where the latter is an emergent property (a “meta-trait”) defined by the within-individual covariance of two traits.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" href="#b5">Brommer et al. (2003)</a> noted that for labile traits for which expression changes across an individual's lifetime, measurement of life-history traits (under varying environmental conditions) and lifetime fitness can be obtained for each individual. Hence, selection on plasticity can be calculated for such traits. Nevertheless, calculation of selection on plasticity has thus far been based on regression of estimates of an individual's reaction-norm slope (describing the covariance between two traits or between a trait and an environmental value) on an individual's fitness, thereby doing stats-on-stats, either on slope estimates derived from linear regression (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" href="#b5">Brommer et al. 2003</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">Nussey et al. 2005a</a>) or derived from a linear mixed model (as Best Linear Unbiased Predictor [BLUP] values, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" href="#b7">Brommer et al. 2005</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" href="#b26">Nussey et al. 2005b</a>). Linear regression of data on each individual requires a certain minimal number of repeated records per individual (e.g., five in 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" href="#b7">Brommer et al. 2005</a>; four in 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">Nussey et al. 2005a</a>), thereby discarding a potentially sizeable proportion of the data consisting of observations on individuals with relatively few repeated records. In terms of selection analysis, this introduces a possible bias as only the longest lived individuals are included. Mixed model BLUP values of a response variable are based on the assumption that all covariates that may have an effect on the response variable have been included (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">Pinheiro and Bates 2000</a>). Hence, using BLUP values to explore covariation with another trait (e.g., fitness), violates the assumption under which they were generated in the first place. Typically, both approaches ignore the often large uncertainty inherent in estimating slope when quantifying selection on the slope estimate, which may produce spurious estimates of selection.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we use random regression mixed models to calculate both the reaction-norm properties and selection on these in an integrative manner that circumvents the above-described problems. Random regression is an implementation of the infinite-dimensional model (e.g., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">Kirkpatrick and Heckman 1989</a>), which presents a simplification of the character state approach by allowing trait variation to be described as a function of a covariate. As all mixed models, random regression is robust for analyzing unbalanced data, which data from natural populations often are (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" href="#b10">Crawley 2002</a>). Here, we argue that a mixed model random regression can be used to explore variation in the properties underlying a trait–trait reaction norm. Random regression mixed models have mostly been used in the study of trait–environment relationships in natural populations, both on the phenotypic and genetic levels (reviewed by 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" href="#b27">Nussey et al. 2007</a>), but have—to our knowledge—not been implemented in the study of covariance between traits. Furthermore, we demonstrate how multivariate random regression can be used to estimate selection on reaction-norm properties. Multivariate random regression models have been rarely used in ecology, with the exception of exploration on how the covariance between traits changes over an environmental gradient (e.g., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">Robinson et al. 2008</a>) and in formal comparison of trait–environment reaction norms in two populations (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" href="#b16">Husby et al. 2010</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We illustrate our approach by a consideration of selection on the properties describing the clutch size–laying date relationship. Our study species, the Ural owl (
  <span class="italic">Strix uralensis</span> Pall.), experiences a highly variable environment, and shows high plasticity in clutch size (one to eight eggs) and seasonal timing of laying (more than 2 months) (e.g., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" href="#b29">Pietiäinen 1989</a>). Previous work (based on linear regression and analysis of covariance) has shown that there is variation across Ural owl females in their clutch size–laying date relationship in terms of elevation and slope (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" href="#b5">Brommer et al. 2003</a>). Here, we quantify the variation in these properties and selection on them using random-regression analysis. We discuss the applicability of this method in the study of phenotypic integration of behavioral and life-history traits.
