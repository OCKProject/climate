 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A nest-box breeding population of Ural owls was studied in Päijät-Häme, southern Finland, in an area of 1500 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> during 1977–2009. Laying date of the first egg was established either by finding the incomplete clutch and calculating back assuming that eggs are laid at 2 days interval or by backdating first the hatching date of the nestlings (based on a daily growth curve) and assuming an incubation period of 32 days for the first egg (largest nestling). Any error in establishing laying date using these approaches is likely to be small in comparison to the length of the period of laying, which spans 2 months. See

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">Kontiainen et al. (2010)</a> for details. Each year, practically all Ural owls females were caught, either during incubation or when caring for their offspring. All females were aged by plumage characteristics to age categories of 1, 2, or ≥3 years old (
