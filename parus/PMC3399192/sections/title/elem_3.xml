  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A nest-box breeding population of Ural owls was studied in Päijät-Häme, southern Finland, in an area of 1500 km
   <span class="sup">2</span> during 1977–2009. Laying date of the first egg was established either by finding the incomplete clutch and calculating back assuming that eggs are laid at 2 days interval or by backdating first the hatching date of the nestlings (based on a daily growth curve) and assuming an incubation period of 32 days for the first egg (largest nestling). Any error in establishing laying date using these approaches is likely to be small in comparison to the length of the period of laying, which spans 2 months. See 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" href="#b29">Pietiäinen (1989)</a> and 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">Kontiainen et al. (2010)</a> for details. Each year, practically all Ural owls females were caught, either during incubation or when caring for their offspring. All females were aged by plumage characteristics to age categories of 1, 2, or ≥3 years old (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" href="#b28">Pietiäinen and Kolunen 1986</a>) and were ringed with a metal ring in order to allow lifelong identification. All offspring were ringed and all boxes were checked after fledging to verify successful fledging of offspring.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data used in the analysis</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the analyses, individuals that started their breeding career during the study period were included. We thus omitted individuals trapped for the first time in 1977, but assumed that all females caught for the first time in one of our boxes from 1978 onwards were first breeders. We included data on clutch size and laying date on all females that started their breeding career between 1978 and 2008 (31 years). We included age as a fixed-effect factor with three levels (1, 2, 3+ years old). Laying date was standardized relative to the all-time median laying date of 31 March (= 0), such that 1 April was 1 and 30 March was –1.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As an estimate of lifetime fitness, we used the total number of fledglings that a female has produced during her entire breeding career, which in this population correlates with the number of descendants after several generations (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" href="#b6">Brommer et al. 2004</a>). Relative fitness 
   <span class="italic">w
    <sub>i</sub>
   </span> of 
   <a ref-type="disp-formula" rid="e5" href="#e5">Equation (5)</a> was calculated by dividing an individual's lifetime production of fledglings by the overall mean lifetime production of fledglings (fitness is relative to an average of unity).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We could analyze the clutch size–laying date relationships and their fitness consequences of 361 Ural owl females with 1115 breeding attempts (3.1 records of clutch size and laying date per female on average). All females with known laying date and clutch size that had bred at least once in our study population were included. Results did not change qualitatively when animals with only one breeding record were excluded.</p>
