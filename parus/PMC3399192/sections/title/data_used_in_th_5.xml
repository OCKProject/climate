 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the analyses, individuals that started their breeding career during the study period were included. We thus omitted individuals trapped for the first time in 1977, but assumed that all females caught for the first time in one of our boxes from 1978 onwards were first breeders. We included data on clutch size and laying date on all females that started their breeding career between 1978 and 2008 (31 years). We included age as a fixed-effect factor with three levels (1, 2, 3+ years old). Laying date was standardized relative to the all-time median laying date of 31 March (= 0), such that 1 April was 1 and 30 March was –1.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As an estimate of lifetime fitness, we used the total number of fledglings that a female has produced during her entire breeding career, which in this population correlates with the number of descendants after several generations (

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We could analyze the clutch size–laying date relationships and their fitness consequences of 361 Ural owl females with 1115 breeding attempts (3.1 records of clutch size and laying date per female on average). All females with known laying date and clutch size that had bred at least once in our study population were included. Results did not change qualitatively when animals with only one breeding record were excluded.</p>
