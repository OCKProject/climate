  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b44" href="#b44">Weis and Gorman (1990)</a> has clarified that quantification of natural selection on the level of the reaction norm is pivotal in understanding the evolution of plasticity. From this perspective, repeated observations on long-lived organisms under natural conditions in combination with the methodology we here presented constitute a powerful approach to quantify variation in the reaction-norm properties and linking them to variation in fitness.
