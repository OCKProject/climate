 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The approach used here to quantify selection on trait–trait reaction norms is equally useful for reaction norms of trait versus environment. The typical use of random regression mixed models is to model the covariance of a trait and an abiotic variable. For example, reaction norms in laying date and temperature have been explored in several studies in wild populations (e.g., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" href="#b7">Brommer et al. 2005</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b50" href="#b50">2008</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" href="#b26">Nussey et al. 2005b</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" href="#b9">Charmantier et al. 2008</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" href="#b16">Husby et al. 2010</a>). Such random regression models can be readily extended to a bivariate form where fitness is also considered (Equation [6]) in order to analyze selection on the trait–environment reaction-norm properties. Understanding selection on trait–environment plasticity may be crucial, because under environmental change organisms may be selected to alter the plasticity in their trait–environment relationship, rather than merely their mean trait value. For example, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" href="#b26">Nussey et al. (2005b)</a> showed that selection on the BLUPs of the slope of laying date–temperature relationships of great tits

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Studies that consider repeated measures of different behaviors collected on a set of individuals may benefit from the approach outlines in this paper. The level of integration of several behaviors within an individual is increasingly receiving attention in ecology and evolutionary biology, because it captures “‘behavioural syndromes,” consistency in behaviors across different contexts (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b79" href="#b79">Sih et al. 2004</a>). Under this paradigm, correlated behaviors (e.g., between “boldness” and “aggression”) arise because individuals are relatively inflexible with respect to environmental conditions (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" href="#b31">Réale et al. 2007</a>). Hence, explicit consideration of “behavioural reaction norms” and understanding selection on their properties has been recently advocated as a potentially fruitful line of research for understanding how natural selection shapes behavioral syndromes (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" href="#b12">Dingemanse et al. 2010</a>). In particular, the notion that behavioral syndromes are maintained in the population because plasticity, that is, reaction-norm slope, is genetically constrained (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b79" href="#b79">Sih et al. 2004</a>) as opposed to being shaped by selection can be explicitly explored using the random regression approach advocated here.
