  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data were collected from nests constructed in March–June 2012 at four study sites; Aberdeen (57.10°N; 
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 14), Lancaster (54.00°N; 
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 14), Shrewsbury (52.43°N; 
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 14), and Penryn (50.05°N; 
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 15); spread over 7° of latitude in Great Britain (Fig. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">2</a>). At each site, suitable areas of habitat were searched regularly for Common Blackbird's nests, but once located the nests were left alone until the end of July when they were collected and placed into sealed and labeled plastic bags, before being transported to Lancaster University.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Quantifying nest insulatory properties</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All nests were frozen at −20°C for at least 4 days in order to kill any invertebrates present within the nests, before the insulatory properties of all of the nests from each of the study sites were determined. Nests were placed in a controlled condition environment of 15°C and 70% humidity for a minimum of 72 h (following McGowan et al. 
   <a rid="b28" ref-type="bibr" href="#b28">2004</a>; Mainwaring et al. 
   <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2012</a>) before the insulatory properties were quantified in a 10°C constant temperature and 70% constant humidity room. Nests were placed onto a hard surface, and two iButtons (Maxim: DS1922L) were heated to 80°C with the “nest” iButton gently pushed into the base of the nest cup and the “control” iButton placed 5 cm away on an adjacent hard surface and at the same height. Then, both the “nest” and the “control” iButtons were left to cool for 30 min, while they recorded the temperature every 20 sec. The cooling rates of the nests were used to quantify the insulatory properties of the nests (following McGowan et al. 
   <a rid="b28" ref-type="bibr" href="#b28">2004</a>; Mainwaring et al. 
   <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2012</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cooling rates were obtained for each nest by fitting the empirical temperature data to logistic models of the form: temperature of iButton – ambient temperature + 
   <span class="italic">b</span>e
   <span class="sup">−
    <span class="italic">ct</span>
   </span>, where 
   <span class="italic">b</span> is the initial temperature gradient between the iButton and ambient, 
   <span class="italic">c</span> describes the cooling rate of the iButton, 
   <span class="italic">t</span> is the time since the experiment began in seconds, and e is the base of natural logarithms. The nest insulatory properties were calculated as the differences in 
   <span class="italic">c</span> of the “nest” and “control” iButtons, with a large positive difference indicating high nest insulation (following McGowan et al. 
   <a rid="b28" ref-type="bibr" href="#b28">2004</a>; Mainwaring et al. 
   <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2012</a>). The insulatory properties of all nests were quantified three times, with the iButtons placed in the same place each time, and the mean of the three scores was used in the analyses.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Quantifying nest volume, morphology, and composition</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The volume and morphology of nests were quantified in two ways. First, we measured five aspects of nest morphology: external nest diameter (±0.05 cm), internal nest-cup diameter (±0.05 cm), external nest depth (±0.05 cm), internal nest-cup depth (±0.05 cm), and nest wall thickness (±0.05 cm). The external nest diameter is the mean of the maximum and minimum diameters of the outer nest cup, and the internal nest-cup diameter is the mean of the maximum and minimum diameters of the inner nest cup. The external nest depth was quantified as the distance from the top rim of the nest walls to the bottom of the nest exterior. The internal nest-cup depth is the distance from the top of the rim of the nest walls to the base of the interior nest cup, where the eggs would be. Meanwhile, the nest wall thickness was quantified as the mean of eight evenly spaced measurements of the nest wall. Then, as the nests of open-cup-nesting birds such as Common Blackbirds are approximately shaped as half a spheroid, the volume of nests was calculated by determining the outer nest volume from the following equation: nest volume = 2/3
   <span class="italic">πa</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span>
   <span class="italic">b</span>, where “
   <span class="italic">a</span>” is the largest, and “
   <span class="italic">b</span>” is the smallest value of the outer radius and the height of the nest, respectively (following Møller 
   <a rid="b29" ref-type="bibr" href="#b29">1990</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Then, the nests were left to dry for 1 week before their composition was quantified by dissecting them into their component materials: twigs, dry grasses, moss, other vegetative material, mud, muddy leaves, thin dead stems, rootlets, and miscellaneous material (Snow 
   <a rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" href="#b36">1958a</a>,b
   <a rid="b37" ref-type="bibr" href="#b37">1958b</a>; Cramp 
   <a rid="b6" ref-type="bibr" href="#b6">1988</a>). Miscellaneous material compromised various nonvegetative materials such as small pieces of polythene and plastic, nylon chord, fishing line, and magnetic tape. Components were weighed on an electronic balance to the nearest 0.05 g. All measurements were taken by one observer (CIJ) meaning that there was no error due to interobserver variability.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spring temperature and precipitation data</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spring temperature and precipitation data were obtained from the British Atmospheric Data Centre. We used the “Met Office – MIDAS Land Surface Stations data (1853–current)” data set to calculate the mean average of the maximum and minimum daily temperatures and the mean average amount of precipitation, from the nearest available (10.75 ± 5.17 km) meteorological stations to each of the study sites. Common Blackbirds at lower latitudes breed earlier than Common Blackbirds at higher latitudes (Snow 
   <a rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" href="#b36">1958a</a>; Cramp 
   <a rid="b6" ref-type="bibr" href="#b6">1988</a>), and so data were obtained for 8 week/56 day periods beginning on April 1, 7, 14, and 21 for the Penryn, Shrewsbury, Lancaster, and Aberdeen study sites, respectively.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistical analyses</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data were analyzed using the SPSS version 20.0 (Armonk, NY) statistical package. We tested for variation in the volume, morphology, composition, and insulatory properties of nests in relation to latitudinal variation in spring temperatures and precipitation using linear mixed models. We used mixed models as they allowed us to control for the possible nonindependence of nests collected within the same study sites by including “study site” as a random effect in the analyses (Crawley 
   <a rid="b7" ref-type="bibr" href="#b7">1993</a>). First, separate models had the various nest size measurements (“external nest diameter,” “internal nest-cup diameter,” “external nest depth,” “internal nest-cup depth,” “nest wall thickness,” and “nest volume”), the various nest materials (“total nest,” “twigs,” “dry grasses,” “moss,” “vegetative material,” “mud,” “muddy leaves,” “thin dead stems,” “rootlets,” and “miscellaneous material”), and “nest insulatory property” as dependent variables, and all models had “spring temperature” included as a fixed explanatory covariate term and “study site” as a random term. We then repeated these analyses with “precipitation” included as the fixed explanatory covariate term, before further partitioning the variance of significant models using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and 
   <span class="italic">post-hoc</span> Tukey tests.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We then explored the roles of nest morphology, volume, and composition in explaining variation in nest insulatory properties. We began by calculating the repeatability (
   <span class="italic">r</span>) values for the cooling rates used to quantify the nest insulatory properties over each of the three tests following the approach suggested by Lessells and Boag (
   <a rid="b19" ref-type="bibr" href="#b19">1987</a>). The ANOVA-based approach is a widely used method to calculate repeatabilities and uses the 
   <span class="italic">F</span> table of an ANOVA with the individual identities treated as factorial predictors. We interpreted the 
   <span class="italic">r</span>-values following the suggestion of Martin and Bateson (
   <a rid="b26" ref-type="bibr" href="#b26">1986</a>), with higher 
   <span class="italic">r</span>-values indicating higher repeatability scores. Variation in nest insulatory properties was then examined using two linear mixed models. The first model had “nest insulatory property” as the dependent variable, the various nest, and cup dimensions, and their two-way interaction terms as fixed explanatory covariate terms and “study site” as a random term. The second model had “nest insulatory property” as the dependent variable, and the various nest materials and their two-way interaction terms as fixed explanatory covariate terms and “study site” as a random term. Both of the maximal models included all of the explanatory variables, and their two-way interaction terms, and explanatory variables were then assessed for significance when they were the last terms in the model. Nonsignificant effects were then sequentially removed by stepwise deletion until the most parsimonious models were obtained, and individual factors are also presented if they were present in a significant interaction term (Crawley 
   <a rid="b7" ref-type="bibr" href="#b7">1993</a>). All statistical tests were two-tailed, means are presented ±1 SE, and a critical 
   <span class="italic">P</span>-value of 0.05 was applied throughout.
