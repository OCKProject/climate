 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Animals across a wide range of taxa construct nests in order to create a safe and environmentally suitable location in which to lay eggs and/or raise offspring (Collias and Collias 
  <a rid="b5" ref-type="bibr" href="#b5">1984</a>; Hansell 
  <a rid="b14" ref-type="bibr" href="#b14">2005</a>). The microclimate within nests directly influences the conditions experienced by the developing offspring, and experimental studies have shown that offspring raised in suboptimal nest microclimates suffer negatively in terms of their growth and development (Peréz et al. 
  <a rid="b31" ref-type="bibr" href="#b31">2008</a>; Ardia et al. 
  <a rid="b3" ref-type="bibr" href="#b3">2010</a>). As parents are in control of their nest construction behavior, and the design of completed nests influences the internal microclimate (Ar and Sidis 
  <a rid="b2" ref-type="bibr" href="#b2">2002</a>; Edelman 
  <a rid="b201" ref-type="bibr" href="#b201">2011</a>), then we should expect natural selection to have acted upon parents so that they build an optimal structure for the local environmental conditions. Furthermore, there may be trade-offs in nest design that differ between sites, for example, a larger nest may be better insulated against temperature loss, but may be more easily detected by potential predators (Møller 
  <a rid="b29" ref-type="bibr" href="#b29">1990</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adaptive variation in nest design in relation to variation in environmental conditions remains generally overlooked (Collias and Collias 
  <a rid="b5" ref-type="bibr" href="#b5">1984</a>), and to our knowledge, only one study has examined whether nest characteristics vary adaptively over small spatial scales. In that study, patterns of nest site selection and nest design by common amakihi's (
  <span class="italic">Hemignathus virens virens</span>) were examined in relation to decreasing ambient temperatures with increasing altitude on Hawaii (Kern and van Riper 
  <a rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" href="#b18">1984</a>). Nests were compared at two sites at different altitudes, and those nests built at higher altitudes were placed closer to canopy edges in order to receive more direct sunlight than nests at the site at lower altitude. Further, nests at higher altitudes also had denser, but not thicker, walls that contained greater amounts of cup lining material and had greater insulation capacities than nests built at the site at a lower altitude (Kern and van Riper 
  <a rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" href="#b18">1984</a>). This study suggests that birds are able to gauge variation in environmental conditions over small spatial scales and adjust their nest-building behaviors to create a suitable microclimate for the offspring and attending parent/s (Hansell 
  <a rid="b13" ref-type="bibr" href="#b13">2000</a>, 
  <a rid="b14" ref-type="bibr" href="#b14">2005</a>). Consequently, nest characteristics should also be expected to vary adaptively over large spatial scales, such as with increasing ambient temperatures as latitude decreases.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Intraspecific studies in birds have shown that American Robin 
  <span class="italic">Turdus migratorius</span> and Yellow Warbler 
  <span class="italic">Dendroica petechia</span> nests were heavier and had thicker nest walls in northern Canada than in southern Canada (Rohwer and Law 
  <a rid="b33" ref-type="bibr" href="#b33">2010</a>; Crossman et al. 
  <a rid="b9" ref-type="bibr" href="#b9">2011</a>). Meanwhile, the amount of cup lining material and insulatory properties of both Blue Tit 
  <span class="italic">Cyanistes caeruleus</span> and Great Tit 
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span> nests decreased with decreasing latitude and increasing spring temperatures in Great Britain (Mainwaring et al. 
  <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2012</a>), and the insulatory properties of northern oriole 
  <span class="italic">Icterus spp</span> nests decreased as latitude decreased in North America (Schaefer 
  <a rid="b34" ref-type="bibr" href="#b34">1980</a>). Consequently, nest characteristics appear to vary adaptively over large spatial scales, yet our understanding is ecologically and taxonomically limited to a few studies that have focused disproportionately on burrow-nesting rodents and hole-nesting birds. Both groups nest in concealed locations and suffer comparatively low levels of nest predation (Martin 
  <a rid="b25" ref-type="bibr" href="#b25">1993</a>; Martin and Briskie 
  <a rid="b27" ref-type="bibr" href="#b27">2009</a>), meaning that they may have more scope than open-nesting species to adjust the design of their nests to create suitable nest microclimates. This is important as minimizing the risk of predation is an important challenge for nesting birds (Lima 
  <a rid="b20" ref-type="bibr" href="#b20">2009</a>), and natural selection favors the construction of small nests, and particularly so amongst open-cup-nesting species (Martin 
  <a rid="b25" ref-type="bibr" href="#b25">1993</a>; Antonov 
  <a rid="b1" ref-type="bibr" href="#b1">2004</a>). Therefore, birds at northerly latitudes may face a trade-off between the need to build a well-insulated nest with the need to build one small enough to minimize the risk of predation. Consequently, our understanding of adaptive variation in nest design over large spatial scales would benefit from studies of open-nesting species (Hansell 
  <a rid="b13" ref-type="bibr" href="#b13">2000</a>). Further, previous studies of open-cup-nesting birds (Rohwer and Law 
  <a rid="b33" ref-type="bibr" href="#b33">2010</a>; Crossman et al. 
  <a rid="b9" ref-type="bibr" href="#b9">2011</a>; but see Schaefer 
  <a rid="b34" ref-type="bibr" href="#b34">1980</a>) have examined nests from two study sites, thereby leaving open the possibility that site-specific effects such as predation risk and habitat quality influenced the females’ nest-building behaviors or the design of the completed nests.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we systematically examined the effects of latitudinal variation in spring temperatures and precipitation on the volume, morphology, composition, and insulatory properties of Common Blackbird 
  <span class="italic">Turdus merula</span> nests (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">1</a>). We chose Common Blackbirds as a study species as they are widespread and numerous throughout Great Britain, and their nests are relatively easy to find. Common Blackbirds are territorially breeding passerine birds that build open-cup nests, and in Great Britain, they are multi-brooded, and the breeding season begins in late February when the female selects the nest site and builds the nest alone (Snow 
  <a rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" href="#b36">1958</a>a,b). Common Blackbird nests consist of a bulky cup of twigs, dry grasses, moss, stalks, and other vegetative material plastered on the inside with mud or muddy leaves and completed by the addition of a substantial cup lined with fine grass, thin dead stems, or rootlets (Snow 
  <a rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" href="#b36">1958a</a>; Cramp 
  <a rid="b6" ref-type="bibr" href="#b6">1988</a>). Females then lay a clutch of 3–5 eggs and incubate the clutch alone, before both parents provision the nestlings. Common Blackbirds have 2–3 broods per year, and so shortly after the nestlings fledge, or when the nest contents are predated, females lay another clutch of eggs either in a freshly built nest or more rarely in the same nest, and the breeding season finishes in late June (Snow 
  <a rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" href="#b36">1958a</a>,b
  <a rid="b37" ref-type="bibr" href="#b37">1958b</a>; Cramp 
  <a rid="b6" ref-type="bibr" href="#b6">1988</a>). In this study, we test three predictions for Common Blackbird nests. First, that as spring temperatures increase with decreasing latitude, the size and morphology of nests will decrease as the need for insulation declines. Second, that the mass of the various building materials will exhibit an inverse relationship with spring temperature. Third, that nest insulatory properties will decrease as the need for insulation diminishes with warmer spring temperatures.
