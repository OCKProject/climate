 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All nests were frozen at −20°C for at least 4 days in order to kill any invertebrates present within the nests, before the insulatory properties of all of the nests from each of the study sites were determined. Nests were placed in a controlled condition environment of 15°C and 70% humidity for a minimum of 72 h (following McGowan et al. 
  <a rid="b28" ref-type="bibr" href="#b28">2004</a>; Mainwaring et al. 
  <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2012</a>) before the insulatory properties were quantified in a 10°C constant temperature and 70% constant humidity room. Nests were placed onto a hard surface, and two iButtons (Maxim: DS1922L) were heated to 80°C with the “nest” iButton gently pushed into the base of the nest cup and the “control” iButton placed 5 cm away on an adjacent hard surface and at the same height. Then, both the “nest” and the “control” iButtons were left to cool for 30 min, while they recorded the temperature every 20 sec. The cooling rates of the nests were used to quantify the insulatory properties of the nests (following McGowan et al. 
  <a rid="b28" ref-type="bibr" href="#b28">2004</a>; Mainwaring et al. 
  <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2012</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cooling rates were obtained for each nest by fitting the empirical temperature data to logistic models of the form: temperature of iButton – ambient temperature + 
  <span class="italic">b</span>e
  <span class="sup">−
   <span class="italic">ct</span>
  </span>, where 
  <span class="italic">b</span> is the initial temperature gradient between the iButton and ambient, 
  <span class="italic">c</span> describes the cooling rate of the iButton, 
  <span class="italic">t</span> is the time since the experiment began in seconds, and e is the base of natural logarithms. The nest insulatory properties were calculated as the differences in 
  <span class="italic">c</span> of the “nest” and “control” iButtons, with a large positive difference indicating high nest insulation (following McGowan et al. 
  <a rid="b28" ref-type="bibr" href="#b28">2004</a>; Mainwaring et al. 
  <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2012</a>). The insulatory properties of all nests were quantified three times, with the iButtons placed in the same place each time, and the mean of the three scores was used in the analyses.
