 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data were analyzed using the SPSS version 20.0 (Armonk, NY) statistical package. We tested for variation in the volume, morphology, composition, and insulatory properties of nests in relation to latitudinal variation in spring temperatures and precipitation using linear mixed models. We used mixed models as they allowed us to control for the possible nonindependence of nests collected within the same study sites by including “study site” as a random effect in the analyses (Crawley 
  <a rid="b7" ref-type="bibr" href="#b7">1993</a>). First, separate models had the various nest size measurements (“external nest diameter,” “internal nest-cup diameter,” “external nest depth,” “internal nest-cup depth,” “nest wall thickness,” and “nest volume”), the various nest materials (“total nest,” “twigs,” “dry grasses,” “moss,” “vegetative material,” “mud,” “muddy leaves,” “thin dead stems,” “rootlets,” and “miscellaneous material”), and “nest insulatory property” as dependent variables, and all models had “spring temperature” included as a fixed explanatory covariate term and “study site” as a random term. We then repeated these analyses with “precipitation” included as the fixed explanatory covariate term, before further partitioning the variance of significant models using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and

  <span class="italic">r</span>) values for the cooling rates used to quantify the nest insulatory properties over each of the three tests following the approach suggested by Lessells and Boag (
  <a rid="b19" ref-type="bibr" href="#b19">1987</a>). The ANOVA-based approach is a widely used method to calculate repeatabilities and uses the 
  <span class="italic">F</span> table of an ANOVA with the individual identities treated as factorial predictors. We interpreted the 
  <span class="italic">r</span>-values following the suggestion of Martin and Bateson (
  <a rid="b26" ref-type="bibr" href="#b26">1986</a>), with higher 
  <span class="italic">r</span>-values indicating higher repeatability scores. Variation in nest insulatory properties was then examined using two linear mixed models. The first model had “nest insulatory property” as the dependent variable, the various nest, and cup dimensions, and their two-way interaction terms as fixed explanatory covariate terms and “study site” as a random term. The second model had “nest insulatory property” as the dependent variable, and the various nest materials and their two-way interaction terms as fixed explanatory covariate terms and “study site” as a random term. Both of the maximal models included all of the explanatory variables, and their two-way interaction terms, and explanatory variables were then assessed for significance when they were the last terms in the model. Nonsignificant effects were then sequentially removed by stepwise deletion until the most parsimonious models were obtained, and individual factors are also presented if they were present in a significant interaction term (Crawley 
  <a rid="b7" ref-type="bibr" href="#b7">1993</a>). All statistical tests were two-tailed, means are presented ±1 SE, and a critical 
  <span class="italic">P</span>-value of 0.05 was applied throughout.
