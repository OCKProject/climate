  <span class="italic">n</span> = 14), Lancaster (54.00°N; 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 14), Shrewsbury (52.43°N; 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 14), and Penryn (50.05°N; 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 15); spread over 7° of latitude in Great Britain (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">2</a>). At each site, suitable areas of habitat were searched regularly for Common Blackbird's nests, but once located the nests were left alone until the end of July when they were collected and placed into sealed and labeled plastic bags, before being transported to Lancaster University.
