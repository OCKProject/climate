 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The volume and morphology of nests were quantified in two ways. First, we measured five aspects of nest morphology: external nest diameter (±0.05 cm), internal nest-cup diameter (±0.05 cm), external nest depth (±0.05 cm), internal nest-cup depth (±0.05 cm), and nest wall thickness (±0.05 cm). The external nest diameter is the mean of the maximum and minimum diameters of the outer nest cup, and the internal nest-cup diameter is the mean of the maximum and minimum diameters of the inner nest cup. The external nest depth was quantified as the distance from the top rim of the nest walls to the bottom of the nest exterior. The internal nest-cup depth is the distance from the top of the rim of the nest walls to the base of the interior nest cup, where the eggs would be. Meanwhile, the nest wall thickness was quantified as the mean of eight evenly spaced measurements of the nest wall. Then, as the nests of open-cup-nesting birds such as Common Blackbirds are approximately shaped as half a spheroid, the volume of nests was calculated by determining the outer nest volume from the following equation: nest volume = 2/3

  <span class="sup">2</span>
  <span class="italic">b</span>, where “
  <span class="italic">a</span>” is the largest, and “
  <span class="italic">b</span>” is the smallest value of the outer radius and the height of the nest, respectively (following Møller

  <a rid="b6" ref-type="bibr" href="#b6">1988</a>). Miscellaneous material compromised various nonvegetative materials such as small pieces of polythene and plastic, nylon chord, fishing line, and magnetic tape. Components were weighed on an electronic balance to the nearest 0.05 g. All measurements were taken by one observer (CIJ) meaning that there was no error due to interobserver variability.
