 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have provided evidence that the nest construction behavior of an open-cup-nesting bird species varies adaptively in a systematic manner in response to large-scale spatial variation in spring temperatures, but not precipitation. Importantly, by examining nests from four study sites along a latitudinal gradient, we have significantly reduced the chances that site-specific effects such as breeding habitat quality, predation pressure, and nutrient availability may have influenced the females’ nest-building behaviors or the design of the completed nests (Crossman et al. 
  <a rid="b9" ref-type="bibr" href="#b9">2011</a>; Mainwaring et al. 
  <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2012</a>). Unfortunately, we do not know the precise dates on which the nests were built nor the subsequent dates on which eggs were laid, which means that we are unable to examine possible seasonal changes in the volume, morphology, composition, and insulatory properties of the nests (Mainwaring and Hartley 
  <a rid="b21" ref-type="bibr" href="#b21">2008</a>; Deeming et al. 
  <a rid="b10" ref-type="bibr" href="#b10">2012</a>). Further, we cannot exclude the possibility that some nests were used as breeding sites twice during the spring, although the reuse of nests is rare (Snow 
  <a rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" href="#b36">1958a</a>,
  <a rid="b37" ref-type="bibr" href="#b37">b</a>; Cramp 
  <a rid="b6" ref-type="bibr" href="#b6">1988</a>). Nevertheless, we remain confident that latitudinal variation in such nest leftacteristics represents biologically meaningful patterns.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The insulatory properties of the Common Blackbird's nests decreased with warmer temperatures at lower latitudes, thereby supporting our third prediction, which posited that nest insulatory properties would decrease as the need for insulation diminished with warmer spring temperatures. This suggests that the decreasing spring temperatures were counteracted by the increasing nest wall thickness and by increasing the amount of grass within nest walls. This should help create an optimal microclimate for incubating eggs and brooding nestlings along the latitudinal gradient. The systematic variation in nest morphology and composition to create suitable nest microclimates along the latitudinal gradient also supports our first two predictions, which posited that morphology of nests would decrease as the need for insulation declines in warmer environments and that the mass of the various building materials will exhibit an inverse relationship with spring temperature, respectively. This is important as previous experimental studies have shown that nestlings raised in suboptimal nest microclimates suffer reduced growth and development (Peréz et al. 
  <a rid="b31" ref-type="bibr" href="#b31">2008</a>; Ardia et al. 
  <a rid="b3" ref-type="bibr" href="#b3">2010</a>; DuRant et al. 
  <a rid="b11" ref-type="bibr" href="#b11">2013</a>). Meanwhile, the amount of precipitation at the four study sites did not vary with latitude, and none of the nest leftacteristics varied with the amount of spring precipitation. The absence of any consistent trends with precipitation suggests that spring temperatures are a much better predictor of nest leftacteristics. This may be expected as incubating parents protect eggs from precipitation, meaning that precipitation may not be expected to determine nest design (Kern and van Riper 
  <a rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" href="#b18">1984</a>; Heenan and Seymour 
  <a rid="b15" ref-type="bibr" href="#b15">2011</a>). However, it is prudent to consider that the microenvironment in which individual nests were located may have also influenced the design of nests, and while the Common Blackbirds in our study may have positioned nests in dry conditions, such as directly under logs and branches, it may be more difficult to ameliorate the effects of ambient temperatures (Crossman et al. 
  <a rid="b9" ref-type="bibr" href="#b9">2011</a>). Further studies could usefully examine the relative influence of a range of environmental variables, such as temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and cloud cover, on nest-building behaviors and nest design.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The amount of grass incorporated into nests increased in cooler environments at higher latitudes and the insulatory property of individual nests, irrespective of study site, was positively correlated with the amount of grass within nests. While these two lines of evidence suggest that incorporating grass increased the insulatory quality of nests, a previous study showed that of a range of commonly used nesting materials, grass was the material that provided the worst insulation (Hilton et al. 
  <a rid="b16" ref-type="bibr" href="#b16">2004</a>). This apparent disparity may be explained by the fact that in our study, grass was incorporated into nests with thicker nest walls, meaning that it was the thickness of the nest walls generally, and not the amount of grassy material in the nests 
  <span class="italic">per se</span> that resulted in those nests having greater insulation properties. Irrespective of the exact function of the various nesting materials, however, the construction of thermally optimal nests in cooler environments must be traded off against both the associated energetic costs of constructing a larger nest (Skowron and Kern 
  <a rid="b35" ref-type="bibr" href="#b35">1980</a>; Mainwaring and Hartley 
  <a rid="b22" ref-type="bibr" href="#b22">2009</a>, 
  <a rid="b23" ref-type="bibr" href="#b23">2013</a>) and the requirement to build smaller nests that minimize the risk of predation from visually searching predators.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Avoiding predation is a continuous challenge for nesting birds (Lima 
  <a rid="b20" ref-type="bibr" href="#b20">2009</a>), and natural selection exerts strong selection pressures on the design of nests, particularly amongst open-cup-nesting birds (Martin 
  <a rid="b25" ref-type="bibr" href="#b25">1993</a>; Martin and Briskie 
  <a rid="b27" ref-type="bibr" href="#b27">2009</a>). Empirical studies have shown that larger nests of open-cup-nesting species are predated more frequently than smaller nests (Antonov 
  <a rid="b1" ref-type="bibr" href="#b1">2004</a>; Lima 
  <a rid="b20" ref-type="bibr" href="#b20">2009</a>). In Common Blackbirds, observational studies have shown that nests with greater external diameters (Gregoire et al. 
  <a rid="b12" ref-type="bibr" href="#b12">2003</a>) and nests that are more detectable (Cresswell 
  <a rid="b8" ref-type="bibr" href="#b8">1997</a>) suffer disproportionately high levels of predation, and an experimental study showed that artificially enlarged nests were predated more frequently than nests that remained unchanged in size and nests that were made artificially smaller (Møller 
  <a rid="b29" ref-type="bibr" href="#b29">1990</a>). Reassuringly, previous reports of nest dimensions for this species (Bocheński 
  <a rid="b4" ref-type="bibr" href="#b4">1968</a>; Pikula 
  <a rid="b32" ref-type="bibr" href="#b32">1983</a>) are comparable to data presented here, suggesting that the nests in our study are typical for Common Blackbirds. Nevertheless, the selection for nests with smaller diameters could also be inferred from our study, as while the internal nest-cup diameters of nests did not vary along the latitudinal gradient, nests in cooler environments at higher latitudes had thicker walls and larger external diameters. This suggests that those Common Blackbirds living at higher latitudes were forced to build wider nests than their conspecifics living in warmer environments. This may simply keep the nest microclimate within acceptable limits for embryonic development (Webb 
  <a rid="b39" ref-type="bibr" href="#b39">1987</a>) or may reflect a response of the adult to the prevailing temperature, which is unrelated to the requirements of the eggs or chicks and more related to the thermal needs of the incubating female (Britt and Deeming 
  <a rid="b202" ref-type="bibr" href="#b202">2011</a>). It does suggest that those Common Blackbirds living in warmer environments at more southerly latitudes were building nests that were wide enough to provide structural support for developing offspring and attending parent (Collias and Collias 
  <a rid="b5" ref-type="bibr" href="#b5">1984</a>; Heenan and Seymour 
  <a rid="b15" ref-type="bibr" href="#b15">2011</a>), but not any larger as the relatively benign environmental conditions enabled them not to. Therefore, female Common Blackbirds in the northerly study areas may have been trading off the need to build a well-insulated nest with one that was small enough to minimize the risk of predation. Consequently, the possibility of a trade-off between building a large and well-insulated nest with one that is small enough to minimize the risk of predation is clearly a fruitful area for further research.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The marginally significant trend toward a decline in the amount of mosses incorporated into nests as spring temperatures increased suggests that moss may have a insulatory role or is important in bulking out the nest wall. While it is unlikely that any of the materials used in Common Blackbird nests will be limited at any particular location, the potential for changing environmental conditions to impact upon the availability of materials for nest building remains unclear. For example, mud is an important component of nests of many other species (Hansell 
  <a rid="b13" ref-type="bibr" href="#b13">2000</a>), and it has been suggested that it may become limited as increasing temperatures cause soils to become drier and harder to penetrate by birds (Tomialojc 
  <a rid="b38" ref-type="bibr" href="#b38">1992</a>). Further, it was postulated that the limited availability of mud may have been an important factor in restricting the nesting distribution of the Song Thrush 
  <span class="italic">Turdus philomelos</span> (Tomialojc 
  <a rid="b38" ref-type="bibr" href="#b38">1992</a>). Meanwhile, increasing ambient temperatures are predicted to increase the availability of nutrients in the soil, which is likely to decrease the distribution and growth of mosses through increased competition from vascular plants (O'Neil 
  <a rid="b30" ref-type="bibr" href="#b30">2000</a>; Jägerbrand et al. 
  <a rid="b17" ref-type="bibr" href="#b17">2003</a>). While this study suggests that Common Blackbirds are currently able to collect sufficient amounts of mud to build their nests, further temporal changes in environmental conditions as a result of anthropogenic climate change may mean that materials such as mosses may become a limited resource in the future (Mainwaring et al. 
  <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2012</a>). Further research could therefore usefully examine the effects of rising temperatures on the availability of nesting materials for birds.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study suggests that open-cup-nesting birds systematically vary the design of their nests in response to large-scale latitudinal variation in spring temperatures, but not precipitation. Accordingly, there are three areas of research that are likely to prove fruitful in the future. First, further research should aim to examine the generality of our findings by examining spatial variation in nest leftacteristics over larger continental scales both in similar open-cup-nesting species and in ecologically different hole-nesting species, as the two are likely to construct nests while under different selection pressures. Such studies should aim to examine larger numbers of nests collected from more sites across multiple years. Second, it would be interesting to quantify the availability of various nesting materials, such as grasses, mosses, and mud in order to examine whether the availability of nesting materials differs between study sites. Third, it would be useful to examine how the thermal properties of nests influence the length of incubation periods and the phenotypic quality of neonates under natural incubation conditions.</p>
