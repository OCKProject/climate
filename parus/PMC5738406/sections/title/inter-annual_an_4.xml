 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the final model explaining the variability of beech and spruce M_index, the high frequency (i.e., inter-annual) components of all seasonal NAO indices were significant (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05, two-sided test), except winter-NAO 
  <span class="italic">Y</span>
  <sub>M−1</sub> for both species and the summer-NAO 
  <span class="italic">Y</span>
  <sub>M−2</sub> for spruce (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). Conversely, among the low-frequency (i.e., decadal trends) components, only winter-NAO was significant (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001) and displayed a strong positive effect on both species. Of all two-way interactions, low-frequency winter-NAO × high-frequency summer-NAO 
  <span class="italic">Y</span>
  <sub>M−1</sub> was significant (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05, 
  <span class="italic">β</span> = + 0.24) in the beech model, but reduced the model Aikaike’s information criterion (AIC) by only three points (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The beech model accurately described (pseudo-
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.59) the observed M_index between 1952 and 2015 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>), correctly reproducing most individual peaks (e.g., 1960, 1995, 2000, and 2014), and prolonged periods of high (e.g., 1989–1995) or low M_index (e.g., 1961–1985). The spruce model performed less well (pseudo-
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.42) and failed to reproduce some peaks (e.g., 1974, 1995, 2004, 2006, and 2009). Models residuals generally showed no systematic bias and patterns (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>), except that the precision of the model increased for higher 
  <span class="italic">AR1</span>. This is expected, as after high masting there is often low masting, but the opposite is not the case. The leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) was successful for beech (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.76) but less successful for spruce (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.48). However, both models accurately captured the shift in the frequency of large-scale masting events that occurred around 1985, from a period characterized by low M_index with relatively infrequent peaks, to a period of more regular large-scale masting events with high M_index. However, residual patterns (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>) and LOOCV (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>) revealed that the model failed to predict the masting peak in 1958 for beech, highly underestimated the peaks in 1974, 2004, and 2011 for both species, and highly overestimated the low value in 1997.
