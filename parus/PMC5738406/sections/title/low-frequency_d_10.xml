 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test whether low-frequency changes in NAO influence beech and spruce masting, and to extract the frequency domain of such relationship, we carried out a wavelet coherence analysis using the 
  <span class="italic">wtc</span> function in the R package 
  <span class="italic">biwavelet</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>
  </span>. Wavelet analysis has often been applied to test for causality between teleconnections and geophysical processes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>
  </span>, and allows assessment of whether such relationships are time-stationary across the frequency domain
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>
  </span>. To avoid bias due to non-normality
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>
  </span>, M_index of both species was arcsine-transformed
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>
  </span> before the wavelet analysis (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>, right column). Wavelet analysis for spruce was limited to the period 1950–2014, as before 1950 there were too few data to calculate M_index (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a> right), whereas for beech we used data extending back to 1826 (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a> left). From 1950 to 2015 we used seasonal NAO indices by NOAA aggregating months as for the initial regression model. However, to extend the beech analysis before 1950 we used seasonal NAO indices provided by Hurrell
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span> and Jones et al.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>
  </span>, which cover the periods 1899–2015 and 1826–2015, respectively. The NOAA and Hurrell series are suited to test for coherence using all seasonal indices, because they are based on principal component analysis of sea level pressure over the North Atlantic
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">65</a>
  </span>. Conversely, the Jones index is station-based (with fixed stations located in the Azores and Iceland), which makes it robust for winter NAO only
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. Consequently, the wavelet coherence analysis for 1826–1899 was carried out on winter-NAO calculated from Jones et al.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>
  </span> only.

 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each wavelet coherence analysis was computed using Morlet continuous wavelet transform and considering the lag − 1 autocorrelation of each series
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>
  </span>. The data were padded with zeros at each end to reduce wraparound effects. Significance of coherence within all frequency domains larger than five years (i.e., low frequencies) was tested using a time-average test and 500 Monte Carlo randomizations.
