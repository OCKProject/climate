  </span>, we analysed the correlation between significant NAO patterns, as in the final regression model, and local weather anomalies. At each grid point of Europe, we computed the Spearman correlation between seasonal NAO indices and both precipitation and temperature series. Monthly precipitation and temperature were obtained from the Climate Research Unit database (version TS4.00). CRU time series and the NAO series were aggregated to the periods DJFM (December–January–February–March), AM (April–May), and JJAS (June–July–August–September), and linearly detrended. The period between 1950 and 2015 was considered for the correlation analysis.
