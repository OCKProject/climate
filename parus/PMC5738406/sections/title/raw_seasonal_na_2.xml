 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The large-scale masting index (M_index) for beech in Central-Northern Europe (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>, left) displayed the highest values (above 95
  <span class="sup">th</span> percentile) in years 1773, 1811, 1846, 1858, 1869, 1888, 1900, 1909, 1918, 1926, 1948, 1958, 1995, 2006, and 2011. From 1950 to 2014, the spruce M_index was significantly correlated with the beech M_index (Pearson = 0.58, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001, two-sided test) and several synchronized large-mast events were shared by both species (e.g., 1974, 1990, 1992, 1995, 2000, 2004, 2006, and 2011) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). For both species, the period used for model building showed transitions between prolonged high (i.e., in early ‘50 s, early ‘90 s of the twentieth century, and in 2010s) and prolonged low M_index (e.g., 1961 to 1986) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Interestingly, this last period coincided with a reduced and non-significant correlation between the two series (Pearson = 0.35, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.12).
