   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001, two-sided test) and several synchronized large-mast events were shared by both species (e.g., 1974, 1990, 1992, 1995, 2000, 2004, 2006, and 2011) (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). For both species, the period used for model building showed transitions between prolonged high (i.e., in early ‘50 s, early ‘90 s of the twentieth century, and in 2010s) and prolonged low M_index (e.g., 1961 to 1986) (Fig.

  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Long-term analyses (&gt; 50 years) on beech data revealed that coherence between the beech M_index and winter-NAO varied through time. In the first half of the twentieth century, both the Hurrell (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>) and the Jones (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>) indices did not show any significant coherence with M_index, and only in the second half of the nineteenth century an in-phase influence of winter-NAO on the beech M_index emerged, again with a frequency domain of 7 to 16 years (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>). Summer-NAO and M_index of both species were significantly coherent for a short period around 1980 (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5b</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6a</a> and 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6c</a>), but for beech the signal in the domain of 7 to 16 years remained throughout the 20
   <span class="sup">th</span> century (albeit weakly). Finally, a significant coherence between spring-NAO and beech M_index was found using both NOAA, and Hurrell indices since 1985 at frequencies of about 8 to 16 years, but this was mostly out of the cone of influence (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6b</a> and 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6d</a>). For spruce, a coherence with spring-NAO remained weak around 11 years for the second half of the twentieth century (Supplementary Fig.

  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite major differences in significance and stationarity between the winter-NAO and the summer- and spring-NAO, we opted for further testing of the low-frequency component of all seasonal NAO indices. In the final regression models, low-frequency indices with a periodicity of 11 years (i.e., the midpoint between 7 and 16 years) were included for both species.</p>

   <sub>M−1</sub> was significant (

   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The beech model accurately described (pseudo-
   <span class="italic">R</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.59) the observed M_index between 1952 and 2015 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>), correctly reproducing most individual peaks (e.g., 1960, 1995, 2000, and 2014), and prolonged periods of high (e.g., 1989–1995) or low M_index (e.g., 1961–1985). The spruce model performed less well (pseudo-
   <span class="italic">R</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.42) and failed to reproduce some peaks (e.g., 1974, 1995, 2004, 2006, and 2009). Models residuals generally showed no systematic bias and patterns (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>), except that the precision of the model increased for higher 
   <span class="italic">AR1</span>. This is expected, as after high masting there is often low masting, but the opposite is not the case. The leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) was successful for beech (
   <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.76) but less successful for spruce (
   <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.48). However, both models accurately captured the shift in the frequency of large-scale masting events that occurred around 1985, from a period characterized by low M_index with relatively infrequent peaks, to a period of more regular large-scale masting events with high M_index. However, residual patterns (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>) and LOOCV (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>) revealed that the model failed to predict the masting peak in 1958 for beech, highly underestimated the peaks in 1974, 2004, and 2011 for both species, and highly overestimated the low value in 1997.
