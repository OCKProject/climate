  <p>NAO and related weather patterns in temperature and precipitation. Correlation between NAO and temperature anomalies (first row), and between NAO and precipitation anomalies (second row) for the seasons winter, spring, summer (columns from left to right). Regions with significant correlations are denoted by black dots. Monthly precipitation and temperature have been obtained from the CRU database (version TS4.00). We aggregated these time series into seasonal time-series and the NAO indices according to our experiment design: winter (December–January–February–March, DJFM), spring (April–May, AM), and summer (June–July–August–September, JJAS). The period between 1950 and 2015 was considered for the correlation analysis. Figure created using ggplot2 package for R
