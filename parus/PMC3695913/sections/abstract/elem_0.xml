 <p>Stochastic winter weather events are predicted to increase in occurrence and amplitude at northern latitudes and organisms are expected to cope through phenotypic flexibility. Small avian species wintering in these environments show acclimatization where basal metabolic rate (BMR) and maximal thermogenic capacity (M
  <sub>SUM</sub>) are typically elevated. However, little is known on intra-seasonal variation in metabolic performance and on how population trends truly reflect individual flexibility. Here we report intra-seasonal variation in metabolic parameters measured at the population and individual levels in black-capped chickadees (

  </div>). Results confirmed that population patterns indeed reflect flexibility at the individual level. They showed the expected increase in BMR (6%) and M
  <sub>SUM</sub> (34%) in winter relative to summer but also, and most importantly, that these parameters changed differently through time. BMR began its seasonal increase in November, while M
  <sub>SUM</sub> had already achieved more than 20% of its inter-seasonal increase by October, and declined to its starting level by March, while M
  <sub>SUM</sub> remained high. Although both parameters co-vary on a yearly scale, this mismatch in the timing of variation in winter BMR and M
  <sub>SUM</sub> likely reflects different constraints acting on different physiological components and therefore suggests a lack of functional link between these parameters.
