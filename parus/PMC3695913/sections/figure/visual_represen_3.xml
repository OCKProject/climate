  <div class="title">Visual representation of the monthly winter increment in metabolic performance.</div>
  <p>Increment in mass-independent BMR (A) and M
   <sub>SUM</sub> (B) relative to summer values. Data measured in August are used as the summer phenotype reference point (August = 0%, black star, dashed line) while maximal levels of BMR and M
   <sub>SUM</sub> recorded in winter are considered representative of the “peak” winter phenotype (February = 100%). Monthly changes in metabolic performance (values above lines) are presented in percent of total inter-seasonal difference. Dotted lines represent BMR variations below the summer reference point.
