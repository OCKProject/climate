  <div class="title">Monthly variation at the population and individual levels in mass-independent BMR, M

  <p>Population data (black line and dots) are least square means for BMR (A), M
   <sub>SUM</sub> (B) and ME (C) controlling for year, month, sex, body mass and bird ID as random parameter. In B and C - dotted line, open dots and uppercase: 1
   <span class="sup">st</span> year; solid line, black dots and lowercase: 2
   <span class="sup">nd</span> year. Different letters represent significant difference between months within a year. Predicted values calculated from LMEs (see text for details) are used to visualize data from individuals captured more than once (grey lines).
