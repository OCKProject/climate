 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Once at the field station, birds were maintained in separate cages (39 cm x 43 cm x 31 cm) supplied with food (sunflower seed) and water 
  <span class="italic">ad libitum</span> until measurements were made. Cages were kept in a room receiving natural light through a window and maintained quiet to avoid disturbance. At around 13: 00, we began M
  <sub>SUM</sub> trials by measuring two birds in parallel using Fox, Box oxygen analyzers (Sable Systems, Las Vegas, NV, USA). This was followed by a second trial on the remaining two birds, which began before 15: 00. Briefly, birds were first weighed (± 0.1 g) and body temperature was measured with a thermocouple reader (Omega model HH-25KC, NIST-traceable, Omega, Montréal, Qc, Canada) using a copper-constantan thermocouple inserted into the cloacae approximately 10 mm deep. Then, birds were put in a stainless steel metabolic chamber fitted with a perch and were exposed to helox gas (21% oxygen, 79% helium) using an average flow rate of 1109 ml.min
  <span class="sup">-1</span> controlled by mass flow valves (Sierra Instruments, Side-Trak® Model 840 (Monterey, CA, USA)). We recorded oxygen consumption of each bird using a sliding cold exposure protocol [
  <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">37</a>] with a decrease in ambient temperature of 3°C every 20 minutes, starting at 0°C in winter and at 6°C in summer. We ended the trials when birds became hypothermic, which was easily identifiable in real time as a steady decline in oxygen consumption for several minutes. Body temperature was measured again immediately after taking birds out of their chambers. We assumed a bird had reached its M
  <sub>SUM</sub> when body temperature after a trial was ≤ 38°C [
  <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">38</a>] (mean body temperature after M
  <sub>SUM</sub> measurement = 33.6 ± 0.2°C). Data from individuals showing a body temperature above this threshold were discarded. Birds were weighed again after measurements and the average body mass was used for the M
  <sub>SUM</sub> analysis. Birds were then brought back to their cage with food and water 
  <span class="italic">ad libitum</span> until BMR measurement starting at 19: 00.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each day, all four birds had their BMR measured simultaneously overnight (from 19: 00 to 06:00). Individuals were maintained at 30°C throughout the trial (within the thermoneutral zone for this species [
  <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">39</a>]) and received a constant flow of air. Birds were weighed before and after measurements and average mass was used in BMR analyses.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Oxygen analyzers were adjusted each day to 20.95% using CO
  <sub>2</sub>-free dry air and mass flow valves were carefully calibrated for air and helox using a bubble-O-meter (Dublin, OH, USA) once per winter. Metabolic rate calculations were done with ExpeData software, v 1.2.6 (Sable Systems, Las Vegas, NV, USA). M
  <sub>SUM</sub> and BMR calculations were based respectively on the highest and lowest averaged 10 minutes of oxygen consumption per measurement sequence according to Lighton’s equation 10.1 [
  <a rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40">40</a>]. The instantaneous measurement technique [
  <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">41</a>] was used for M
  <sub>SUM</sub> while BMR was calculated using the steady state approach. The duration of BMR trials (around 11 hours) insured that birds were post-absorptive at time of BMR measurement (which was obtained after 6 h 40 min ± 8 min of recording on average). Since wintering birds use mostly lipids as substrate for shivering [

  <a rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42">42</a>,
