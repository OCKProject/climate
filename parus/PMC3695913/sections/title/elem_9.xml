   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">table 1)</a>. The coldest average temperature was recorded in December, and the lowest minimal temperature was measured in February. During the second year (2010-2011), mean temperatures fell below 0°C from November to March and reached their coldest mean ambient and minimal values in January (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">table 1)</a>. However, the following months remained relatively cold as minimal temperatures changed by less than one degree in the next two months. Overall, the second winter of the study was colder than the first and had more months with minimal temperatures below -25°C.
