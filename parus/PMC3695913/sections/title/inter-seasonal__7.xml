 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We first studied inter-seasonal variation in body mass and metabolic performance. To do so, we used a linear mixed effect model (LME) to test for effects of “year”, “season” (winter or summer), “sex” (male, female or undetermined) and interaction term “year*season”, using bird ID as random parameter, on whole BMR, M
  <sub>SUM</sub> and ME. We also included the variable “relative time of capture” (time since sunrise / day length, hereafter “time of capture”) for body mass analyses. We then used the same model including body mass as a covariate to analyse variations in mass-independent metabolic performance.
