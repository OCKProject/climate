 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To study intra-seasonal variation (i.e. within winter) in parameters of metabolic performance, we used the same model but this time testing for the effects of “year”, “month”, “sex” and the interaction term “year*month”, again using bird ID as random parameter. “Time of capture” was also considered when analysing variations in body mass. To study effects on mass-independent variables we repeated the analyses including body mass as a covariate.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We saved residuals from those LMEs to study relationships between whole and mass-independent winter BMR and M
  <sub>SUM</sub>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Variables were removed from models when non-significant and results from final models are presented. In cases where the interaction term year*month was significant, we ran separate analyses by year. We used Tukey tests to investigate differences between months and between sexes. Analyses on metabolic parameters showed the same final patterns whether or not body mass was included as a covariate. We therefore present results for mass-independent BMR, M
  <sub>SUM</sub> and ME. Data for these variables without mass corrections are available in the Supporting Information files (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0068292.s001" href="#pone.0068292.s001">table S1</a>-S2). In all cases, residuals were tested for normality using the one sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Population data are presented as least square means ± s.e.m., and intra-individual data are shown as predicted values (original values corrected for the effects that were found significant at the population level).
