 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(d) Is metabolic expansibility a meaningful variable?</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we considered metabolic expansibility as an indicator of the capacity of an organism to produce heat (because it was based on M
  <sub>SUM</sub>) for a given size of metabolic machinery (which would be reflected by BMR) [
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>,
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">15</a>,
  <a rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26">26</a>,
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">28</a>,
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">34</a>]. However, the lack of correlation between BMR and M
  <sub>SUM</sub>, as observed by others [
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">15</a>,
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">27</a>,
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">28</a>,
  <a rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57">57</a>], as well as the temporal mismatch in these parameters during seasonal acclimatization suggest a lack of a functional relationship between BMR and M
  <sub>SUM</sub>. Although BMR includes the resting energy consumption of physiolgical components involved in active thermogenesis (i.e. muscles), evidences suggest that, in the context of cold acclimatization, its variations are mainly influenced by activity and size of organ systems involved in energy acquisition and digestion [
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>,
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">30</a>,
  <a rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52">52</a>], while M
  <sub>SUM</sub> would mostly reflect active energy consumption of shivering muscles [
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">21</a>,
  <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">31</a>,
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">32</a>]. It therefore becomes apparent to us that metabolic expansibility, as we defined it earlier, may lead to misleading conclusions about machinery adjustments. We therefore suggest caution with the interpretation of this variable and recommend interpreting variations in BMR and M
  <sub>SUM</sub> separately to infer on animals metabolic capacity.
