  <sub>SUM</sub>
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temperature has been suggested as one of the drivers of winter metabolic performance [
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>,
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>,
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>,
  <a rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48">48</a>] and this led us to predict a gradual increase in BMR and M
  <sub>SUM</sub> during winter where a peak would be observed during the coldest months of the season. Seasonal variations in BMR were of lower amplitude than expected but changes in average values were consistent with our prediction. Although significant differences were only clear when comparing February with October, November and March, BMR clearly tended to be higher during December, January and February, the coldest months of winter (both years combined, 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">table 1)</a>. However, BMR declined rapidly in March, when ambient temperatures were still relatively cold (-16°C and -27°C mean minimum temperature in 2010 and 2011 respectively), which suggests that temperature may not be the sole driver of winter BMR phenotype in chickadees.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast, intra-seasonal changes in average M
  <sub>SUM</sub> differed between years. During the first winter, M
  <sub>SUM</sub> peaked in February and declined in March while in the second year M
  <sub>SUM</sub> increased until the end of our measurements in March. M
  <sub>SUM</sub> variations were therefore consistent with our predictions for the first year, where February was the coldest month based on minimal temperature, but were counterintuitive for the second year where no decline in M
  <sub>SUM</sub> were observed. It must be noted, however, that cold energy-demanding temperatures lasted much longer during the second winter since, although daily temperatures were already warming by March, minimal temperatures were as cold in March as in January. It is therefore likely that birds maintained their thermogenic capacity to its maximal level as long as days with very cold temperature prevailed. As metabolic expansibility is the ratio of M
  <sub>SUM</sub> on BMR, and given the differences in range of intra-seasonal changes in BMR and M
  <sub>SUM</sub>, variations in ME were inevitably affected by changes in M
  <sub>SUM</sub>. It was therefore of no surprise to find similar variation when comparing ME and M
  <sub>SUM</sub>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The contrast in BMR and M
  <sub>SUM</sub> patterns goes in hand with the hypothesis that these components of metabolic performance respond to different sets of environmental constraints [
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>,
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">27</a>,
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">28</a>]. Comparing intra-seasonal patterns of change in BMR and M
  <sub>SUM</sub> relative to summer values also suggests a certain level of independence between these parameters. Although it was moderate, the increase in mass-independent BMR between seasons (+5.9% comparing August and February) was the same as that detected between October and February (+5.9%). In fact, the increase in BMR started after November, when birds began to face minimal temperatures below -10°C (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">table 1)</a>, and remained relatively steady until February (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068292-g004" href="#pone-0068292-g004">Figure 4A)</a>. In contrast, the inter-seasonal change in mass-independent M
  <sub>SUM</sub> (+34.2% between August and February) was higher than that measured within season (+25.0% between October and February). In fact, M
  <sub>SUM</sub> had already achieved 21.8% of its inter-seasonal increase when we began our measurements in October (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068292-g004" href="#pone-0068292-g004">Figure 4B)</a> meaning that, although the largest change in M
  <sub>SUM</sub> appeared between January and February (+45.4% of total inter-seasonal increase, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068292-g004" href="#pone-0068292-g004">Figure 4B)</a>, this parameter began to change well before the beginning of sub-zero mean ambient temperatures (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">table 1)</a>. These results therefore suggest that flexible adjustments in thermogenic capacity appear relatively early in autumn (before October) while physiological components reflected in BMR only begin to change later (from November).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Why would BMR begin to increase later in autumn and decline earlier in the spring than M
  <sub>SUM</sub>? The reasons for the uncoupling of these variables are not clear. However, if one considers M
  <sub>SUM</sub> as a variable mainly influenced by the size of shivering muscles [
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">21</a>,
  <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">31</a>,
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">32</a>,
  <a rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51">51</a>] and BMR as reflecting changes in size and activity of the main digestive organs in response to cold acclimatization [
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>,
  <a rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52">52</a>,
  <a rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53">53</a>] then it is likely that those metabolic parameters reflect different sets of physiological constraints acting relatively independently, both being associated with winter [
  <a rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54">54</a>]. Pectoral muscles would start changing early in the season in association with the appearance of cold ambient temperatures (note that sub-zero minimal temperatures were already recorded in October), whereas winter BMR variations would likely reflect changes in diet and in the amounts of food consumed (to sustain an increasing daily energy expenditure, DEE). Chickadees feed mainly on insects during summer but eat up to 50% vegetal matter during winter [
  <a rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55">55</a>] while food supplementation by feeders may represent only up to 21% of their daily energy intake [
  <a rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56">56</a>]. Snow typically starts to fall in November at our field site while insects are already visible by March. Therefore, it could be that the combination of a winter increase in DEE and changes in natural diet digestibility and energy content leads to a restructuring of the digestive apparatus, and in turn changes in BMR, appearing independently from those observed in M
  <sub>SUM</sub>. The proximal effect of cold ambient temperature on parameters of metabolic performance [
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>,
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>,
  <a rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48">48</a>] would therefore be much more influential for M
  <sub>SUM</sub> than for BMR. Experimental research is needed to test this “metabolic uncoupling” hypothesis and to determine what biotic and/or abiotic factors trigger seasonal changes in parameters of metabolic performance.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the seasonal mismatch in variations of BMR and M
  <sub>SUM</sub>, it is therefore of no surprise to find a lack of significant correlation between these parameters when controlling for body mass in regression analyses. Independence of BMR and M
  <sub>SUM</sub> has also been observed by others [
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">15</a>,
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">27</a>,
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">28</a>,
  <a rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57">57</a>], but findings remains conflicting [
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">25</a>,
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">33</a>]. Experimental manipulations of BMR and M
  <sub>SUM</sub>, for example by combining diet and temperature treatments, should therefore be conducted to confirm findings.
