 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Peak values in average metabolic performance were recorded in February for both years (see below). We therefore calculated inter-seasonal variation in body mass and metabolic parameters between peak of winter and summer using values measured in February and August.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Average body mass did not vary between years or seasons but positively varied with time of capture (F
  <sub>1,70</sub> = 11.2, p &lt; 0.01). Males were also on average 10.5% heavier than females (sex: F
  <sub>2,112</sub> = 59.8, p &lt; 0.0001, males: 12.06 ± 0.07 g; females: 10.91 ± 0.08 g, undetermined 11.31 ± 0.10 g, Tukey: p &lt; 0.0001). BMR, M
  <sub>SUM</sub> and ME were all influenced by body mass (BMR: F
  <sub>1,112</sub> = 32.5, p &lt; 0.0001; M
  <sub>SUM</sub>: F
  <sub>1,109</sub> = 29.6, p &lt; 0.0001, ME: F
  <sub>1,98</sub> = 5.0, p &lt; 0.05). Mass-independent BMR was 5.9% higher in winter relative to summer (season: F
  <sub>1,116</sub> = 16.5, p &lt; 0.0001, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068292-g001" href="#pone-0068292-g001">Figure 1A)</a> while average values for mass-independent M
  <sub>SUM</sub> were 34.2% higher at the peak of winter relative to August (season: F
  <sub>1,115</sub> = 135.5, p &lt; 0.0001). However, this latter effect depended on the year (year*season: F
  <sub>1,117</sub> = 7.2, p &lt; 0.01). Mass-independent M
  <sub>SUM</sub> was 13.4% higher in the first winter relative to the second, which led to a M
  <sub>SUM</sub> being 41.9% higher than in summer during the first year compared to a 26.4% seasonal difference during the second year (Tukey: p &lt; 0.0001 in all cases) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068292-g001" href="#pone-0068292-g001">Figure 1B)</a>. Mass-independent ME was 25.0% higher in winter (6.2 x BMR) than in summer (5.0 x BMR, season: F
  <sub>1,111</sub> = 56.9, p &lt; 0.0001) and this effect was also dependent on the year (year*season: F
  <sub>1,109</sub> = 5.2, p &lt; 0.05). Mass-independent ME was 11.4% higher in the first winter than in the second with a ME 32.7% higher relative to summer in the first year compared to a 17.4% difference between winter and summer during the second year (Tukey: p &lt; 0.0001 in all cases) (
