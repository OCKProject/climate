 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Linear regression between residuals of whole BMR and whole M
  <sub>SUM</sub> extracted from linear mixed effect models resulted in a significant but weak positive relationship between these parameters (n = 269; r
  <span class="sup">²</span>
  <sub>adj</sub> = 0.04; p &lt; 0.001). The relationship was not significant when using residuals from models controlling for body mass (p = 0.4).
