 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(a) Inter-seasonal variation in metabolic performance</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mass-independent basal metabolic rate, interpreted here as the energy expenditure of physiological systems remaining active in a resting bird, peaked at 0.27 W in wintering black-capped chickadees. This is comparable to values measured in wintering chickadees from Ohio (0.26 W) and Wisconsin (0.27W) [
  <a rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48">48</a>] but lower than the ones measured in birds spending their winter in New York (0.29) [
  <a rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49">49</a>], South Dakota (0.30 W) [
  <a rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48">48</a>] and Alaska (0.42 W) [
  <a rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50">50</a>]. It is therefore not surprising to find that the 6% seasonal increase in mass-independent BMR observed here is much lower than the +14% found by Cooper and Swanson in birds from South Dakota [
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>]. This seasonal variation is, however, in the relatively large range of seasonal changes observed in other temperate free-living resident passerines (from -4.3% in

  </div> [
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>]). Assuming the seasonal elevation in BMR reflects an increase in maintenance costs [
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>,
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>], it therefore appears that black-capped chickadees from our study site only face a moderate rise in maintenance energy demand in association with seasonal cold acclimatization relative to other populations. If temperature is one of the drivers of winter metabolic performance [
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>,
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>], it is likely that differences between populations reflect physiological responses to local conditions.
