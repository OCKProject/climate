 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As for the inter-seasonal analyses, we found no year effect on average body mass in wintering black-capped chickadees. However, body mass varied over time within winter (month: F
  <sub>6,212</sub> = 8.3, p &lt; 0.0001) increasing by 4.0% between October and December (Tukey: p &lt; 0.01) and remained constant until August (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068292-g002" href="#pone-0068292-g002">Figure 2</a>, Tukey: p = 0.07). Mass also differed between sexes (F
  <sub>2,218</sub> = 146.8, p &lt; 0.0001) with males being on average 11.5% heavier than females (males: 12.00 ± 0.05 g; females: 10.76 ± 0.06 g, undetermined 11.18 ± 0.07 g, Tukey: p &lt; 0.0001) and, as these birds are fattening up on a daily basis [
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">35</a>,
