 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study was carried out within the Forêt d’Enseignement et de Recherche Macpès, Québec, Canada (48° 30’ N, 68° 52 W) between January and March 2010 (n = 56) and from October 2010 to March 2011 (n = 149). Data from summer individuals were collected in August 2010 (n = 12) and 2011 (n = 11). To attract chickadees and facilitate capture, 18 feeding stations were set up within the forest with an average distance between stations of 1.9 km (see 30,32 for a description of the stations). Feeders were regularly filled with black sunflower seeds. On capture days, feeders were removed and homemade potter traps (15 cm x 15 cm x 15 cm) baited with seeds were placed on a tray installed on a wooden fence pole. All birds were caught during morning (between 08:00 and 13:00) and removed from traps within one minute of capture. Weather stations in the forest [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Birds caught for the first time were banded with a USGS numbered metal band as well as a unique combination of three plastic color bands to allow further identification from a distance. For each capture, birds were first weighed then had the length of their beak, head plus beak, tarsus, tail and wing measured [
