 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All analyses were carried out in R 3.3.1 (R Development Core Team, 
  <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0088" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0088">2015</a>). To test whether data collected in 2015 and 2016 could be analysed together, we examined differences in cyanogenic glucoside concentration and colour metrics (luminance, saturation, hue, internal contrasts and relative marking area on the forewing) between years, across the seven species collected in both (see Table 
  <a rid="jeb13389-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" href="#jeb13389-tbl-0001">1</a>). These were tested for each dependent variable in turn, with a linear model allowing interactions between the independent variables of year, sex and species in the full model, followed by model simplification. Luminance, hue and chromatic contrast were log‐transformed to fit model assumptions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As this investigation revealed significant effects of year and sex on both toxicity and colour metrics, we subsequently analysed the relationship between colour metrics and cyanogenic glucoside levels across species separately for each year. The data were also analysed across both sexes, and for males and females separately. To account for evolutionary relatedness between species, we used phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) models, allowing 
  <span class="italic">λ</span> to be fitted by maximum likelihood (Mundry, 
  <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0069">2014</a>), as implemented by the package “caper” (Orme, 
  <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0079">2013</a>). We set out to test the relationship between cyanogenic glucoside concentration and all available colour metrics in a single model, but several of these variables were highly correlated. To deal with the problem of collinearity, we calculated variance inflation factors (VIFs) using the vif function in the “car” package (Fox &amp; Weisberg, 
  <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0037">2011</a>) and selected appropriate models by a combination of a commonly used “rule‐of‐thumb”, whereby VIFs should not exceed 10, and logical expectations of correlations (Dormann et al., 
  <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0022">2013</a>; O'Brien, 
  <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0078">2007</a>): for example, colour measures such as saturation, hue and chromatic contrast are calculated from the same cone catch values, so are expected to be correlated, whereas marking size is not tied to these variables. This yielded 3–4 different models per data set (combination of sex and collection year; see Supporting Information Data 
  <a rid="jeb13389-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#jeb13389-sup-0001">S5</a>). To fit model assumptions, for the data set of females in 2015, saturation was transformed using the square‐root function, and chromatic contrast was log‐transformed. Cyanogenic glucoside concentration was log‐transformed for all the 2016 data sets. Finally, small phylogenies suffer from a lack of power (Freckleton, Harvey, &amp; Pagel, 
  <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0039">2002</a>), making it difficult to accurately estimate parameters of phylogenetic signal, such as 
  <span class="italic">λ</span> (Arenas et al., 
  <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0003">2015</a>; Symonds &amp; Blomberg, 
  <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0119" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0119">2014</a>). We thus re‐ran the same PGLS models with 
  <span class="italic">λ</span> fixed to 1, corresponding to a Brownian model of evolution, to check whether our results were affected by a low estimate of phylogenetic signal.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the exception of 
  <span class="italic">Zygaena filipendulae</span>, for which quantitative signal honesty has already been investigated (Briolat, Zagrobelny, Olsen, Blount, &amp; Stevens, 
  <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0011">2018</a>), sample sizes in this study are generally too low to explore intraspecific variation in toxin level and coloration, especially as the different collection years and localities used for each species would also have to be accounted for (see Supporting Information Table 
  <a rid="jeb13389-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#jeb13389-sup-0001">S1</a>). However, we do investigate quantitative honesty in 
  <span class="italic">Z. ephialtes</span>, a species for which all samples (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 21) originated from a single location in 2015 (see Supporting Information Data 
  <a rid="jeb13389-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#jeb13389-sup-0001">S6</a>). Following Briolat, Zagrobelny, et al. (
  <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0011">2018</a>), we used multiple linear regression and stepwise model simplification to test the relationship between the concentration of cyanogenic glucosides in each sample and forewing coloration. As above, VIFs were used to determine that models including saturation or hue should be run separately. Models included all other possible colour metrics (luminance, chromatic contrast, luminance contrast, relative marking area, and either hue or saturation), and sex was allowed to interact with every metric.
