 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Photographs of the moths’ forewings were taken with a calibrated, UV‐sensitive digital camera [Nikon D7000 (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) fitted with a 105 mm CoastalOptics quartz lens], in controlled conditions inside a dark room. Lighting was provided by an EYE Color Arc Lamp MT70 bulb (Iwasaki Electric Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), its UV‐blocking coating removed by lightly scrubbing with a steel brush (Troscianko &amp; Stevens, 
  <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0122" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0122">2015</a>), thus emitting a spectrum of light similar to D65 daylight conditions. The forewings were chosen for analysis as they are more visible to predators than the hindwings, which in the Zygaenidae are hidden from view when at rest. As these wings are iridescent, only the right‐hand wings were photographed (to keep scale direction consistent), and the light source and camera were held at constant angles relative to the wings (50° and 90°, respectively). The wings were photographed flat against a background of grey ethylene‐vinyl acetate (EVA, or craft foam). A scale bar and a set of two polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) reflectance standards, reflecting 7% and 93% of all wavelengths of light, respectively (Zenith Lite Diffuse Target sheets, SphereOptics, Pro‐Lite Technology, Cranfield, UK), were included in each photograph, enabling calibration of the images with respect to lighting conditions (Troscianko &amp; Stevens, 
  <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0122" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0122">2015</a>). Each specimen was photographed twice, using different filters [a UV/infrared blocking filter (Baader UV/IR Cut Filter), transmitting between 400 and 700 nm, and a UV pass and IR blocking filter (Baader U filter), transmitting between 300 and 400 nm). All photographs were taken in RAW format, with a constant aperture (f8) and manual white balance set to “cloudy”.
