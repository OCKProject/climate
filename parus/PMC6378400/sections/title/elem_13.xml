 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, we found little evidence of quantitative signal honesty across the sampled species of Zygaenidae. Most colour metrics were not correlated with the concentration of defensive cyanogenic glucosides, whether male or female specimens were considered, and irrespective of the value of 
  <span class="italic">λ</span> in phylogenetically controlled analyses (Table 
  <a rid="jeb13389-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" href="#jeb13389-tbl-0003">3</a>, Supporting Information Data 
  <a rid="jeb13389-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#jeb13389-sup-0001">S7</a>). The trends that did emerge from this data set usually suggested a dishonest relationship between the strength of colour signals and defence levels, as higher toxin concentrations were associated with paler and less chromatically vibrant colours in 2015. Nevertheless, relationships between the concentration of cyanogenic glucosides and achromatic features could be seen to suggest quantitative honesty. When 
  <span class="italic">λ</span> was estimated as a low value by maximum likelihood, some trends were significant in 2015, and, in particular, luminance was positively correlated with the concentration of cyanogenic glucosides across species. However, this did not lead to significant differences in achromatic contrast in the wings, and paler markings 
  <span class="italic">per se</span> seem unlikely to constitute more salient markings. In terms of colour, only negative correlations with toxicity were found, suggesting dishonesty in signalling: saturation, hue and chromatic contrast were all negatively correlated with cyanogenic glucoside levels in females in 2015, especially in females. Under a Brownian motion model of evolution, we found only one significant relationship, a positive correlation in 2016 between luminance contrast and cyanogenic glucoside concentration across males of these species. This could be a potentially useful cue for predators, although there were no other significant correlations between other measures of coloration and toxin levels in that year.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Assessing the relevance of these correlations to predator behaviour is difficult, as determining which aspects of signals and defences are most relevant to predators is not straightforward. Chemical defences are generally assessed by measuring toxin levels, but these may vary across body parts, total toxin amounts may be more relevant if prey are swallowed whole, and distastefulness, inducing taste rejection by predators (Skelhorn &amp; Rowe, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0100" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0100">2009</a>, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0101" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0101">2010</a>) may not covary with toxicity: in nudibranchs, similarly distasteful red‐spotted species were shown to vary widely in their chemical profiles and lethality to brine shrimp (Winters et al., 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0126" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0126">2018</a>). As cyanogenic glucosides are bitter‐tasting and can be dispensed to predators 
   <span class="italic">via</span> defensive fluids during an attack (Jones, Rothschild, &amp; Parsons, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0058">1962</a>), measuring levels of linamarin and lotaustralin in burnet moths should provide a relevant estimate of both unpalatability and toxicity. By contrast, the question of which properties of warning signals predators most attend to is still somewhat unresolved and is poorly studied in the context of the Zygaenidae.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several lines of evidence suggest that chromatic features are the most important for avoidance learning, at least for avian predators (Stevens &amp; Ruxton, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0113" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0113">2012</a>). In the laboratory, learning experiments, primarily with 
   <span class="italic">Gallus gallus domesticus</span> chicks but also with 
   <span class="italic">C. caeruleus</span> and other passerines, suggest that chromatic features are generally more important than pattern for avoidance learning, generalization and memory in birds (Aronsson &amp; Gamberale‐Stille, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0004">2008</a>, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0005">2012a</a>; Exnerová et al., 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0034">2006</a>; Kazemi, Gamberale‐Stille, Tullberg, &amp; Leimar, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0059">2014</a>; Osorio, Jones, &amp; Vorobyev,

   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0118" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0118">2009</a>). These findings are broadly supported by several artificial predation experiments in the wild, suggesting that colour is most critical in determining the survival of model prey exposed to avian predators, although pattern can have an added effect (Arenas et al., 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0003">2015</a>; Finkbeiner, Briscoe, &amp; Reed, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0035">2014</a>; Nokelainen, Hegna, Heudler, Lindstedt, &amp; Mappes, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0076">2012</a>; Tan, Reid, &amp; Elgar, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0120" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0120">2016</a>). As such, colour generally seems more important than luminance in predator avoidance, and several chromatic features are thought to be especially relevant to aposematic prey and their predators. Field studies with model frogs and ladybirds have shown that chromatic contrast to the natural background is particularly important (Arenas et al., 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0003">2015</a>; Hegna, Saporito, Gerow, &amp; Donnelly, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0052">2011</a>), while experiments presenting different species of Lycaeidae seed bug larvae to domestic chicks suggest that prey with redder and more saturated signals are more strongly avoided (Gamberale‐Stille &amp; Tullberg, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0043">1999</a>). Long‐wavelength colours are also thought to be more effective as warning signals, due to innate avoidance by some predators and their greater stability under different lighting conditions (Arenas, Troscianko, &amp; Stevens, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0002">2014</a>). Finally, experiments with artificial stimuli and natural prey items such as 
   <span class="italic">Arctia plantaginis</span> (wood tiger moth) larvae suggest that larger coloured markings generate greater avoidance (Forsman &amp; Merilaita, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0036">1999</a>; Lindstedt, Lindström, &amp; Mappes, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0063">2008</a>; Lindström, Alatalo, Mappes, Riipi, &amp; Vertainen, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0065">1999</a>; Smith, Halpin, &amp; Rowe, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0102" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0102">2014</a>). In an honest signalling paradigm, we would thus expect stronger defences to be associated with stronger signals, represented by more saturated, redder, larger and more conspicuous markings (Arenas et al., 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0003">2015</a>; Stevens &amp; Ruxton, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0113" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0113">2012</a>). Yet, in our study, we found no association between marking size and toxicity across species, and the few correlations between chromatic features and toxicity we found in 2015 go against our expectations for quantitative honesty.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the other hand, correlations between achromatic features, such as luminance and luminance contrast to wing background colours, could also be utilized by predators. Achromatic information may still be relevant to avian predators, potentially helping them to distinguish small pattern elements (Stevens, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0108" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0108">2007</a>), triggering initial avoidance of aposematic patterns (Sandre, Stevens, &amp; Mappes, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0094" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0094">2010</a>) and speeding up learning (Aronsson &amp; Gamberale‐Stille, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0006">2012b</a>). Luminance contrast in the pattern of prey items can also facilitate detection and avoidance learning in experiments with mantids (Prudic, Skemp, &amp; Papaj, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0087" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0087">2007</a>), suggesting that it could be a useful cue for some invertebrate predators, to which burnet moths are also exposed (though note that mantids seem to lack colour discrimination, whereas many other invertebrates have good colour vision). In 2016, we found that internal luminance contrast was positively correlated with toxicity in males, so there is the potential for this signal property to act as an honest signal. Yet, it is also important to note that this trend was not linked to differences in marking luminance, so was likely to be driven by changes in the luminance of the dark background area of the moths’ wings. As the dark pigment melanin is involved in many other functions, from immune defences to thermoregulation (Solano, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0103" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0103">2014</a>), other selective pressures besides avoiding predation could be responsible for the trends in wing background luminance, and hence the relationship between luminance contrast and toxin levels. It would be useful to know more about the response of avian predators to the different features of a burnet moth‐like pattern, to conclusively determine whether any of the correlations found here could be relevant to predator behaviour in the wild. Across the board, comprehensively examining variation in many aspects of their colour signals suggests a lack of quantitative honesty across the zygaenid species studied here, but features such as luminance contrast between wing markings and background colours may be worthy of further investigation.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The above conclusions across species are broadly supported by results found when testing quantitative honesty within species in the Zygaenidae. In 
   <span class="italic">Z. filipendulae</span>, few significant associations emerged between measures of coloration and cyanogenic glucoside levels, and the trends that were uncovered were more indicative of a negative relationship between signal strength and toxicity: within some populations, higher cyanogenic glucoside concentrations were associated with paler markings, whereas across populations, higher toxin levels were found in females with smaller and paler markings (Briolat, Zagrobelny, et al., 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0011">2018</a>). Within 
   <span class="italic">Z. ephialtes</span>, we found a negative correlation between toxin levels and internal chromatic contrast, similarly suggesting a negative correlation between signal salience and defence levels. As in 
   <span class="italic">Z. filipendulae</span>, there is also a negative relationship between the relative size of the red markings and cyanogenic glucoside concentration, such that more toxic females have smaller markings. However, this relationship is reversed in males, raising the possibility that the area of red markings could act as an honest signal of toxicity in males. Aside from this potentially interesting difference between sexes, which may be related to the overall smaller size of males, there is little evidence of quantitative honesty within the Zygaenidae studied so far. As already discussed in the case of 
   <span class="italic">Z. filipendulae</span> (Briolat, Zagrobelny, et al., 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0011">2018</a>), the highly aversive nature of cyanogenic glucosides and fluctuations in individual toxin content over a moth's lifetime, depending on reproductive events, might limit the usefulness of quantitative honesty in burnet moths. More data would be required to test within‐species variation in a greater number of zygaenid species and determine whether this is a family‐wide pattern.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Relatively few studies have explored the relationship between coloration and the levels of chemical defences across species while accounting for phylogeny as we do here (but see Cortesi &amp; Cheney, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0013">2010</a>; Santos &amp; Cannatella, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0095" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0095">2011</a>; Summers &amp; Clough, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0116" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0116">2001</a>), so the present study makes a rare contribution to the field. While some species have very small sample sizes (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 1 or 
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 2), these were still included in the analysis as increasing the number of species is key to greater reliability in phylogenetic analyses. The absence of signal honesty in the Zygaenidae is contrary to the results of other studies of signal honesty across species, in ladybirds (Arenas et al., 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0003">2015</a>) and nudibranchs (Cortesi &amp; Cheney, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0013">2010</a>), as well as some work in poison frogs (Santos &amp; Cannatella, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0095" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0095">2011</a>; Summers &amp; Clough, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0116" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0116">2001</a>; but see Darst et al., 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0017">2006</a>). It demonstrates that quantitative signal honesty is not ubiquitous across families of aposematic species. Across species, a range of factors, including different habitat or microhabitat features (Endler, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0030">1993</a>), predator communities (Endler &amp; Mappes, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0031">2004</a>; Nokelainen, Valkonen, Lindstedt, &amp; Mappes, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0077">2014</a>) and life‐history traits (Longson &amp; Joss, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0066">2006</a>), are likely to impose different fitness costs and benefits on the production of both signals and defences. If these costs and benefits do not change in parallel, honest signalling may not be expected (Speed &amp; Ruxton, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0104" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0104">2007</a>). In the Zygaenidae, the economics of signals and defences are likely to differ between species, as they vary in their means of acquiring toxins, as well as in their behaviour. Sampling host plants from collection sites wherever possible, we measured the cyanogenic glucoside content of plant tissues the larvae were likely to feed on (Supporting Information Data 
   <a rid="jeb13389-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#jeb13389-sup-0001">S2</a>) to address this issue. Although not comprehensive, our results suggest that, among our samples, only 
   <span class="italic">Z. filipendulae</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Z. occitanica</span> were feeding on plants with high levels of cyanogenic glucosides. 
   <span class="italic">Z. trifolii</span>,
   <span class="italic"> Z. cynarae</span>,
   <span class="italic"> R. pruni</span> and in some cases 
   <span class="italic">A. infausta</span> may also have been able to both sequester the cyanogenic glucosides linamarin and lotaustralin from their host plants as well as synthesize them themselves (Davis &amp; Nahrstedt, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0020">1986</a>; Zagrobelny et al., 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0133" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0133">2014</a>), whereas the other species appear to have relied entirely on de novo synthesis. Moreover, behavioural differences between the species in the 
   <span class="italic">Zygaena</span> genus and the others will modulate their exposure to predators. The Procridinae behave more like cryptic species, flying rapidly and seeking to evade capture, whereas red‐spotted burnet moths are much more sluggish (Hofmann &amp; Tremewan, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0054">2017</a>) and highly visible. Finally, although many of these species do co‐exist in the wild, our samples were collected from many different locations, so were not exposed to the same community of predators.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sex‐specific trends in quantitative honesty found for 
   <span class="italic">Z. filipendulae</span> (Briolat, Burdfield‐Steel, et al.,

   <span class="italic">Z. ephialtes</span> suggest that differences between sexes should be considered in studies of signal honesty. The costs and benefits of aposematic signalling may vary between males and females of warningly coloured species, due to size dimorphism, trade‐offs related to sexual signalling, and variation in habitat use and behaviour, modulating their exposure to predators. In sexually dimorphic seven‐spot ladybirds (
   <span class="italic">Coccinella septempunctata</span>), an honest relationship between elytra carotenoids and coccinelline levels was only found in females, a result attributed to greater resource limitation or greater benefits of aposematic signalling in the larger sex (Blount et al., 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0008">2012</a>). Burnet moths are similarly sexually dimorphic, with larger females (Naumann, Tarmann, &amp; Tremewan, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0070">1999</a>), but other factors may also affect the economics of aposematic signalling: although both sexes are highly visible at rest, males are generally more active (Naumann et al., 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0070">1999</a>), and there is some limited evidence that visual signals could play a role in sexual signalling, at close range (Friedrich &amp; Friedrich‐Polo, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0040">2005</a>; Koshio,

   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0053">2010</a>). Across species, trends were broadly similar between sexes in this study, but the significance of these relationships varied, suggesting that ignoring differences between sexes could mask interesting results. This is an important consideration, as existing studies of quantitative honesty across aposematic species and populations do not analyse males and females separately, even in taxa in which males and females are known to differ (e.g. in ladybirds; Arenas et al., 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0003">2015</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study also revealed considerable variation, in both coloration and toxicity, between individuals collected in two different years. These differences are unlikely to be caused by inconsistencies in our experimental procedures. While caterpillars were raised under natural conditions during collection trips, subsequent rearing conditions were kept as consistent as possible between specimens collected in 2015 and 2016. Moreover, differences in colour between years were found even among 
   <span class="italic">Z. trifolii</span> specimens, collected as pupae from the same location and placed in an incubator with the same settings until eclosion, suggesting that conditions prior to euthanasia were not responsible for this variation. Preliminary experiments verified that the time that specimens were kept in the −80°C freezer between termination and photography did not impact coloration. Methods and equipment used for image capture did not vary between years, and all images from both seasons were processed and analysed together. Finally, we verified that differences in toxin levels were not caused by variations in the sensitivity of the LC‐MS machine and column used, by re‐running a subset of samples from both years together. While existing studies of signal honesty in aposematic species do not consider temporal variation in signal and defence traits, our study suggests that seasonal variation may have an impact on these traits.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With only 2 years of data, it is difficult to explain the observed patterns of between‐year variation, but environmental conditions, linked to variation in weather across years (see Supporting Information Data 
   <a rid="jeb13389-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#jeb13389-sup-0001">S7</a>), are likely to impact investment in coloration and chemical defences in burnet moths. Variation in coloration in tiger moths (Erebidae) has been linked to fluctuations in local ecological conditions (Galarza, Nokelainen, Ashrafi, Hegna, &amp; Mappes, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0042">2014</a>), and in particular temperature (Goulson &amp; Owen,

For the species relying completely on de novo synthesis of cyanogenic glucosides, plant productivity may still be important. For example, nitrogen limitation will lead to reduced investment in cyanogenic glucosides in burnet moths, due to trade‐offs with other products, as suggested by the hypothesized breakdown of cyanogenic glucosides during pupation to fuel chitin synthesis (Zagrobelny et al., 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0131" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0131">2007</a>). Interestingly, all the species in which cyanogenic glucoside levels decreased between years in males (
   <span class="italic">A. infausta</span>,
   <span class="italic"> R. pruni</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Z. sarpedon</span>) feed on acyanogenic host plants, suggesting that resource allocation trade‐offs may broadly differ between species able to sequester cyanogenic glucosides from their host plants and those who cannot. Comparing host plant levels of cyanogenic glucosides and other nutritional resources to moth toxin levels and coloration across years would help elucidate the relationship between environmental conditions, host properties and aposematic phenotypes. This type of longitudinal study could be a valuable means of testing for quantitative honesty in aposematic signalling, providing the opportunity to study how resources are allocated to signals and defences in response to environmental conditions, and as the communities of predators and prey co‐evolve.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, the present work deepens our understanding of the relationship between signals and defences across species, by contributing to the small number of studies testing signal honesty across closely related aposematic species, with sophisticated methods for quantifying chemical defences, phylogenetic controls and measures of coloration accounting for predator vision. We find no clear evidence of quantitative signal honesty across the sampled species of Zygaenidae, especially not with regard to those aspects of appearance most likely to be salient to predators, a result likely attributable to varying costs of signal and defence production across species. Our study also highlights the importance of considering differences between sexes and temporal variation in analyses of signal honesty moving forward.</p>
