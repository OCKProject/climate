  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Individuals of 14 Zygaenidae species were collected in spring and summer 2015 and 2016, from locations in Denmark, France and the UK (Table

   <a rid="jeb13389-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#jeb13389-sup-0001">S1</a> for full details). Where possible, host plants were sampled at the same locations (see Supporting Information Data 
   <a rid="jeb13389-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#jeb13389-sup-0001">S2</a>). To ensure that all Zygaenidae analysed were virgin, an important consideration as males and females exchange cyanogenic glucosides during reproduction (Zagrobelny, Bak, Ekstrøm, Olsen, &amp; Møller, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0129" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0129">2007</a>; Zagrobelny, Bak, Olsen, &amp; Møller,

   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0134" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0134">2013</a>), specimens were collected at the larval or pupal stage, then reared to maturity in the laboratory. Larvae and pupae were kept in individual boxes with air holes, inside an incubator at 20°C, with a 16:8 hr day:night cycle, following protocols from previous work on 
   <span class="italic">Zygaena filipendulae</span> (Linnaeus, 1758) (Zagrobelny et al., 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0129" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0129">2007</a>). The larvae were fed ad libitum with the same host plant as they were found on in the field (Table 
   <a rid="jeb13389-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" href="#jeb13389-tbl-0001">1</a>). After emergence, the adults were euthanized by placing them in a −80°C freezer. Due to the difficulty of finding larvae or pupae of certain species, and high mortality, five species are limited to very small sample sizes (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 1 or 
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 2, see Table 
   <a rid="jeb13389-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" href="#jeb13389-tbl-0001">1</a>). Their wings were dissected for photography, and then, the entire sample was placed in 1 ml 80% methanol in preparation for LC‐MS analysis of cyanogenic glucoside content.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Photographs of the moths’ forewings were taken with a calibrated, UV‐sensitive digital camera [Nikon D7000 (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) fitted with a 105 mm CoastalOptics quartz lens], in controlled conditions inside a dark room. Lighting was provided by an EYE Color Arc Lamp MT70 bulb (Iwasaki Electric Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), its UV‐blocking coating removed by lightly scrubbing with a steel brush (Troscianko &amp; Stevens, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0122" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0122">2015</a>), thus emitting a spectrum of light similar to D65 daylight conditions. The forewings were chosen for analysis as they are more visible to predators than the hindwings, which in the Zygaenidae are hidden from view when at rest. As these wings are iridescent, only the right‐hand wings were photographed (to keep scale direction consistent), and the light source and camera were held at constant angles relative to the wings (50° and 90°, respectively). The wings were photographed flat against a background of grey ethylene‐vinyl acetate (EVA, or craft foam). A scale bar and a set of two polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) reflectance standards, reflecting 7% and 93% of all wavelengths of light, respectively (Zenith Lite Diffuse Target sheets, SphereOptics, Pro‐Lite Technology, Cranfield, UK), were included in each photograph, enabling calibration of the images with respect to lighting conditions (Troscianko &amp; Stevens, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0122" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0122">2015</a>). Each specimen was photographed twice, using different filters [a UV/infrared blocking filter (Baader UV/IR Cut Filter), transmitting between 400 and 700 nm, and a UV pass and IR blocking filter (Baader U filter), transmitting between 300 and 400 nm). All photographs were taken in RAW format, with a constant aperture (f8) and manual white balance set to “cloudy”.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Image analysis</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All image analysis was performed in ImageJ (Schneider, Rasband, &amp; Eliceiri, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0097" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0097">2012</a>) using open access custom‐made plugins in the Image Calibration and Analysis Toolbox (Troscianko &amp; Stevens, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0122" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0122">2015</a>). Methods used for processing images and extracting colour metrics are summarized below; full details are provided in Supporting Information Data 
   <a rid="jeb13389-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#jeb13389-sup-0001">S3</a>. To allow for objective colour measurements, images were linearized and normalized (Stevens, Párraga, Cuthill, Partridge, &amp; Troscianko, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0112" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0112">2007</a>), and then scaled to 100 pixels/mm. Photographs taken with the two types of filter were combined using an automatic alignment tool, and the resulting multispectral images were mapped to avian vision, as previous observations show that birds are likely to be the most relevant visual predators of burnet moths (Tremewan, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0121" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0121">2006</a>). Each image was converted to the visual system of 
   <span class="italic">C. caeruleus</span>, the model species for the ultraviolet‐sensitive (UVS) avian visual system (Hart, Partridge, Cuthill, &amp; Bennett, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0050">2000</a>) using a highly accurate polynomial mapping technique (Pike, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0086" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0086">2011</a>; Stevens &amp; Cuthill,

   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0122" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0122">2015</a>) to produce a set of image layers corresponding to the predicted cone catch values for each of the five avian cone types: long wavelength (LW)‐, medium wavelength (MW)‐, short wavelength (SW)‐ and ultraviolet (UV)‐sensitive photoreceptors, and double cones. Relevant wing areas were selected using the freehand tool in ImageJ. Most species display red forewing markings, but for 
   <span class="italic">Rhagades pruni</span> (Denis &amp; Schiffermüller, 1775), the iridescent blue patch at the base of the wing was selected as the markings, whereas for 
   <span class="italic">Theresimima ampellophaga</span> (Bayle‐Barelle, 1808), the whole uniform wing was measured as a single patch. Cone catch values for every photoreceptor type were obtained from each selected patch and then averaged to obtain a single measure of colour per individual, for both the wing markings and wing background area.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Colour metrics</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the average cone catch values, several measures of coloration were calculated: luminance, saturation and hue of the forewing marking colours, as well as both chromatic and luminance contrasts between markings and background colours. In brief, luminance (perceived lightness) was taken as the cone catch value for the double cones (Jones &amp; Osorio, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0057">2004</a>; Osorio &amp; Vorobyev, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0081">2005</a>), and saturation, measuring colour “richness”, was calculated by plotting wing colours in a tetrahedral colour space and measuring the Euclidian distance from each colour to the centre of the tetrahedron (after Endler &amp; Mielke, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0032">2005</a>; Stoddard &amp; Prum, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0115" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0115">2008</a>). Hue, representing the type or shade of a colour, was derived using principal component analysis (after Spottiswoode &amp; Stevens, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0106" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0106">2011</a>) to obtain a ratio of cone catch values broadly inspired by the general principle of colour opponency, known to be relevant to avian vision (Osorio, Jones, &amp; Vorobyev, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0080">1999</a>; Osorio, Vorobyev, &amp; Jones, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0082" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0082">1999</a>). In this study, hue is given by the following equation, such that higher hue values represent colours with relatively higher reflectance in the LW or UV channels, indicating redder colours, higher ultraviolet reflectance or both:

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chromatic and achromatic contrasts between the markings and background colours provide a sense of the salience of wing markings, and may be relevant to predator behaviour, although the relative importance of pattern contrast over colour 
   <span class="italic">per se</span> in aposematic signals remains unclear (Aronsson &amp; Gamberale‐Stille,

Samples were prepared by grinding up the specimens in 1 ml ice‐cold 55% MeOH with 0.1% formic acid and then passing them through an Anopore 0.45‐μm filter (Whatman). The analytical LC‐MS was performed with an Agilent 1100 Series LC (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany), and Bruker HCT‐Ultra ion trap mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany), run in positive electrospray mode, with an oven temperature of 35°C. A Zorbax SB‐C18 column (Agilent; 1.8 μM, 2.1 × 50 mm) was used for chromatographic separation, running with a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min, increased to 0.3 ml/min from 11.2 to 13.5 min. The mobile phases A and B were composed, respectively, of H
   <sub>2</sub>O with 0.1% (v/v) HCOOH, 50 μM NaCl and MeCN with 0.1% (v/v) HCOOH, with a gradient as follows: 0–0.5 min, isocratic 2% B; 0.5–7.5 min, linear gradient 2%–40% B; 7.5–8.5 min, linear gradient 40%–90% B; 8.5–11.5 isocratic 90% B; 11.6–17 min, isocratic 2% B.

The total amount of each compound was estimated according to its extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) peak areas and quantified using calibration curves for the linamarin, lotaustralin and amygdalin standards. Finally, the concentration of cyanogenic glucosides in each sample was determined by dividing the total amount of compounds in each sample by the specimen mass, recorded at the time of preservation. Samples of larval host plants were analysed similarly. To rule out the possibility that differences between samples from 2015 and 2016 were caused by the LC‐MS machine, a subset of 20 samples (5 
   <span class="italic">A. infausta</span> and 5 
   <span class="italic">Z. trifolii</span> from each year, both males and females) were run together a second time in 2017. Analysing the results with a mixed effects model including specimen ID as a random effect, we found no significant effect of the interaction between collection year and machine run (original, in 2015 or 2016, vs. second run in 2017) on the concentration of cyanogenic glucosides for either

A new phylogenetic tree was built from these sequences, as previously published phylogenies using all available sequences (Niehuis et al.,

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phylogenetic relationships were assessed with maximum likelihood (ML), using the “phangorn” package (Schliep, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0096" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0096">2011</a>) in R. The most appropriate model of evolution was identified as a GTR+G+I model, allowing for variation in mutation rates between sites and the presence of invariant sites, according to ML estimates calculated with the modelTest function in “phangorn”. Tree topology was then optimized by nearest‐neighbour interchange (NNI), using the optim.pml function. Finally, partitions allowing different rates of evolution for nuclear and mitochondrial sequences or for every different gene were tested with the pmlPart function. Based on Akaike information criterion (AIC) scores, a partitioned model considering each gene separately was selected (AIC
   <sub>no partition</sub> = 40049.83, AIC
   <sub>nuclear/mitochondrial partition</sub> = 39575.70, AIC

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistical analyses</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All analyses were carried out in R 3.3.1 (R Development Core Team, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0088" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0088">2015</a>). To test whether data collected in 2015 and 2016 could be analysed together, we examined differences in cyanogenic glucoside concentration and colour metrics (luminance, saturation, hue, internal contrasts and relative marking area on the forewing) between years, across the seven species collected in both (see Table 
   <a rid="jeb13389-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" href="#jeb13389-tbl-0001">1</a>). These were tested for each dependent variable in turn, with a linear model allowing interactions between the independent variables of year, sex and species in the full model, followed by model simplification. Luminance, hue and chromatic contrast were log‐transformed to fit model assumptions.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As this investigation revealed significant effects of year and sex on both toxicity and colour metrics, we subsequently analysed the relationship between colour metrics and cyanogenic glucoside levels across species separately for each year. The data were also analysed across both sexes, and for males and females separately. To account for evolutionary relatedness between species, we used phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) models, allowing 
   <span class="italic">λ</span> to be fitted by maximum likelihood (Mundry, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0069">2014</a>), as implemented by the package “caper” (Orme, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0079">2013</a>). We set out to test the relationship between cyanogenic glucoside concentration and all available colour metrics in a single model, but several of these variables were highly correlated. To deal with the problem of collinearity, we calculated variance inflation factors (VIFs) using the vif function in the “car” package (Fox &amp; Weisberg, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0037">2011</a>) and selected appropriate models by a combination of a commonly used “rule‐of‐thumb”, whereby VIFs should not exceed 10, and logical expectations of correlations (Dormann et al., 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0022">2013</a>; O'Brien, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0078">2007</a>): for example, colour measures such as saturation, hue and chromatic contrast are calculated from the same cone catch values, so are expected to be correlated, whereas marking size is not tied to these variables. This yielded 3–4 different models per data set (combination of sex and collection year; see Supporting Information Data 
   <a rid="jeb13389-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#jeb13389-sup-0001">S5</a>). To fit model assumptions, for the data set of females in 2015, saturation was transformed using the square‐root function, and chromatic contrast was log‐transformed. Cyanogenic glucoside concentration was log‐transformed for all the 2016 data sets. Finally, small phylogenies suffer from a lack of power (Freckleton, Harvey, &amp; Pagel, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0039">2002</a>), making it difficult to accurately estimate parameters of phylogenetic signal, such as 
   <span class="italic">λ</span> (Arenas et al., 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0003">2015</a>; Symonds &amp; Blomberg, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0119" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0119">2014</a>). We thus re‐ran the same PGLS models with 
   <span class="italic">λ</span> fixed to 1, corresponding to a Brownian model of evolution, to check whether our results were affected by a low estimate of phylogenetic signal.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the exception of 
   <span class="italic">Zygaena filipendulae</span>, for which quantitative signal honesty has already been investigated (Briolat, Zagrobelny, Olsen, Blount, &amp; Stevens, 
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0011">2018</a>), sample sizes in this study are generally too low to explore intraspecific variation in toxin level and coloration, especially as the different collection years and localities used for each species would also have to be accounted for (see Supporting Information Table 
   <a rid="jeb13389-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#jeb13389-sup-0001">S1</a>). However, we do investigate quantitative honesty in 
   <span class="italic">Z. ephialtes</span>, a species for which all samples (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 21) originated from a single location in 2015 (see Supporting Information Data 
   <a rid="jeb13389-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#jeb13389-sup-0001">S6</a>). Following Briolat, Zagrobelny, et al. (
   <a rid="jeb13389-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#jeb13389-bib-0011">2018</a>), we used multiple linear regression and stepwise model simplification to test the relationship between the concentration of cyanogenic glucosides in each sample and forewing coloration. As above, VIFs were used to determine that models including saturation or hue should be run separately. Models included all other possible colour metrics (luminance, chromatic contrast, luminance contrast, relative marking area, and either hue or saturation), and sex was allowed to interact with every metric.
