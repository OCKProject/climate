 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recently, germline epimutations of 
  <span class="italic">MLH1</span> have been identified in individuals with colorectal and other cancers characterized by microsatellite instability (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">Hitchins et al. 2005</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">Suter et al. 2004</a>). 
  <span class="italic">MLH1</span> encodes a protein involved in DNA mismatch repair, and somatic biallelic hypermethylation of its promoter is associated with sporadic colorectal carcinoma in older women. Heterozygous germline mutations of 
  <span class="italic">MLH1</span> cause the autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). Promoter methylation screens of several genes, including 
  <span class="italic">MLH1</span>, were conducted in individuals with personal or family histories of colorectal cancer, but lacking evidence of 
  <span class="italic">MLH1</span> mutation. Three individuals were identified with hemiallelic promoter hypermethylation of 
  <span class="italic">MLH1</span> in tissues from all embryonic germ cell lineages. The affected allele was silenced; loss of the other allele was shown in tumor tissue, and absence of MLH1 protein in tumors demonstrated complete functional loss of 
  <span class="italic">MLH1</span>. A low proportion (1%) of carrier sperm in one of the three probands suggested potential for transgenerational inheritance of the allele, but it also demonstrated that the epimutation was unstable in the germline, having been erased during gametogenesis in most sperm. There was no evidence of the epimutations in parents or siblings of the probands, and the daughter of one proband inherited his 
  <span class="italic">MLH1</span> allele but with normal methylation. Although the evidence is insufficient to rule out transgenerational inheritance of the 
  <span class="italic">MLH1</span> epimutation, it suggests that inheritance of this epimutation is likely to be weak, if it occurs at all.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A major environmental factor affecting human health is nutrition, and many populations today and in the past have been exposed to alternating feast or famine conditions. Maternal nutrition during pregnancy can influence the disease susceptibility phenotype of children, and can influence, through the female line, the birthweight of grandchildren (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">Lumey and Stein 1997</a>). In order to study the effects of grandparental nutrition on cardiovascular mortality and the incidence of diabetes, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">Kaati et al. (2002)</a> analyzed the records of three generations of people in an isolated area of northern Sweden. The authors had previously shown that longevity was inversely related to energy intake of the grandfather during his slow growth period in childhood (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">Bygren et al. 2000</a>). In the new study, the original study group was expanded to include 239 individuals born in either 1890, 1905, or 1920 (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">Kaati et al. 2002</a>). The study analyzed the relationship to cardiovascular mortality or diabetes of food availability during the parents’ and grandparents’ childhood slow growth period (9–12 years for boys, 8–10 years for girls). The results showed that poor paternal or good maternal food availability protected against cardiovascular mortality, while good paternal food availability tended to protect from diabetes. Poor paternal grandfather’s food availability tended to protect from diabetes and, as previously shown, increased longevity, whereas good paternal grandfather’s food availability predisposed to diabetes. The size of probands’ sibships was increased if the paternal grandfather was exposed to food shortages or if the father was exposed to a food surfeit. The findings are important because they show the effects of nutrition on one generation can reach forward through the male line across at least two generations. The opposing effects of paternal and grandpaternal nutrition suggest that effects are reversible. A genetic mechanism for transgenerational transmission of the nutrition effects was deemed unlikely in the absence of evidence for intense selection across the three study generations. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">Kaati et al. (2002)</a> hypothesized an epigenetic cause, most likely affecting an imprinted gene, and nominated the variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) minisatellite upstream of the INS-IGF2-H19 imprinted region as a candidate locus for the effect. The region is paternally imprinted and paternal variation at the INS VNTR had been associated with altered risk of type 2 diabetes, thus suggesting that factors affecting an imprinted gene might influence the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">Huxtable et al. 2000</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">Pembrey (2002)</a> speculated that the mechanism for transgenerational responses to nutrition observed in the Kaati et al. study primarily could be related to reproduction. The period of slow growth during boyhood coincides with the onset of spermatogonial differentiation and spermatocyte production, and consequently the remethylation of marks erased during gametogenesis at loci such as at the imprinting control region between IGF2 and H19 (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">Kerjean et al. 2000</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">Pembrey 2002</a>). Therefore, during this period of dynamic epigenetic events in the testis, nutrition could potentially directly affect imprint establishment, and such an altered mark might be heritable over several generations or susceptible to reversal in the following generation, depending on nutritional exposures. If this were true, then perhaps the notion of imprinting, at least for this locus, would need to be revised to include some flavor of a metastable epiallele in which stochastic variation was prompted by environmental exposure during a sensitive period. It should be noted that the effect of the INS VNTR on susceptibilty to type 2 diabetes is controversial, with at least two recent large studies coming to opposite conclusions (
