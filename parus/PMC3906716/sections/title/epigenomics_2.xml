 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Epigenomics has been defined as the study of the effects of structural and chemical modifications to chromatin and its component proteins and DNA (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">Murrell et al. 2005</a>). The epigenome changes according to cell cycle, cell type, age of the organism, and species, and in response to environmental factors such as nutrition. Nonetheless, with increasing awareness of the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in human disease, several groups have set out to characterize mouse and human epigenomes. Technologies used for genomic analysis of DNA methylation, chromatin-associated proteins, and chromatin higher-order structures were recently reviewed and are not discussed in detail here (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">Murrell et al. 2005</a>). Recent studies marrying epigenome analysis with gene expression are confirming that epigenetic variation is rife within mammalian genomes, at least within the mouse and human.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Human Epigenome Project (HEP) aims to “identify, catalogue and interpret genome-wide DNA methylation patterns and profiles of all human genes in all major tissues” and their diseased variants (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">Murrell et al. 2005</a>). Bisulfite sequencing remains the most sensitive and specific method for analyzing DNA methylation, although development of new genome-scale methods may eventually rival it and provide potential for higher throughput analysis (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">Murrell et al. 2005</a>). In a pilot study, HEP used a modified high-throughput bisulfite sequencing method and also matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) to analyze cytosine methylation of CpG dinucleotides in targeted regions of 90 major histocompatibility (MHC) region genes, sampling six different tissue types from 32 persons (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">Rakyan et al. 2004</a>). The two methods produced comparable results and showed that there was considerable interindividual variation in DNA methylation, with over 80% of unique CpG sites showing greater than 20% variation between individuals. Methylation patterns of about 10% of amplicons were tissue specific. Moreover, CpG methylation status of the upstream sequence of a subset of 24 genes correlated with their expression levels in prostate and liver. In principle, this confirms, at the genomic level in a natural population, the general model that epigenetic states influence phenotype, i.e., gene expression, and that epigenetic variation due to DNA methylation is common in the genome, at least in the human MHC. As Rakyan et al. point out, problems remain with inherent technical variation and the use of samples uncontrolled for factors affecting epigenetic state such as environment, age and gender. Moreover, the use of genetically diverse samples leaves open the possibility that certain genotypes might be associated with a particular epigenotype.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Combined chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and microarray studies have been used to construct genome-wide maps of modified histones in flies and yeast (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">Bernstein et al. 2002</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">Pokholok et al. 2005</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">Schubeler et al. 2004</a>). These studies showed that the transcribed parts of active genes are associated with histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation. To better delineate the properties of mammalian chromatin on a large scale, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">Bernstein and colleagues (2005)</a> used a combination of ChIP, linear DNA amplification, and tiling oligonucleotide arrays to map histone modifications for human Chromosomes 21 and 22 in HepG2 hepatoma cells, and for six genomic loci orthologous in mouse and human. An interesting finding from this study was that conservation of histone modifications between orthologs in human and mouse was stronger than conservation of DNA sequence.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a different approach, ChIP and reverse-transcription real-time PCR was used to assess histone lysine methylation states at DNA repeats in mouse embryonic cells and their differentiated derivatives (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">Martens et al. 2005</a>). This study showed that in major and minor satellite repeats, the repressive histone marks—trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 and histone H4 lysine 20—appeared stable between different cell types. Conversely, for other classes of repeats such as DNA transposons and retrotransposons, repressive histone lysine methylation states varied between cell types. Some marks appeared quite variable within a cell and repeat type, suggesting the potential for variable transcriptional repression.
