 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The phenotype-driven genetics methods of linkage analysis and positional cloning have enabled us to discover the genetic cause of mammalian Mendelian phenotypes, that is, those phenotypes with a perfect correspondence between phenotype and a single- locus genotype, (

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">van De Sluis et al. 2002</a>). However, much mammalian phenotypic variance cannot be attributed to single-gene effects, and other sources include multigene effects, environmental influences, noise, and epigenetic effects. Epigenetic effects are those effects caused by chemical modifications to DNA that do not alter the DNA sequence but do alter the probability of gene transcription. Such modifications include direct covalent modification of the DNA by methylation of cytosines in symmetric or asymmetric contexts and modification of the proteins that bind to DNA. Such modifications may alter DNA accessibility to transcription complexes at a local level and affect higher-order chromatin structure at regional and genome-wide levels, thus linking genome structure and transcriptional regulation. The progressive elucidation of epigenetic molecular mechanisms in different organisms has been and continues to be a major project of many laboratories. Excellent reviews on this topic appear frequently, reflecting the rapid advances of knowledge in the field and its entanglement with the new field of small RNAs (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of special relevance to the mammalian genome, phenotype-driven genetics methods such as sensitized mouse mutagenesis studies are discovering molecules involved in mammalian epigenetic regulation and are exposing subtle effects of such molecules on the whole animal (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">Blewitt et al. 2005</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">Bultman et al. 2005</a>). Strategies used to study epigenetic mechanisms in the mouse have recently been well reviewed (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">Mager and Bartolomei 2005</a>). This review does not focus on epigenetic mechanisms but takes up the topic of the biological significance of epigenetic genome regulation, focusing on mammals as much as possible.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Epigenetic mechanisms are intimately involved in setting up and maintaining the two major forms of chromosomal structure, heterochromatin and euchromatin, and in the structural switches of facultative heterochromatin between the two. Nuclear transplantation studies and studies of germ cell formation have established that epigenetic reprogramming is an essential component of the very earliest stages of mammalian embryogenesis, and in 
  <span class="italic">Drosophila</span> of germ cell development and maintenance (

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" href="#CR75">Xi and Xie 2005</a>). Disruption of normal epigenetic reprogramming, like that which occurs following interference with normal DNA methylation processes, has severe impacts on development of the embryo (

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">Okano et al. 1999</a>). Spontaneous epigenetic pathology has been linked with several sorts of human disease, e.g., imprinting disorders and cancer (

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">Holm et al. 2005</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The cardinal signs of epigenetic effects on gene transcription are variable expression of a gene in a population of isogenic individuals (variable expressivity) and/or a mosaic pattern among cells of the same type within an individual (variegation) (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">Whitelaw and Martin 2001</a> and references therein). The phrase “metastable epialleles” was coined to describe alleles with more than one stable epigenetic state driving variable expressivity and variegation (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">Rakyan et al. 2002</a>). At each new generation, the establishment of a metastable epiallele’s epigenetic state is probabilistic, although there may be some parental influence, and once established the epigenetic state is mitotically inherited. Thus, classical imprinted alleles are epialleles, but they are not metastable epialleles because establishment of their epigenetic state in each new generation is strictly determined by the parent of origin of the allele. Epigenetic states at chromosomal loci are reversible and changes of epigenetic state occur regularly during development as cells undergo differentiation and are age-dependent in the adult animal (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">Bennett- Baker et al. 2003</a>). Over the lifespan of the animal, it was estimated that epigenetic changes occur more frequently than DNA mutations (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">Bennett-Baker et al. 2003</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using a proviral construct transfected into mammalian cells, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">Lorincz et al. (2002)</a> showed that the construct’s DNA methylation state was established stochastically. The state established was influenced by the initial methylation density and by a 
  <span class="italic">cis</span>-acting regulatory element whose absence increased the probability of methylation of the construct. Unmethylated or densely methylated constructs were stably maintained and propagated, while low-density methylated constructs were inherently unstable and subject to stochastic demethylation or 
  <span class="italic">de novo</span> methylation (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">Lorincz et al. 2002</a>). Stochastic establishment of methylation of naturally occurring alleles has been observed in mice and is believed to be a general feature of DNA cytosine methylation in mammals.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is no doubt that epigenetic modifications to DNA are mitotically heritable, and there is well-documented evidence of meiotic or transgenerational epigenetic inheritance for individual genes over several generations in a number of model organisms including flies, mice, worms, and plants (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">Finnegan 2002</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">Rakyan et al. 2003</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">Zilberman and Henikoff 2005</a>). But how much phenotypic variability does the epigenotype account for in mammals and to what extent does transgenerational epigenetic inheritance occur in natural populations?
