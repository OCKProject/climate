 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An important idea driving interest in epigenetic inheritance is whether environmentally induced changes in epigenetic status, and hence gene transcription and phenotype, can be transmitted through more than one generation. 
  <span class="italic">A</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <span class="italic">vy</span>
  </span> mice were used to demonstrate that maternal diet influences epigenetic states and hence phenotypes of F
  <sub>1</sub> offspring through altering the probability of methylation of the 
  <span class="italic">A</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <span class="italic">vy</span>
  </span> locus (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">Waterland and Jirtle 2003</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">Wolff et al. 1998</a>). However, the experiments in these two studies did not test whether the altered epigenetic states were then passed, without further dietary interference, to subsequent generations, and so no further inferences can be drawn regarding heritability of environmentally mediated epigenetic effects.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An intriguing link was made in rats between the quality of maternal care as measured by licking and nursing behavior and the epigenetic status of the glucocorticoid receptor gene and behavioral phenotype of the offspring (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">Weaver et al. 2004</a>). Again, the study was conducted on too few generations to determine whether the effects might be heritable. Offspring of male mice treated with chromium(III) chloride have an altered lifetime risk of developing specific cancers, and Shiao and colleagues hypothesized an epigenetic rather than a genetic cause (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">Shiao et al. 2005</a> and refs therein). Evidence supporting the argument included allele-specific DNA hypomethylation of the ribosomal RNA spacer promoter of the 45S ribosomal RNA gene in the sperm of treated mice. In addition, the paternally acquired epimutation is transmitted to the F
  <sub>1</sub> offspring (Y.H. Shiao, personal communication), but the work awaits further clarification through linkage of 45S ribosomal RNA hypomethylation to the phenotype and study of the phenotype in the F
  <sub>2</sub> generation.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Transgenerational effects of environmental exposure to hormones or hormone-like substances has been of longstanding interest to the medical and ecologic communities. Diethylstilbestrol (DES), for example, was shown to affect the cancer susceptibility phenotype of “grandchildren” of DES-exposed female mice; the results suggested transmission of epigenetic pathology, but epigenetic investigations were not reported (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">Newbold et al. 2000</a>). A transgenerational epigenetic modification affecting at least three subsequent generations has been reported for rats exposed 
  <span class="italic">in utero</span> to vinclozolin, an agricultural fungicide, or methoxychlor, a pesticide (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">Anway et al. 2005</a>). Metabolites of these agents possess weak endocrine activity, and the agents are known generically as endocrine disruptors. Earlier experiments showed that either agent, when administered to the female mice or rats in midgestation, during embryonic primordial germ cell migration and gondadal sex determination, produced defective spermatogenic capacity in F
  <sub>1</sub> offspring (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">Shimamura et al. 2002</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">Uzumcu et al. 2004</a>). The underlying hypothesis of the new work is that disruption of normal genome demethylation and remethylation in primordial germ cells of the embryo (F
  <sub>1</sub>) leads to a change in the potential for normal demethylation and remethylation of the affected loci in the following and subsequent generations (F
  <sub>2</sub>+). The abnormal male phenotypes were observed in several male lines each from differently treated F
  <sub>0</sub> dams (and presumably different sires) of two different rat strains. This, and the non-Mendelian inheritance of the traits, argue against the possibility of a vinclozolin-induced genetic cause for the phenotype, and together with the methylation data suggest epigenetic inheritance. It will be interesting to follow the future course of these studies as the nature of the epigenetic abnormalities is explored in more depth.
