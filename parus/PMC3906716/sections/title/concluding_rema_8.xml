 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of phenotype is the flavor of the month and is provoking much interesting discussion (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">Jablonka and Lamb 2005</a>), but little hard data support it in mammals. In the same way as maternal effects can be mistaken for genetic effects unless explicitly modeled (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">Kruuk 2004</a> and references therein), it is possible that epigenetic effects require specific modeling for detection. More sophisticated large studies are needed in outbred populations, looking at the right sort of phenotype, ideally a phenotype with known genetic input, enabling elimination of a genetic cause for the phenotypic variation. Inbred model populations are still relatively untapped as an experimental resource for investigating transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. As mechanisms are better understood and population studies proceed, interesting findings are bound to emerge.
