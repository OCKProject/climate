 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The extent to which epigenotype contributes to variable phenotype is somewhat controversial and is difficult to disentangle from genetic and environmental contributions in outbred natural populations. Much evidence is indirect, being the genetic equivalent of an artwork’s “negative space,” i.e., epigenetic effect is a strong candidate source of phenotype variability after genetic and environmental effects have been ruled out. For example, animal studies using isogenic mammalian populations in defined environments showed that approximately 70%–80% of phenotype “random variability” in biological quantitative traits was unrelated to environment (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">Gartner 1990</a>). At the time, technical and perhaps conceptual limitations prevented better definition of the source of this apparently nongenetic, nonenvironmental variation. In a number of instances, phenotypic discordance between human monozygotic (MZ) twins raised apart is no greater than phenotypic discordance of MZ twins raised together. This suggests that a large proportion of the discordance is a result of something other than environment (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">Wong et al. 2005</a>). Indeed epigenetic discordance can account for phenotypic discordance between MZ twins in imprinting disorders such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" href="#CR70">Weksberg et al. 2003</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More recently, gene transcription has been directly investigated as a quantitative trait in studies of phenotypic variability. Do these studies tell us anything about the role of epigenetics in the determination of phenotype? Epigenetic modifiers of a notional locus A might be identified as 
  <span class="italic">cis</span>-acting, without DNA sequence changes in the “mutant” allele. As sensitized mutagenesis studies have shown, 
  <span class="italic">trans</span>-acting loci may also be identified, e.g., loci encoding histone or DNA methyltransferases. Microarray-based global transcription profiling studies in combination with classical genetic studies, such as linkage analysis in human and mouse populations and other model organisms such as yeast, show that natural variation in transcript abundance is common in eukaryotes and is often genetically linked to multiple loci. Mouse and human studies indicate that 
  <span class="italic">cis</span>-acting elements are an important component of mammalian gene expression variability, although the sensitivity of microarray platforms to detect 
  <span class="italic">cis</span>-acting elements in diploid organisms is limited by the inability to separate allele-specific measurements (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">Stamatoyannopoulos 2004</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The involvement of 
  <span class="italic">cis</span>-acting elements in transcript abundance implicates genetic involvement of regulatory systems involved in epigenetic effects such as promoters, silencers, enhancers, and insulators. Indeed, allele-specific transcriptional variation in 4 of 69 mouse genes expressed from four different inbred strains was accompanied by multiple strain-specific promoter sequence differences for each gene (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">Cowles et al. 2002</a>). In this case, the results indicate a likely genetic rather than epigenetic source of the variation, as do studies showing Mendelian inheritance of allele-specific expression variation in humans (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" href="#CR76">Yan et al. 2002</a>). Incomplete penetrance was observed in another similar study, suggesting a role for epigenetic factors, but the influence of 
  <span class="italic">trans</span> factors could not be ruled out (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">Pastinen et al. 2004</a>). As with other quantitative traits, variance in gene expression between MZ twins, e.g., as found by 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">Cheung et al (2003)</a> and 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">Sharma et al (2005)</a>, more clearly suggests a distinct role for epigenetic phenomena.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Genome-scale transcriptional profiling studies and allelic expression patterns also identify considerable variation lacking an obvious genetic source (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">Brem et al. 2002</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">Cheung et al. 2003</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">Schadt et al. 2003</a>). However, tracking down a source as purely epigenetic is severely limited if not impossible when working with outbred populations because of the abundant supply of genetic variation and the difficulties in controlling confounding factors such as environment or allelic transcript stability. Furthermore, the intent of most studies is to quantify genetic causes of gene expression variation between tissues, individuals, or populations. Thus, the study designs will not be sensitive detectors of epigenetic effects, despite showing there is potential for widespread epigenetic regulation of gene expression. It may be possible to gain an idea of the genome-wide impact of epigenetic transcriptional effects by transcriptional profiling studies within inbred strains of animals, under defined environmental conditions.
