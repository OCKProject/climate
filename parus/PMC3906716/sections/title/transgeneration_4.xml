 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With accumulating evidence of epigenetic association with normal phenotypic variation, the question arises as to the heritability of epigenetic characteristics. Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is difficult to study in outbred populations because the effects are stochastic, may be parentally influenced, and may be quite small, requiring large study populations to detect. As noted elsewhere, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance does not include imprinting, although this strict exclusion may not apply in some cases (see discussion about Kaati et al. below) (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">Rakyan and Whitelaw 2003</a>). While transgenerational epigenetic inheritance has been documented in many eukaryotes, evidence in mammals is scanty. Abnormal methylation patterns of mouse urinary protein inherited for two generations after nuclear transfer were reported by 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">Roemer et al. (1997)</a>. However, other reports indicate reversal of abnormal clone phenotypes in offspring of clones from nuclear transplantation, suggesting that the abnormalities were epigenetic in nature and were corrected in the germ cells of the clone (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Epigenetic inheritance has been studied extensively in viable yellow mice (

   <span class="italic">vy</span>
  </span>) and Axin-fused (
  <span class="italic">Axin</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <span class="italic">Fu</span>
  </span>) mice (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">Morgan et al. 1999</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">Rakyan et al. 2003</a>). In these mice, a variably penetrant phenotype is linked to the activity and DNA methylation status of a retrotransposon driving abnormal expression of the 
  <span class="italic">A</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <span class="italic">vy</span>
  </span> gene and production of aberrant transcripts from the 
  <span class="italic">Axin</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <span class="italic">Fu</span>
  </span> gene. The studies show that transgenerational inheritance of the methylation mark at these alleles can be through the maternal and/or the paternal germline, and it is strain dependent.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These two mouse models are convenient for investigation of epigenetic inheritance in that a clear phenotype is linked to an epigenetically controlled promoter for both genes. It is logical to suppose that many other examples exist with either a similar class of alternative promoter (i.e., retrotransposon promoter) or a more standard promoter; however, their detection and investigation is problematic if they lack a distinct phenotype. For example, a third naturally occurring metastable epiallele is the 
  <span class="italic">Cabp</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <span class="italic">IAP</span>
  </span> allele, discovered by searching gene expression databases for genes with alternative 5â€² regions provided by an endogenous retrovirus (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">Druker et al. 2004</a>). No obvious phenotype, other than aberrant transcripts, has been associated with 
  <span class="italic">Capb</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <span class="italic">IAP</span>
  </span> and its epigenetic heritability status has not been studied.
