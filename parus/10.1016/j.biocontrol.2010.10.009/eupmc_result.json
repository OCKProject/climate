    "The beneficial role of insectivorous birds potentially contributing to the biological control of forest insect pests appears crucial in the context of climate warming, especially for species currently expanding their range such as the pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa. Larvae of T. pityocampa are aposematic and carry true urticating setae which, together with overwintering in silk winter nests, prevent them from predation by most insectivorous forest birds. The present review aims at pointing out which bird species can regularly feed on this key forest defoliator throughout its distribution range, and which predation strategies allow birds to cope with the urticating setae carried by late-instar larvae. At least seven bird species can be considered as regular predators of the pine processionary moth: four large migrant specialists (great spotted cuckoo Clamator glandarius, common cuckoo Cuculus canorus, European nightjar Caprimulgus europaeus and Eurasian hoopoe Upupa epops) and three small sedentary generalists (great tit Parus major, crested tit Lophophanes cristatus and coal tit Periparus ater). Each species has developed morphological traits and foraging techniques to feed on different life stages of T. pityocampa throughout the year: (i) gizzard wall structure allowing the consumption of caterpillars with urticating setae (cuckoos); (ii) nocturnal foraging on moth imagos by aerial hawking (nightjars); (iii) ground probing on below-ground pupae with long curved bill (hoopoe); and (iv) shifted predation period in autumn and winter on eggs, early- and late-instar larvae, with particular feeding technique allowing to eat only the inner parts of urticating larvae stages (tits). Although several avian predators regularly feed on T. pityocampa, only a few specialist and generalist insectivorous birds may contribute to regulate its populations, especially when population density of the moth is low. Moreover, their efficiency may possibly be threatened by mismatches associated with climate change."
