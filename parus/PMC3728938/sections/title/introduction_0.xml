 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All birds, at some point during their annual cycle, carry out molt, the process of feather replacement. Molt serves two purposes: it keeps the plumage in good condition and it is adapted to special seasonal needs such as breeding and camouflage during the non-breeding season (Ginn and Melville 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" href="#b14">1983</a>). Due to energy constraints, most bird species avoid overlapping molt with other energetic and time demanding activities such as breeding or migration (Alerstam and Lindström 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" href="#b1">1990</a>). The need for a regular molt can, therefore, imposes a constraint on the life cycle of all birds.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Species that migrate long-distances have evolved a variety of strategies that allows them fit molt into their annual cycle. For instance, waders (Charadrii) such as the Little Stint 
  <span class="italic">Calidris minuta</span> and Red Knot 
  <span class="italic">Calidris canutus</span> molt most body and flight feathers almost exclusively on the non-breeding ground, Golden Plovers 
  <span class="italic">Pluvialis apricaria</span> start molt on or near the breeding grounds, the Wood Sandpiper 
  <span class="italic">Tringa glareola</span> and Wilson's Phalarope 
  <span class="italic">Phalaropus tricolor</span> start molt at some appropriate stopover site during migration which is then suspended and continued on the non-breeding ground (summarized in Prater et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" href="#b28">1977</a>; Ginn and Melville 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" href="#b14">1983</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ecological significance of molt lies in its link with other life-history traits within the annual cycle. For instance, in species that molt shortly after the breeding season is completed, molt can serve as an indicator for the end of the breeding season if breeding is difficult to quantify directly (Orell and Ojanen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" href="#b27">1980</a>; Reed et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" href="#b29">2003</a>). In species that make a single breeding attempt per season, an early onset of molt could indicate breeding failure (e.g., Barshep et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" href="#b3">2011a</a>). In migratory birds in which wing molt typically occurs after they have arrived at their non-breeding areas, there is the possibility that prior events within the annual cycle, such as breeding and migration, can displace the timing of molt (Barshep 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" href="#b2">2011</a>). Studies have shown that a shift in the timing of molt can affect the rate at which feathers are grown, which in turn affects feather quality (Dawson et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" href="#b10">2000</a>; Serra 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" href="#b33">2001</a>), and can even affect future survival and breeding success (Hemborg and Lundberg 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" href="#b16">1998</a>; Hemborge 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" href="#b17">1999</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although some theoretical models have also been used to explain how migratory distance, energy reserves, breeding status, and environmental seasonality can affect molt strategies in birds (e.g., Holmgren and Hedenström 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">1995</a>; Barta et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" href="#b5">2006</a>), the use of empirical data to test ecological hypotheses in relation to molt is somewhat a neglected area (Conklin and Battley 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" href="#b8">2012</a>). The reason for this neglect is partly due to a lack of adequate analytical tools to make comparisons between years, localities, and species. This barrier is, in part, removed with the development of molt models (e.g., Underhill and Zucchini 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" href="#b47">1988</a>), which enable explanatory variables to be included in models.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study examines how the timing of molt of long-distance migratory birds during the non-breeding season might be affected by environmental conditions experience by the birds earlier in the season using the Curlew Sandpiper 
  <span class="italic">Calidris ferruginea</span> as a study species (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">1</a>). The Curlew Sandpiper breeds in the Central Siberian Arctic of northern Russia (77°23′N, 71°40′E) with occasional breeding records near Barrow, Alaska (Cramp and Simpsons 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b201" href="#b201">1983</a>). The breeding system of the species is Polygyny; males do not partake in parental duties. The timing of post-breeding migration in this species has been linked to breeding productivity (Blomqvist et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" href="#b6">2002</a>; Figuerola 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" href="#b13">2006</a>; Barshep et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" href="#b4">2011b</a>), which has in turn been linked to lemming abundance and temperature in the tundra. Arctic predators such as the Arctic fox 
  <span class="italic">Alopex lagopus</span> have a preference for lemmings (
  <span class="italic">Lemmus</span> spp. and 
  <span class="italic">Dicrostonyx</span> spp.) and in years when lemmings are abundant, birds breed unmolested by predators. When lemming numbers collapse and there are large numbers of predators, a large proportion of breeding attempts are lost to predation (Summers and Underhill 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" href="#b36">1987</a>; Underhill et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b48" href="#b48">1993</a>), resulting in breeding failure and causing the birds to leave their breeding ground early. Breeding success is also low in years of low mean temperature in the Arctic during the breeding season (Schekkerman et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" href="#b31">1998</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our assumption is that if conditions on the breeding areas affect the timing of breeding and, eventually, migration, then the timing of molt will also be displaced, and the annual variation in the onset of molt will be related to conditions on the breeding area and/or some indicator of breeding success. We hypothesize that (a) conditions on the breeding areas will affect the start of molt on the wintering areas through carry-over effects (b) end date of the molt will affect pre-migratory fattening.</p>
