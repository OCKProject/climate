  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moult records of 2618 adult Curlew Sandpipers caught in South Africa (SA) (1970–1974) at Langebaan Lagoon (33°05′S, 18°02′E) and Rietvlei (33°50′S, 18°30′E), 5685 records (1981–2006) from Roebuck Bay and 80-Mile beach in northwestern Australia (NWA) (18°07′S, 122°16′E), and 7524 records (1978–2008) from southeastern Australia (SEA) (38°–39°N, 144°–147°E) were used in this study. Birds were aged based on feather appearance and wing condition (Prater et al.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b202" href="#b202">1990</a>). Adults were sexed using the discriminant function formula of Wymenga et al. (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Separate lemming and weather data sets were considered for Australia and SA because birds wintering in Australia are likely to originate from the eastern breeding range of the species while birds wintering in Africa are likely to originate from the western breeding range (Wymenga et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b52" href="#b52">1990</a>; Minton 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" href="#b23">2005</a>). Population records of lemming abundance from Yamal (70°N, 70°E), Taymyr Peninsula (74°N, 98°E), western Yakutia, and the lower Lena River (73°N 127°E) were extracted from the Arctic Breeding Birds Survey (
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arcticbirds.net/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.arcticbirds.net/</span>) and from literature (Underhill 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b44" href="#b44">1987</a>; Summers et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">1998</a>). Lemming abundance was scored on a four-graded scale 0–3 categorized as very low, low, moderate, and high. We merged the data sets on lemming abundance for each breeding region by taking the average and rounding to the nearest integer. The index of predation pressure was calculated using the formula of Blomqvist et al. (

   </sub>) to the focal year (
   <span class="italic">X</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">t</span>
   </sub>). Therefore, a predation index of 0 is due to an increase in lemming abundance from the previous to the focal year. The index ranges between 0 and 3, with 0 representing the minimum and 3 representing the maximum predation.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temperature data were used as a proxy for weather conditions in the Arctic during the breeding period in June and July (Tomkovich and Soloviev 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b42" href="#b42">2006</a>). Although other climate parameters such as precipitation and timing of snowmelt could also have been of major importance, temperature was the only variable for which it was possible to obtain consistent, long-term data for the period of interest. For Australia, data on temperature in June and July were obtained from the weather stations of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) located in Yakutia (70°N, 85°E) while for SA, temperature data were obtained from the weather station in Taymyr (74°N, 95°E). The proportion of juvenile birds in catch totals was used as an index of breeding success (Minton et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">2005</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Applying the Underhill–Zucchini molt model</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The frequently used methods to estimate the start date and duration of molt involves regressing molt scores of all birds against the date. This method is unsatisfactory because, using the standard field technique for recording primary molt data (Ginn and Melville 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" href="#b14">1983</a>), it appears as if the rate molt decreases over time (Summers et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" href="#b37">1983</a>). This is, in part, due to the fact that primary feathers vary greatly in length. The outer primaries are much larger than the inner primaries but the growth stage of all feather are scored equally. Rather than assuming that molt score increases linearly with time, it is more realistic to assume that feather material is produced at a constant rate (Summers et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" href="#b37">1983</a>; Underhill 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" href="#b43">1985</a>; demonstrated in Remisiewicz et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">2009</a>; Barshep et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" href="#b3">2011a</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" href="#b4">b</a>). Application of the UZ model therefore requires the conversion of molt scores into proportion of feather material grown (PFMG) given by the equation:

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">where m
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">i</span>
   </sub> is the mass of the 
   <span class="italic">i</span>th primary relative to the total mass of all the primaries, and 
   <span class="italic">p</span>(
   <span class="italic">s</span>

   </sub> relative to its mass when it is fully grown (see full details in Underhill and Zucchini 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" href="#b47">1988</a>). This conversion essentially “straightens” the progress of molt (Summers et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" href="#b37">1983</a>) while the molt model estimates the dates of commencement and completion of primary molt of the “average” bird.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data analyses</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moult scores were converted into PFMG using the relative masses of primary feathers (Underhill and Summers 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" href="#b46">1993</a>; Underhill and Joubert 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b45" href="#b45">1995</a>). Annual estimates of molt start date, duration of molt, and standard deviation of parameters for all adults as well as for the sexes were obtained using the combined PFMG of all 10 primary feathers. The relationship between the mean start dates of molt on the wintering grounds with proportion of juvenile birds in the total catch and the average June and July temperatures in the Arctic was explored using extensions of the maximum likelihood molt models of Underhill and Zucchini (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" href="#b47">1988</a>), which allows the inclusion of covariates in the model (Erni et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" href="#b12">2013</a>) allowing us to fit models of the form:Moult start date in year 
   <span class="italic">i</span> = 
   <span class="italic">a</span> + 
   <span class="italic">b</span> (covariate in year 
   <span class="italic">i</span>)where 
   <span class="italic">a</span> and 
   <span class="italic">b</span> would be two parameters to be estimated by the model (Underhill et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b49" href="#b49">2006</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The data were assumed to be “Type 2” which uses molt scores of birds that have not yet started molt, birds in molt, and those that have completed molt.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">End of molt and body condition</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relationship between the end date of molt and body condition, here expressed as the amount of fat accumulated by the bird above the lean body mass, prior to spring migration was explored. The allometric relationship between the lean body mass and wing length (an indicator of size in birds) was used to predict the mass of an individual bird of a given body size. We followed the approach recommended in Summers (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" href="#b35">1988</a>) and implemented by Schultz et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">2010</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The allometric relationship between wing length and mass is given as: 
   <span class="italic">m*</span> = 
   <span class="italic">aw</span>
   <span class="sup">
    <span class="italic">b</span>
   </span>, where 
   <span class="italic">m*</span> is the predicted lean mass of a bird with wing length 
   <span class="italic">w, a</span>, and 
   <span class="italic">b</span> are estimated using a log–log regression on the observed values for observed body mass 
   <span class="italic">m</span> (g) and wing length 
   <span class="italic">w</span> (mm). The condition index 
   <span class="italic">i</span> is the observed mass divided by the predicted mass for a bird of given wing length: 
   <span class="italic">i</span> = 
   <span class="italic">m/m*</span>. A bird with the condition index 
   <span class="italic">i</span> &gt; 1 has a larger mass than predicted for its wing length, and a bird with 
   <span class="italic">i</span> &lt; 1 has a smaller mass than that predicted for its wing length (Schultz 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">2010</a>). For the estimation of the allometric relationship, only birds caught in February were used; this is the month when birds were leanest (Elliott et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" href="#b11">1976</a>; Minton et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">2006</a>) and when molt would have been completed, therefore, feather wear will not affect calculations of allometric relationship.
