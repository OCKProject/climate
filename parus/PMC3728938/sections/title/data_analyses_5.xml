 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moult scores were converted into PFMG using the relative masses of primary feathers (Underhill and Summers 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" href="#b46">1993</a>; Underhill and Joubert 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b45" href="#b45">1995</a>). Annual estimates of molt start date, duration of molt, and standard deviation of parameters for all adults as well as for the sexes were obtained using the combined PFMG of all 10 primary feathers. The relationship between the mean start dates of molt on the wintering grounds with proportion of juvenile birds in the total catch and the average June and July temperatures in the Arctic was explored using extensions of the maximum likelihood molt models of Underhill and Zucchini (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" href="#b47">1988</a>), which allows the inclusion of covariates in the model (Erni et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" href="#b12">2013</a>) allowing us to fit models of the form:Moult start date in year 
  <span class="italic">i</span> = 
  <span class="italic">a</span> + 
  <span class="italic">b</span> (covariate in year 
  <span class="italic">i</span>)where 
  <span class="italic">a</span> and 
  <span class="italic">b</span> would be two parameters to be estimated by the model (Underhill et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b49" href="#b49">2006</a>).
