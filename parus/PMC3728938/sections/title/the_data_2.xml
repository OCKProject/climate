 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moult records of 2618 adult Curlew Sandpipers caught in South Africa (SA) (1970–1974) at Langebaan Lagoon (33°05′S, 18°02′E) and Rietvlei (33°50′S, 18°30′E), 5685 records (1981–2006) from Roebuck Bay and 80-Mile beach in northwestern Australia (NWA) (18°07′S, 122°16′E), and 7524 records (1978–2008) from southeastern Australia (SEA) (38°–39°N, 144°–147°E) were used in this study. Birds were aged based on feather appearance and wing condition (Prater et al.
