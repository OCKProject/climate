In the allometric regression, 63% and 65% of the variance in mass was explained by wing length for the Curlew Sandpipers in NWA and SEA, respectively. Sex accounted for only 2.2% and 2.7% of the variance in NWA and SEA, respectively, indicating that wing length alone could be used to predict the allometric relationship without taking sex into account. In both areas, the earlier the end date of molt the higher the body mass indices of the birds in March (NWA:
