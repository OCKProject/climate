  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>2,6103</sub> = 7.01, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.002). The start dates of molt for the average female bird at the different sites are as follows. In SA, start date was 18 October (±1.1 SE), duration 124 days (±2.2 SE), and standard deviation of start date 13 days (±1.7 SE). In NWA, the average start date of molt was 30 September (±0.9 SE), duration 130 days (±1.1 SE), and standard deviation of start date 14 days (±1.3 SE). In SEA, the mean start date of molt was 24 October (±0.8 SE), duration of 114 days (±2.0 SE) and standard deviation of start date 11 days (±1.0 SE). In SA, the annual estimates of the start dates of molt for females ranged from 16 September to 23 October (38 days), 3 September to 26 October (54 days) in NWA, and 17 October to 31 October (14 days) in SEA (Fig.

The duration of molt was longer for males than that for females. In SA, the average duration of molt for males was 131 days (SE ± 1.2) and 123 days (SE ± 2.2) for females, 133 days (SE ± 0.7) for males and 130 days (SE ± 1.1) for females in NWA, and 124 days (SE ± 2.0) for males and 114 days (SE ± 1.0) for females in SEA.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At all three sites, the start date of molt in males was not related to the proportion of juvenile birds or the temperature in July, but molt generally started earlier in years with high June temperatures (Table

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">3</a>). In females, the start date of molt was not related to the proportion of juvenile birds in SA, but molt started significantly later in good breeding years compared to poor breeding years in NWA and SEA (Table 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a>). Both predation index and the temperature in July were significant predictors of the start date of molt. The start of molt in females was significantly earlier in years of high predation pressure (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">4</a>) and low July temperature (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">3</a>), but was not significantly related to June temperature (Table

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to examine the link between the end dates of molt and body condition prior to migration, we used the estimated end dates of molt for the entire population rather than for the separate sexes because for many years, the sample sizes of body condition in March were too small when the data were separated into sexes. The overall annual estimates of the start date of molt ranged between 3 October and 13 October (10 days) in SA, 31 August and 18 October (44 days) in NWA, 29 September and 12 November (23 days) in SEA. Annual estimates of the end date of molt ranged between 8 February and 18 February (10 days) in SA, 19 January and 30 March (44 days) in NWA, 4 February and 15 March (23 days) in SEA. There was a negative correlation between the start date of molt and duration of molt (Pearson's correlation; SA: 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = −0.80,
