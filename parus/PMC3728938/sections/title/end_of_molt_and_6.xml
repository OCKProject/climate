 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relationship between the end date of molt and body condition, here expressed as the amount of fat accumulated by the bird above the lean body mass, prior to spring migration was explored. The allometric relationship between the lean body mass and wing length (an indicator of size in birds) was used to predict the mass of an individual bird of a given body size. We followed the approach recommended in Summers (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" href="#b35">1988</a>) and implemented by Schultz et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">2010</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The allometric relationship between wing length and mass is given as: 
  <span class="italic">m*</span> = 
  <span class="italic">aw</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <span class="italic">b</span>
  </span>, where 
  <span class="italic">m*</span> is the predicted lean mass of a bird with wing length 
  <span class="italic">w, a</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">b</span> are estimated using a logâ€“log regression on the observed values for observed body mass 
  <span class="italic">m</span> (g) and wing length 
  <span class="italic">w</span> (mm). The condition index 
  <span class="italic">i</span> is the observed mass divided by the predicted mass for a bird of given wing length: 
  <span class="italic">i</span> = 
  <span class="italic">m/m*</span>. A bird with the condition index 
  <span class="italic">i</span> &gt; 1 has a larger mass than predicted for its wing length, and a bird with 
  <span class="italic">i</span> &lt; 1 has a smaller mass than that predicted for its wing length (Schultz 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">2010</a>). For the estimation of the allometric relationship, only birds caught in February were used; this is the month when birds were leanest (Elliott et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" href="#b11">1976</a>; Minton et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">2006</a>) and when molt would have been completed, therefore, feather wear will not affect calculations of allometric relationship.
