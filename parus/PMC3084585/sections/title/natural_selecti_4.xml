 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate variation affects ecological processes at multiple scales and influences local selection pressures. For example, in finches endemic to the Galápagos Islands (
  <span class="italic">Geospiza fortis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">G. scandens</span>), changes in rainfall driven by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation affect relative abundance of seeds of different sizes and hardness, which in turn drive fluctuating patterns of selection on body size and beak morphology (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" href="#b31">Grant &amp; Grant 2002</a>). In a changing climate, selection can shift from stabilizing, where intermediate trait values have highest fitness, to net-directional. Alternatively, local climates might become more variable and extreme weather events more frequent (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" href="#b20">Easterling et al. 2000</a>), in which case populations experience selection that fluctuates more in sign and magnitude. The latter is expected to favor increased plasticity, although several factors might limit evolutionary changes to phenotypic plasticity.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Predicting changes in natural selection requires identifying biotic and abiotic factors exerting selective pressures, estimating likely temporal and spatial changes in these factors under different scenarios of climate change, identifying which traits, or combinations of traits, will be targets of this selection, and determining how phenotypic plasticity affects (potentially correlated) trait selection.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Extrapolating selection patterns in future environments necessitates knowledge of mechanistic links between climate variation, phenotypes, and fitness (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" href="#b36">Holt 1990</a>). Studies on Great Tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) and trophic interactions in the Netherlands, where spring temperatures have been rising gradually, are illustrative. Since 1973 researchers measured annual selection differentials (a measure of the strength of directional selection, defined as the covariance between trait and relative fitness) for the date egg laying began and documented increased selection for earlier egg laying (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b70" href="#b70">Visser et al. 1998</a>). The ecological mechanism underpinning the changing relation between trait and fitness involves shifts in the phenology of food (larvae of the winter moth [
  <span class="italic">Operophtera brumata</span>]) for chicks and potential effects of changing larval phenology on the productivity of Great Tits (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b69" href="#b69">Visser et al. 2006</a>). Timing of egg hatching in 
  <span class="italic">O. brumata</span> is itself under selection for synchronization with bud burst in oak trees (
  <span class="italic">Quercus robur</span>). Caterpillars of this moth rely on oak leaves for food, and although the oak trees have been opening their buds earlier, advancement in the date of egg hatching has been more extreme (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b66" href="#b66">van Asch et al. 2007</a>). Caterpillars now emerge before their food peaks and consequently are most available for Great Tits earlier in the season (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b69" href="#b69">Visser et al. 2006</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For evolution to occur, at least some of the variation among individuals in traits affecting survival and reproductive success must be transmitted from parents to offspring. Given knowledge of selective pressures and genetic variances and covariances (inheritance patterns underlying trait variation), the expected trajectory and rate of evolutionary change can be calculated (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b59" href="#b59">Price 1970</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" href="#b47">Lande &amp; Arnold 1983</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" href="#b23">Falconer &amp; Mackay 1996</a>). Selection acts on expressed phenotypes and both the expression of genetic variation and the strength of selection often depend on the environment (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b44" href="#b44">Kruuk et al. 2008</a>). Obtaining estimates of selection intensity and quantitative genetic parameters across a range of environmental conditions allows for more accurate prediction of how mean traits values might respond to climate change (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">Etterson 2008</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under continual directional selection, the mean phenotype will lag behind a moving optimum because traits are never 100% heritable. The key issue is to determine whether the resulting lag load is demographically sustainable. Extinction probability following a large, abrupt environmental change can be substantial in populations of low to medium density even if they exhibit adaptive evolution after the change (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" href="#b28">Gomulkiewicz &amp; Holt 1995</a>; but see 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" href="#b7">Boulding &amp; Hay 2001</a>). This is because strong directional selection generates a large number of deaths each generation. When environmental change is gradual, evolving populations can track a moving selective optimum, but persistence still depends on the continued availability of sufficient genetic variation in the right phenotypic direction (i.e., in a direction aligned with that of selection) (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" href="#b47">Lande &amp; Arnold 1983</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" href="#b10">Bürger &amp; Krall 2004</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" href="#b39">Jones et al. 2004</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Whenever selection acts on multiple phenotypic traits simultaneously, genetic correlations among traits, or a lack of genetic variance for some, can prevent or slow the rate of evolution toward the optimum combination of trait values (i.e., the one which would yield the highest fitness) (e.g., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">Dickerson 1955</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" href="#b47">Lande &amp; Arnold 1983</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b67" href="#b67">Via &amp; Lande 1985</a>). For example, if two traits are negatively correlated genetically but selection favors higher phenotypic values for each, then an increase in one would result in a decrease in the other, and consequently neither might evolve (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">Etterson &amp; Shaw 2001</a>). The greater the opposition between trait genetic covariance and the direction of multivariate selection, the faster the population accrues a lag load in a monotonically changing environment (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" href="#b33">Hellmann &amp; Pineda-Krch 2007)</a>. The resulting drop in absolute fitness can lead to reductions in abundance and make a population more susceptible to genetic and demographic stochasticity (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" href="#b10">Bürger &amp; Krall 2004</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conversely, genetic correlations between traits that match the direction of selection can increase the rate of evolution (relative to the situation in which traits are independent (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" href="#b1">Agrawal &amp; Stinchcombe 2009</a>) and potentially reduce relative extinction probability. Absolute extinction probability might still increase if environments become increasingly stochastic or if carrying capacity is reduced. Most biologists agree that selection is unlikely to act on traits in isolation, yet few have quantified genetic covariation among traits affecting individual fitness in the context of an altered climate (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" href="#b33">Hellmann &amp; Pineda-Krch 2007</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several classes of traits are expected to experience strong selection in general as climate changes, such as traits related to the timing of life-history events, physiological tolerances, dietary preferences, and disease resistance. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" href="#b9">Bradshaw and Holzapfel (2008)</a> argue that timing of key life-history transitions, such as timing of reproduction, will often be under strongest selection. Evolutionary responses to longer growing seasons have already been documented in a range of animals, including mosquitoes, squirrels, and migratory birds (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" href="#b9">Bradshaw &amp; Holzapfel 2008</a>). Longer summers and shorter winters might also lead to prolonged droughts in some regions, which would select for phenological changes in plants. For example, between 2000 and 2004, low winter precipitation led to shorter growing seasons for 
  <span class="italic">Brassica rapa</span> (field mustard) in southern California. Thus, earlier flowering was selected for and many late bloomers senesced before they produced seeds. Plants bloomed 8.6 days earlier in one population following the drought, and survival of postdrought genotypes was higher than predrought genotypes (grown from stored seed) when both were grown under conditions mimicking a shorter season (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" href="#b26">Franks et al. 2007</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rising temperatures, atmospheric CO
  <sub>2,</sub> and ocean acidity will impose strong and complex selection on terrestrial and aquatic organisms to adapt their physiology (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b57" href="#b57">Pörtner &amp; Farrell 2008</a>). The degree to which different aspects of thermal physiology are evolutionarily labile within and across taxa is debated (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" href="#b2">Angilletta et al. 2002</a>), but genetic constraints (e.g., negative genetic correlations between performance at high and low temperatures or between different aspects of performance) may be a real limitation for some populations. Heat tolerance in ectothermic animals may be under weaker selection than cold tolerance (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" href="#b9">Bradshaw &amp; Holzapfel 2008</a>). Nonetheless, intensified selection on thermal performance may occur in many situations in the future. In the tropics, terrestrial ectotherms already live close to their physiologically determined thermal optima and have much narrower thermal tolerances compared with ectotherms that live at higher latitudes (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" href="#b16">Deutsch et al. 2008</a>). Although greater warming is predicted at higher latitudes (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">IPCC 2007</a>), relatively small temperature increases or increased thermal variability in the tropics could affect fitness in ectotherms greatly and select for higher or broader temperature tolerances. Additionally, the fitness of ectotherms in warming temperate regions may initially increase (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" href="#b16">Deutsch et al. 2008</a>). Increased thermal variability may be detrimental for aquatic species, however, whose capacity for aerobic performance decreases substantially at both low and high temperatures, where oxygen supply becomes limiting (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b57" href="#b57">Pörtner &amp; Farrell 2008</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the oceans rising temperatures will increasingly impose thermal stress on corals, and models suggest persistence will require an increase in the thermal tolerance of corals of 0.5–1 °C by 2060 (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">Donner et al. 2005</a>). Acclimatization responses such as the uptake of novel heat-tolerant symbionts (
  <span class="italic">Symbiodinium</span> spp.) may partially increase tolerance, but genetic responses in the host or symbiont would likely also be necessary (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" href="#b5">Baird et al. 2009</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ocean acidification resulting from increased dissolution of atmospheric carbon dioxide (forming carbonic acid) inhibits the ability of hard-shelled marine organisms, including reef-building corals, to incorporate calcium carbonate into their shells. Although mechanisms allowing more efficient extraction of carbonates from seawater may evolve, pH could decrease so much that exoskeletons dissolve. For all organisms, rapid adaptation of physiological tolerances to climate change remains plausible but uncertain.</p>
