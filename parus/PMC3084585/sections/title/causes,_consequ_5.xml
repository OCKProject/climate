 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plastic phenotypic responses by individuals to shifting conditions, such as changes in behavior (including migratory patterns), physiology, and morphology, provide another means to persist as climate changes. Phenotypic plasticity, the environment-dependent expression of phenotypes by genotypes, can substantially alter the phenotypic distribution (mean and variance) of populations over time without a genetic change. Plasticity is evolutionarily favored when the environment is heterogeneous in time or space, selection favors different phenotypes in different environments, no one phenotype has greatest fitness across all environments, and reliable cues allow organisms to respond effectively (

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b62" href="#b62">Scheiner 1993</a>). Costs associated with acquiring environmental information, producing different phenotypes, and maintaining the physiological and developmental capacity for facultative responses, however, can substantially constraint the evolution of phenotypic plasticity (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b62" href="#b62">Scheiner 1993</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" href="#b17">DeWitt et al. 1998</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">de Jong 1999</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adaptive plasticity in key traits may allow populations to track shifting selection pressures without much evolution. For example, warmer, drier springs in the Canadian Yukon have led to an increase and seasonal advancement in cone production of white spruce (
  <span class="italic">Picea glauca</span>) the primary food source for North American red squirrels (
  <span class="italic">Tamiascurus hudsonicus</span>). In response, female squirrels have advanced their parturition dates by approximately 18 days over a 10-year period, which has occurred mostly through plasticity rather than genetic adaptation (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b61" href="#b61">Réale et al. 2003</a>). Mean lifetime reproductive success has remained stable, which suggests the squirrels have remained well adapted (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" href="#b6">Berteaux et al. 2004</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" href="#b13">Charmantier et al. 2008</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plasticity has limits, however (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" href="#b17">DeWitt et al. 1998</a>), and once these are exceeded adaptive evolution or demographic rescue from neighboring source populations (populations in which the number of births exceeds the number of deaths) provide the only mechanisms for persistence. The limits to adaptive plasticity in wild populations are not well understood. Empirical studies relating phenotypic responses of known individuals to environmental changes can increase understanding, particularly if fitness consequences can be deduced (e.g., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b61" href="#b61">Réale et al. 2003</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b52" href="#b52">Nussey et al. 2005</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" href="#b13">Charmantier et al. 2008</a>). Understanding also can be increased by experiments in which temperatures or other environmental variables are manipulated beyond the historical range. Plastic and evolutionary responses to the resulting artificial selection can be determined statistically with reciprocal-transplant experiments (e.g., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b58" href="#b58">Potvin &amp; Tousignant 1996</a>) or experiments with pedigreed families (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">Etterson 2008</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reaction norms are functional relations that describe how traits change as a result of phenotypic plasticity when the environment changes. Regardless whether plasticity limits are exceeded, selective pressures on reaction norms will almost certainly change as climate and ecological interactions change. Simple, linear reaction norms are characterized by two parameters: elevation, which describes the expected phenotype in the average environment, and slope (degree of plasticity), which measures how responsive the phenotype is to environmental change. Independent selection pressures on each component are difficult to predict, but several broad scenarios can be distinguished on the basis of expected environmental change.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In many ecosystems, particularly at high latitudes, varying rates of phenological and ontogenetic changes across species are leading to mismatches between interacting species (e.g., predators and prey). In situations where environmental cues used by organisms to time life-history transitions no longer are effective, selection might favor changes in reaction—norm elevation, shape (e.g., slope), or both. For example, caterpillar prey for Great Tits in the Netherlands are now available to feed chicks considerably earlier in the summer than several decades ago (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b70" href="#b70">Visser et al. 1998</a>). Females who always lay early and those who lay early only in warm years (more plastic females), have higher reproductive success (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b52" href="#b52">Nussey et al. 2005</a>). Variation across females in these reaction-norm components (elevation and slope) has a heritable component, which suggests that reaction-norm evolution could alleviate the negative effects of phenological shifts for this population (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b52" href="#b52">Nussey et al. 2005</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If the frequency of previously rare extreme climatic events increases (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" href="#b20">Easterling et al. 2000</a>), selection pressures and population dynamics may become more erratic, and this may favor evolution of increased plasticity (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b63" href="#b63">Svanbäck et al. 2009</a>). Nevertheless, if plasticity entails substantial energetic costs that reduce fitness, selection is expected to favor generalist (high plasticity) strategies only when ecological dynamics are highly variable or cyclic. Otherwise, selection should favor low-cost specialist (low plasticity) strategies (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b63" href="#b63">Svanbäck et al. 2009</a>). Even if energetic costs of plasticity are low, stronger plasticity will be selected for only if environments remain predictable, which is unlikely (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b68" href="#b68">Visser 2008</a>). Unless organisms can switch to more reliable cues, selection may favor reduced plasticity (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b62" href="#b62">Scheiner 1993</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">de Jong 1999</a>)— even if environments become more variable.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moreover, local environments may change rapidly, for example, due to an abrupt climatic shift or the appearance of a novel predator. Sudden, qualitative shifts in abiotic conditions or community composition can render previously adaptive plastic responses suboptimal (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b48" href="#b48">Langerhans &amp; DeWitt 2002</a>). Under these circumstances, selection may favor phenotypes beyond the range that can be produced by nonplastic genotypes. If genetic variation for plasticity exists in the population and some plastic genotypes produce phenotypes that are better adapted to the new conditions, directional selection may favor these induced extremes (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" href="#b4">Badyaev 2005</a>). Such a process of plasticity and subsequent “genetic assimilation” (eventual flattening of reaction norms) may allow populations to evolve rapidly enough to survive abrupt change (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b60" href="#b60">Price et al. 2003</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" href="#b46">Lande 2009</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Higher environmental stress may also increase mutation or recombination rates, thereby increasing genetic diversity and evolutionary potential (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" href="#b35">Hoffmann &amp; Parsons 1997</a>). Phenotypic diversity may be further enhanced if “cryptic genetic variation” is released, that is, variation outside the normal range of reactions that was never expressed phenotypically (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b51" href="#b51">McGuigan &amp; Sgro 2009</a>). If either or both of these processes lead to the emergence of novel phenotypic variants that perform well under the novel stresses, adaptive evolution may occur fast enough to preclude extinction (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" href="#b11">Carroll &amp; Watters 2008</a>).
