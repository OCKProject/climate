 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Experimental studies that explore fitness consequences of phenotypic and genetic change under simulated climate change in different demographic contexts (e.g., large vs. small populations or closed populations vs. metapopulations) can test theoretical models of extinction risk and elucidate general, adaptive mechanisms and genetic and demographic constraints that might affect population and species persistence in the wild.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Theoretical models suggest maximum sustainable rates of continuous evolution in closed populations could be &lt;10% of a phenotypic standard deviation per generation. Any continuous shift in the optimal phenotype beyond this rate may overwhelm evolutionary potential and decrease abundance (

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" href="#b10">Bürger &amp; Krall 2004</a>). These models assume adaptation occurs gradually by successive substitution of alleles (gene variants) with mostly small phenotypic effects. Nevertheless, adaptation to novel environments often involves mutations that have large effects (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" href="#b40">Keeling et al. 2008</a>). More recent models suggest that different combinations of genetic architecture (e.g., number and effect size of genes affecting the trait; frequency of occurrence of major mutations) and types of environmental change (e.g., sudden vs. gradual) can have complex consequences for rates of adaptation and population persistence (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" href="#b43">Kopp &amp; Hermisson 2007</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" href="#b29">Gomulkiewicz et al. 2010</a>). Adaptive plasticity will also reduce the demographic impact of strong selection, allow more time for evolutionary adaptation, and reduce the amount of evolutionary change necessary to track a moving optimum (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" href="#b12">Chevin et al. 2010</a>). Simulation models that capture essential evolutionary and ecological dynamics (e.g., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" href="#b7">Boulding &amp; Hay 2001</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" href="#b37">Holt &amp; Gomulkiewicz 2004</a>) could be extended to incorporate plasticity and alternative modes of genetic architecture and then used to explore different climate-change scenarios.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Altered patterns of gene flow between open populations (or between species at hybrid zones) may play an important role in modulating adaptive responses to climate change. Increased gene flow could lead to an influx of useful genetic variation that might permit faster evolutionary tracking of environmental change or facilitate shifts between adaptive peaks. Conversely, gene flow from populations adapted to very different conditions could disrupt local adaptation (e.g., immigrants might not have resistance to local strains of parasites). For example, increased regional climate heterogeneity could accentuate differences in selective regimes across a species’ range, which could increase migration loads (the reduction in mean fitness because of immigration of maladapted genotypes that breed and compete with local genotypes). Under such circumstances, adaptation and persistence may be maximized at intermediate dispersal levels, although the advantages of immigration may outweigh its negative effects when populations are initially adapting to locations that have become demographic sinks (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" href="#b37">Holt &amp; Gomulkiewicz 2004</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For organisms with limited dispersal capabilities, habitat fragmentation and climate change may together render long-term persistence unlikely (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b65" href="#b65">Travis 2003</a>), unless in situ adaptation can keep pace with environmental changes. Species with shorter generation times, higher initial population sizes, and higher fecundity are expected to evolve faster for a given absolute pace of physical change. Increased climatic variability may exceed the current capacity of long-lived species with low fecundity to persist through phenotypic plasticity (e.g., via behavioral buffering of adult survival) (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">Forcada et al. 2008</a>). Many threatened species are long-lived and have small population sizes, whereas species currently considered invasive may adapt most readily.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Establishing the rates of climate change that allow population persistence via phenotypic plasticity and evolution requires identifying which aspects of climate shape the selective pressures and currently limit the abundance and distribution of organisms (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" href="#b37">Holt &amp; Gomulkiewicz 2004</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">Helmuth et al. 2010</a>). Conservation measures, such as effort to increase the quantity, quality, and connectivity of a species’ habitat, could at least maintain if not be targeted to increase phenotypic and genetic diversity (and therefore adaptive potential) within and among populations (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" href="#b11">Carroll &amp; Watters 2008</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most current projections of extinction probability as climate changes (e.g., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b64" href="#b64">Thomas et al. 2004</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b50" href="#b50">Malcolm et al. 2006</a>) do not account for adaptation. Conservation plans that aim to preserve key ecological and evolutionary processes, rather than status quo phenotypes, will at least ensure that species have a fighting chance against climate change.
