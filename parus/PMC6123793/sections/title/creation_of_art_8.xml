 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Artificial moth targets for the avian predation experiments followed a wide range of past experiments using similar targets based either on natural backgrounds or designed to mimic real species

  </span>. Targets were created using the multispectral images generated from the moth museum specimen photographs. As with a range of past work, images were converted to the predicted photon catches of the vision of the blue tit, under D65 lighting conditions, and then the output of a printer was calibrated in an iterative process

  </span> such that the image colours (pixel values) converged to accurately match the real moths in terms of bird vision when reproduced. The match for every printed target was a JND value &lt; 1.00, indicating indistinguishability from a real moth

  </span>. Generally, most previous work has tended to, for example, simply match the appearance of target wings to the average colour (in photon catches) of the substrate (e.g., tree bark
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>
  </span>). Past work matching artificial prey items to Lepidopteran models has also tended to ensure that matches of colour are based on targets falling within the range of photon catch values of the real animal model
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. Our work most closely follows other recent work on butterfly coloration
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">65</a>
  </span>, which used a visual discrimination model to create matches to the real butterflies, with matches chosen when colours fell within 1–3 JNDs. Our approach is in fact even more detailed in that, unlike past studies, we did not create all targets per treatment as identical and simply matching an average model coloration, but instead we included individual variation by matching different individual targets to 100 unique individual moth models (see below). Therefore, our work is robust in accounting both for individual variation and in setting rigorous criteria, whereby models were only generated when colour and luminance matches to the real specimens were within 1.00 JND.

 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Once 50 individuals of each of the two morphs (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 100) were correctly calibrated, they were scaled to ensure their size accurately matched real-life peppered moths; with each wing, on average, 221 mm
  <span class="sup">2</span> in surface area. The specimens were printed using an HP LaserJet Enterprise 500 Colour M551 on Whatman Filter Paper No.1 12.5 cm stuck onto A4 plain paper. Using filter paper on which to print the targets was undertaken because this, unlike normal printer paper, reflects ultraviolet light and enabled us to match the UV reflectance of typical moths even though printer ink is incapable of printing UV itself

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>
  </span>. Artificial wings were made waterproof using Plasti-Kote Matt Clear Acrylic spray paint, which permitted transmission / reflectance of UV.

 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An edible body was made of pastry, which has been shown in various previous experiments to be a safe, edible, and an effective measure of bird predation rates, including when attached to paper targets
  <span class="sup">

  </span>. Following past protocols, lard and plain flour were mixed in a 1:3 ratio, before adding five drops of black food colouring for the 
  <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> morphs, or a combination of approximately one red, one blue, three yellow and one black drop(s) for the typical morphs. White food colouring was used to add pattern to 
  <span class="italic">typica</span> bodies. The pastry was rolled into 12 × 5 × 2 mm bodies, attached to the artificial wings using a 20-mm panel pin inserted into the centre of the pastry body, and left overnight in the freezer to set.
 </p>
 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The creation of the edible bodies for the targets was somewhat constrained by both available food colourings and of aiming to match both colour and luminance simultaneously. We calculated, using the above methods and visual modelling, the colour and luminance contrasts of fifteen pastry bodies, of each morph, against the moths themselves and natural resting backgrounds. For luminance, results for bodies to moths were: 
  <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> (mean JND plus standard error: 3.838 ± 0.733) and 
  <span class="italic">typica</span> (3.809 ± 0.731). For colour, matches were: 
  <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> (16.106 ± 1.477) and 
  <span class="italic">typica</span> (4.991 ± 0.641). The comparisons of bodies to respective natural backgrounds for luminance were: 
  <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> (3.773 ± 0.348) and 
  <span class="italic">typica</span> (1.660 ± 0.309). For colour, matches were: 
  <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> (13.721 ± 1.328) and 
  <span class="italic">typica</span> (2.783 ± 0.148). Therefore, results demonstrate relatively low distinguishability of bodies to both moths and backgrounds, with the exception of 
  <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> for colour. However, this difference is highly unlikely to explain our survival results for multiple reasons (see Discussion).
