  <span class="sup">−14</span>, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), whereby 
  <span class="italic">typica</span> morphs displayed low chromatic differences, or good camouflage (mean JND = 2.99 ± 1.17 standard error), and 
  <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> had a poorer match to the background (8.03 ± 0.83 JND). There was no significant difference in the colour match between the morphs on plain bark backgrounds (
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>1,129</sub> = 1.66, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 130, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.19); 
  <span class="italic">typica</span> (9.81 ± 2.17 JND) and 
  <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> (8.95 ± 1.53 JND). For luminance, there was also a significant difference in matching between morphs to lichen (

  <span class="italic">n</span> = 130,

  <span class="sup">−16</span>), with 
  <span class="italic">typica</span> (1.82 ± 0.67 JND) predicted to be close to indistinguishable in luminance to lichen, compared to 
  <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> (6.64 ± 0.48 JND) that has greater achromatic contrast. Furthermore, there was a significant difference in luminance camouflage between morphs on plain bark (
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>1,129</sub> = 108.93, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 130, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 2e
  <span class="sup">−16</span>), with 
  <span class="italic">typica</span> showing greater difference and worse camouflage (8.56 ± 1.03 JND) in comparison to 
  <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> (3.07 ± 0.73 JND), which showed a close match. Overall, our results support the expectations that 
  <span class="italic">typica</span> is a much closer match to crustose lichen, whereas 
  <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> a closer match to plain bark (Fig.

    <p>Camouflage of peppered moth morphs to avian vision. Images show a melanic and a typical peppered moth morph to avian vision, along with samples of plain bark and lichen. 
     <span class="bold">a</span> This set of images represent colour data (
     <span class="italic">n</span> = 130), comprised of cone response data for a longwave, mediumwave, shortwave, and UV cones (with UV and shortwave data combined into the blue image channel as images have only three layers). 
     <span class="bold">b</span> This set of images represent data from avian double cones, showing luminance (
     <span class="italic">n</span> = 130). These images illustrate the better match for colour and luminance of 
     <span class="italic">typica</span> compared to carbonaria against lichen backgrounds. Graphs are just noticeable difference (JND) results for colour (
     <span class="bold">a</span>) and luminance (
     <span class="bold">b</span>) of 
     <span class="italic">typica</span> and 
     <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> specimens against plain bark and lichen. JND data was statistically analysed using a general linear model, with colour data log-transformed. For colour (
     <span class="bold">a</span>) between the morphs, plain bark did not display significance (
     <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.19) whereas lichen bark did (
