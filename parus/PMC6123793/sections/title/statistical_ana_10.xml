  </span>. A generalised linear model was performed on both colour and luminance JNDs, with background type as the response variable and morph the explanatory variable. Model residuals were checked for assumptions of homogeneity of variance and a normal distribution, for which colour JND data for both bark and lichen required a log transformation to correct for skewness. For the field experiment, a Nonparametric Distribution Analysis (Right Censoring) was performed using Minitab Statistical Software 18
