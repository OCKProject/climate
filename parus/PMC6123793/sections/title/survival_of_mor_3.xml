  </span>. We expected that there would be a higher survival of 
  <span class="italic">typica</span> than 
  <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> targets. Survival was measured over a 48-h period across ten experimental blocks and significantly differed between 
  <span class="italic">typica</span> and 
  <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> (

  <span class="sup">−16</span>; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Survival probability estimates at 48 h were 0.43 ± 0.03 for 
  <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> and 0.64 ± 0.03 for 
  <span class="italic">typica</span> (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>, 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). No morph-related censoring bias was observed for non-avian predation or disappearing targets: 20 
  <span class="italic">typica</span> and 17 
  <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> treatments required censoring. These results, overall, indicate that 
  <span class="italic">typica</span> had an ~21% greater survival rate than 
  <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> across the entire experiment.
