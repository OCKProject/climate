   <span class="italic">Biston betularia</span>) specimens were required for digital image analysis. Photographic data were obtained from three museums in the south of England: Bristol Museum and Art Gallery, the Exeter Ark of the Royal Albert Memorial Museum and Art Gallery, and Oxford University Museum of Natural History. The Oxford collections are noteworthy as they contain the specimens collected by Kettlewell for his original bird predation and breeding experiments. Access was permitted to the specimen drawers for selection of the most intact 
   <span class="italic">typica</span> and 
   <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> forms of both sexes for sampling, with selection based on wing completeness. Due to the age and fragility of such specimens, care in handling the pinned insects was paramount.

  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used a Nikon D7000 DSLR camera that had previously undergone a quartz conversion (Advanced Camera Services Limited, Norfolk, UK) by replacement of the internal UV filter with a transparent quartz sheet, as per previous studies

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
   </span>. This allowed for full spectral sensitivity throughout the avian-visible spectrum. A CoastalOpt 105 mm UV Macro APO interchangeable lens was attached whereby photographs in the human-visible spectrum were taken with a Baader UV-IR blocking filter (transmitting 400–700 nm) and ultraviolet (UV) photographs were taken using a Baader UV pass filter (transmitting 315–400 nm)
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
   </span>. All images were taken in RAW format. An area within the collections was selected with a minimal amount of natural and artificial light so not to interfere with the lighting equipment, which consisted of an Iwasaki EYE Colour Arc lamp connected to a Ventronic ballast, mounted onto a PhotxPro photographic lighting stand with an attached Elinchrom umbrella. The arc lamp was left to warm-up for 15 min to allow the bulb to reach at least 90% of its full light output. Prior to use, the UV blocking filter applied over the arc lamp was removed using a steel brush bit as to allow for a full spectrum of wavelengths. A cylindrical sheet of PTFE was placed around the bulb, or around the specimen(s) to be photographed if accessible, to evenly diffuse the light.
  </p>
  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If appropriate, a moth was removed from the specimen drawer and pinned onto a neutral grey foam background. A maximum of three specimens per shot were photographed to ensure they were all uniform in size and wings were not out of the frame. To remove any effect of lighting variability, a light (95%) and dark (5%) reflectance standard (Labsphere, Congleton, UK) was included along with a scale bar positioned on the side closest to the specimens. The camera was positioned directly above using either a copy stand or a tripod with a flexible head, before being focused to obtain optimal sharpness. The exposure time was selected dependent on whether photographing with the visible or UV filter and optimised for correct exposure and to prevent saturation

  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cryptic camouflage between the peppered moth and its natural resting backgrounds was explored by modelling avian vision to compare chromatic and achromatic contrasts. Woodlands in low-polluted areas were visited to obtain in situ photographs of plain tree bark and photos of bark possessing crustose lichen. Oak (

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
   </span>. 130 individual trees were selected according to the previous outlined suitability, photographing 65 plain bark and 65 lichen covered bark specimens under neutral light during daylight hours, using the same Nikon D7000 camera and lenses as per museum specimen collection. A light and dark reflectance standard and scale bar was positioned in each photograph to correct scaling and any lighting differences encountered during image analysis.
  </p>
  <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To prepare the images for analysis, each photo was converted into a multispectral image using the open-access software ImageJ

   </span> with the Image Calibration and Analysis Toolbox plugin
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
   </span>. A RAW image in both the UV and visible was selected for each specimen, and screened prior to this to check for overexposure. The light and dark reflectance standards were individually selected to normalise the channels and account for potential variation in light conditions
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>
   </span>. Manual alignment was then conducted on the visible RGB and UV channels of the multispectral image 32-bit stack for accurate colour measurements. For each sample of the two different background types, a single 
   <span class="italic">typica</span> or 
   <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> moth morph was compared once by random selection, to determine how colour and luminance (lightness) contrasted between the moth and its background.

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>,

   </span>. Although we could have used a different irradiance spectrum (such as a green forest shade), this would not have affected the results for several reasons. First, the woodland is in fact not continuous shade but patches of trees and clearings, and thus a mixture of open skies and forest shade lighting. In addition, real moths and the models here would actually be exposed to a range of light conditions associated with time of day, depth in the forest/vegetation cover, and weather. In addition, like most other visual modelling, we account for the process of colour constancy, via the so-called von Kries transformation
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>
   </span>, and as such, using a different irradiance spectrum has been shown to have little effect on predicted cone catch values

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>
   </span>. Finally, to fully demonstrate that our modelling is robust for lighting, we compared the predicted cone catch values for 16 moths (eight 
   <span class="italic">typica</span> and eight 
   <span class="italic">carbonaria</span>) under both D65 and forest shade irradiance spectra. As expected, results were unchanged, with mean plus standard deviation cone catch values as follows: double (forest = 0.22 ± 0.13, D65 = 0.21 ± 0.13), longwave (forest = 0.27 ± 0.15, D65 = 0.27 ± 0.15), mediumwave (forest = 0.20 ± 0.13, D65 = 0.20 ± 0.13), shortwave (forest = 0.14 ± 0.10, D65 = 0.14 ± 0.10), ultraviolet (forest = 0.08 ± 0.06, D65 = 0.07 ± 0.06). In all cases, there was a very strong and significant correlation between the cone catch values under the two light conditions (Spearman’s rank correlation tests between forest and D65 for all receptors: 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0001,

   </span>, while a Weber fraction of 0.2 was utilised for luminance. To quantify discrimination, JND values were calculated for both colour and achromatic contrast (luminance).

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>
   </span>. Generally, most previous work has tended to, for example, simply match the appearance of target wings to the average colour (in photon catches) of the substrate (e.g., tree bark
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>
   </span>). Past work matching artificial prey items to Lepidopteran models has also tended to ensure that matches of colour are based on targets falling within the range of photon catch values of the real animal model
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>

   </span>, which used a visual discrimination model to create matches to the real butterflies, with matches chosen when colours fell within 1–3 JNDs. Our approach is in fact even more detailed in that, unlike past studies, we did not create all targets per treatment as identical and simply matching an average model coloration, but instead we included individual variation by matching different individual targets to 100 unique individual moth models (see below). Therefore, our work is robust in accounting both for individual variation and in setting rigorous criteria, whereby models were only generated when colour and luminance matches to the real specimens were within 1.00 JND.

   <span class="sup">2</span> in surface area. The specimens were printed using an HP LaserJet Enterprise 500 Colour M551 on Whatman Filter Paper No.1 12.5 cm stuck onto A4 plain paper.

   <span class="italic">typica</span> bodies. The pastry was rolled into 12 × 5 × 2 mm bodies, attached to the artificial wings using a 20-mm panel pin inserted into the centre of the pastry body, and left overnight in the freezer to set.
  </p>
  <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The creation of the edible bodies for the targets was somewhat constrained by both available food colourings and of aiming to match both colour and luminance simultaneously. We calculated, using the above methods and visual modelling, the colour and luminance contrasts of fifteen pastry bodies, of each morph, against the moths themselves and natural resting backgrounds. For luminance, results for bodies to moths were: 
   <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> (mean JND plus standard error: 3.838 ± 0.733) and 
   <span class="italic">typica</span> (3.809 ± 0.731). For colour, matches were: 
   <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> (16.106 ± 1.477) and 
   <span class="italic">typica</span> (4.991 ± 0.641). The comparisons of bodies to respective natural backgrounds for luminance were: 
   <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> (3.773 ± 0.348) and 
   <span class="italic">typica</span> (1.660 ± 0.309). For colour, matches were: 
   <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> (13.721 ± 1.328) and

   <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> for colour. However, this difference is highly unlikely to explain our survival results for multiple reasons (see Discussion).

Ten locations within mixed deciduous woodlands in low-polluted areas over the south of England were selected based upon availability of crustose lichen. In Cornwall, these were Argal Reservoir, Penryn (50°9′11ʺ N, 5°8′11ʺ W), Lady’s Wood, Truro (50°17′24.2ʺ N, 5°3′42.2ʺ W), St Clement Wood, Truro (50°17′29.2ʺ N, 5°3′16.1ʺ W), Kennall Vale, Ponsanooth (50°11′42.3ʺ N, 5°8′59.1ʺ W), and Devichoys Wood, Truro (50°15′17.5ʺ N, 5°3′23.6ʺ W).

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
   </span> of 500 samples over ten blocks along a non-linear transect ranging between 1–1.5 km in length. In each block were 25 replicates of each treatment – 50 targets in total. These were pinned at a height of 1.7 m on a singular lichen-possessing tree at least 10 m apart from one another. If a tree did not have crustose lichen at this height, a further 1 m was walked along the transect until a suitable tree was found, and then the next subsequent tree would be 10 m apart. Moths were haphazardly selected from a bag, to avoid selection bias, and pinned onto trunks and under branches because these areas were shown to be the natural resting locations most frequented by the moth
