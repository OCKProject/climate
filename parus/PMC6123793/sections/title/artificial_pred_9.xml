 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Artificial moth targets modelled to avian visual systems were used as a proxy for peppered moths to determine morph survival rate through a field predation experiment. This approach is well tested and closely follows a range of past work

  </span>. Data collection was conducted in June 2017 to coincide with peppered moth emergence between May and August 2017. Ten locations within mixed deciduous woodlands in low-polluted areas over the south of England were selected based upon availability of crustose lichen. In Cornwall, these were Argal Reservoir, Penryn (50°9′11ʺ N, 5°8′11ʺ W), Lady’s Wood, Truro (50°17′24.2ʺ N, 5°3′42.2ʺ W), St Clement Wood, Truro (50°17′29.2ʺ N, 5°3′16.1ʺ W), Kennall Vale, Ponsanooth (50°11′42.3ʺ N, 5°8′59.1ʺ W), and Devichoys Wood, Truro (50°15′17.5ʺ N, 5°3′23.6ʺ W). In Hampshire, Holybourne Down, Alton (51°10′46.6ʺ N, 0°56′52.3ʺ W) and Chawton Park Wood, Alton (51°7′31.1ʺ N, 1°1′52.4ʺ W) were visited. The experiment followed a randomised block design
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span> of 500 samples over ten blocks along a non-linear transect ranging between 1–1.5 km in length. In each block were 25 replicates of each treatment – 50 targets in total. These were pinned at a height of 1.7 m on a singular lichen-possessing tree at least 10 m apart from one another. If a tree did not have crustose lichen at this height, a further 1 m was walked along the transect until a suitable tree was found, and then the next subsequent tree would be 10 m apart. Moths were haphazardly selected from a bag, to avoid selection bias, and pinned onto trunks and under branches because these areas were shown to be the natural resting locations most frequented by the moth
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. The targets were pinned at orientations within 20° of the horizontal plane as this is naturally exhibited behaviour in geometrid moths

  </span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). Additionally, targets were pinned into position at the centre of the lichen patch being sampled. While there may be a risk of unconscious bias with this and various previous similar experiments, we believe the procedures here make that unlikely. Each transect was checked at three time intervals: 6, 24, and 48 h. At each interval, all moths were visited to determine whether any predation, or another outcome, had occurred. Results were censored whereby 1 represented bird predation or censored 0 if the artificial moth had survived to 48 h, was missing, or another incident had occurred such as predation from a slug (identified by slime trails
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>). Bird predation was evident if the artificial target had rips from &gt;50% of the body

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span> and/or the wings were wholly or partially removed. As outlined in past studies
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>
  </span>, the process of recording predation events with such a large number of targets is impractical, and indeed experiments like ours here have been validated on multiple occasions. Other studies on artificial prey have also deduced avian predation from marks made on clay bodies
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>
  </span>. The woodland used in this experiment is comparable to that of other studies, which included information on species present and observed as taking prey items, including: blue tits (

  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>), European robins (
  <span class="italic">Erithacus rubecula</span>), chaffinches (
