 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Across nature, many taxa have evolved camouflage to avoid detection or recognition
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>. Animal defensive coloration has long provided flagship examples to illustrate and defend evolution and adaptation, including early work by Bates and Wallace on mimicry and camouflage
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. Arguably, the most important example of evolution in action is that of industrial melanism and the peppered moth (
  <span class="italic">Biston betularia</span>). During the Industrial Revolution (
  <span class="italic">ca</span>. 1760–1840), there was a rise of a new dark melanic (
  <span class="italic">carbonaria</span>) form in conjunction with a corresponding decline of the pale (
  <span class="italic">typica</span>) morph
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. The former is widely thought to have been well camouflaged against birds on trees where atmospheric pollution had killed off the lichen and soot particulates coated the bark, with 
  <span class="italic">typica</span> effectively hidden on lichen-covered trunks and branches in unpolluted woodland. This was supported by the classic work of Kettlewell
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>, who demonstrated strong selection against 
  <span class="italic">typica</span> in polluted woodland and against 
  <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> in unpolluted woodland where lichen persisted. Further work around this time
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span> supported Kettlewell and found that, despite persisting at frequencies as high as 80%, 
  <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> still incurred a selective disadvantage in unpolluted areas. The introduction of the Clean Air Acts (1950s) provided further support
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>, whereby pollution declined, lichen populations recovered, and there has since been a rise in the frequency of 
  <span class="italic">typica</span> and a decline in 
  <span class="italic">carbonaria</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>. Correspondingly, recent work has shown strong selection pressure against the melanic form, driven by differential avian predation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. Therefore, this example provides key evidence for natural selection, shows the importance of a greater understanding of the ways in which anthropogenic activity influences defensive adaptations, and can provide further insight into both predator-prey dynamics and other anthropogenic impacts (e.g. climate change)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the above, and considerable supporting work, this example of natural selection has been repeatedly attacked through unsupported claims of fraudulence on Kettlewell’s behalf
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. These claims have been firmly rebutted
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>, but more importantly, the publication of scientific criticisms
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span> ultimately led to some doubts in the scientific community and furthered the promotion of an anti-evolution agenda from the non-scientific community
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. Most of these criticisms and uncertainties have since been largely addressed (for example, natural resting sites), and the validity of the original studies confirmed through further experiments providing reliable evidence indicating bird predation is the most important selective factor driving camouflage in 
  <span class="italic">Biston betularia</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. However, there remains a crucial gap in this example—remarkably, no study has quantified the camouflage of peppered moths, or related this to survival against predators in controlled experiments. This is crucial because humans and birds have visual systems differing in terms of number of receptor types, receptor sensitivity, and the ability of birds to perceive ultraviolet (UV) light
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. With 
  <span class="italic">typica</span> appearing speckled under UV light (due to white wing scales strongly reflecting and black scales absorbing UV
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>) and crustose lichen species on which 
  <span class="italic">typica</span> rest
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span> reflecting similar UV patterns, such natural backgrounds may consequently better conceal 
  <span class="italic">typica</span> from its avian predators. In addition, for camouflage to work an object must closely resemble its background, and a fundamental criterion of camouflage theory is that the closer an object matches the background the less likely it is to be seen
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>. To date, evidence that peppered moths are truly camouflaged has been indirect or subjective, being based on human assessment of either the moths directly or images of them.
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using museum specimens, including some of Kettlewell’s original collections, we used digital image analysis
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span> and models of avian vision
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span> to quantify the camouflage match for colour and luminance (lightness) of 
  <span class="italic">typica</span> and 
  <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> forms against lichen and plain tree bark (see Methods). We expected that 
  <span class="italic">typica</span> would share greater similarities with crustose lichen backgrounds in comparison to plain bark backgrounds, whereas the reverse should be seen with 
  <span class="italic">carbonaria</span>. Comparisons of 65 
  <span class="italic">typica</span> and 65 
  <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> individuals, each against a different sample of lichen and bark, allowed us to calculate discrimination values (just noticeable differences; JNDs) for colour and luminance of each moth to each background. Increasingly higher JND values indicate greater mismatch, and values close to 1.00 suggest camouflage so effective that colours cannot be distinguished between moths and their resting background.
 </p>
 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Next, we performed predation experiments
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span> in unpolluted woodland with substantial lichen density (mostly in Cornwall, UK) to compare the likelihood of detection of 
  <span class="italic">typica</span> and 
  <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> morphs by avian predators. A widely used and powerful technique is to use artificial prey items designed to resemble real animals to predator vision
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span> (see “Methods” section); effective for monitoring survival over time
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span> when presented with an edible component and pinned to natural backgrounds in the field. We created artificial moths matching the appearance of 
  <span class="italic">typica</span> and 
  <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> forms using images of peppered moth museum specimens and measured predation over time for each morph, predicting that survival would be higher of models matching the 
  <span class="italic">typica</span> morph. Overall, we show that, as predicted, to avian vision 
  <span class="italic">typica</span> individuals of the peppered moth more closely match lichen covered bark, whereas 
  <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> individuals more closely match plain bark. Furthermore, these differences translate into a strong survival advantage of 
  <span class="italic">typica</span> individuals in unpolluted woodland.
