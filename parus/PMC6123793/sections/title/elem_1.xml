   <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> (3.07 ± 0.73 JND), which showed a close match. Overall, our results support the expectations that 
   <span class="italic">typica</span> is a much closer match to crustose lichen, whereas 
   <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> a closer match to plain bark (Fig.
