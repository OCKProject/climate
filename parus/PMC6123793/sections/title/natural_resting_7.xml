 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cryptic camouflage between the peppered moth and its natural resting backgrounds was explored by modelling avian vision to compare chromatic and achromatic contrasts. Woodlands in low-polluted areas were visited to obtain in situ photographs of plain tree bark and photos of bark possessing crustose lichen. Oak (
  <span class="italic">Quercus robar</span>) and ash (
  <span class="italic">Fraxinus excelsior</span>) trees were selected based upon their suitability as natural resting backgrounds as identified through previous peppered moth experiments
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>. Selection of crustose lichen species, 
  <span class="italic">Lecidella elaeochroma</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Graphis scripta</span>, as opposed to foliose lichen, was based upon previous work
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
  </span>, and because previous experiments show that crustose lichen is most commonly located on tree trunks and the lower sides of main branches
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>, which are the natural resting locations most frequented by the peppered moth
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. Evidence against using foliose lichen is supported by ancestral populations found upon upper branches, whereas crustose lichens flourish underneath branches in unpolluted locations
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. 130 individual trees were selected according to the previous outlined suitability, photographing 65 plain bark and 65 lichen covered bark specimens under neutral light during daylight hours, using the same Nikon D7000 camera and lenses as per museum specimen collection. A light and dark reflectance standard and scale bar was positioned in each photograph to correct scaling and any lighting differences encountered during image analysis.
 </p>
 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To prepare the images for analysis, each photo was converted into a multispectral image using the open-access software ImageJ
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>
  </span> with the Image Calibration and Analysis Toolbox plugin
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. A RAW image in both the UV and visible was selected for each specimen, and screened prior to this to check for overexposure. The light and dark reflectance standards were individually selected to normalise the channels and account for potential variation in light conditions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>
  </span>. Manual alignment was then conducted on the visible RGB and UV channels of the multispectral image 32-bit stack for accurate colour measurements. For each sample of the two different background types, a single 
  <span class="italic">typica</span> or 
  <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> moth morph was compared once by random selection, to determine how colour and luminance (lightness) contrasted between the moth and its background.

 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For modelling avian predator vision, the blue tit (
  <span class="italic">Cyanistes caeruleus</span>) was selected because previous studies have shown them to attack the peppered moth

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>, their foraging behaviour may be affected by UV cues
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
  </span>, and broadly their visual system is representative of many higher passerine birds
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>
  </span>. We first used a well-established method of converting calibrated images from camera to animal colour space (predicted cone response data) using a polynomial mapping technique
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
  </span> under D65 (daylight) lighting conditions. This method is highly accurate in generating cone response data compared to modelling using reflectance spectra
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>
  </span>. Although we could have used a different irradiance spectrum (such as a green forest shade), this would not have affected the results for several reasons. First, the woodland is in fact not continuous shade but patches of trees and clearings, and thus a mixture of open skies and forest shade lighting. In addition, real moths and the models here would actually be exposed to a range of light conditions associated with time of day, depth in the forest/vegetation cover, and weather. In addition, like most other visual modelling, we account for the process of colour constancy, via the so-called von Kries transformation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>
  </span>, and as such, using a different irradiance spectrum has been shown to have little effect on predicted cone catch values
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>
  </span>. Finally, to fully demonstrate that our modelling is robust for lighting, we compared the predicted cone catch values for 16 moths (eight 
  <span class="italic">typica</span> and eight 
  <span class="italic">carbonaria</span>) under both D65 and forest shade irradiance spectra. As expected, results were unchanged, with mean plus standard deviation cone catch values as follows: double (forest = 0.22 ± 0.13, D65 = 0.21 ± 0.13), longwave (forest = 0.27 ± 0.15, D65 = 0.27 ± 0.15), mediumwave (forest = 0.20 ± 0.13, D65 = 0.20 ± 0.13), shortwave (forest = 0.14 ± 0.10, D65 = 0.14 ± 0.10), ultraviolet (forest = 0.08 ± 0.06, D65 = 0.07 ± 0.06). In all cases, there was a very strong and significant correlation between the cone catch values under the two light conditions (Spearman’s rank correlation tests between forest and D65 for all receptors: 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0001, 
  <span class="italic">r</span> &gt; 0.988).

 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Visual discrimination (level of camouflage) was assessed according to the widely used Vorobyev and Osorio receptor noise discrimination model
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>. On the basis of a recent detailed evaluation of estimates of receptor noise
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>
  </span>, a Weber fraction of 0.1 was selected for colour discrimination with single cone (UV, shortwave, mediumwave, longwave) photoreceptor ratios of 1.00: 1.92: 2.68: 2.70, respectively
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>
  </span>, while a Weber fraction of 0.2 was utilised for luminance. To quantify discrimination, JND values were calculated for both colour and achromatic contrast (luminance). JND calculations for the latter are based on double cones, and represent how discriminable two spectra are from one another under the assumption that visual discrimination is limited by receptor noise
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>
  </span>. A JND value of 1.00 is taken as the discrimination threshold for birds, whereby JND &lt; 1.00 indicates two objects cannot be distinguished even under optimal viewing conditions, and as values increase &gt; 1.00 this denotes increasing contrast and greater differences in distinguishability
