  <p>Camouflage of peppered moth morphs to avian vision. Images show a melanic and a typical peppered moth morph to avian vision, along with samples of plain bark and lichen. 
   <span class="bold">a</span> This set of images represent colour data (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 130), comprised of cone response data for a longwave, mediumwave, shortwave, and UV cones (with UV and shortwave data combined into the blue image channel as images have only three layers). 
   <span class="bold">b</span> This set of images represent data from avian double cones, showing luminance (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 130). These images illustrate the better match for colour and luminance of 
   <span class="italic">typica</span> compared to carbonaria against lichen backgrounds. Graphs are just noticeable difference (JND) results for colour (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) and luminance (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) of 
   <span class="italic">typica</span> and 
   <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> specimens against plain bark and lichen. JND data was statistically analysed using a general linear model, with colour data log-transformed. For colour (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) between the morphs, plain bark did not display significance (
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.19) whereas lichen bark did (
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 6.66e
   <span class="sup">−14</span>). Both morphs displayed statistical significance for luminance (
   <span class="bold">b</span>); typica (
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 2e
   <span class="sup">−16</span>) and melanic (
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 2e
   <span class="sup">−16</span>). Boxplots display untransformed average JND values (bold line), the interquartile range (box component), range of minimum and maximum JND values (horizontal lines either end of range), and circle symbols signifying outlier results
