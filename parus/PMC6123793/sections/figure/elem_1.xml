  <p>Visualisation of the artificial predation experiment. Examples of the artificial moth targets made to match 
   <span class="italic">typica</span> and 
   <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> specimens show the components of the pastry body and the digitally colour calibrated paper wings. Statistical analysis was conducted to produce the non-parametric distribution plot of survival over time, using Kaplan–Meier estimation. Higher survival of targets matching 
   <span class="italic">typica</span> moths than 
   <span class="italic">carbonaria</span> moths were seen; graphically represented by the red dashed and solid blue lines, respectively (
