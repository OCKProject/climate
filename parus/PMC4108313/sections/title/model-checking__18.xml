 <div class="title">Model-checking to measure the discrepancy between the model parameter posterior combination and the real dataset for the three alternative demographic scenarios for the Upper Subansiri population of the Arunachal macaque.</div>
 <p>The summary statistics using datasets simulated with the prior distributions of the parameters, the observed data and the datasets from the posterior predictive distributions are represented on the plane of the first two principal components. The model (Scenario 2) fits the data well, as the cloud of datasets simulated from the prior (small green dots), datasets from the posterior predictive distribution (larger green dots) and the observed dataset (yellow circles) overlap completely.</p>
