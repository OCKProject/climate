 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We extracted genomic DNA from skin and blood samples using the QIAGEN DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit (Qiagen GMBH, Hamburg, Germany), following the manufacturer's protocols. We used extraction blanks as negative controls in downstream polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to sample a non-coding region of the Arunachal macaque mitochondrial genome, we amplified a 534bp-long D-loop (hyper-variable segment 1) region using the primer set from Li and Zhang 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Li1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Li1">[25]</a>. We conducted standard 35-cycle PCR to amplify the target regions

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We amplified 22 fluorescently labelled microsatellite loci (DXS571, DXS6810, DXS8043, DXS6799, D20S171, D4S243, D12S372, D8S1466, D9S934, D7S794, D10S611, D8S1106, D15S823, D19S255, D2S146, D17S791, D18S869, D18S537, D6S2419, D16S403, D5S1457, D10S179, D11S2002), already established for other macaque species

  <a rid="pone.0097061-Kanthaswamy1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Kanthaswamy1">[28]</a>. PCR amplification of 35 cycles was conducted for up to five loci simultaneously with combinations selected on the basis of fragment size, annealing temperature, and the fluorescent dye set DS - 33 components used (dy6FAM, VIC, PET or NED). The PCR products were resolved with an ABI 3130xl automated sequencer and analysed with GeneMapper software (version 4.0; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA). We could successfully sequence 24 of the individual samples collected â€“ 5 for Tawang, 10 for Upper Subansiri and 9 for West Siang. The accession numbers for the mitochondrial DNA sequences have been given in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0097061.s002" href="#pone.0097061.s002">Table S1</a>. We are also open to sharing the microsatellite data for further analyses, if requested.
