 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study was conducted in accordance with all relevant Indian laws, with due permits from the State Forest Department of Arunachal Pradesh. We collected only small pieces of dried skin samples from local communities without any kind of payment. As these were from old hunting trophies and no fresh hunting was reported from our study sites, we are confident that our sample collection did not encourage killing of the species in any way. Additionally, we have led a conservation programme for the species in this region over the last seven years.</p>
