 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Pleistocene epoch, with its frequent climatic fluctuations, is known to have driven range expansions and population decline/expansion of many species 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Davis1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Davis1">[1]</a>. The climatic fluctuations consisted of episodes with relatively high and low global ice volumes. The lowest of ice volumes characterised the interglacial periods with relatively warmer climate 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Kukla1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Kukla1">[2]</a>. The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), which occurred near the end of the Pleistocene, about 20,000 years ago 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Clark1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Clark1">[3]</a>, was a particularly dramatic period of glacial advance and global cooling resulting in demographic bottlenecks for many animal populations. This period was eventually followed by a period of warm and humid climate that lasted through the Early Holocene period, with the subsequent expansion of many previously bottlenecked populations 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Williams1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Williams1">[4]</a>. Importantly, the Holocene warming created opportunities for colonisation of new regions by modern humans as well, which further triggered profound alterations in world ecosystems and, in turn, the demography of several other species 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Barnosky1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Barnosky1">[5]</a>. One of the ways we can corroborate the past occurrence of these large-scale changes is by tracking changes in the population size of species over evolutionary time.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Investigations into past complex dynamic events have been facilitated, in the absence of more accurate ancient DNA, by recent advances in model-based hypothesis testing of current molecular data. Thus, it is now possible to employ an inferential framework to derive statistically robust inferences of the timing and magnitude of past changes in the effective population size (
  <span class="italic">N</span>e) of species over clearly defined time periods 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Fontaine1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Fontaine1">[6]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Koblmller1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Koblmller1">[7]</a>. While it is crucial to identify and separate ancient from more recent demographic events to obtain insights into the long-term population dynamics of species, this is often difficult to achieve in practice as similar genetic patterns can result from different demographic histories 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Chikhi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Chikhi1">[8]</a>. Nevertheless, the use of different types of genetic markers, such as mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites, combined with new kinds of statistical analytical methods, have achieved significant success in detecting genetic signatures of major demographic events, such as population bottlenecks, expansions and admixtures that may have occurred in different historical time periods 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Fontaine1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Fontaine1">[6]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although a vast majority of studies have performed these tests and estimated demographic parameters across taxa, very few studies have been conducted on tropical or subtropical ecosystems (but see 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Goossens1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Goossens1">[9]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Salmona1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Salmona1">[10]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Ting1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Ting1">[11]</a>). This gap in our knowledge is clearly problematic as the detrimental effects of climatic and other environmental changes on subtropical and tropical biodiversity across much of the world are only likely to increase in the near future 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Beaumont1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Beaumont1">[12]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to address this knowledge gap, we sought to investigate the past demographic history of a primate, the Arunachal macaque 
  <span class="italic">Macaca munzala</span>, an endangered species recently reported from and believed to be endemic to the state of Arunachal Pradesh in northeastern India. It is not at all clear how the complex climatic history of the Indian subcontinent might have shaped the population history of this primate, particularly given its distribution in the subtropical mountainous habitat within the Eastern Himalayan biodiversity hotspot.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pleistocene climate change and/or physical barriers have often been described as important forces driving the demographic history of many species from other parts of the subtropics 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Shapiro1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Shapiro1">[13]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Qu1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Qu1">[14]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Lu1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Lu1">[15]</a>. A few studies that have specifically examined the demographic history of primate species, however, suggest instead a primary role for anthropogenic factors driving relatively recent demographic changes in primate populations 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Goossens1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Goossens1">[9]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Bergl1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Bergl1">[16]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Chang1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Chang1">[17]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Storz1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Storz1">[18]</a>. The only reported exceptions to this trend are two macaque species from the northern hemisphere, the Barbary macaque 
  <span class="italic">M. sylvanus</span> and the Japanese macaque 
  <span class="italic">M. fuscata</span>. Their demographic history were shown to be shaped relatively more strongly by Pleistocene glaciation events than later anthropogenic influences 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Modolo1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Modolo1">[19]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Kawamoto1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Kawamoto1">[20]</a>. Consequently, these macaque populations revealed signatures of genetic bottlenecks after the LGM, around 20,000 years ago 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Modolo1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Modolo1">[19]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Kawamoto1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Kawamoto1">[20]</a>. We thus thought it important to explore the history of a macaque species in the Eastern Himalaya, which also marked the southernmost limit of the Pleistocene glaciers.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">What also characterises this biodiversity-rich region is the decimation of its indigenous wildlife by the local human communities, a well-documented historical phenomenon. The state of Arunachal Pradesh is inhabited by a number of animistic tribes who continue to depend heavily on wildlife for their subsistence as well as for sport 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Aiyadurai1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Aiyadurai1">[21]</a>. Our knowledge of the histories of these people is, however, fragmentary and incomplete. The peopling of this region seems to have occurred rather late in the history of the Indian subcontinent. According to variously recorded folklore and traditional knowledge, the ancestral Tani people migrated to central Arunachal Pradesh approximately 1,500 years ago from the north, through the Siang region. These people then settled in the Himalayan valleys and, due to the unique topography of the region as well as internecine warfare among them, were persistently isolated from one another. They were subsequently believed to have given rise to the many sub-tribes of today, such as the Adi and Apatani 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Krithika1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Krithika1">[22]</a>, which largely continue to follow their ancestral animistic culture. The Arunachal macaque is also known to be hunted across its distribution range, either in retaliation of its crop-raiding in the western districts of Tawang and West Kameng 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Kumar1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Kumar1">[23]</a> or for food, sport and trade in the central districts of Upper Subansiri and West Siang 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Kumar2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Kumar2">[24]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, therefore, we investigate the impact of two important factors, Pleistocene glaciation events and more recent anthropogenic activities, on the demographic history of the Arunachal macaque. More specifically, we ask whether the species was able to maintain its ancestral population size throughout its history on the southern subtropical fringes of the Tibetan Plateau. If, however, there were significant changes in the population size of this large mammalian species, were these wrought more by Pleistocene climate change, which is known to have affected the population history of several other species in the region, or were humans the principal driving force? Answers to these questions are critical not only to predict the future trajectories of populations of primates and other mammalian species to impending climatic changes in the Eastern Himalayan biodiversity hotspot but also to develop conservation strategies for the increasingly endangered species of the region.</p>
