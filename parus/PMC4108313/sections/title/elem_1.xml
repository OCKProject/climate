  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study was conducted in accordance with all relevant Indian laws, with due permits from the State Forest Department of Arunachal Pradesh. We collected only small pieces of dried skin samples from local communities without any kind of payment. As these were from old hunting trophies and no fresh hunting was reported from our study sites, we are confident that our sample collection did not encourage killing of the species in any way. Additionally, we have led a conservation programme for the species in this region over the last seven years.</p>

   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0097061.s001" href="#pone.0097061.s001">Fig. S1</a>). While Tawang forms the western edge of the state, both Upper Subansiri and West Siang are located in remote central Arunachal Pradesh. These samples were preserved in 95% ethanol at ambient temperature till they were transported to the laboratory. A single blood sample was also obtained from a captive individual in Typee, Tawang District. We considered the samples to belong to three tentative populations – Tawang (n = 5), Upper Subansiri (n = 12) and West Siang (n = 9) on the basis of their geographic origins (

    <a rid="pone.0097061-DiRienzo1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-DiRienzo1">[34]</a>. Any departures from the null hypothesis were explained as departures from the model, including selection, population expansion or decline. Consistency across independent loci, however, was unlikely to be caused by selection but rather by demographic events. This approach allowed us to detect population size changes and confirm that the signal was consistent across mutation models. The demographic event, however, could not be dated.

Some or all parameters that defined each model (such as population sizes, timing of the demographic events or mutation rates) were considered as random variables for which some prior distributions were defined, as shown in

For each simulation, the parameter values were drawn from their prior distributions, defining a demographic history that was used to build a specific input file for the DIY-ABC programme. Coalescent-based simulations were run to generate a genetic diversity for each sample, with the same number of gene copies and loci as those originally observed. Summary statistics (S) were then computed for the simulated datasets for each of the observed dataset (S*). Following the method of

    <a rid="pone.0097061-Cornuet2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Cornuet2">[36]</a>, we estimated the Type I error probability as the proportion of instances where the selected scenario did not exhibit the highest posterior probability, as compared to the competing scenarios for 500 simulated datasets generated under the best-supported model. We similarly estimated the Type II error probability by simulating 100 datasets for each of two alternative scenarios and calculating the mean proportion of instances in which the best-supported model was incorrectly selected as the most probable model.

    <a rid="pone.0097061-Cornuet3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Cornuet3">[41]</a>. Finally, following the method of Gelman 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>
    <a rid="pone.0097061-Gelman1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Gelman1">[42]</a>, we evaluated whether, under the best model-posterior combination, we were able to reproduce the observed data using the model-checking procedure available in DIY-ABC 
    <a rid="pone.0097061-Cornuet2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Cornuet2">[36]</a>. Model-checking computations were processed by simulating 1000 pseudo-observed datasets under each studied model-posterior combination, with sets of parameter values drawn with replacement among the 1000 sets of the posterior sample. This generated a posterior cumulative distribution function for each summary statistic, allowing us to estimate the 
    <span class="italic">P</span> values for the observed values of these summary statistics. In addition, a principal components analysis (PCA) was performed on the summary statistics. Principal components were computed from the 15,000 datasets simulated with parameter values drawn from the prior. The target (observed) dataset, as well as the 1,000 datasets simulated from the posterior distributions of parameters, was then added to each plane of the PCA.
