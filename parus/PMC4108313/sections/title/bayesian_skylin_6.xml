 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used Bayesian skyline plots of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to examine the past population dynamics of the study populations.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bayesian skyline plots allow for the estimation of effective population size,

Furthermore, we selected the HKY+Γ+I mutation model for the analysis with a mean HVS1 substitution rate of 0.1643 substitutions per nucleotide per million year (Myr) for the mean rate prior 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Chakraborty2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Chakraborty2">[29]</a>. We used BEAST, version 1.7 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Drummond1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Drummond1">[30]</a> for constructing the Bayesian skyline plots. Two independent runs were conducted for 10
  <span class="sup">7</span> steps, with a sampling of the parameters once every 10
  <span class="sup">3</span> steps. Ten percent of the samples were discarded as burn-in. The estimated sample size (ESS) for all parameters was found to be above 200 at the end of each run, indicating good convergence of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. The independent runs were combined using LogCombiner, version 1.5.4 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Drummond1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Drummond1">[30]</a>, with resampling every 10
  <span class="sup">5</span> steps. After combining all the MCMC runs, the ESS for all parameters was observed to be more than 200.
