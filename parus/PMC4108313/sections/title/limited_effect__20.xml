 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pleistocene climate change is known to have influenced the demographic history of many species across a wide variety of taxa. The landmass of Europe and a large part of northern America were under continental ice sheets repeatedly over the last three million years, forcing most species to either go extinct or shift their distribution range. Those, which shifted their range, also suffered a concomitant reduction in their population size. The effects of glaciation on species abundance and distribution, however, become more complex in eastern Eurasia where ice cover was never continuous

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The southern part of the Tibetan Plateau is an interesting example in this regard. The southern edge of the plateau was characterised by complex orogenesis, as compared to that experienced by the flatter central regions. This area also marks the southern limit of the glaciers that occur on the plateau. During the Quaternary period, the Tibetan Plateau had undergone four to five glaciations but was less affected by the ice sheets than were other regions in Asia at that time 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Zheng1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Zheng1">[47]</a>. The largest glacier on the plateau occurred in the middle of the Pleistocene (about 0.5 mya) and continued until 0.17 mya 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Zheng1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Zheng1">[47]</a>. During that time, the ice cover may have been permanent in the higher altitudes and central regions of the plateau 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Shi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Shi1">[48]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Shi2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Shi2">[49]</a> while the southern and eastern regions experienced relatively less glaciation 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Zhang1">[50]</a>. Both these sets of conditions created a fragmented ice cover where most of the high-elevation areas on the mountain ranges were ice-clad. Consequently, the prolonged glaciation periods during the late Pleistocene appear to have had a less severe effect on the species inhabiting these areas, as compared to those inhabiting Europe or North America.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is now being suggested that the ice sheets possibly retreated more rapidly on the Tibetan Plateau than they did in Europe, as seems to be evident from the demographic history of species like the great tit 
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span> from the plateau 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Zhao1">[46]</a>. It was observed that contrary to the post-LGM expansion of European animal populations, the demographic histories of species on the Tibetan Plateau indicate expansions only before the LGM; they remained relatively stable or grew slowly subsequently through the LGM 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Zhao1">[46]</a>. The edges of the plateau would have been less under the influence of the glaciations, if at all, at least on the lower elevations. We find support for such a hypothesis in the Bayesian skyline plots, which suggest that the size of the Arunachal macaque populations appeared to remain constant during the prolonged pre-LGM climatic fluctuations. A recent comparative study on five avian species from the Tibetan Plateau 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Qu1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Qu1">[14]</a> demonstrated that three species distributed on the central platform of the plateau experienced rapid population expansion after the retreat of the extensive glaciers during the pre-LGM (0.5â€“0.175 mya), results similar to that of Zhao 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Zhao1">[46]</a>. On the contrary, the population sizes of the other two species, the twite 
  <span class="italic">Carduelis flavirostris</span> and the black redstart 
  <span class="italic">Phoenicurus ochruros</span>, distributed on the edges of the plateau, remained at stable levels throughout the same pre-LGM period. It was concluded that the comparatively ice-free habitats on the edges of the plateau might have experienced milder climates during the glaciation period and this allowed the local species populations to persist in this stable niche 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Qu1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Qu1">[14]</a>. Our data also allow us to arrive at similar conclusions for a mammalian species, the Arunachal macaque, in the Eastern Himalayas on the southern fringes of the Tibetan Plateau.
