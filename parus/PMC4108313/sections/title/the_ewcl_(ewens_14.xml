 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This test, which attempted to detect the presence of a population bottleneck, indicated that, regardless of the mutation model assumed, the three Arunachal macaque populations, taken together, exhibited a significant signal of bottleneck for a majority of the microsatellite loci tested. It should, however, be remembered that this can be an artefact of the presence of structure in the tested populations. We, therefore, decided to treat the populations separately and found that only the Upper Subansiri site had an acceptable sample size for the test. For this population, the infinite-allele model (IAM) and two-phase model (TPM) showed statistical significance for heterozygosity excess, in both one-tailed and two-tailed tests (both 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt;&lt; 0.05), thus providing clear evidence for a genetic bottleneck in this population in the past. The application of a stepwise-mutation model (SMM), however, yielded non-significant results for both one-tailed (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.13) and two-tailed (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.064) tests.
