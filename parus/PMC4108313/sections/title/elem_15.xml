 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We then tested three alternative scenarios of demographic change – demographic expansion, decline or constant size – using a model-based approximate Bayesian inferential framework. We first evaluated the relative posterior probability of each competing scenario using a polytomous logistic regression on 1% of the simulated datasets closest to the observed dataset. The resulting PCA unambiguously pointed to the scenario of population decline (Scenario 2), which assumed an ancient, large population size that declined at some point in the past to reach the present, much smaller population size (

   <p>(A) Estimates of the posterior probability of each scenario and their comparison. Direct estimate: The number of times that a given scenario is found closest to the simulated datasets once the latter, produced under several scenarios, have been sorted by ascending distances to the observed dataset. Logistic regression: A polytomic weighted logistic regression was performed on the first closest datasets with the proportion contributed by each scenario as the dependent variable and the differences between the summary statistics of the observed and simulated datasets as the independent variables. The intercept of the regression, corresponding to an identity between simulated and observed summary statistics, was taken as the point estimate. In addition, 95% confidence intervals were computed 
    <a rid="pone.0097061-Cornuet3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Cornuet3">[41]</a>. In all these cases, Scenario 2 explained the observed data best. (B) Principal component analysis: Visual information on how data sets simulated under each scenario are close to the observed data set. Here too, Scenario 2 fits the observed data best

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We next evaluated the power of the model choice procedure using the method implemented in DIY-ABC, following the recommendations of Robert 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span>
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Robert1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Robert1">[43]</a>. For this purpose, we first simulated 500 random datasets under the selected scenario (Scenario 2) and computed the proportion of cases in which this scenario did not display the highest posterior probability among all scenarios. This empirical estimate of the Type I error was only 16.6%. We then empirically estimated the Type II error rate by simulating 100 random datasets under each alternative scenario (Scenarios 1 and 3) and computing the proportion of cases in which Scenario 2 was incorrectly selected as the most likely scenario in these simulated datasets. The average Type II error rate was only 8%, indicating a statistical strength of 92%. Hence, this simulation-based evaluation of the performance of the ABC model-choice procedure 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Robert1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Robert1">[43]</a> clearly showed that, given the size and polymorphism of our dataset, the method had statistical properties of both power and robustness to distinguish between the alternative demographic scenarios that we investigated.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We estimated the marginal posterior probability density for each parameter of the decline scenario (Scenario 2) using 1% of the closest simulated datasets from the observed dataset (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097061-t002" href="#pone-0097061-t002">Table 2</a>). Under this model, we estimated that a large population with an effective size of approximately 50,600 macaque individuals (95% Highest Probability Density or HPD 19,600 – 68,300) declined to a present effective population size of approximately 1,700 individuals (95% HPD 476 – 4,090), that is, approximately 30-fold. Assuming an average generation time of five years for macaques 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Harvey1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Harvey1">[44]</a>, we estimated that this decline occurred approximately 3,500 (95% HPD 520 – 13,800) years before present.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, to assess the goodness-of-fit of the model (Scenario 2) to the data, we simulated 1,000 datasets under each of the three scenarios tested, drawing the values of their parameters into the marginal posterior distributions of these parameters. We thus identified which model was the most capable of reproducing the observed summary statistics computed from the real data, following the model-checking procedure described by Cornuet 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span>
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Cornuet2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Cornuet2">[36]</a>. Of the three demographic scenarios tested, the datasets simulated under Scenario 2 were most compatible with the observed summary statistics. This can be observed by comparing the values of summary statistics computed from the simulated datasets for each tested scenario against the real values. With the exception of Scenario 2, all competing scenarios generated large numbers of summary statistics that displayed highly significant outlying values (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097061-g004" href="#pone-0097061-g004">Fig. 4</a>). This finding thus strongly supported the very high posterior probability values obtained for Scenario 2 of population decline, using the model-choice procedure.

   <p>The summary statistics using datasets simulated with the prior distributions of the parameters, the observed data and the datasets from the posterior predictive distributions are represented on the plane of the first two principal components. The model (Scenario 2) fits the data well, as the cloud of datasets simulated from the prior (small green dots), datasets from the posterior predictive distribution (larger green dots) and the observed dataset (yellow circles) overlap completely.</p>
