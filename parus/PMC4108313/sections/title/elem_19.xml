 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Classical bottleneck tests are often used by both evolutionary and conservation biologists to evaluate whether species have experienced historical demographic declines. In contrast, more recently developed Bayesian approaches offer the potential to draw more detailed inferences with respect to both bottleneck timing and severity

  <a rid="pone.0097061-Cornuet2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Cornuet2">[36]</a> but have not yet been thoroughly evaluated. Consequently, we analysed a multi-marker dataset using both sets of approaches to elucidate the possible impacts of historical climate change and more recent anthropogenic effects on an “edge” primate species – a species that inhabits the undulating edges of a plateau instead of its flat centre 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Qu1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Qu1">[14]</a> – the Arunachal macaque, in the northeastern Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh. This region, situated in the southern part of the Tibetan Plateau, also forms part of the Eastern Himalaya biodiversity hotspot.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pleistocene climate change is known to have influenced the demographic history of many species across a wide variety of taxa. The landmass of Europe and a large part of northern America were under continental ice sheets repeatedly over the last three million years, forcing most species to either go extinct or shift their distribution range. Those, which shifted their range, also suffered a concomitant reduction in their population size. The effects of glaciation on species abundance and distribution, however, become more complex in eastern Eurasia where ice cover was never continuous 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Zhan1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Zhan1">[45]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Zhao1">[46]</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The southern part of the Tibetan Plateau is an interesting example in this regard. The southern edge of the plateau was characterised by complex orogenesis, as compared to that experienced by the flatter central regions. This area also marks the southern limit of the glaciers that occur on the plateau. During the Quaternary period, the Tibetan Plateau had undergone four to five glaciations but was less affected by the ice sheets than were other regions in Asia at that time 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Zheng1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Zheng1">[47]</a>. The largest glacier on the plateau occurred in the middle of the Pleistocene (about 0.5 mya) and continued until 0.17 mya 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Zheng1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Zheng1">[47]</a>. During that time, the ice cover may have been permanent in the higher altitudes and central regions of the plateau 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Shi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Shi1">[48]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Shi2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Shi2">[49]</a> while the southern and eastern regions experienced relatively less glaciation 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Zhang1">[50]</a>. Both these sets of conditions created a fragmented ice cover where most of the high-elevation areas on the mountain ranges were ice-clad. Consequently, the prolonged glaciation periods during the late Pleistocene appear to have had a less severe effect on the species inhabiting these areas, as compared to those inhabiting Europe or North America.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is now being suggested that the ice sheets possibly retreated more rapidly on the Tibetan Plateau than they did in Europe, as seems to be evident from the demographic history of species like the great tit 
   <span class="italic">Parus major</span> from the plateau 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Zhao1">[46]</a>. It was observed that contrary to the post-LGM expansion of European animal populations, the demographic histories of species on the Tibetan Plateau indicate expansions only before the LGM; they remained relatively stable or grew slowly subsequently through the LGM 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Zhao1">[46]</a>. The edges of the plateau would have been less under the influence of the glaciations, if at all, at least on the lower elevations. We find support for such a hypothesis in the Bayesian skyline plots, which suggest that the size of the Arunachal macaque populations appeared to remain constant during the prolonged pre-LGM climatic fluctuations. A recent comparative study on five avian species from the Tibetan Plateau 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Qu1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Qu1">[14]</a> demonstrated that three species distributed on the central platform of the plateau experienced rapid population expansion after the retreat of the extensive glaciers during the pre-LGM (0.5–0.175 mya), results similar to that of Zhao 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Zhao1">[46]</a>. On the contrary, the population sizes of the other two species, the twite 
   <span class="italic">Carduelis flavirostris</span> and the black redstart 
   <span class="italic">Phoenicurus ochruros</span>, distributed on the edges of the plateau, remained at stable levels throughout the same pre-LGM period. It was concluded that the comparatively ice-free habitats on the edges of the plateau might have experienced milder climates during the glaciation period and this allowed the local species populations to persist in this stable niche 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Qu1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Qu1">[14]</a>. Our data also allow us to arrive at similar conclusions for a mammalian species, the Arunachal macaque, in the Eastern Himalayas on the southern fringes of the Tibetan Plateau.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Effect of elevation and animal physiology</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Altitude appears to have played an extremely important role in the demographic history of animal species during the past glacial periods with species at various elevations being affected differently. A very good example of this is in the Alps 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Hewitt1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Hewitt1">[51]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Hewitt2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Hewitt2">[52]</a>. Many present-day species in the high elevations colonised their present range by expanding their range from the lower altitudes and latitudes during specific interglacial periods. In contrast, species with Arctic–Alpine distributions, which were not annihilated during peaks of glaciation, descended during these periods and may have spread more widely across the cold tundra and steppe plains of continental Europe 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Hewitt1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Hewitt1">[51]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Hewitt2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Hewitt2">[52]</a>. The impact of Pleistocene glacial cycles is thus expected to have varied among species across geographical regions, in part, perhaps due to their biology of differential cold tolerance 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Lu1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Lu1">[15]</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first indication of such a historical change in the size of the study Arunachal macaque populations was detected through the mismatch distributions of the sampled individuals (data not shown) which, however, could be unreliable due to small sample size of the present study. Mismatch distribution analysis also has its limitations, as exemplified by many studies where contemporary samples of a bottlenecked population failed to recover a unimodal mismatch distribution 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Hoffman1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Hoffman1">[53]</a>. Instead, coalescent theory, which incorporates information from genealogy may better able to evaluate the demographic histories of populations 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Felsenstein1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Felsenstein1">[54]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Pybus1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Pybus1">[55]</a>. Bayesian skyline plots in our study also suggest expansion of the study macaque populations. These plots also propound changes in population size only after the LGM, as has been established for several avian edge species on the Tibetan Plateau 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Qu1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Qu1">[14]</a>. Moreover, the effective female population size of the Arunachal macaque seems to have increased approximately 15,000 years ago.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the climate on the Tibetan Plateau has been documented to have been colder during the pre-LGM extensive glacial period than during the LGM 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Shi3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Shi3">[56]</a>, mountain heights below the snowline were not apparently glaciated. The current snowlines on the eastern edge of the plateau extend from 4200 to 5200 m 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Shi4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Shi4">[57]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Liu1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Liu1">[58]</a>. In Arunachal Pradesh, more specifically, the vegetation ends approximately at a 5,000-m elevation from where the present snowline starts 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Mishra1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Mishra1">[59]</a>. During the LGM, however, the snowline descended to approximately 3,300 m on many mountain ranges on the Tibetan Plateau 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Shi3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Shi3">[56]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Shi4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Shi4">[57]</a>, thus contributing to cooler climates locally 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Zheng1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Zheng1">[47]</a>. Arunachal macaques are known to presently occur at altitudes between 1800 – 3500 m 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Sinha1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Sinha1">[60]</a> although they could also inhabit higher, unexplored, elevations in the region. It now seems possible that at least a part of the current habitat of the macaque was covered by ice during the LGM. We, therefore, speculate that this primate might have colonised even higher elevations after the LGM, resulting in the observed signature of population expansion.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The pattern that our results suggest have been conclusively established for another lower-elevation avian edge species from the Tibetan plateau, the black redstart 
   <span class="italic">Phoenicurus ochruros</span>
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Qu1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Qu1">[14]</a>. The relationship between glaciation, altitude and species demographic history is, however, far from straightforward. Interestingly, Lu 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Lu1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Lu1">[15]</a> found that the population size of the three low-elevation (1800 – 3200 m) stream salamander species from the Tibetan Plateau were significantly but slowly decreased from the beginning of the extensive glacial period long before the LGM, in striking contrast to what has been established for the Arunachal macaque and the black redstart. According to Lu 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Lu1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Lu1">[15]</a>, the suitable habitats for the salamanders may have not been covered by ice during both the LGM and the extensive pre-LGM glacial period but the species may have suffered from climatic cooling because they are less cold-tolerant than their high-elevation counterparts. These ideas are consistent with the hypothesis that variation in ecological adaptations may affect geographical patterns of genetic variation in species populations 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Gavrilets1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Gavrilets1">[61]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Hewitt3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Hewitt3">[62]</a>. The poikilothermic salamanders may be expected to have a much lower range of tolerance to changes in ambient temperatures than would homoeothermic animals such as birds and mammals. Thus, animal physiology is another important factor that may have differently affected the evolutionary history of species that otherwise occurred at similar elevations and latitudes in a particular geographical region.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Holocene population decline</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The increase in effective female population size of the Arunachal macaque, as revealed by the Bayesian skyline plots, continues till approximately 5,000 years ago, after which it appears to have suffered a mild decline. Mitochondrial and nuclear autosomal microsatellite loci are known to be informative at different time scales, highlighting different episodes in the demographic history of a species 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Fontaine1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Fontaine1">[6]</a>. The mtDNA diversity tends to reflect comparatively older demographic events in a species' history. Conversely, microsatellite data are more informative about the contemporary demography of a species. Such a difference in demographic signals, captured by each type of genetic marker, may arise from the differences in their respective mutation rates 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Cornuet2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Cornuet2">[36]</a>. The relatively fast mutation rate of microsatellite loci enables them to capture recent and almost contemporaneous events but also increases homoplasy at these loci, which thereby reduces the signal of older demographic events 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Estoup1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Estoup1">[39]</a>. These, more ancient, events can, however, still be detected using the slower evolving mtDNA sequences. That is why we employed our microsatellite data to validate the occurrence of a very recent population decline in the Arunachal macaque.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The classical heterozygosity excess test (the EWCL method) suggested a past population bottleneck in at least the Upper Subansiri population, as reflected in its microsatellite data although the statistical significance of this result was highly dependent on the underlying mutational model. A bottleneck was inferred for this population for two particular models – the infinite-allele (IAM) and two-phase (TPM) models – but not for a third one, the stepwise-mutation (SMM) model, despite the IAM being unrealistic for most microsatellites 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-DiRienzo1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-DiRienzo1">[34]</a>. Several other microsatellite-based studies of species, thought to have experienced severe, but temporary, reductions in population size, had either failed altogether to detect a bottleneck or, as with our study, yielded results that depended on the mutational model 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Spong1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Spong1">[63]</a>. In at least some of these cases, a few specific markers may have disproportionately influenced the more conservative SMM model. However, in our study, we used 22 microsatellite loci, over twice the minimum number recommended 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Luikart1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Luikart1">[64]</a>. To circumvent this problem, we applied the ABC method that clearly supported the population decline model (Scenario 2) over the constant size and population expansion models.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We could also estimate the extent and time of the decline from the posterior probabilities. Our simulations suggest the population decline started approximately 3,500 years ago, which was climatically a warm period and this is surprising as such climatic conditions are normally conducive for population growth. Several authors have postulated that such idiosyncratic mid-Holocene population declines may have been accelerated and enhanced by major expansions in ancient human civilizations 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Stavrianos1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Stavrianos1">[65]</a> (ca. 1,500 BC), the rapid development of agriculture, and the resulting changes in landscapes in recent times. For example, it has been speculated that the expansion and migration of human populations into the erstwhile virgin mountains of the Sichuan region may have caused the decline of the giant panda population during the later part of the mid-Holocene 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Zhang2">[66]</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Arunachal Pradesh too, anthropogenic factors may have significantly influenced the demographic history of the Arunachal macaque over the last few decades or centuries. One of the largest indigenous groups of people that inhabit the districts of Upper Subansiri and West Siang, two areas from which our study samples were derived, and which hunt wildlife extensively for food and sport, is represented by the collective animist Adi people 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Lego1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Lego1">[67]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Tabi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Tabi1">[68]</a>. Recent ethnographic and population genetic studies reveal that the Adi, alternatively referred to as the Luoba Tibetan in Tibet, trace their ancestral migration and settlement history from southern Tibet into Arunachal Pradesh to different time periods during the 5
   <span class="sup">th</span> to 7
   <span class="sup">th</span> century AD, or to the last 1,300 to 1,500 years before present 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Lego1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Lego1">[67]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Tabi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Tabi1">[68]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Krithika2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Krithika2">[69]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Kang1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Kang1">[70]</a>. Although these estimates do not reject the possibility of a peopling of this region in even earlier times, it is entirely possible that the Arunachal macaque population declines may have actually begun at the time that central Arunachal Pradesh was being peopled by the Adi and other animistic tribes that continue to hunt rampantly even today. It must be reiterated, however, that there is currently no evidence to conclusively establish the definitive contribution of either climatic or anthropogenic factors to this decline in Arunachal macaque populations.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It should be noted that our investigation, which focuses on a rare, endangered, montane primate, has a smaller sample size than is typical for most population genetics studies. Although there appears to be little benefit in sampling more than 20 to 30 individuals per population for microsatellite-based studies that assess genetic diversity of populations 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Pruett1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Pruett1">[71]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Hale1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Hale1">[72]</a>, sample sizes that are even smaller, as is the case in the present study, may not precisely represent the populations and may yield large errors for descriptive statistical estimates such as allele frequencies and expected heterozygosity. It has, however, been suggested that where small sample sizes are unavoidable, as, for instance, in the case of rare and endangered species, the precision of the estimates can be significantly enhanced by increasing the number of genotyped microsatellite loci, which is precisely what we have done in our study 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Hale1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Hale1">[72]</a>. Moreover, we have used approximate Bayesian computations to test whether the population size changes that we observe using other analytical methods are noteworthy or not. The approximate Bayesian computation framework manages any sample size, which may often be as low as 8 – 12 samples per population 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Fagundes1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Fagundes1">[73]</a>, by simulating the exactly observed sample sizes 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Beaumont4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Beaumont4">[74]</a>. Small sample sizes would simply lead to wider credible intervals than would larger sample sizes 
   <a rid="pone.0097061-Beaumont4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Beaumont4">[74]</a>. We are aware of this limitation of our results but believe that the communication of our present study is of critical importance, in spite of its low sample size, for the conservation effort to save the species, particularly as the collection of more samples from the rare and heavily hunted macaque populations in Arunachal Pradesh is not currently feasible.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, the Tibetan Plateau is an important region to study the population history of its native species for more than one reason. First of all, it is a highly variable region with its different regions – the flat central platform and the more variable mountainous edges based on altitude – differing significantly from one another in topography and climatic history. The edge regions of the plateau have had a tumultuous orogenic history and the species of these areas are, thus, also expected to show a more eventful evolutionary history. Our study of an edge primate species has, along with other studies from the region, hinted at a very complex image of how geographical features such as latitude and altitude, animal physiology, and climate change in the past may have together influenced its demographic history. Unlike in the tropics, where Pleistocene glacial fluctuations were less likely to have been extreme, this region seems to represent a balance between the tropics and the more severe, temperate arctic environments. This study also underscores the possibility that a cold-tolerant species like the Arunachal macaque, which could withstand historical climate change and grow once the climate became conducive, may actually be extremely vulnerable to anthropogenic exploitation, as is perhaps indicated by its more recent population decline. It is imperative that we understand the population dynamics of such a species at a much finer scale, which could be possible with sampling more populations, particularly those that may connect the study populations. What is of greater concern, however, is the clear genetic signature of a serious decline in the populations of the species, possibly mediated by the extensive hunting that it continues to face across its distribution range. While these threats to the affected populations are currently being documented by on-ground field studies, it is entirely possible that unless immediate action is taken, genetic drift caused by hunting, epidemics or other natural calamities can rapidly eliminate the remaining genetic diversity of this less-known endemic primate from an extremely important biodiversity hotspot in the remote Himalayan mountains of northeastern India.</p>
