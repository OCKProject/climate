 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Altitude appears to have played an extremely important role in the demographic history of animal species during the past glacial periods with species at various elevations being affected differently. A very good example of this is in the Alps 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Hewitt1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Hewitt1">[51]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Hewitt2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Hewitt2">[52]</a>. Many present-day species in the high elevations colonised their present range by expanding their range from the lower altitudes and latitudes during specific interglacial periods. In contrast, species with Arctic–Alpine distributions, which were not annihilated during peaks of glaciation, descended during these periods and may have spread more widely across the cold tundra and steppe plains of continental Europe 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Hewitt1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Hewitt1">[51]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Hewitt2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Hewitt2">[52]</a>. The impact of Pleistocene glacial cycles is thus expected to have varied among species across geographical regions, in part, perhaps due to their biology of differential cold tolerance 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Lu1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Lu1">[15]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first indication of such a historical change in the size of the study Arunachal macaque populations was detected through the mismatch distributions of the sampled individuals (data not shown) which, however, could be unreliable due to small sample size of the present study. Mismatch distribution analysis also has its limitations, as exemplified by many studies where contemporary samples of a bottlenecked population failed to recover a unimodal mismatch distribution 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Hoffman1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Hoffman1">[53]</a>. Instead, coalescent theory, which incorporates information from genealogy may better able to evaluate the demographic histories of populations 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Felsenstein1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Felsenstein1">[54]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Pybus1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Pybus1">[55]</a>. Bayesian skyline plots in our study also suggest expansion of the study macaque populations. These plots also propound changes in population size only after the LGM, as has been established for several avian edge species on the Tibetan Plateau 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Qu1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Qu1">[14]</a>. Moreover, the effective female population size of the Arunachal macaque seems to have increased approximately 15,000 years ago.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the climate on the Tibetan Plateau has been documented to have been colder during the pre-LGM extensive glacial period than during the LGM 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Shi3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Shi3">[56]</a>, mountain heights below the snowline were not apparently glaciated. The current snowlines on the eastern edge of the plateau extend from 4200 to 5200 m 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Shi4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Shi4">[57]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Liu1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Liu1">[58]</a>. In Arunachal Pradesh, more specifically, the vegetation ends approximately at a 5,000-m elevation from where the present snowline starts 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Mishra1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Mishra1">[59]</a>. During the LGM, however, the snowline descended to approximately 3,300 m on many mountain ranges on the Tibetan Plateau 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Shi3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Shi3">[56]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Shi4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Shi4">[57]</a>, thus contributing to cooler climates locally 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Zheng1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Zheng1">[47]</a>. Arunachal macaques are known to presently occur at altitudes between 1800 – 3500 m 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Sinha1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Sinha1">[60]</a> although they could also inhabit higher, unexplored, elevations in the region. It now seems possible that at least a part of the current habitat of the macaque was covered by ice during the LGM. We, therefore, speculate that this primate might have colonised even higher elevations after the LGM, resulting in the observed signature of population expansion.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The pattern that our results suggest have been conclusively established for another lower-elevation avian edge species from the Tibetan plateau, the black redstart 
  <span class="italic">Phoenicurus ochruros</span>
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Qu1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Qu1">[14]</a>. The relationship between glaciation, altitude and species demographic history is, however, far from straightforward. Interestingly, Lu 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Lu1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Lu1">[15]</a> found that the population size of the three low-elevation (1800 – 3200 m) stream salamander species from the Tibetan Plateau were significantly but slowly decreased from the beginning of the extensive glacial period long before the LGM, in striking contrast to what has been established for the Arunachal macaque and the black redstart. According to Lu 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span>
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Lu1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Lu1">[15]</a>, the suitable habitats for the salamanders may have not been covered by ice during both the LGM and the extensive pre-LGM glacial period but the species may have suffered from climatic cooling because they are less cold-tolerant than their high-elevation counterparts. These ideas are consistent with the hypothesis that variation in ecological adaptations may affect geographical patterns of genetic variation in species populations 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Gavrilets1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Gavrilets1">[61]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0097061-Hewitt3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0097061-Hewitt3">[62]</a>. The poikilothermic salamanders may be expected to have a much lower range of tolerance to changes in ambient temperatures than would homoeothermic animals such as birds and mammals. Thus, animal physiology is another important factor that may have differently affected the evolutionary history of species that otherwise occurred at similar elevations and latitudes in a particular geographical region.
