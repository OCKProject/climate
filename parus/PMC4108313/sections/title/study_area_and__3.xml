 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We obtained dried skin samples of Arunachal macaque individuals, killed and preserved as hunting trophies, from 14 villages across the districts of Tawang, Upper Subansiri and West Siang in the state of Arunachal Pradesh (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0097061.s001" href="#pone.0097061.s001">Fig. S1</a>). While Tawang forms the western edge of the state, both Upper Subansiri and West Siang are located in remote central Arunachal Pradesh. These samples were preserved in 95% ethanol at ambient temperature till they were transported to the laboratory. A single blood sample was also obtained from a captive individual in Typee, Tawang District. We considered the samples to belong to three tentative populations – Tawang (n = 5), Upper Subansiri (n = 12) and West Siang (n = 9) on the basis of their geographic origins (
