Species from subtropical and tropical regions are, however, considerably less studied, despite representing most of the biodiversity hotspots in the world including many highly threatened by anthropogenic activities such as hunting. These regions, consequently, pose a significant knowledge gap in terms of how their fauna have typically responded to past climatic changes. We studied an endangered primate, the Arunachal macaque <italic>Macaca munzala</italic>, from the subtropical southern edge of the Tibetan plateau, a part of the Eastern Himalaya biodiversity hotspot, also known to be highly threatened due to rampant hunting. We employed a 534 bp-long mitochondrial DNA sequence and 22 autosomal microsatellite loci to investigate the factors that have potentially shaped the demographic history of the species. Analysing the genetic data with traditional statistical methods and advance Bayesian inferential approaches, we demonstrate a limited effect of past glacial fluctuations on the demographic history of the species before the last glacial maximum, approximately 20,000 years ago. This was, however, immediately followed by a significant population expansion possibly due to warmer climatic conditions, approximately 15,000 years ago. These changes may thus represent an apparent balance between that displayed by the relatively climatically stable tropics and those of the more severe, temperate environments of the past. This study also draws attention to the possibility that a cold-tolerant species like the Arunachal macaque, which could withstand historical climate fluctuations and grow once the climate became conducive, may actually be extremely vulnerable to anthropogenic exploitation, as is perhaps indicated by its Holocene ca. 30-fold population decline, approximately 3,500 years ago. Our study thus provides a quantitative appraisal of these demographically important events, emphasising the ability to potentially infer the occurrence of two separate historical events from contemporary genetic data.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The study was funded by a Department of Science and Technology, Government of India grant to AS, a Department of Biotechnology, Government of India grant to both UR and AS and an International Primatological Society research grant to DC.

The climatic fluctuations consisted of episodes with relatively high and low global ice volumes. The lowest of ice volumes characterised the interglacial periods with relatively warmer climate <xref rid="pone.0097061-Kukla1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), which occurred near the end of the Pleistocene, about 20,000 years ago <xref rid="pone.0097061-Clark1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, was a particularly dramatic period of glacial advance and global cooling resulting in demographic bottlenecks for many animal populations. This period was eventually followed by a period of warm and humid climate that lasted through the Early Holocene period, with the subsequent expansion of many previously bottlenecked populations <xref rid="pone.0097061-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Importantly, the Holocene warming created opportunities for colonisation of new regions by modern humans as well, which further triggered profound alterations in world ecosystems and, in turn, the demography of several other species <xref rid="pone.0097061-Barnosky1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. One of the ways we can corroborate the past occurrence of these large-scale changes is by tracking changes in the population size of species over evolutionary time.</p><p>Investigations into past complex dynamic events have been facilitated, in the absence of more accurate ancient DNA, by recent advances in model-based hypothesis testing of current molecular data. Thus, it is now possible to employ an inferential framework to derive statistically robust inferences of the timing and magnitude of past changes in the effective population size (<italic>N</italic>e) of species over clearly defined time periods <xref rid="pone.0097061-Fontaine1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097061-Koblmller1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. While it is crucial to identify and separate ancient from more recent demographic events to obtain insights into the long-term population dynamics of species, this is often difficult to achieve in practice as similar genetic patterns can result from different demographic histories <xref rid="pone.0097061-Chikhi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Nevertheless, the use of different types of genetic markers, such as mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites, combined with new kinds of statistical analytical methods, have achieved significant success in detecting genetic signatures of major demographic events, such as population bottlenecks, expansions and admixtures that may have occurred in different historical time periods <xref rid="pone.0097061-Fontaine1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Although a vast majority of studies have performed these tests and estimated demographic parameters across taxa, very few studies have been conducted on tropical or subtropical ecosystems (but see <xref rid="pone.0097061-Goossens1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097061-Salmona1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097061-Ting1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>). This gap in our knowledge is clearly problematic as the detrimental effects of climatic and other environmental changes on subtropical and tropical biodiversity across much of the world are only likely to increase in the near future <xref rid="pone.0097061-Beaumont1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>In order to address this knowledge gap, we sought to investigate the past demographic history of a primate, the Arunachal macaque <italic>Macaca munzala</italic>, an endangered species recently reported from and believed to be endemic to the state of Arunachal Pradesh in northeastern India. It is not at all clear how the complex climatic history of the Indian subcontinent might have shaped the population history of this primate, particularly given its distribution in the subtropical mountainous habitat within the Eastern Himalayan biodiversity hotspot.</p><p>Pleistocene climate change and/or physical barriers have often been described as important forces driving the demographic history of many species from other parts of the subtropics <xref rid="pone.0097061-Shapiro1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097061-Qu1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097061-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. A few studies that have specifically examined the demographic history of primate species, however, suggest instead a primary role for anthropogenic factors driving relatively recent demographic changes in primate populations <xref rid="pone.0097061-Goossens1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097061-Bergl1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097061-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097061-Storz1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The only reported exceptions to this trend are two macaque species from the northern hemisphere, the Barbary macaque <italic>M. sylvanus</italic> and the Japanese macaque <italic>M. fuscata</italic>. Their demographic history were shown to be shaped relatively more strongly by Pleistocene glaciation events than later anthropogenic influences <xref rid="pone.0097061-Modolo1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097061-Kawamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Consequently, these macaque populations revealed signatures of genetic bottlenecks after the LGM, around 20,000 years ago <xref rid="pone.0097061-Modolo1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097061-Kawamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. We thus thought it important to explore the history of a macaque species in the Eastern Himalaya, which also marked the southernmost limit of the Pleistocene glaciers.</p><p>What also characterises this biodiversity-rich region is the decimation of its indigenous wildlife by the local human communities, a well-documented historical phenomenon. The state of Arunachal Pradesh is inhabited by a number of animistic tribes who continue to depend heavily on wildlife for their subsistence as well as for sport <xref rid="pone.0097061-Aiyadurai1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Our knowledge of the histories of these people is, however, fragmentary and incomplete. The peopling of this region seems to have occurred rather late in the history of the Indian subcontinent. According to variously recorded folklore and traditional knowledge, the ancestral Tani people migrated to central Arunachal Pradesh approximately 1,500 years ago from the north, through the Siang region. These people then settled in the Himalayan valleys and, due to the unique topography of the region as well as internecine warfare among them, were persistently isolated from one another. They were subsequently believed to have given rise to the many sub-tribes of today, such as the Adi and Apatani <xref rid="pone.0097061-Krithika1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, which largely continue to follow their ancestral animistic culture. The Arunachal macaque is also known to be hunted across its distribution range, either in retaliation of its crop-raiding in the western districts of Tawang and West Kameng <xref rid="pone.0097061-Kumar1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> or for food, sport and trade in the central districts of Upper Subansiri and West Siang <xref rid="pone.0097061-Kumar2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>In this study, therefore, we investigate the impact of two important factors, Pleistocene glaciation events and more recent anthropogenic activities, on the demographic history of the Arunachal macaque. More specifically, we ask whether the species was able to maintain its ancestral population size throughout its history on the southern subtropical fringes of the Tibetan Plateau. If, however, there were significant changes in the population size of this large mammalian species, were these wrought more by Pleistocene climate change, which is known to have affected the population history of several other species in the region, or were humans the principal driving force? Answers to these questions are critical not only to predict the future trajectories of populations of primates and other mammalian species to impending climatic changes in the Eastern Himalayan biodiversity hotspot but also to develop conservation strategies for the increasingly endangered species of the region.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study was conducted in accordance with all relevant Indian laws, with due permits from the State Forest Department of Arunachal Pradesh.

Any departures from the null hypothesis were explained as departures from the model, including selection, population expansion or decline. Consistency across independent loci, however, was unlikely to be caused by selection but rather by demographic events.

The landmass of Europe and a large part of northern America were under continental ice sheets repeatedly over the last three million years, forcing most species to either go extinct or shift their distribution range. Those, which shifted their range, also suffered a concomitant reduction in their population size. The effects of glaciation on species abundance and distribution, however, become more complex in eastern Eurasia where ice cover was never continuous <xref rid="pone.0097061-Zhan1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097061-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.</p><p>The southern part of the Tibetan Plateau is an interesting example in this regard. The southern edge of the plateau was characterised by complex orogenesis, as compared to that experienced by the flatter central regions. This area also marks the southern limit of the glaciers that occur on the plateau. During the Quaternary period, the Tibetan Plateau had undergone four to five glaciations but was less affected by the ice sheets than were other regions in Asia at that time <xref rid="pone.0097061-Zheng1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. The largest glacier on the plateau occurred in the middle of the Pleistocene (about 0.5 mya) and continued until 0.17 mya <xref rid="pone.0097061-Zheng1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. During that time, the ice cover may have been permanent in the higher altitudes and central regions of the plateau <xref rid="pone.0097061-Shi1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097061-Shi2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> while the southern and eastern regions experienced relatively less glaciation <xref rid="pone.0097061-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Both these sets of conditions created a fragmented ice cover where most of the high-elevation areas on the mountain ranges were ice-clad. Consequently, the prolonged glaciation periods during the late Pleistocene appear to have had a less severe effect on the species inhabiting these areas, as compared to those inhabiting Europe or North America.</p><p>It is now being suggested that the ice sheets possibly retreated more rapidly on the Tibetan Plateau than they did in Europe, as seems to be evident from the demographic history of species like the great tit <italic>Parus major</italic> from the plateau <xref rid="pone.0097061-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. It was observed that contrary to the post-LGM expansion of European animal populations, the demographic histories of species on the Tibetan Plateau indicate expansions only before the LGM; they remained relatively stable or grew slowly subsequently through the LGM <xref rid="pone.0097061-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. The edges of the plateau would have been less under the influence of the glaciations, if at all, at least on the lower elevations. We find support for such a hypothesis in the Bayesian skyline plots, which suggest that the size of the Arunachal macaque populations appeared to remain constant during the prolonged pre-LGM climatic fluctuations. A recent comparative study on five avian species from the Tibetan Plateau <xref rid="pone.0097061-Qu1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> demonstrated that three species distributed on the central platform of the plateau experienced rapid population expansion after the retreat of the extensive glaciers during the pre-LGM (0.5&#x02013;0.175 mya), results similar to that of Zhao <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="pone.0097061-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. On the contrary, the population sizes of the other two species, the twite <italic>Carduelis flavirostris</italic> and the black redstart <italic>Phoenicurus ochruros</italic>, distributed on the edges of the plateau, remained at stable levels throughout the same pre-LGM period. It was concluded that the comparatively ice-free habitats on the edges of the plateau might have experienced milder climates during the glaciation period and this allowed the local species populations to persist in this stable niche <xref rid="pone.0097061-Qu1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Our data also allow us to arrive at similar conclusions for a mammalian species, the Arunachal macaque, in the Eastern Himalayas on the southern fringes of the Tibetan Plateau.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Effect of elevation and animal physiology</title><p>Altitude appears to have played an extremely important role in the demographic history of animal species during the past glacial periods with species at various elevations being affected differently.

Interestingly, Lu <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="pone.0097061-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> found that the population size of the three low-elevation (1800 &#x02013; 3200 m) stream salamander species from the Tibetan Plateau were significantly but slowly decreased from the beginning of the extensive glacial period long before the LGM, in striking contrast to what has been established for the Arunachal macaque and the black redstart. According to Lu <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0097061-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, the suitable habitats for the salamanders may have not been covered by ice during both the LGM and the extensive pre-LGM glacial period but the species may have suffered from climatic cooling because they are less cold-tolerant than their high-elevation counterparts. These ideas are consistent with the hypothesis that variation in ecological adaptations may affect geographical patterns of genetic variation in species populations <xref rid="pone.0097061-Gavrilets1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097061-Hewitt3" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. The poikilothermic salamanders may be expected to have a much lower range of tolerance to changes in ambient temperatures than would homoeothermic animals such as birds and mammals. Thus, animal physiology is another important factor that may have differently affected the evolutionary history of species that otherwise occurred at similar elevations and latitudes in a particular geographical region.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Holocene population decline</title><p>The increase in effective female population size of the Arunachal macaque, as revealed by the Bayesian skyline plots, continues till approximately 5,000 years ago, after which it appears to have suffered a mild decline. Mitochondrial and nuclear autosomal microsatellite loci are known to be informative at different time scales, highlighting different episodes in the demographic history of a species <xref rid="pone.0097061-Fontaine1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The mtDNA diversity tends to reflect comparatively older demographic events in a species' history. Conversely, microsatellite data are more informative about the contemporary demography of a species. Such a difference in demographic signals, captured by each type of genetic marker, may arise from the differences in their respective mutation rates <xref rid="pone.0097061-Cornuet2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The relatively fast mutation rate of microsatellite loci enables them to capture recent and almost contemporaneous events but also increases homoplasy at these loci, which thereby reduces the signal of older demographic events <xref rid="pone.0097061-Estoup1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. These, more ancient, events can, however, still be detected using the slower evolving mtDNA sequences. That is why we employed our microsatellite data to validate the occurrence of a very recent population decline in the Arunachal macaque.</p><p>The classical heterozygosity excess test (the EWCL method) suggested a past population bottleneck in at least the Upper Subansiri population, as reflected in its microsatellite data although the statistical significance of this result was highly dependent on the underlying mutational model. A bottleneck was inferred for this population for two particular models &#x02013; the infinite-allele (IAM) and two-phase (TPM) models &#x02013; but not for a third one, the stepwise-mutation (SMM) model, despite the IAM being unrealistic for most microsatellites <xref rid="pone.0097061-DiRienzo1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Several other microsatellite-based studies of species, thought to have experienced severe, but temporary, reductions in population size, had either failed altogether to detect a bottleneck or, as with our study, yielded results that depended on the mutational model <xref rid="pone.0097061-Spong1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. In at least some of these cases, a few specific markers may have disproportionately influenced the more conservative SMM model. However, in our study, we used 22 microsatellite loci, over twice the minimum number recommended <xref rid="pone.0097061-Luikart1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. To circumvent this problem, we applied the ABC method that clearly supported the population decline model (Scenario 2) over the constant size and population expansion models.</p><p>We could also estimate the extent and time of the decline from the posterior probabilities. Our simulations suggest the population decline started approximately 3,500 years ago, which was climatically a warm period and this is surprising as such climatic conditions are normally conducive for population growth. Several authors have postulated that such idiosyncratic mid-Holocene population declines may have been accelerated and enhanced by major expansions in ancient human civilizations <xref rid="pone.0097061-Stavrianos1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref> (ca. 1,500 BC), the rapid development of agriculture, and the resulting changes in landscapes in recent times. For example, it has been speculated that the expansion and migration of human populations into the erstwhile virgin mountains of the Sichuan region may have caused the decline of the giant panda population during the later part of the mid-Holocene <xref rid="pone.0097061-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>.</p><p>In Arunachal Pradesh too, anthropogenic factors may have significantly influenced the demographic history of the Arunachal macaque over the last few decades or centuries. One of the largest indigenous groups of people that inhabit the districts of Upper Subansiri and West Siang, two areas from which our study samples were derived, and which hunt wildlife extensively for food and sport, is represented by the collective animist Adi people <xref rid="pone.0097061-Lego1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097061-Tabi1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. Recent ethnographic and population genetic studies reveal that the Adi, alternatively referred to as the Luoba Tibetan in Tibet, trace their ancestral migration and settlement history from southern Tibet into Arunachal Pradesh to different time periods during the 5<sup>th</sup> to 7<sup>th</sup> century AD, or to the last 1,300 to 1,500 years before present <xref rid="pone.0097061-Lego1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097061-Tabi1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097061-Krithika2" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097061-Kang1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. Although these estimates do not reject the possibility of a peopling of this region in even earlier times, it is entirely possible that the Arunachal macaque population declines may have actually begun at the time that central Arunachal Pradesh was being peopled by the Adi and other animistic tribes that continue to hunt rampantly even today. It must be reiterated, however, that there is currently no evidence to conclusively establish the definitive contribution of either climatic or anthropogenic factors to this decline in Arunachal macaque populations.</p><p>It should be noted that our investigation, which focuses on a rare, endangered, montane primate, has a smaller sample size than is typical for most population genetics studies. Although there appears to be little benefit in sampling more than 20 to 30 individuals per population for microsatellite-based studies that assess genetic diversity of populations <xref rid="pone.0097061-Pruett1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097061-Hale1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>, sample sizes that are even smaller, as is the case in the present study, may not precisely represent the populations and may yield large errors for descriptive statistical estimates such as allele frequencies and expected heterozygosity. It has, however, been suggested that where small sample sizes are unavoidable, as, for instance, in the case of rare and endangered species, the precision of the estimates can be significantly enhanced by increasing the number of genotyped microsatellite loci, which is precisely what we have done in our study <xref rid="pone.0097061-Hale1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. Moreover, we have used approximate Bayesian computations to test whether the population size changes that we observe using other analytical methods are noteworthy or not. The approximate Bayesian computation framework manages any sample size, which may often be as low as 8 &#x02013; 12 samples per population <xref rid="pone.0097061-Fagundes1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>, by simulating the exactly observed sample sizes <xref rid="pone.0097061-Beaumont4" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>. Small sample sizes would simply lead to wider credible intervals than would larger sample sizes <xref rid="pone.0097061-Beaumont4" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>. We are aware of this limitation of our results but believe that the communication of our present study is of critical importance, in spite of its low sample size, for the conservation effort to save the species, particularly as the collection of more samples from the rare and heavily hunted macaque populations in Arunachal Pradesh is not currently feasible.</p><p>In conclusion, the Tibetan Plateau is an important region to study the population history of its native species for more than one reason. First of all, it is a highly variable region with its different regions &#x02013; the flat central platform and the more variable mountainous edges based on altitude &#x02013; differing significantly from one another in topography and climatic history. The edge regions of the plateau have had a tumultuous orogenic history and the species of these areas are, thus, also expected to show a more eventful evolutionary history. Our study of an edge primate species has, along with other studies from the region, hinted at a very complex image of how geographical features such as latitude and altitude, animal physiology, and climate change in the past may have together influenced its demographic history. Unlike in the tropics, where Pleistocene glacial fluctuations were less likely to have been extreme, this region seems to represent a balance between the tropics and the more severe, temperate arctic environments. This study also underscores the possibility that a cold-tolerant species like the Arunachal macaque, which could withstand historical climate change and grow once the climate became conducive, may actually be extremely vulnerable to anthropogenic exploitation, as is perhaps indicated by its more recent population decline. It is imperative that we understand the population dynamics of such a species at a much finer scale, which could be possible with sampling more populations, particularly those that may connect the study populations. What is of greater concern, however, is the clear genetic signature of a serious decline in the populations of the species, possibly mediated by the extensive hunting that it continues to face across its distribution range. While these threats to the affected populations are currently being documented by on-ground field studies, it is entirely possible that unless immediate action is taken, genetic drift caused by hunting, epidemics or other natural calamities can rapidly eliminate the remaining genetic diversity of this less-known endemic primate from an extremely important biodiversity hotspot in the remote Himalayan mountains of northeastern India.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0097061.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
