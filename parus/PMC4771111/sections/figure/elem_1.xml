  <p>Top panel shows the proportion of infected bats roosting in the heated bat house over the 2â€…month sampling period. Some bats had to be removed from the experiment over time (see Materials and methods); therefore, the bottom panel shows the number of bats remaining in the flight cage on each sampling day.</p>
