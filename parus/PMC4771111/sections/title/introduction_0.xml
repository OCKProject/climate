  <a rid="COV070C57" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C57">Weller, 1989</a>). Habitat enhancement can be used to target many aspects of the biology of threatened species, including nesting or egg laying (

  </a>,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For endothermic species, enhancing habitat to reduce thermoregulatory costs can improve survival and fitness and has potential as a management tool for threatened populations (e.g. 
  <a rid="COV070C47" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C47">Schifferli, 1973</a>; 
  <a rid="COV070C41" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C41">Nager and Noordwijk, 1992</a>;

  <a rid="COV070C5" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C5">Boyles and Willis, 2010</a>). Warm microclimates can be especially important for successful gestation and improved growth of offspring (

  <a rid="COV070C36" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C36">McCarty and Winkler, 1999</a>).

  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>a</sub> for 11 h saved birds about 7 kJ, increased the time allocated to incubation, and allowed birds to lay larger eggs (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Insectivorous bats are one group of endotherms facing a range of conservation threats, including habitat loss (
  <a rid="COV070C26" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C26">Kunz and Lumsden, 2003</a>), climate change (
  <a rid="COV070C21" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C21">Humphries 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2002
  </a>) and disease (
  <a rid="COV070C14" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C14">Frick 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2010
  </a>; 
  <a rid="COV070C28" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C28">Langwig 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2012
  </a>; 
  <a rid="COV070C55" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C55">Warnecke 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2012
  </a>), and they are also a candidate taxon for a habitat enhancement approach to management. Bats spend most of their lives roosting, and roost microclimate is thought to play a key role in survival and reproductive success (e.g. 
  <a rid="COV070C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C13">Fenton and Barclay, 1980</a>; 
  <a rid="COV070C26" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C26">Kunz and Lumsden, 2003</a>; 
  <a rid="COV070C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C29">Lausen and Barclay, 2003</a>). In the temperate zone, roost temperature (
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>roost</sub>) and 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>a</sub> will often fall below thermoneutrality (
  <a rid="COV070C62" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C62">Willis and Brigham, 2005</a>), and many bat species use torpor [i.e. reduced body temperature (
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>b</sub>) and metabolism] to reduce energetic costs (e.g. 
  <a rid="COV070C66" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C66">Willis 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2006
  </a>). However, torpor can delay parturition and inhibit lactation in female bats (
  <a rid="COV070C31" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C31">Lewis, 1993</a>; 
  <a rid="COV070C58" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C58">Wilde 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>., 1995
  </a>) and is known to inhibit spermatogenesis in male ground squirrels (
  <a rid="COV070C4" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C4">Barnes 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 1986
  </a>). Therefore, although bats employ some torpor during the reproductive season to save energy and, potentially, delay parturition during inclement weather (
  <a rid="COV070C66" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C66">Willis 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2006
  </a>), they may also select roosts that help them to reduce reliance on torpor (
  <a rid="COV070C8" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C8">Chruszcz and Barclay, 2002</a>; 
  <a rid="COV070C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C29">Lausen and Barclay, 2003</a>). The dependence of bats on warm 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>roost</sub> suggests that habitat protection or enhancement targeting roost microclimates could benefit survival, reproduction and population growth for temperate bats.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Roost microclimate could also play a role in population recovery from disease. White-nose syndrome (WNS) is an infectious disease of hibernating bats, caused by the fungus 
  <span class="italic">Pseudogymnoascus destructans</span> (
  <a rid="COV070C34" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C34">Lorch 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2011
  </a>; 
  <a rid="COV070C55" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C55">Warnecke 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2012
  </a>) and responsible for unprecedented declines of bats across eastern North America (
  <a rid="COV070C53" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C53">US Fish and Wildlife Service, 2012</a>). The mechanisms underlying mortality are still not fully understood, but affected bats are emaciated as a result of an increase in arousal frequency and energy expenditure during hibernation (reviewed by 
  <a rid="COV070C60" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C60">Willis, 2015</a>). Some bats survive WNS (
  <a rid="COV070C10" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C10">Dobony 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2011
  </a>; 
  <a rid="COV070C39" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C39">Maslo 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2015
  </a>) but, unfortunately, survivors exhibit a rapid reversal of immune suppression in spring that appears to cause immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, which is characterized by a dramatic inflammatory response, deterioration in physiological condition and, possibly, mortality (
  <a rid="COV070C40" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C40">Meteyer 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2012
  </a>). Healing from WNS-associated wing damage, in addition to the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome response itself, is likely to be energetically expensive (
  <a rid="COV070C15" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C15">Fuller 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2011
  </a>). Thus, availability of warm roost microclimates could help survivors make it through potentially harsh spring conditions and initiate reproduction earlier in summer, improving survival of their offspring. If survivors exhibit heritable traits that help them to survive the winter with WNS (
  <a rid="COV070C63" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C63">Willis and Wilcox, 2014</a>; 
  <a rid="COV070C38" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C38">Maslo and Fefferman, 2015</a>), this approach could facilitate evolution of WNS-survival traits in threatened populations (
  <a rid="COV070C39" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C39">Maslo 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2015
  </a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used a combination of behavioural experiments with a captive colony of little brown bats (
  <span class="italic">Myotis lucifugus</span>) and a series of bioenergetic models to test the hypothesis that enhancement of the microclimate of summer roosts could aid management of bat populations imperilled by WNS and other threats. We predicted that: (i) during the post-hibernation period, captive bats would be more likely to select sites with 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>roost</sub> maintained near their thermoneutral zone compared with colder roosts; (ii) bats recovering from WNS at the end of hibernation would show a stronger preference for a heated roost compared with healthy individuals; and (iii) heated roosts would result in biologically significant energy savings for bats compared with natural
