 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results support the potential of roosting habitat enhancement as a management tool for threatened, temperate-zone bats, in general, and as a response to WNS, in particular. We found that both infected and control bats preferred roosting in an artificially heated bat house over an unheated bat house, that bats recovering from WNS virtually always used the heated bat house, and that recovering bats were less likely than control bats to select the unheated bat house. Our model suggests that heated roosts could provide dramatic thermoregulatory energy savings during conditions typical of the post-hibernation period in central Canada, compared with energy expenditure in natural roosts. Our results also suggest the importance of protecting and possibly enhancing high-quality roosting habitat as a management action to enhance survival, reproduction and recovery of bat populations affected by WNS and other threats.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Habitat modification targeting roost or nest microclimate has shown potential as conservation tool for other taxa. For example, heated nest boxes increased reproductive fitness for birds nesting in cavity by reducing energetic costs of incubation and improving the survival of offspring (
  <a rid="COV070C41" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C41">Nager and Noordwijk, 1992</a>; 
  <a rid="COV070C6" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C6">Bryan and Bryant, 1999</a>). During times of energy limitation, such as reproduction, animals should select microclimates that help to minimize energy expenditure. Although a number of studies have shown that male bats of temperate species rely heavily on torpor during summer and suggest that they should select colder roosts than females (e.g. 
  <a rid="COV070C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C29">Lausen and Barclay, 2003</a>), data are scarce for many species. We found that male little brown bats from both infected and control groups preferentially roosted in the heated bat house (Figs

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="COV070F3" href="#COV070F3">3</a>a), possibly because warm

  <sub>roost</sub> could improve rates of spermatogenesis (
  <a rid="COV070C48" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C48">Speakman and Thomas, 2003</a>). To reduce impacts of our research on the wild bat population we restricted our experiment to males, but warm roost microclimates are predicted to be even more important for females. Warm microclimates reduce the energetic demands of thermoregulation during gestation and lactation and enhance the growth of offspring (e.g. 
  <a rid="COV070C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C29">Lausen and Barclay, 2003</a>; 
  <a rid="COV070C48" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C48">Speakman and Thomas, 2003</a>). However, pregnant and post-lactating bats are also known to select roosts that have cool microclimates early in the day, presumably to facilitate some use of torpor (
  <a rid="COV070C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C29">Lausen and Barclay, 2003</a>). For some species, the use of cool microclimates may be especially important during inclement weather, when deep torpor can slow the growth of offspring and delay parturition until conditions become more favourable (
  <a rid="COV070C66" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C66">Willis 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2006
  </a>). Thus, habitat that includes a diversity of microclimates could be most beneficial for survival, reproduction and recovery from WNS. We suggest that future studies quantify 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>roost</sub> preferences and their energetic implications for females of bat species facing the most pronounced impacts affected by WNS.

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Warm roost microclimates could also enhance recovery from WNS. White-nose syndrome causes increased energy expenditure during hibernation that prematurely reduces fat stores (
  <a rid="COV070C55" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C55">Warnecke 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2012
  </a>; 
  <a rid="COV070C54" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C54">Verant 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2014
  </a>), which means affected bats that survive are likely to emerge with minimal energy reserves in spring and must mount an energetically costly immune response while food resources are still scarce. Our results suggest that little brown bats surviving WNS may attempt to compensate for energetic costs via selection of warm roost microclimates. Warm microclimates are known to improve healing of skin lesions in other vertebrates (e.g. 
  <a rid="COV070C1" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C1">Anderson and Roberts, 1975</a>) and, in our study, infected bats virtually always selected the heated bat house (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="COV070F3" href="#COV070F3">3</a>b). It is possible that the timing of availability for each type of bat house in our experiment influenced our results. This study was one of several time-sensitive experiments running in our laboratory to address the recovery phase from WNS, and the timing of availability of bats and equipment prevented us from synchronizing the introduction of heated roosts for both groups. The infected group had a short period of initial exposure to the heated bat house before the unheated bat house was provided, whereas the control group was exposed to both heated and unheated bat houses at the same time. Therefore, infected bats had longer to acclimate to the heated bat house, meaning that the difference we observed should be interpreted cautiously. Nonetheless, free-ranging bats routinely switch between multiple roost sites in the wild (e.g. 
  <a rid="COV070C61" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C61">Willis and Brigham, 2004</a>), and infected bats could have investigated both bat houses and easily switched to the unheated bat house if they preferred it. Moreover, the fact that both groups exhibited a significant preference for heated roosts supports their potential as a management tool even if infected bats do not exhibit a stronger preference in the wild.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our models also highlight the potential benefits of warm roost microclimates for survival, reproduction and population recovery, particularly for bats with limited fat reserves. Predicted thermoregulatory energy expenditure was reduced by as much as 81.2% for bats exposed to thermoneutral 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>roost</sub> with brief opportunities for torpor expression followed by passive warming, compared with maintaining normothermia in a natural roost. Although we only accounted for costs of thermoregulation in our models, our estimates are also plausible in the context of reported values of daily energy expenditure for little brown bats. 
  <a rid="COV070C27" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C27">Kurta 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. (1989)
  </a> found that pregnant female little brown bats in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, USA, expended ∼29.9 kJ day
  <span class="sup">−1</span> in late spring/early summer, with about 4.15 kJ h
  <span class="sup">−1</span> attributed to flight. Our model, based on 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>a</sub> values from a colder, more northern study site, predicted that basal plus thermoregulatory energy costs for a pregnant female little brown bat in a natural roost would amount to 23.5 kJ day
  <span class="sup">−1</span> on average. If we account for foraging for approximately 2–3 h per night, this would add 8.5–13.5 kJ day
  <span class="sup">−1</span> to our estimates (
  <a rid="COV070C27" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C27">Kurta 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 1989
  </a>), leading to a plausible range of daily energy expenditure values of 32.0–37.0 kJ day
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. Thus, the behavioural preference of bats for warm microclimates, combined with our estimates of predicted thermoregulatory energy expenditure, suggests the potential of artificially heated bat houses to help mitigate declines of WNS-affected bat populations.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To date, most proposed mitigations for WNS focus on treating infected bats during winter, whereas few studies have addressed the potential importance of summer habitats (
  <a rid="COV070C60" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C60">Willis, 2015</a>). Protection and enhancement of summer habitats could improve spring and summer survival and reproduction of bats that make it through the winter with WNS. As a result, they could also increase the chance that any heritable traits that provide a winter survival advantage will be passed on to offspring and accumulate in surviving populations (Q. M. R. Webber and C. K. R. Willis, unpublished data). We recommend that future studies investigate preferences for, and energetic benefits of, heated bat houses for females of temperate bat species in the wild and determine the impact of artificial heating on gestation, juvenile development and survival of bats with and without WNS. Given the large North American market for bat houses (estimated at ∼25 000 bat houses sold in the USA each year; R. Mies, Organization for Bat Conservation, personal communication), heated bat houses could theoretically be deployed on a large scale on private and public property where AC power is available. We also recommend further work to understand natural variation in 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>roost</sub> experienced by WNS-affected species throughout their ranges and identify readily measurable characteristics of those roosts that predict warm 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>roost</sub> so that managers can more easily identify and protect those habitats.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the potential benefit of warm roost microclimates, more work is needed to address potential limitations and negative consequences of artificially heated bat houses as a management tool. For example, warm roosts that prevent bats from using torpor during spring could be counter-productive if they increase energy expenditure when food is unavailable. It is also possible that, if many bats exhibit strong preferences for heated roosts, then social network dynamics could be altered in ways that lead to enhanced pathogen or parasite transmission, including transmission of 
  <span class="italic">P. destructans</span> (Q. M. R. Webber and C. K. R. Willis, unpublished data). Understanding the impacts of 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>roost</sub> manipulation for social dynamics and pathogen or parasite transmission is important for evaluating the potential of habitat enhancement as a management strategy. Artificially eated bats houses will also be effective only for species, such as little brown bats, that regularly rely on anthropogenic structures. Other endangered bat species, such northern long-eared bats (
  <span class="italic">Myotis septentrionalis</span>), are unlikely to benefit because they rely more heavily on roosts in trees. Importantly, though, our results support not only artificial heating as a management tool but also the protection of the highest quality natural summer roosting habitat (i.e. forest roosts that provide the warmest roost microclimates). These kinds of habitats could be critical for helping forest-dependent species to maintain energy balance during spring recovery.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found that both infected and control bats preferentially selected heated bat houses and that infected bats appeared to exhibit a stronger preference than control animals. The bioenergetic model we devised also highlighted the potential thermoregulatory benefits of artificially heated roosts compared with natural sites. Taken together, these results suggest that heated bat houses, in addition to protection of high-quality natural roosts with warm microclimates, could be useful as a conservation measure by improving conditions for gestation, lactation and offspring development and by enhancing recovery from WNS. Roost microclimate enhancement could be implemented by running AC or solar power to existing roosts (i.e. those often found in man-made structures or on private or public property) or designing structures that best retain solar heat and warm passively. Regardless, before this strategy is attempted on a large scale in the field, more data are needed on effects of
