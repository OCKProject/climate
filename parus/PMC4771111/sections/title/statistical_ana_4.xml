 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All analyses were conducted in R (version 2.14.1; 
  <a rid="COV070C43" ref-type="bibr" href="#COV070C43">R Development Core Team, 2011</a>). To test whether bats were more likely to occupy artificially heated or unheated bat houses within each treatment group, we used McNemar's test with Yate's correction for continuity on a 2 × 2 contingency table, quantifying the number of paired observation days when at least one bat was present or when bats were entirely absent from the heated or unheated bat house. To test for a difference in use of the heated vs. unheated bat house between infected and control groups, we used Fisher's exact test on two additional 2 × 2 contingency tables, this time quantifying the presence and absence of at least one bat in the heated and unheated bat house. We were not able to bring the two groups of bats to the laboratory or introduce the bat houses at the same times; therefore, for the Fisher's exact test, we only used observations from 20 June to 23 July 2013, when both groups were present in the flight cages simultaneously with access to both bat houses.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To compare the energetic implications of our four roost scenarios, we first calculated the average daily energy expenditure for April and May of each year (i.e. from 1996 to 2005). Thus, we calculated one value of average daily energy expenditure for April 1996, one value for May 1996, one value for April 1997, and so on. We then used an ANOVA for each month with average daily energy expenditure as the response variable, Scenario (i.e. 1–4) as the predictor and year as the experimental unit. We used Tukey's honest significance test for 
  <span class="italic">post hoc</span> analysis. Significance was assessed at the 
  <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;0.05 level, and all values are reported as the means ± SD.
