 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results show lower early swelling response to PHA in older individuals. Matching with our predictions, these findings suggest that ageing might impair toad immune capacity, aligned with a senescence pattern, at least during the early stages of the response, which correspond to an innate response. Supporting senescence of immune system in toads, some studies have found deteriorated immune organs and reduced immune-cell counts in older 
  <span class="italic">Bufotes viridis</span> toads (
  <a rid="ref-76" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-76">Saad et al., 1994</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eliciting an immune response is indeed energetically costly (
  <a rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-18">Demas et al., 2012</a>), and such energy challenge can be harder to afford by older individuals, whose energy metabolism is impaired (
  <a rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-31">Green, Galluzzi &amp; Kroemer, 2011</a>). However, a fit physiological state and favourable ecological circumstances may reverse that trend (
  <a rid="ref-67" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-67">Palacios et al., 2011</a>). For instance, 
  <a rid="ref-55" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-55">Massot et al. (2011)</a> found that immune response to PHA was higher in older than in younger female common lizards, 
  <span class="italic">Zootoca vivipara</span>. Thus, immune response might be optimised (
  <a rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-30">Graham, Allen &amp; Read, 2005</a>) in older individuals, in which reducing innate response could be compensated with a bolstered adaptive response as a consequence of accumulated antigen experiences (
  <a rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-25">Franceschi et al., 2007</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-40">Janeway et al., 1999</a>). However, other studies have found negative effects of age also on adaptive response (
  <a rid="ref-80" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-80">Solana, Pawelec &amp; Tarazona, 2006</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-89" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-89">Weng, 2006</a>), so a general pattern remains unclear. On the other hand, older individuals could have difficulties in facing oxidative stress caused by immune response (
  <a rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-15">Constantini &amp; Møller, 2009</a>), so a milder immune response could reduce oxidative unbalance. In fact, oxidative stress induces senescence and favours age-related disorders (
  <a rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-38">Hosokawa, 2002</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An alternative, but not mutually exclusive explanation implies a trade-off between immune capacity and reproduction. Limitations in energy-metabolism outcome could be on the basis of reduced immune response in older individuals (
  <a rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-37">Hipkiss, 2008</a>). According to the terminal investment hypothesis, older individuals could increase energy investment in current reproduction, since their chances of future reproduction events are low (
  <a rid="ref-71" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-71">Poizat, Rosecchi &amp; Crivelli, 1999</a>). In that context, the energy-limiting situation due to deteriorated metabolism in older individuals (
  <a rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-1">Balaban, Nemoto &amp; Finkel, 2005</a>) could lead to trade-offs favouring reproduction to the detriment of other energy-consuming life-history traits (
  <a rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-28">González-Tokman, González-Santoyo &amp; Córdoba-Aguilar, 2013</a>), such as immune response. Accordingly, immune-system activity has proven reduced as a consequence of terminal investment resource reallocation into reproduction (
  <a rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-45">Krams et al., 2011</a>). Conversely, an immune challenge can trigger terminal investment (
  <a rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-4">Bonneaud et al., 2004</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-63" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-63">Nielsen &amp; Hokman, 2012</a>), suggesting complex relationships between immune system and reproduction in the context of ageing. Indeed, reproduction and immune activity are under a trade-off in great tit (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) females (
  <a rid="ref-66" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-66">Ots &amp; Horak, 1996</a>), as could also be happening in this system, where some indicators of reproductive investment are higher in older individuals in 
  <span class="italic">E. calamita</span> toads (
  <a rid="ref-94" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-94">Zamora-Camacho &amp; Comas, 2017</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interestingly, the negative effect of age on immune response affected similarly males and females, so we found no evidence of a sex-dependent mechanism underlying immune response senescence. Although we detected no sex differences in the relationship between immune response and age, they were expectable. On the one hand, the investment of female anurans in reproduction is particularly high (
  <a rid="ref-92" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-92">Yu et al., 2017</a>), so the energy trade-off, likely more intense in older, energy-limited individuals (
  <a rid="ref-62" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-62">Navarro &amp; Boveris, 2007</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-31">Green, Galluzzi &amp; Kroemer, 2011</a>), could be greater in females. Nonetheless, in agreement with our results, reproductive investment of 
  <span class="italic">Hyla intermedia</span> female frogs shows no trade-off with age (
  <a rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-8">Cadeddu &amp; Castellano, 2012</a>), and 
  <span class="italic">Rana temporaria</span> female frogs do not trade off reproductive investment and growth (
  <a rid="ref-47" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-47">Lardner &amp; Loman, 2003</a>). On the other hand, the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis predicts lower immunocompetence in males due to the immunosuppressive effect of testosterone (
  <a rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-23">Folstad &amp; Karter, 1992</a>). Nevertheless, we found no evidence for such handicap, nor a relationship with age. Accordingly, 
  <span class="italic">Hyla arborea</span> male frogs showed no negative effect of testosterone injection on swelling response to PHA (
  <a rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-19">Desprat et al., 2015</a>). Indeed, immune responsiveness to PHA has often been found similar in male and female anurans (
  <a rid="ref-95" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-95">Zhang et al., 2017</a>), also in this species (
  <a rid="ref-94" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-94">Zamora-Camacho &amp; Comas, 2017</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, we detected no effect of habitat on the negative relationship between age and early immune response. These agrosystem toads live shorter but grow larger and invest more in reproduction (
  <a rid="ref-94" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-94">Zamora-Camacho &amp; Comas, 2017</a>), and at the same time they show a delayed early swelling response to PHA in comparison with natural-habitat toads (
  <a rid="ref-93" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-93">Zamora-Camacho, in press</a>). Therefore, we might expect accelerated reduction of early immune response in agrosystem toads due to agrosystem stressors. However, the tendency of early immune response with age was similar in both habitats.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In any case, reduced immune capacity in older individuals, at least in early stages according to our results, could be a consequence of senescence through mechanisms that remain obscure (reviewed in 
  <a rid="ref-85" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-85">Torroba &amp; Zapata, 2003</a>), and at the same time play a role on increased mortality in older individuals (
  <a rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-36">Hillyer et al., 2005</a>). Older toads in this system showed reduced early immune response to PHA, which might suggest impaired ability to overcome infections (
  <a rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-35">Hawley &amp; Altizer, 2011</a>) and parasites (
  <a rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-9">Campião, Da Silva &amp; Ferreira, 2009</a>), as detected in other species. Therefore, deterioration of early swelling response, corresponding to innate immunity may be at least one of the causes of compromised survival in older adults (
  <a rid="ref-94" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-94">Zamora-Camacho &amp; Comas, 2017</a>), as immune response is directly related to survival (
  <a rid="ref-57" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-57">Møller &amp; Saino, 2004</a>). However, we cannot completely discard a cohort effect (potential effects caused by inter-annual differences in factors such as temperature, precipitation regimes, food availability, or pathogen exposure), as we measured age with skeletochronology—which implies a snapshot of the age structure at the time when animals were sampled—not with a longitudinal study. The experimental design described here is cross-sectional, since it explores characteristics of a population at a given moment (
  <a rid="ref-64" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-64">Nussey et al., 2008</a>). On the other hand, longitudinal studies measure the same characteristics of the same individuals at different points of their lives, and are valuable for studying ageing processes, as they avoid biases by differential mortality (
  <a rid="ref-64" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-64">Nussey et al., 2008</a>). However, we conducted a cross-sectional study instead because an immune challenge could have an effect on subsequent ones, which would reduce the reliability of repeated-measures results (
  <a rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-5">Boughton, Joop &amp; Armitage, 2011</a>).
