 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prior to their release, we clipped two toes from each toad, disinfecting the wounds with chlorhexidine and stanching them with a tissue adhesive glue (Dermabond). Toes were used for age estimates, as previously described in 
  <a rid="ref-94" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-94">Zamora-Camacho &amp; Comas (2017)</a>. Specifically, age was estimated by means of phalanx skeletochronology (
  <a rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-13">Comas et al., 2016</a>) using one phalanx per toad. This method does not involve killing specimens. Phalanx skeletochronology is based on the growth pattern of bones of indeterminate-growth ectotherms. Cross-sections of the bones appear surrounded by a line (lines of arrested growth, hereafter LAGs) delimiting areas of rapid osteogenesis when growth is slow or does not happen, typically during hibernation and/or aestivation. Age can be estimated by couting these LAGs: each LAG correspond to one period of inactivity. Since toads in this area only stop activity, and therefore growing, once a year during aestivation, each LAG corresponds to one year. We confirmed the number of LAGs corresponding to one year by calibrating the technique with six subadults whose age was known, which we did not use in the analyses.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We preserved phalanges in 70% ethanol. We performed several trials to estimate the time needed for decalcification. Based on those trials, we decalcified bones by immersing them in 3% nitric acid for 150 min. A solution of phosphate-buffered saline solution with sucrose was used to preserve decalcified samples for at least 48 h at 4 °C. Then, we sectioned them at 16 µm using a freezing microtome (HM500, MICROM) at the Estación Biológica de Doñana (EBD-CSIC), Seville (Spain). We stained cross-sections for 20 min with Harris hematoxylin. After that, we washed the slides in tap water for 5 min to rinse stain. Finally, we used an alcohol chain to dehydrate sections, which we mounted on slides and fixed with DPX (a common medium for mounting histological samples).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Afterwards, we counted the number of LAGs in each cross-section with a light microscope (Leitz Dialux20) at magnifications from 50 to 125X. To do so, we used several representative cross-sections among those in which LAGs were clearly visible, and photographed them several times with a ProgRes C3 camera. For better observation of LAGs, we only photographed bone diaphises. More specifically, we focused on sections were medullar cavity was at its minimun size, while that of the periosteal area was at its maximum size (
  <a rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-13">Comas et al., 2016</a>). Next, the same researcher counted the amount of LAGs in the periosteal bone, on two independent occasions; in no case did the researcher know the identification of the toad studied (
  <a rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-13">Comas et al., 2016</a>). Readings matched in all cases. Because we captured toads during winter and spring, LAGs formed during the preceding summer inactivity period could be discerned from the exterior border of the bones, and were not counted.
