 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Toads were captured in natural pine grove Pinares de Cartaya, and agroecosystems nearby, in the Southwest of Spain (37°20′N, 7°09′W). Pine grove was composed of stone pine (
  <span class="italic">Pinus pinea</span>) as the tree stratum, and 
  <span class="italic">Pistacia lentiscus, Cistus ladanifer</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Rosmarinus officinalis</span> as an undergrowth. Although some debate exists on the autochthonous or introduced origin of stone pine in this area, their dominance in this ecosystem has been estimated for at least 4,000 years (

  <span class="italic">E. calamita</span> reproduces were numerous throughout both habitats. Warm winter and arid summer climate in the area makes toads skip hibernation, but they undergo an inactivity period during the summer instead.
