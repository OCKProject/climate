   <span class="italic">Epidalea calamita</span> is a medium-sized (54–75 mm snout-vent length -SVL- in this system) Bufonid toad that inhabits diverse habitats throughout Central and Southwestern Europe (
   <a rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-27">Gómez-Mestre, 2014</a>). Activity takes place mainly during warm, wet nights, and thus phenology varies according to climate: this species hibernates in habitats where winters are cold, but resorts to aestivation instead to avoid summer drought in southern warm locations (
   <a rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-27">Gómez-Mestre, 2014</a>). Similarly, there is variation in reproduction period, which may take place in late winter or in spring (
   <a rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-27">Gómez-Mestre, 2014</a>). Eggs are often laid in very small temporary ponds, and tadpoles can finish metamorphosis in periods as short as 6 weeks (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Toads were captured in natural pine grove Pinares de Cartaya, and agroecosystems nearby, in the Southwest of Spain (37°20′N, 7°09′W). Pine grove was composed of stone pine (
   <span class="italic">Pinus pinea</span>) as the tree stratum, and 
   <span class="italic">Pistacia lentiscus, Cistus ladanifer</span>, and 
   <span class="italic">Rosmarinus officinalis</span> as an undergrowth. Although some debate exists on the autochthonous or introduced origin of stone pine in this area, their dominance in this ecosystem has been estimated for at least 4,000 years (
   <a rid="ref-54" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-54">Martínez &amp; Montero, 2004</a>). Agroecosystems were around 5 km away, in a traditional crop area, which in the recent years has shifted to intensive orange and strawberry plantations, among other crops. Small ponds where 
   <span class="italic">E. calamita</span> reproduces were numerous throughout both habitats. Warm winter and arid summer climate in the area makes toads skip hibernation, but they undergo an inactivity period during the summer instead.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Toad collection and management</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We collected 18 female and 20 male 
   <span class="italic">B. calamita</span> by hand during their mating season (January–April) in 2015. Toads were caught while active on rainy nights, or actively searched for under rocks or logs during the day. We distinguished males because their throats are purple-to-pink due to their vocal sacs, and because they show brown or black nuptial pads in their fingers and forelimb tubercles (
   <a rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-27">Gómez-Mestre, 2014</a>). For each toad, we measured SVL with a ruler to the nearest mm, body mass with a balance (model CDS-100, precision 0.01 g), and left forelimb sole pad thickness to the nearest 0.01 mm, using a pressure-sensitive micrometer (Mitutoyo). We took three consecutive measures in quick succession, and considered the mean as sole pad thickness (
   <a rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-7">Brown, Shilton &amp; Shine, 2011</a>). Afterwards, we subcutaneously injected 0.1 mg of phytohemagglutinin (PHA, Sigma Aldrich L-8754; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) diluted in 0.01 ml phosphate buffer saline in left forelimb sole pad. We inoculated the same amount of PHA to all individuals because there were no significant differences in body mass between toads from both habitats (
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>1,37</sub> = 0.146; 
   <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.704). PHA is a protein that provokes a safe skin-swelling immune response that involves T-cells and other components of the immune system (

   <a rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-3">Bílková, Vinklerová &amp; Vinkler, 2015</a>). The magnitude of that swelling is directly proportional to the capacity of the individual to elicit an immune response (
   <a rid="ref-68" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-68">Parmentier, De Vries Reilingh &amp; Nieuwland, 1998</a>; 
   <a rid="ref-87" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-87">Vinkler, Bainova &amp; Albrecht, 2010</a>; 
   <a rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-11">Clulow, Harris &amp; Mahony, 2015</a>). This method has proved valid in amphibians (

   <a rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-11">Clulow, Harris &amp; Mahony, 2015</a>). According to 
   <a rid="ref-79" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-79">Smits, Bortolotti &amp; Tella (1999)</a>, omitting phosphate buffer saline (PBS) controls in PHA tests has little impact on the results, decreases handling errors, and reduces the coefficient of variation resulting from measurement inaccuracy. For this reason, PHA tests are often simplified by not using PBS controls in amphibians (

   <a rid="ref-93" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-93">Zamora-Camacho, in press</a>) as well as in other groups (v.gr.

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After inoculations, we measured sole pad thickness as described, once per hour, for the six hours subsequent to inoculations. Early swelling response to PHA in this species peaks before six hours from inoculation (
   <a rid="ref-93" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-93">Zamora-Camacho, in press</a>). This procedure allowed us to calculate swelling immune response on an hourly basis, by subtracting sole pad thickness prior to inoculations to sole pad thickness at each hourly measure after inoculation for each individual. At these early stages, swelling response to PHA is directly proportional to recruitment of macrophages, eosinophils and neutrophils, which corresponds to an innate response in closely-related 
   <span class="italic">Rhinella marina</span> toads (
   <a rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-7">Brown, Shilton &amp; Shine, 2011</a>). With that information, for each individual, we calculated area under the curve (AUC, in h*mm) resulting from swelling-response progression during the six hours measured, as a directly proportional measurement of swelling response magnitude incorporating time (
   <a rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-21">Fekedulegn et al., 2007</a>). We obtained AUC with software GraphPad Prism 7.0, which applies the trapezoidal formula. During the whole procedure, we kept toads in individual plastic terraria, with humid peat as a substrate and an opaque piece of plastic as a shelter. Toads were released at their capture sites after the last measure.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Skeletochronology technique</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prior to their release, we clipped two toes from each toad, disinfecting the wounds with chlorhexidine and stanching them with a tissue adhesive glue (Dermabond). Toes were used for age estimates, as previously described in 
   <a rid="ref-94" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-94">Zamora-Camacho &amp; Comas (2017)</a>. Specifically, age was estimated by means of phalanx skeletochronology (
   <a rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-13">Comas et al., 2016</a>) using one phalanx per toad. This method does not involve killing specimens. Phalanx skeletochronology is based on the growth pattern of bones of indeterminate-growth ectotherms. Cross-sections of the bones appear surrounded by a line (lines of arrested growth, hereafter LAGs) delimiting areas of rapid osteogenesis when growth is slow or does not happen, typically during hibernation and/or aestivation. Age can be estimated by couting these LAGs: each LAG correspond to one period of inactivity. Since toads in this area only stop activity, and therefore growing, once a year during aestivation, each LAG corresponds to one year. We confirmed the number of LAGs corresponding to one year by calibrating the technique with six subadults whose age was known, which we did not use in the analyses.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We preserved phalanges in 70% ethanol. We performed several trials to estimate the time needed for decalcification. Based on those trials, we decalcified bones by immersing them in 3% nitric acid for 150 min. A solution of phosphate-buffered saline solution with sucrose was used to preserve decalcified samples for at least 48 h at 4 °C. Then, we sectioned them at 16 µm using a freezing microtome (HM500, MICROM) at the Estación Biológica de Doñana (EBD-CSIC), Seville (Spain). We stained cross-sections for 20 min with Harris hematoxylin. After that, we washed the slides in tap water for 5 min to rinse stain. Finally, we used an alcohol chain to dehydrate sections, which we mounted on slides and fixed with DPX (a common medium for mounting histological samples).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Afterwards, we counted the number of LAGs in each cross-section with a light microscope (Leitz Dialux20) at magnifications from 50 to 125X. To do so, we used several representative cross-sections among those in which LAGs were clearly visible, and photographed them several times with a ProgRes C3 camera. For better observation of LAGs, we only photographed bone diaphises. More specifically, we focused on sections were medullar cavity was at its minimun size, while that of the periosteal area was at its maximum size (
   <a rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-13">Comas et al., 2016</a>). Next, the same researcher counted the amount of LAGs in the periosteal bone, on two independent occasions; in no case did the researcher know the identification of the toad studied (
   <a rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-13">Comas et al., 2016</a>). Readings matched in all cases. Because we captured toads during winter and spring, LAGs formed during the preceding summer inactivity period could be discerned from the exterior border of the bones, and were not counted.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since data met the criteria of residual homoscedasticity and normality, we conducted parametric statistics (
   <a rid="ref-72" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-72">Quinn &amp; Keough, 2002</a>). Firstly, we performed two simple regressions with AUC as a dependent variable, and age in the first case and SVL in the second case as independent variables. Then, we performed a multiple regression with AUC as a dependent variable, and SVL and age as independent variables. Finally, we conducted a series of ANCOVAs to test the effects of SVL and age on AUC and each hourly measurement independently with sex and habitat introduced as factors—since both affect swelling immune response of these toads (
   <a rid="ref-93" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-93">Zamora-Camacho, in press</a>)—without non-significant habitat*sex interactions. Statistical analyses were performed with the software Statistica 8.0.
