 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similar values of genetic diversity were obtained for both the four populations of 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">schioetzi</span> and the five populations of 
  <span class="italic">L</span>. 
  <span class="italic">bicolor</span> (
  <a rid="pone.0202010.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0202010.t001">Table 1</a>). The average percentage of polymorphic loci for the four populations of 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">schioetzi</span> was 74.8% (Standard Error SE = 3.8). The average of genetic diversity (
  <span class="italic">H</span>
  <sub>E</sub>) across these populations and loci was 0.219 (SE = 0.008). We did not detect significant differences in average heterozygosity between populations (F(3,496) = 0.65, P = 0.58). The average percentage of polymorphic loci for 
  <span class="italic">L</span>. 
  <span class="italic">bicolor</span> was 69.8% (SE = 2.3), and the average value of genetic diversity was 
  <span class="italic">H</span>
  <sub>E</sub> = 0.209 (SE = 0.008). Average heterozygosity was not significantly different among the five populations of 
  <span class="italic">L</span>. 
  <span class="italic">bicolor</span> (F (4,585) = 1.28, P = 0.28).
