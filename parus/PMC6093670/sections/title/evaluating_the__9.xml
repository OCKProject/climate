 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We performed an Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) to investigate the hierarchical partitioning of genetic variation among populations and estimate the population genetic differentiation via Φ
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">PT</span>
  </sub>. To do this, each of the sampling sites were treated as populations (other hierarchical analysis such as different groups of fragments or regions were not performed). Φ
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">PT</span>
  </sub> is analogous to 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">ST</span>
  </sub> and used for dominant markers such as AFLP [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref057">57</a>]. This measure was calculated as 
  <span class="italic">V</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">AP</span>
  </sub> ⁄ (
  <span class="italic">V</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">AP</span>
  </sub> + 
  <span class="italic">V</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">WP</span>
  </sub>), where 
  <span class="italic">V</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">AP</span>
  </sub> is the variance among populations and 
  <span class="italic">V</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">WP</span>
  </sub> the variance within populations. We tested for statistical significance of the Φ
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">PT</span>
  </sub> values using a nonparametric permutation method [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref058" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref058">58</a>] with the number of permutations set to 999. By testing significance of the variance components and Φ statistic through a permutational approach removes the assumption of normality, which is unsuitable for molecular data [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref058" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref058">58</a>]. Significance levels following corrections for multiple comparisons via Bonferroni tests [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref059" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref059">59</a>] were conducted.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Last, we investigated population genetic structure using the Bayesian model-based clustering algorithms implemented in STRUCTURE v2.3.3 [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref060" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref060">60</a>]. STRUCTURE uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to cluster individuals into populations based on their genotypes. It generates posterior probabilities of assignment of individuals to each of a given number of 
  <span class="italic">K</span> groups or populations regardless of their site of origin [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref060" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref060">60</a>]. For each species, we first ran STRUCTURE on all populations across the entire study area using the admixture model (no prior information) with correlated allele frquencies. We then used the population data (sampling sites) as prior information (LOCPRIOR) to assist the clustering as recommended when the signal of structure is weak [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref060" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref060">60</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref061" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref061">61</a>]. For both species, a range of 
  <span class="italic">K</span> values from 1 to 10 was performed. We ran batches of five independent runs with a burn-in of 100,000 and 500,000 iterations for each of the 
  <span class="italic">K</span> values. We calculated the ‘optimal’ 
  <span class="italic">K</span> (the number of genetic clusters that best fits these data) using the web version of STRUCTURE HARVESTER [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref062" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref062">62</a>]. Below, we report estimates for 
  <span class="italic">K</span> using two methods: (1) the log posterior probability of the data Ln(
  <span class="italic">K</span>) given 
  <span class="italic">K</span> genetic clusters [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref060" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref060">60</a>] and (2) Δ
  <span class="italic">K</span> [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref063" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref063">63</a>], which is based on the rate of change in the log probability of data between successive 
  <span class="italic">K</span> values.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test for migration within each species, we used STRUCTURE to identify immigrants or individuals with recent immigrant ancestry in the last two generations. The model for this analysis uses population information with correlated allele frequencies. The model was set to GENSBACK = 2 and MIGRPRIOR = 0.001, as suggested by Falush et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref064" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref064">64</a>]. Thus, the prior probability that an individual has pure ancestry from its predefined population is 0.999.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To examine the pattern of isolation by distance, we tested for correlation between matrices of geographic and genetic distances (Φ
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">PT</span>
  </sub> pairwise
  <sub>)</sub> using a Mantel test as implemented in GenAlEx v6.5.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although both GenAlEx and STRUCTURE can accommodate missing data, we removed missing genotypes from the analyses for the two preferred combinations of primers for both species in all analyses. Missing data may be problematic for some pairwise distance-based analyses implemented in GenAlEx [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref065" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref065">65</a>]. While GenAlEx provides an option for interpolating the genetic distance for missing loci (by inserting the average genetic distances for each population level pairwise contrast, that is, within a population, or between two populations), we prevent any possible bias by eliminating the missing data from our analyses [see 
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref055">55</a>].
