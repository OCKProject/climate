 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used GenAlEx v6.5 [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref055">55</a>] to perform frequency and distance-based analyses. Allelic frequencies were estimated following the method of Lynch and Milligan [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref056">56</a>], assuming independent nuclear loci and Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium within populations. The expected Heterozygosity (
  <span class="italic">H</span>
  <sub>E</sub>) was calculated as 2(p)(q) implemented for diploid binary data (dominant markers) and assuming random mating, where q = (1—Band Frequency)^0.5 and p = 1—q.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We converted genetic data into a pairwise individual-by-individual genetic distance matrix and used this to assess genetic structure within populations. This is a true Euclidean metric [see 
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref055">55</a>] as required for the subsequent analysis of molecular variance.
