 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A common cause of genetic differentiation among populations is geographic distance so that in continuous habitats, poor dispersal ability and large distances between individuals may drive genetic differentiation [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref070" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref070">70</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref071" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref071">71</a>]. However, the results of our Mantel test on the continuous forest populations of 
  <span class="italic">L</span>. 
  <span class="italic">bicolor</span> showed no evidence for significant genetic differences among them, regardless of distance. Within the continuous forest habitat dispersal occurs over at least 1.85 km (between MFIII and MFIV), the greatest distances between any of our continuous forest sites. The fact that estimates of 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">ST</span>
  </sub> from AFLP’s are likely to be over estimates [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref072" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref072">72</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref073" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref073">73</a>] gives us confidence that little, if any genetic differentiation exists among forest populations.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Habitat fragmentation, which often isolates populations and reduces their size [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref072" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref072">72</a>] is another cause of population genetic differentiation at small geographic scales, e.g. less than five km [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref072" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref072">72</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref073" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref073">73</a>]. We found evidence for this in 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">schioetzi</span>, where a population from the riparian forest fragment (F3) is distinct from the forest population (MFI). While F3 and MFI are in close geographic proximity (less than two km), they are separated by heavily overgrazed and annually burnt grassland, so that movement between habitats would likely be difficult. However, because AFLPs have a lower mutation rate than microsatellites [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref074" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref074">74</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref075" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref075">75</a>] it is important to be aware that our estimates of 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">ST</span>
  </sub> will likely be higher than if we had used microsatellites [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref069" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref069">69</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref075" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref075">75</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similar findings have been reported by Dixo et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref076" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref076">76</a>] who compared genetic diversity of the toad 
  <span class="italic">Rhinella ornata</span> among small and medium forest fragments that were either isolated or connected to large forest areas by corridors. They found a weak but significant 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">ST</span>
  </sub> between small fragments and continuous forest, but no significant genetic differentiation among continuous forest sites.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The extent of gene flow among local populations determines their potential for genetic differentiation [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref077" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref077">77</a>]. Thus, at our study site, current gene flow may explain the lack of genetic differentiation among populations within the forest (
  <span class="italic">L</span>. 
  <span class="italic">bicolor</span>) and among the riparian forest fragments (
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">schioetzi</span>). This is supported by our tests for migration, which indicated that in both species, populations are weakly linked by gene flow, both current and within the past two generations. In the case of 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">schioetzi</span>, the test revealed that population F3 contained immigrants from the other two riparian fragments as well as from the forest population MFI. In this case, invidivuals may be dispersing via a stepping-stone dispersal model [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref078" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref078">78</a>], moving, for example, from MFI to F3 through F1, most probably in the rainy season when grass is tall and there is no burning. Moreover, at this time of year streamflow is higher so that streams within fragments which are isolated from each other in the dry season are able to join up, connecting fragments (see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202010.g001" href="#pone.0202010.g001">Fig 1</a>). Despite this potential homogenizing effect of the wet season, signiticant genetic difference was detected among some population pairs. In the case of 
  <span class="italic">L</span>. 
  <span class="italic">bicolor</span>, the single riparian fragment population F4, contained immigrants from all forest populations except MFII, from which it was significantly genetically different. A possible explanation for this could be non-random gene flow, i.e. gene flow which is not constant over time, nor the same level between every population pair. Such variation could reduce the homogenizing effect of gene flow and instead promote genetic differentiation [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref079" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref079">79</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref080" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref080">80</a>]. Two studies we are aware of on 
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span> have demonstrated that non-random dispersal (such as we describe above) can contribute to genetic differentiation at a fine scale [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref079" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref079">79</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref080" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref080">80</a>]. For example Garant et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref079" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref079">79</a>] found that non random dispersal influenced diversifying effects on body mass variation and Postma and van Noordwijk [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref080" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref080">80</a>] observed that small-scale genetic difference in clutch size was produced by different levels of gene flow.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For both species, the results of clustering analyses in STRUCTURE differ based on the estimator used (Ln(
  <span class="italic">K</span>) and Δ
  <span class="italic">K</span>) and groupings were not consistent with sampling location. While the precise number of genetic clusters is not critical to our study, the finding of multiple population groups using both estimators supports our interpretation of population genetic structure.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A synthesis of our results suggest they are similar to the findings of a similar study on 
  <span class="italic">Phrynobatrachus guineensis</span> in Taï National Park (TNP), Ivory Coast [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref081" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref081">81</a>]. As in our study, and in contrast to expectations, Sandberger et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref081" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref081">81</a>] detected only a slight significant genetic differentiation among populations of this leaf litter frog and no correlation between the geographic and genetic distances (isolation by distance). Their Bayesian clustering revealed no genetic substructure. Originally 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">guineensis</span> was thought to be weakly mobile and highly specialized, however, high intra- and possibly inter-patch migration events explained the lack of population structure. Thus, individuals of this species are more able to disperse than was expected. We cannot rule out that this is not the case in our study and future work is needed to test this idea.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another potential contributing factor to genetic differentaion in fragmented populations is that in fragmented landscapes species often persist as metapopulations [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref082" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref082">82</a>]. This may well be the case for the two target species in this study [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref083" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref083">83</a>]. If so, then the persistence of genetic variation within and among populations would depend on the factors discussed above and the ability of the species to form a metapopulation [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref084" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref084">84</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While we lack information on dispersal distances for our focal species, some examples are available for other amphibian species. For the salamander 
  <span class="italic">Plethodon cinereus</span>, Cabe et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref085" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref085">85</a>] found clear genetic differences among plots that increased with distance (200m to 2 km). Geographic distances at larger scales (&gt; 2 km) contributed to differentiation among populations of the European tree frog 
  <span class="italic">Hyla arborea</span> in a fragmented landscape Angelone et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref086" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref086">86</a>]. Because the likelihood of detecting isolation by distance increases with the number of populations sampled [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref087" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref087">87</a>], the lack of correlation in our study between geographic distance and genetic differentiation may be due to the relatively small number of sample sites included. However, sampling more sites at greater distances is difficult in this system as Ngel Nyaki Forest Reserve comprises only ~5.3 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> of forest (with no straight-line distances within continuous forest exceeding 5 km) and most of the few remaining forest fragments are relatively near to the reserve.
