 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Globally, amphibians face the most extreme population declines of all major vertebrate groups [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref001">1</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref003">3</a>]. Contributing factors include climate change, disease, and habitat fragmentation [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref004">4</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref006">6</a>]. The severity of amphibian declines vary across geographic regions [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref003">3</a>] and despite evidence for population declines in Africa [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref007">7</a>], the influence of habitat fragmentation on these declines remains unknown [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref007">7</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref008">8</a>]. Even less is known about the impact of habitat fragmentation on population genetics of amphibian species in Africa [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref009">9</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref010">10</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As is the case with many other taxa, habitat fragmentation likely has long-term effects on the genetic viability of amphibian populations because of the combined effects of reduced population size and increased isolation [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref011">11</a>]. Increased isolation among populations may lead to reduced dispersal and gene flow, increased levels of inbreeding, smaller effective population sizes, and loss of genetic variation [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref012">12</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref014">14</a>]. Consequently, assessing the population genetics of a species can provide valuable information for conservation much more quickly than longitudinal demographic studies [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref015">15</a>]. Such studies have already been widely used to inform management strategies to halt or slow down amphibian decline [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref010">10</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref016">16</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref022">22</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To begin to redress the paucity of population genetics studies of African amphibians, we focused on populations of frogs within the forests of the Nigerian Highlands of the Cameroon Volcanic Line [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref023">23</a>]. This is one of Africa’s biodiversity hotspots [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref024">24</a>] and hosts a rich diversity of amphibian species [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref025">25</a>]. Despite recognition as a center of biodiversity [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref026">26</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref027">27</a>], the diversity and ecology of amphibians in Nigeria’s mountains remain understudied [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref025">25</a>]. The montane forests on the Mambilla Plateau have been fragmented for a long time, hundreds of years at least. However, even 30 years ago there was more connectivity among the fragments [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref028">28</a>] and more likely the streamside forests were acting as corridors between larger forests. Within the last 30 years (HC, personal observation) there has been a dramatic increase in cattle, which first arrived on the Plateau in the 1950's [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref029">29</a>]. In addition to overgrazing by cattle, other threats to these forests include grass burning and land clearance for farming [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref030">30</a>]. We used this heavily modified landscape in Nigeria’s mountains as a context for studying how forest fragmentation and associated degradation impact population genetic structure in forest-associated frog species.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on previous surveys of Ngel Nyaki amphibians [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref025">25</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref031">31</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref032">32</a>], we selected two species from the anuran family Arthroleptidae that is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref033">33</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref037">37</a>]. Both species, 
  <span class="italic">Cardioglossa schioetzi</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Leptodactylodon bicolor</span>, are endemic to the montane forests of Cameroon and Nigeria, they are small (&lt;30 mm snout–vent length), have stream-adapted tadpoles, and live in leaf litter and rocky areas [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref037">37</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref039">39</a>]. Little information exists on the population biology of these species, such as for example, the distances over which individuals disperse. 
  <span class="italic">Cardioglossa schioetzi</span> occurs within small degraded riparian forests close to, but outside Ngel Nyaki Forest Reserve, as well as along the edge habitat of the continuous Ngel Nyaki forest (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202010.g001" href="#pone.0202010.g001">Fig 1</a>). In contrast, 
  <span class="italic">L</span>. 
  <span class="italic">bicolor</span> is common along rocky streams within the continuous forest, but is rarely found within riparian fragments (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202010.g001" href="#pone.0202010.g001">Fig 1</a>; [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref032">32</a>]). Both species are on the IUCN Threatened species list (
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">schioetzi</span>–Endangered; 
  <span class="italic">L</span>. 
  <span class="italic">bicolor</span>–Vulnerable [
  <a rid="pone.0202010.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202010.ref040">40</a>]) because of habitat degradation and the decline of remaining forest habitats on the mountains of Cameroon and Nigeria.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We aimed to determine levels of genetic diversity within and among populations of each species and use these data to assess levels of gene flow and connectivity among the populations within each species, in part to determine the extent to which grasslands act as a dispersal barrier for these species. Because its populations occur in fragments surrounded by heavily grazed grassland, we hypothesized that 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">schioetzi</span> would have less connectivity among populations and less genetic diversity than in
