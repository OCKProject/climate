 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The test for migration revealed that 53 of 80 individuals of 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">schioetzi</span> were immigrants or had ancestry in other populations in the past two generations. Migration between forest and riparian fragments was 40% (21 individuals) and between riparian fragments was 60% (32 individuals). In the case of 
  <span class="italic">L</span>. 
  <span class="italic">bicolor</span>, 78 of 118 (66%) were immigrants or had ancestry in other populations in the past two generations. Twenty-one (27%) individuals of 
  <span class="italic">L</span>. 
  <span class="italic">bicolor</span> were migrants between forest and riparian fragments, whereas 57 (73%) were between the populations within the continuous forest. Due to the fact that the tissue samples used in this study were toe clips from males (
  <span class="italic">Cardioglossa schioetzi</span>) and tadpole tails (
  <span class="italic">Leptodactylodon bicolor</span>), it was not possible to test if migration is biased by sex.
