  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The colour moult phenology analysis at the Gardiner site in two years that differed strongly in amount of snowpack indicated that drivers of this circannual trait, and plasticity across different snow years, were similar to our previous findings at the Seeley Lake study site [
   <a rid="RSPB20140029C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C13">13</a>]. The autumn moult for hares in the Gardiner site was fixed across 2011 and 2012 both for initiation date and rate of change (overlapping confidence intervals among initiation and completion dates; 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20140029F1" href="#RSPB20140029F1">figure 1</a>). For the spring moult, we detected plasticity in the rate of the white-to-brown moult. The completion date of the spring moult occurred 19 days later in 2011, consistent with the month longer snow duration in that year (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20140029F1" href="#RSPB20140029F1">figure 1</a>).

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analysis of the spring initiation date in the Gardiner site was compromised by a small sample size in spring 2012. Specifically, only three radiocollared hares were alive between 4 May and 30 May, as 16 out of 19 hares were depredated in April and early May, and new hares were not collared until early June (see the electronic supplementary material, S1). Thus, the model likely underestimated the initiation date of the spring 2012 moult, leading to the 95% credible intervals of initiation dates between the two years being separated by one day in timing (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20140029F1" href="#RSPB20140029F1">figure 1</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The limited sample size in spring 2012 also restricted our analysis of the effects of snow cover, temperature and sex on the rate of the spring moult in the Gardiner site by biasing model results. Thus, we combined the Gardiner site data and the Seeley Lake site data from springs 2010 to 2012 to test for the effects of the covariates on the spring moult rate using a larger sample size. Snow cover was negatively related to the rate of change, but the magnitude of the effect was small. A change from 100 to 0% snow shifted the average completion date of the spring moult by only three days (
   <span class="italic">β</span>
   <sub>Snow</sub> = 0.054, s.d. = 0.015). Temperature also had an effect on the rate of the moult, but the coat colour phenology model with temperature (degree days) as a covariate predicted that the span from 0 to 23.1°C (the highest daily average temperature during the spring moult period) explained only a one-day modification of the completion date of the spring moult (
   <span class="italic">β</span>
   <sub>Temp</sub> = 0.15, s.d. = 0.016). Lastly, when testing for the effects of sex on spring moult rate at the two sites, the sex-skewed spring data from the Gardiner site in 2012 positively biased the estimate. In spring 2012, five out of the seven hares observed to change to 5 or 0% white were females, which indicated that females completed the spring moult 14 days earlier than males. By contrast, omitting the Gardiner spring 2012 data resulted in a minimal influence of sex on the rate of the spring moult, with females completing the spring moult on average two days earlier than males (
   <span class="italic">β</span>
   <sub>Sex</sub> = −4.43, s.d. = 5.27).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We observed a large difference in the timing of the coat colour moult phenology between our two study sites. For each year, hares at the Gardiner site initiated autumn moults by one to two weeks earlier in the autumn and by a month later in the spring, corresponding to cooler temperatures and longer lasting snowpack in the Gardiner site. However, the duration of the colour moults was very similar across sites with autumn and spring moults lasting on average 39.9 days (s.d. = 3.22) and 41.9 days (s.d. = 7.00), respectively.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, our limited data for the seven individuals that were observed over multiple seasons at the Gardiner site also indicated no plasticity in the autumn but some in the spring rate of moult. According to the plots, reaction norms of the six hares that we observed over two disparate autumns displayed similar phenologies, differing by only 0–10 days between the two autumns (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20140029F2" href="#RSPB20140029F2">figure 2</a>
   <span class="italic">a</span>). By contrast, the one hare which was observed over two springs had moult phenologies that differed between springs by 15–20 days, comparable to the range of plasticity observed across all six individuals in the autumn moult (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Concealment</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Contrary to our predictions, hares did not seek higher concealment with increasing colour contrast; rather, the level of concealment was mostly affected by season and site. First, we detected habituation to human observers, as concealment began to significantly decrease with number of location attempts when hares were located more than nine times. Therefore, we truncated the dataset to include only the first nine observations per hare which yielded a total of 731 observations from 139 radiocollared individuals at the two sites. Each individual was observed an average of 6.4 occasions (s.d. = 2.9).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The best model included season, site and quadratic form of colour contrast at 1 m (see the electronic supplementary material, S2, for the set of best models tested). The other three best models included one additional term each: snow at 10 m, whiteness, and snow at 1 m (in order) that had positive effects on concealment, but their 95% HPD intervals included zero. The significant quadratic relationship of contrast on concealment was in the opposite direction than expected, with highest concealment at medium levels of positive colour contrast and reduced concealment at high negative and high positive contrasts (
   <span class="italic">β</span>
   <sub>Contrast</sub> = 0.0051, s.d. = 0.0021; 
   <span class="italic">β</span>
   <sub>Contrast</sub>
   <span class="sup">2</span> = −0.000085, s.d. = 0.000026; see the electronic supplementary materials, S3 and S4). Concealment varied seasonally, and hares were on average concealed by 25% more in the summer and 8% more in the autumn than in the winter, but not significantly different in the spring than in the winter. Concealment was significantly different at the two sites; hares at the Seeley Lake site were on average 11% more concealed than at the Gardiner site.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Flight initiation distance</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hares did not flee at farther distances with increasing mismatch as we predicted, but rather their concealment level, season and site variables played important roles in predicting their FID. We detected habituation to human observers, as FID began to significantly decrease with number of location attempts when hares were located more than five times. Therefore, we truncated the dataset to include only the first five observations per hare which yielded a total of 367 observations from 104 radiocollared individuals. Each individual was located on average 4.1 occasions (s.d. = 1.3).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our set of best models included concealment, site, season, sex and either contrast or mismatch (see the electronic supplementary material, S5, for the set of best models tested). The model results can be interpreted as the increase in probability of flight initiation throughout the distance within which we measured the FID response (=20 m). Our first, second and sixth best model included mismatch at 10 m. Hares matched with their background were 5.6 times more likely to flee than brown hares on snowy background (hazard ratio
   <sub>Negative Mismatch</sub> = 5.62, s.e. = 1.72), but there was no difference for white hares on brown background (hazard ratio
   <sub>Positive Mismatch</sub> = 1.62, s.e. = 1.39; see the electronic supplementary material, S6, for a list of coefficients from the best model). A similar trend was observed in the fourth and fifth best model that included absolute mismatch at 10 m scale, where matched hares were about two times (fourth best model: hazard ratio
   <sub>Abs Mismatch</sub> = 2.02, s.e. = 1.33; fifth best model: hazard ratio
   <sub>Abs Mismatch</sub> = 1.87, s.e. = 1.33) more likely to flee than mismatched hares. The third best model included a linear relationship with colour contrast at 1 m. Hares were 0.77% more likely to flee with each 1% decrement in colour contrast (hazard ratio
   <sub>Contrast</sub> = 1.01, s.e. = 1.00).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Concealment significantly decreased flight distance; with each 25% increment in body concealed hares were 26% less likely to flee. There was a significant difference in FID at the two sites; hares at the Gardiner site were 89% more likely to flee than hares at the Seeley Lake site. Season appeared in all best models but only summer was significantly different from winter; hares were 21% more likely to flee in summer than in winter. Sex was present in all best models as it improved model fit but was not significant in any of them. Similarly, snow at 1 m around hares and whiteness were present in three models of the best models set but their effects were not significant in any. According to the score tests and scatterplots of scaled Schoenfeld residuals, there was no evidence of non-proportional hazards in any of the terms in the best models.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Resting spots</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hares were not more likely to rest at spots within their immediate vicinity where colour contrast was reduced but instead preferred spots with relatively little snow. Colour contrast was an important predictor of presence but hares were located at spots that resulted in higher colour contrast relative to the available spots within 10-m radius of the hares (
   <span class="italic">β</span> = 0.0076, s.d. = 0.0022). Further, we found strong evidence that hares were more likely to be found at spots with less snow cover. The probability that a hare would be found at a spot with no snow cover was 3.92 times higher than at a spot with complete (100%) snow cover (
   <span class="italic">β</span> = −0.016, s.d. = 0.0019, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20140029F3" href="#RSPB20140029F3">figure 3</a>). The model which included snow cover received more support than the model including colour contrast (ΔAIC
