 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conducted our research at two sites in western Montana, USA, separated by approximately 330 km: the Seeley Lake study site (used in [
  <a rid="RSPB20140029C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C13">13</a>]) in the Lolo National Forest (Morrel Creek drainage) and the Gardiner study site in the Gallatin National Forest (Bear Creek drainage). The Gardiner study site is about twice as high in elevation (2400–2700 m.a.s.l.) as the Seeley Lake study site (1300–1450 m.a.s.l.). This elevation difference leads to cooler temperature and longer duration of snow cover in the Gardiner study site; snowpack persists at the Gardiner site from late October until May [
  <a rid="RSPB20140029C24" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C24">24</a>], compared to December to April at the Seeley Lake site [
  <a rid="RSPB20140029C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C13">13</a>]. The Seeley Lake site (Lat. = 47.23°, Long. = −113.43°) is 240 km further north than the Gardiner site (Lat. = 45.08°, Long. = −110.57°).
