 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test whether hares chose resting spots randomly with respect to colour contrast and snow cover, we fitted separate mixed effects models with fixed effects of colour contrast and snow cover. The models were fitted with binomial error distribution and a logit link function in R using the package lme4 [
  <a rid="RSPB20140029C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C29">29</a>]. The binomial dependent variable coded as one for the immediate resting spot (1 m) and zero for the eight other available ‘pie slices’ within the 10-m radius of the hare. The identity of individual hares and the date of when each hare was located were included as random effects to control for variation among individuals and to specify a nested design of the nine spots available to a hare at each location. We compared importance of the tested predictors using the statistical significance of the fixed effects slopes and the models’ AIC
