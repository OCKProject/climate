 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The colour moult phenology analysis at the Gardiner site in two years that differed strongly in amount of snowpack indicated that drivers of this circannual trait, and plasticity across different snow years, were similar to our previous findings at the Seeley Lake study site [
  <a rid="RSPB20140029C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C13">13</a>]. The autumn moult for hares in the Gardiner site was fixed across 2011 and 2012 both for initiation date and rate of change (overlapping confidence intervals among initiation and completion dates; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20140029F1" href="#RSPB20140029F1">figure 1</a>). For the spring moult, we detected plasticity in the rate of the white-to-brown moult. The completion date of the spring moult occurred 19 days later in 2011, consistent with the month longer snow duration in that year (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20140029F1" href="#RSPB20140029F1">figure 1</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analysis of the spring initiation date in the Gardiner site was compromised by a small sample size in spring 2012. Specifically, only three radiocollared hares were alive between 4 May and 30 May, as 16 out of 19 hares were depredated in April and early May, and new hares were not collared until early June (see the electronic supplementary material, S1). Thus, the model likely underestimated the initiation date of the spring 2012 moult, leading to the 95% credible intervals of initiation dates between the two years being separated by one day in timing (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20140029F1" href="#RSPB20140029F1">figure 1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The limited sample size in spring 2012 also restricted our analysis of the effects of snow cover, temperature and sex on the rate of the spring moult in the Gardiner site by biasing model results. Thus, we combined the Gardiner site data and the Seeley Lake site data from springs 2010 to 2012 to test for the effects of the covariates on the spring moult rate using a larger sample size. Snow cover was negatively related to the rate of change, but the magnitude of the effect was small. A change from 100 to 0% snow shifted the average completion date of the spring moult by only three days (
  <span class="italic">β</span>
  <sub>Snow</sub> = 0.054, s.d. = 0.015). Temperature also had an effect on the rate of the moult, but the coat colour phenology model with temperature (degree days) as a covariate predicted that the span from 0 to 23.1°C (the highest daily average temperature during the spring moult period) explained only a one-day modification of the completion date of the spring moult (
  <span class="italic">β</span>
  <sub>Temp</sub> = 0.15, s.d. = 0.016). Lastly, when testing for the effects of sex on spring moult rate at the two sites, the sex-skewed spring data from the Gardiner site in 2012 positively biased the estimate. In spring 2012, five out of the seven hares observed to change to 5 or 0% white were females, which indicated that females completed the spring moult 14 days earlier than males. By contrast, omitting the Gardiner spring 2012 data resulted in a minimal influence of sex on the rate of the spring moult, with females completing the spring moult on average two days earlier than males (
  <span class="italic">β</span>
  <sub>Sex</sub> = −4.43, s.d. = 5.27).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We observed a large difference in the timing of the coat colour moult phenology between our two study sites. For each year, hares at the Gardiner site initiated autumn moults by one to two weeks earlier in the autumn and by a month later in the spring, corresponding to cooler temperatures and longer lasting snowpack in the Gardiner site. However, the duration of the colour moults was very similar across sites with autumn and spring moults lasting on average 39.9 days (s.d. = 3.22) and 41.9 days (s.d. = 7.00), respectively.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, our limited data for the seven individuals that were observed over multiple seasons at the Gardiner site also indicated no plasticity in the autumn but some in the spring rate of moult. According to the plots, reaction norms of the six hares that we observed over two disparate autumns displayed similar phenologies, differing by only 0–10 days between the two autumns (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20140029F2" href="#RSPB20140029F2">figure 2</a>
  <span class="italic">a</span>). By contrast, the one hare which was observed over two springs had moult phenologies that differed between springs by 15–20 days, comparable to the range of plasticity observed across all six individuals in the autumn moult (
