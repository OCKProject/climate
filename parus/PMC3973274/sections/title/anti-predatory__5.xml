 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We evaluated behaviour of each located hare at both sites. For hares stationary at a resting spot, we visually estimated concealment as the percentage of the hare's body hidden by vegetation at four levels (1 = 0–25% of body concealed to 4 = 75–100% concealed), from the direction from which the hare was initially sighted and from a low angle (approx. 1 m above ground, mimicking the view of common mammalian carnivores). To estimate FID, observers approached a hare at a consistent walking pace (approximately 0.5 m s
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) until the hare fled or the observer was within 3 m of the hare. We used a digital laser rangefinder (Leupold, Beaverton, OR, USA) to estimate FID to the nearest metre. We used a minimum approach distance of 3 m to minimize disturbance to the hare; hares that did not flush at the 3-m distance were recorded as ‘no flush’ and were not disturbed further. The maximum distance at which we were able to estimate distance reliably in the forest was 20 m.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, we tested whether hares randomly chose spots to rest with respect to minimizing colour contrast or snow presence in their immediate vicinity. We estimated percentage of snow cover (20% increments) at eight, non-overlapping subsections of the 10-m radius circle around each hare by photographing the ground from where the hare rested at each cardinal and inter-cardinal direction to create eight ‘pie slices’. Snow cover and colour contrast at these eight ‘available’ spots were compared to that in the 1-m radius immediately surrounding the hare's resting spot; we excluded from analysis resting spots where all subsections and the resting spot were entirely snow-covered or snow-free, as these cases provided no information on whether the chosen resting spot differed from the surroundings. Our final sample sizes for this analysis yielded a total of 251 observations from 77 individual hares.</p>
