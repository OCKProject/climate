We monitored 51 hares (32 different hares in 2011, and 31 in 2012) at the Gardiner study site and 148 hares (43 different hares in 2010, 63 in 2011 and 58 in 2012) at the Seeley Lake study site. The percentage of white coat colour (% whiteness) and the percentage of ground snow cover within 1- and 10-m radii circles centred at each hare's resting spot (% snow cover) were visually estimated in 20% increments with a standardized protocol of observation and photographs to control for light conditions and distance. All final percentages were visually estimated by a single observer using primarily the photographs, and secondarily the field visual estimates when the quality of the photograph was insufficient, did not show the whole hare's body, or the photograph was absent. We classified animals that just initiated or nearly completed the moult as 5 or 95% white. We measured colour contrast as the difference between per cent whiteness of the hare and the per cent snow cover. It is not known at which scale crypsis may be perceived by either prey or predators; thus, we measured colour contrast within the 1- and 10-m radii circles. We chose these radii because we felt that they were reasonable approximations of the finest and coarsest scales at which crypsis could be effective (i.e. crypsis would be completely ineffective at less than 1 m and completely effective at more than 10 m). A positive contrast indicated a white hare on a non-snowy background, whereas a negative value indicated a brown hare on a snowy background. We considered a hare mismatched when the absolute difference (here referred to as contrast) between its coat colour and background was at least 60% (see [
  <a rid="RSPB20140029C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C13">13</a>] for consideration of other thresholds), as at this threshold hares began to clearly stand out against their surroundings.
