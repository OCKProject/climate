 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phenological shifts in plant and animal populations have been linked widely to climate change [
  <a rid="RSPB20140029C1" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C1">1</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20140029C2" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C2">2</a>]. Pressing questions of interest include how these phenological shifts link mechanistically to climate variables and whether the observed shifts are adaptive. Although evolution by natural selection is a possible means of adaptation, the most immediate adaptive solution to the rapid pace of climate change is phenotypic plasticity [
  <a rid="RSPB20140029C3" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C3">3</a>], the range of phenotypes expressed by a genotype in different environmental conditions. In some cases, plasticity in circannual behaviour and other traits has explained most of the observed change in phenology [
  <a rid="RSPB20140029C4" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C4">4</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20140029C5" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C5">5</a>] and has been shown to maintain or increase fitness [
  <a rid="RSPB20140029C6" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C6">6</a>]. For instance, plasticity in phenology of egg laying in a population of great tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) in the United Kingdom was adaptive in minimizing phenological mismatch with food sources, thereby maintaining population growth [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Snowshoe hares (
  <span class="italic">Lepus americanus</span>), and at least nine other mammal species globally, undergo seasonal moults to a white or brown coat to match the presence or absence of snow. Background matching is a crypsis strategy that reduces risk of detection by predators [
  <a rid="RSPB20140029C8" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C8">8</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20140029C9" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C9">9</a>]. In recent decades, persistence of snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased owing to increased air temperatures and more precipitation falling as rain instead of snow [
  <a rid="RSPB20140029C10" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C10">10</a>–
  <a rid="RSPB20140029C12" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C12">12</a>]. In a recent study of the mistiming between presence of ground snow cover and seasonal colour moults in snowshoe hares, strong background mismatch was documented during spring and autumn, and predicted to greatly increase in the future [
  <a rid="RSPB20140029C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C13">13</a>]. White animals on non-snowy backgrounds are extremely conspicuous and would appear to be easier to detect by a predator that hunts visually. Both individual behaviours and population dynamics of hares are overwhelmingly shaped by predation, which can comprise 85–100% of mortality [
  <a rid="RSPB20140029C14" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C14">14</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Snowshoe hares might be able to minimize fitness costs of seasonal mismatch in camouflage through plasticity in the phenology of coat colour moults. Timing of moult in autumn and spring is presumably initiated by photoperiod, but temperature and possibly presence of snow may affect the rate of the change [
  <a rid="RSPB20140029C15" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C15">15</a>–
  <a rid="RSPB20140029C17" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C17">17</a>]. Mills 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a rid="RSPB20140029C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C13">13</a>] showed average timing of the autumn and spring moult in snowshoe hares in Montana to be fixed across years with disparate snow cover, with some plasticity in the rate of spring moult, once the white-to-brown transition had been initiated.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Separate from or in combination with phenological shifts, hares might be able to modify their behaviour to minimize the mismatch of coat colour or its potential costs. Snowshoe hares rely strongly on their crypsis to avoid predation, with minimal attempts at hiding in vegetation resulting in low concealment. In contrast to other lagomorphs in the region that stay brown during the winter (i.e. mountain cottontails (
  <span class="italic">Sylvilagus nuttallii</span>) or pikas (
  <span class="italic">Ochotona princeps</span>)), snowshoe hares do not build burrows for escape underground. Rather, during the day, hares sit completely still at a resting spot and do not flee until immediate danger arises. Intuitively, this strategy is maladaptive when selection of a resting spot results in mismatch between coat colour and background. Steen 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a rid="RSPB20140029C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C18">18</a>] observed that willow ptarmigans (
  <span class="italic">Lagopus lagopus</span>) moulting from white to brown plumage during snow melt fed in areas that matched their coloration, even though areas selected for optimal crypsis often offered less nutritious food. Similarly, hares could be resting during the day at spots where background colour is similar to their coat colour, and thus reduces colour contrast. Whether hares are able to recognize their coat colour and choose resting spots that match it is not known. Alternatively, mismatched hares might achieve effective camouflage by selecting resting spots associated with cover provided by dense understory, trees or rocks, as suggested by [
  <a rid="RSPB20140029C19" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C19">19</a>]. Finally, because hares rely on both crypsis and flight, mismatched hares may increase the distance at which they flee when approached by a predator [
  <a rid="RSPB20140029C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C20">20</a>]. Crypsis in prey species decreases the risk perceived by an animal and consequently can decrease flight initiation distance (FID) [
  <a rid="RSPB20140029C21" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C21">21</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20140029C22" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C22">22</a>]. For example, round-tailed horned lizards (
  <span class="italic">Phrynosoma modestum</span>), whose colouring resembles small stones, displayed shorter FIDs on rocky substrates than on uniform sand, likely as a response to higher crypsis among rocks [
  <a rid="RSPB20140029C23" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C23">23</a>]. Similarly, hares mismatched to their background might perceive higher predation risk and flee sooner (longer FID).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we provide an evaluation of the adaptive potential of snowshoe hares to minimize negative effects of colour mismatch through phenotypic plasticity in moult phenology and behaviour. Mills 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a rid="RSPB20140029C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C13">13</a>] found little plasticity in seasonal coat colour change at a single study site (Seeley Lake, MT, USA). We extend that investigation to a second site which differed considerably in climate and photoperiod and compare moult phenologies at both sites. Next, we analyse at both sites variables influencing moult phenology and explore reaction norms in moult phenology. Lastly, we examine whether anti-predatory behaviours are being modified in response to colour mismatch and consequently evaluate whether behavioural plasticity may ameliorate negative effects of colour mismatch.
