  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conducted our research at two sites in western Montana, USA, separated by approximately 330 km: the Seeley Lake study site (used in [
   <a rid="RSPB20140029C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C13">13</a>]) in the Lolo National Forest (Morrel Creek drainage) and the Gardiner study site in the Gallatin National Forest (Bear Creek drainage). The Gardiner study site is about twice as high in elevation (2400–2700 m.a.s.l.) as the Seeley Lake study site (1300–1450 m.a.s.l.). This elevation difference leads to cooler temperature and longer duration of snow cover in the Gardiner study site; snowpack persists at the Gardiner site from late October until May [
   <a rid="RSPB20140029C24" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C24">24</a>], compared to December to April at the Seeley Lake site [
   <a rid="RSPB20140029C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C13">13</a>]. The Seeley Lake site (Lat. = 47.23°, Long. = −113.43°) is 240 km further north than the Gardiner site (Lat. = 45.08°, Long. = −110.57°).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both sites are temperate boreal coniferous forest on US Forest Service lands with little to no permanent human habitation, and logging being the primary land use. Common predators of hares in these sites include Canada lynx (
   <span class="italic">Lynx canadensis</span>), bobcat (
   <span class="italic">Lynx rufus</span>), coyote (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the Gardiner site, we applied the methods used by Mills 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
   <a rid="RSPB20140029C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C13">13</a>] at the Seeley Lake site, of visually locating hares weekly using radiotelemetry to quantify coat colour phenology and colour contrast between hares and their background. We monitored 51 hares (32 different hares in 2011, and 31 in 2012) at the Gardiner study site and 148 hares (43 different hares in 2010, 63 in 2011 and 58 in 2012) at the Seeley Lake study site. The percentage of white coat colour (% whiteness) and the percentage of ground snow cover within 1- and 10-m radii circles centred at each hare's resting spot (% snow cover) were visually estimated in 20% increments with a standardized protocol of observation and photographs to control for light conditions and distance. All final percentages were visually estimated by a single observer using primarily the photographs, and secondarily the field visual estimates when the quality of the photograph was insufficient, did not show the whole hare's body, or the photograph was absent. We classified animals that just initiated or nearly completed the moult as 5 or 95% white. We measured colour contrast as the difference between per cent whiteness of the hare and the per cent snow cover. It is not known at which scale crypsis may be perceived by either prey or predators; thus, we measured colour contrast within the 1- and 10-m radii circles. We chose these radii because we felt that they were reasonable approximations of the finest and coarsest scales at which crypsis could be effective (i.e. crypsis would be completely ineffective at less than 1 m and completely effective at more than 10 m). A positive contrast indicated a white hare on a non-snowy background, whereas a negative value indicated a brown hare on a snowy background. We considered a hare mismatched when the absolute difference (here referred to as contrast) between its coat colour and background was at least 60% (see [
   <a rid="RSPB20140029C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C13">13</a>] for consideration of other thresholds), as at this threshold hares began to clearly stand out against their surroundings.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Anti-predatory behaviours</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We evaluated behaviour of each located hare at both sites. For hares stationary at a resting spot, we visually estimated concealment as the percentage of the hare's body hidden by vegetation at four levels (1 = 0–25% of body concealed to 4 = 75–100% concealed), from the direction from which the hare was initially sighted and from a low angle (approx. 1 m above ground, mimicking the view of common mammalian carnivores). To estimate FID, observers approached a hare at a consistent walking pace (approximately 0.5 m s
   <span class="sup">−1</span>) until the hare fled or the observer was within 3 m of the hare. We used a digital laser rangefinder (Leupold, Beaverton, OR, USA) to estimate FID to the nearest metre. We used a minimum approach distance of 3 m to minimize disturbance to the hare; hares that did not flush at the 3-m distance were recorded as ‘no flush’ and were not disturbed further. The maximum distance at which we were able to estimate distance reliably in the forest was 20 m.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, we tested whether hares randomly chose spots to rest with respect to minimizing colour contrast or snow presence in their immediate vicinity. We estimated percentage of snow cover (20% increments) at eight, non-overlapping subsections of the 10-m radius circle around each hare by photographing the ground from where the hare rested at each cardinal and inter-cardinal direction to create eight ‘pie slices’. Snow cover and colour contrast at these eight ‘available’ spots were compared to that in the 1-m radius immediately surrounding the hare's resting spot; we excluded from analysis resting spots where all subsections and the resting spot were entirely snow-covered or snow-free, as these cases provided no information on whether the chosen resting spot differed from the surroundings. Our final sample sizes for this analysis yielded a total of 251 observations from 77 individual hares.</p>

    <a rid="RSPB20140029C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C13">13</a>]), and to test for the effects of snow, temperature and sex on moult phenology at both sites. We assessed temperature as the rate of seasonal cooling in the autumn and warming in the spring; we calculated degree days for each day as the cumulative sum of mean temperature below 0°C in the autumn (September–December) and above 0°C in the spring (March–June).

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We were able to document individual moult phenology over more than 1 autumn or spring moult for none of the hares at the Seeley Lake site and only seven individuals in the Gardiner site due to the high mortality rates typical of snowshoe hares [

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test whether hares adjusted hiding behaviour to increase concealment in response to colour contrast, we fitted linear mixed effects models in software R v. 2.15.2 [
    <a rid="RSPB20140029C28" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C28">28</a>] using the package lme4 [
    <a rid="RSPB20140029C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C29">29</a>]. We included the identity of individual hares as a random effect to control for variation among individuals. We included the fixed effects of coat colour (per cent whiteness), snow cover around hares (at 1- and 10-m radius), coat colour contrast (at 1- and 10-m radius; ranging from −100 to 100), coat colour mismatch (at 1- and 10-m radius), site, sex and season. Coat colour mismatch was a categorical variable distinguishing between positive (white hare on brown background: contrast ≥ 60), negative (brown hare on white background: contrast ≤ −60) and no mismatch (−60 &lt; contrast &lt; 60). Further, to examine whether the two different types of contrast and mismatch (positive and negative) had equivalent effects, we established an absolute contrast covariate (ranging from 0 to 100) and a binary categorical covariate for absolute mismatch (mismatch: contrast ≤ −60 and contrast ≥ 60 versus no mismatch: −60 &lt; contrast &lt; 60). In addition to linear terms, we used quadratic terms to allow for the possibility of a curvilinear response of concealment to contrast. We differentiated seasons separately for the two sites based on local climate (Seeley Lake: winter (December–March), spring (April–May), summer (June–August), autumn (September–November); Gardiner: winter (November–April), spring (May–June), summer (July–August), autumn (September–October)).

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because hare whiteness and snow cover at both the 1- and 10-m radius around hares were highly correlated for most of the year (
    <span class="italic">r</span> ≥ 0.8), we considered each separately in model construction. Whiteness and contrast as well as snow cover and contrast were not highly correlated (
    <span class="italic">r</span> ≤ 0.1 and 
    <span class="italic">r</span> ≥ −0.5, respectively) and so were both present in some models. To test for habituation in hiding behaviour to human observers, we ran a univariate linear mixed model, with concealment as a function of number of location attempts per hare (including unsuccessful sightings) and individual hares coded as random effects to control for variation among individuals.
