 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test whether hares adjusted hiding behaviour to increase concealment in response to colour contrast, we fitted linear mixed effects models in software R v. 2.15.2 [
  <a rid="RSPB20140029C28" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C28">28</a>] using the package lme4 [
  <a rid="RSPB20140029C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C29">29</a>]. We included the identity of individual hares as a random effect to control for variation among individuals. We included the fixed effects of coat colour (per cent whiteness), snow cover around hares (at 1- and 10-m radius), coat colour contrast (at 1- and 10-m radius; ranging from −100 to 100), coat colour mismatch (at 1- and 10-m radius), site, sex and season. Coat colour mismatch was a categorical variable distinguishing between positive (white hare on brown background: contrast ≥ 60), negative (brown hare on white background: contrast ≤ −60) and no mismatch (−60 &lt; contrast &lt; 60). Further, to examine whether the two different types of contrast and mismatch (positive and negative) had equivalent effects, we established an absolute contrast covariate (ranging from 0 to 100) and a binary categorical covariate for absolute mismatch (mismatch: contrast ≤ −60 and contrast ≥ 60 versus no mismatch: −60 &lt; contrast &lt; 60). In addition to linear terms, we used quadratic terms to allow for the possibility of a curvilinear response of concealment to contrast. We differentiated seasons separately for the two sites based on local climate (Seeley Lake: winter (December–March), spring (April–May), summer (June–August), autumn (September–November); Gardiner: winter (November–April), spring (May–June), summer (July–August), autumn (September–October)).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because hare whiteness and snow cover at both the 1- and 10-m radius around hares were highly correlated for most of the year (
  <span class="italic">r</span> ≥ 0.8), we considered each separately in model construction. Whiteness and contrast as well as snow cover and contrast were not highly correlated (
  <span class="italic">r</span> ≤ 0.1 and 
  <span class="italic">r</span> ≥ −0.5, respectively) and so were both present in some models. To test for habituation in hiding behaviour to human observers, we ran a univariate linear mixed model, with concealment as a function of number of location attempts per hare (including unsuccessful sightings) and individual hares coded as random effects to control for variation among individuals.

The precision of model parameters was based on a sample (100 000 iterations) from the posterior distribution of the fixed effects parameters using a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach (function mcmcsamp) to determine whether the 95% highest posterior density (HPD) intervals included zero.
