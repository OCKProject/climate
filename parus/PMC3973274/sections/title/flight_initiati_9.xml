 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used Cox proportional hazards regression [
  <a rid="RSPB20140029C31" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C31">31</a>] to test whether FID increased with colour mismatch. Our data were a form of time-to-event data, with flight the event of interest and observations with no flight response at the maximum approaching distance of 3 m classified as right-censored data. We fitted the models using the package survival [
  <a rid="RSPB20140029C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C32">32</a>] in R. We included the same covariates and potential correlations among them as in the previous analysis: whiteness, snow cover around hares, colour contrast (regular and absolute), colour mismatch (regular and absolute), site, sex, season and concealment. We also tested for potential habituation in FID behaviour as in the previous analysis. The proportional hazard assumption was tested using score test and scatterplots of scaled Schoenfeld residuals. We selected a set of best models (within 2 Î”AIC
