 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used a mixed effects change point analysis to estimate the population mean initiation and completion dates of coat colour change phenology in the Gardiner site (as previously done for the Seeley Lake site [
  <a rid="RSPB20140029C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C13">13</a>]), and to test for the effects of snow, temperature and sex on moult phenology at both sites. We assessed temperature as the rate of seasonal cooling in the autumn and warming in the spring; we calculated degree days for each day as the cumulative sum of mean temperature below 0°C in the autumn (September–December) and above 0°C in the spring (March–June).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We were able to document individual moult phenology over more than 1 autumn or spring moult for none of the hares at the Seeley Lake site and only seven individuals in the Gardiner site due to the high mortality rates typical of snowshoe hares [
  <a rid="RSPB20140029C25" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C25">25</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20140029C27" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20140029C27">27</a>] and due to incomplete detection. We plotted coat colour observations over time of those seven individuals for visual assessment of the reaction norm (range of phenotypes produced by a particular genotype in different environmental conditions) in the moult phenology.
