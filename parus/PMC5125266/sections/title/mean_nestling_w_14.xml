 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Model building generated a subset of 29 models (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t3" href="#t3">Table 3</a>). As expected due to the differences in species size, species was a highly influencing variable in mean nestling weight, being present in all the models (Σωi = 1.00). Year was present in all the models as well, because nestlings were heavier in 2013 (

Also, RWD was present in all the models; however, its interaction with species was highly influential (Σωi = 0.91), as the larger the RWD, the lower the mean weight, but being more pronounced in the case of great tits (
