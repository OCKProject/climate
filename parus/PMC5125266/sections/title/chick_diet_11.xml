 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, we recorded a total of 3209 feeding trips, 73.6% of which were Lepidoptera larvae, accounting for 78.4% of the total biomass. Within Lepidoptera families, noctuids represented 63.7% and tortricids 15.2% of the total biomass. Geometrids only accounted for 6.6% of the total biomass.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The modelling approach provided a set of 21 models (whose weights summed ≥0.95) to explain the biomass of noctuids in the nestling diet (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>). Our results did not lend definitive support to any of these models due to the relatively small differences in AICc values (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>). Importantly, however, most models included the year (Σωi = 0.99), as the biomass of noctuids in nestling diet was greater in 2012 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1a</a>). Also influential were species (Σωi = 0.91) and noctuid availability (Σωi = 0.79). Nevertheless, their iteration was influential as well (Σωi = 0.45), as feeding with noctuids by blue tits was positively determined by their availability in the field, but this was not the case in great tits (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">None of the potential predictor variables influenced nestling feeding with tortricids, as the null model was the one with the lowest AICc, not including any variable, and having a weight of 0.67 (
