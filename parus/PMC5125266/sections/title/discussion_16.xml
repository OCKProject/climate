 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By comparing two sympatric species, our findings suggest that differences previously found in HA levels in comparative reviews of single-species studies
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" href="#b9">9</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" href="#b10">10</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" href="#b29">29</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b45" href="#b45">45</a> could be related to more generalist or more specialist foraging strategies of the studied species. Namely, specialists like great tits would rely more intensely on HA, whereas more generalist birds, such as blue tits, would take advantage of their flexible feeding capabilities to cope with food unpredictability, thus avoiding HA. Our results should be interpreted with some caution as trophic generalist species may include specialized individuals consistently feeding on certain resources
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" href="#b46">46</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ecosystems are often highly variable from one year to another, and species with short life expectancies, such as small passerines, must adjust their breeding timing to these unstable conditions
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" href="#b3">3</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" href="#b6">6</a>. These species need mechanisms to cope with environmental unpredictability, especially with respect to changes in food availability, which determines their breeding performance
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" href="#b5">5</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" href="#b31">31</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" href="#b40">40</a>. The variety of shapes in the curves of caterpillar availability in our study highlights both the temporal and spatial unpredictability of food availability that tits must face. For instance, our study area underwent unusual snowfalls at the beginning of May 2013, which stopped leaf development, and, in turn, modified caterpillar availability. One mechanism that has been proposed for birds to cope with this uncertainty is HA. HA creates a hierarchy of sizes among the nestlings that ensures the survival of larger nestlings when food is running short, while smaller nestlings die, rather than compromising the survival of the whole brood
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" href="#b8">8</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" href="#b12">12</a>. However, smaller nestlings can also survive if food provisioning is ultimately sufficient
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" href="#b13">13</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" href="#b14">14</a>. Our results suggest that foraging efficiency is a suitable alternative to HA as those species (or individuals) that are better foragers could compensate for future food shortages, and would not need to resort to HA. Blue tits were more efficient foragers because they consistently increased the biomass of noctuids in the nestling diet when these prey were more available in the field, whereas great tits did not. Also, RWD caused a greater impact on mean nestling weight in great tits (i.e., their broods were more heterogeneous, lowering the smallest chicks the overall mean), showing lower fledging rates. In other words, blue tits, but not great tits, showed compensatory feeding, thus minimizing the impact of nestling size hierarchy produced by HA. In a previous study, we found that blue tits, but not great tits, showed compensatory investment in larger broods by increasing the feeding rate with suboptimal prey
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">34</a>. Indeed, blue tits fed with smaller prey, more frequently, and with higher prey diversity
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">34</a>, see also ref. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">32</a>. All of these traits correspond to a generalist foraging strategy. Monitoring feeding rates was key to determining how blue tits compensated for HA, as some experiments that tested the role of food provisioning in HA stopped the 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">supplementary feeding</a> before incubation started (e.g., refs 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" href="#b12">12</a> and 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">15</a>). Plastic responses are vital when evolution is insufficient to keep track of environmental changes, and can help species to counter stressful conditions
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" href="#b47">47</a>. Our results suggest that both HA and compensatory feeding can be suitable responses to the new selection pressures originated by climate change. As commented above, the existence of unstable environmental conditions is one of the reasons suggested to be behind HA
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" href="#b8">8</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" href="#b11">11</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" href="#b12">12</a>. On the other hand, it is widely assumed that ecological generalists are less vulnerable to environmental changes, and less affected by changes in resources availability compared to their specialist counterparts
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b48" href="#b48">48</a>. This is the case of the response of Darwin’s tree finches (
  <span class="italic">Camarhynchus spp</span>.) to dry years (i.e., conditions of resource scarcity), which varied with their trophic status, as generalist species were even more generalized during periods of food shortage, while the specialist species become even more specialized
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b49" href="#b49">49</a>. Also, penguin species with broader foraging niche has been found to respond better (i.e., population increase) to rapidly changing environmental conditions than their sister species with narrower niche (i.e., population decrease) in sympatric populations
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b50" href="#b50">50</a>. Finally, climate change is occurring at a time when forests are becoming increasingly fragmented through habitat destruction
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" href="#b47">47</a>, and individuals occupying suboptimal patches could evolve in a particular ways (e.g., being smaller
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b51" href="#b51">51</a>). These could be interesting topics for future studies.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results suggest that great tits likely resort to HA because they are not able to improve their feeding efficiency to respond to environmental variability as blue tits do (see also refs 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">32</a> and 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">34</a>). However, the foraging flexibility shown by the latter could be not enough at the end of season, when caterpillar availability diminishes because they pupate
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" href="#b5">5</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" href="#b6">6</a>. The increase in HA as the season advanced was a common pattern in several studies, based on the reduction of resource availability with date
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" href="#b16">16</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" href="#b17">17</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">18</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">19</a>. This pattern aligns with the expectations of both the BRH and the HUH, as the costs of synchrony are particularly high under the poor environmental conditions that typically affect late broods, reducing nestling survival
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">15</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" href="#b16">16</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">19</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The response to food availability was, however, similar between blue and great tits in some respects. The biomass of noctuids delivered to the nestlings was more than four times that of tortricids. Noctuid caterpillars are larger, juicy, allow for fewer feeding trips, and are related to higher nestling weight
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" href="#b5">5</a>. This makes them ideal prey for central place foragers like tits, as birds can maximize foraging rates by reducing the trips to and from a nest. On the contrary, tits did not track tortricid availability, as this did not influence the delivery rates of caterpillars of this family to the nestlings, even during the 2013 outbreak, when tortricid abundance was three times that of 2012, and noctuid abundance was low. This underrepresentation of tortricids in the nestling diet has previously been observed in other Mediterranean oak woods, and seems related to their inferior nutritional quality
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" href="#b5">5</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The hierarchies caused by HA were maintained throughout the whole nestling period, as found in other works
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" href="#b12">12</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">19</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b52" href="#b52">52</a>. The influence of tortricids in nestling parameters was limited. Although nestling mean weight as well as fledging rate increased during the tortricid outbreak in 2013, tits were not able to compensate for the size gradient due to the HA simply by increasing the feeding rate with these suboptimal prey. Consequently, the HA (and the RWD) negatively affected the fledging rate
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">18</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">19</a>, but see refs 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" href="#b16">16</a> and 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" href="#b35">35</a>. Despite nestling mortality was low (overall 8% in blue tits and 7% in great tits; lower than in other studies with tits: 19–21%
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" href="#b16">16</a> or 16–22%
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b53" href="#b53">53</a>; see also ref. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" href="#b35">35</a>), those nestlings that died were likely the smallest ones
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">18</a>. The reason for the lower nestling mortality in our populations could be their smaller brood sizes compared with those studies from northern populations. This, in turn, seems to be related to the low egg hatchability due to understory overgrazing, what could affect the abundance of snails, the main source of calcium for the eggshell in our study region
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b54" href="#b54">54</a>. Although it could be interesting to repeat our approach with higher levels of chick mortality, we are confident that these do not constrain our findings, as our sympatric species showed similar levels of nesting mortality but presented different strategies (HA 
  <span class="italic">vs</span>. foraging efficiency).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some authors
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">19</a> have suggested that those blue tits with larger HA were late breeders, and altogether worse birds (younger, worse competitors), implying that HA is not deliberate. However, female age did not influence HA in our study population (the same applies to great tits), thus not supporting the idea that HA is linked to suboptimal females (see also ref. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">21</a>; but see ref. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b53" href="#b53">53</a>). Nevertheless, we acknowledge that we only discriminated two age classes. Thus, these findings should be treated with caution. In their study with pied flycatchers 
  <span class="italic">Fycedula hypoleuca</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" href="#b11">11</a>, these authors found that yearling females did hatch more synchronously, which they interpreted as a result of energy constraints occurring at laying time
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">18</a>. The asynchronous hatching in yearling Eurasian kestrels 
  <span class="italic">Falco tinnunculus</span> has been suggested as a voluntary adjustment to their lower ability for food provisioning
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">25</a>. Finally, female mass did not influence our results, rejecting the idea that the incapacity to manage large broods
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">19</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" href="#b41">41</a> plays a role in our results.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If HA is adaptive, it should lead to heavier nestlings, reducing fledging rate due to the mortality of smaller chicks (the ‘offspring quality assurance hypothesis’
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" href="#b16">16</a>; see also ref. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">18</a>). However, in our study, HA reduced fledging rates in both species, but did not increase mean body weight, but rather quite the contrary. Our results showed that RWD (closely related to HA) reduced the mean nestling weight, mainly in great tits. In enlarged great tit broods
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" href="#b35">35</a>, found similar results, as did
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b55" href="#b55">55</a> after manipulating HA in Eurasian kestrels, although only in food-limited years. In our study years, caterpillars were less abundant than, for instance, in 2011 (unpub. data). Despite the poor environmental conditions, many small nestlings survived, which surely reduced brood mean weight. The body mass at fledging positively predicts post-fledging survival and recruitment in tits
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" href="#b16">16</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b56" href="#b56">56</a>. Despite the fact that HA does not seem to be adaptive for fledglings, it may still be adaptive for their parents if: (i) with the progression of the season, this best-of-a-bad-job provides higher fitness than losing the entire brood due to trying to get ahead with synchronic fledglings when food availability decreases
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" href="#b8">8</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" href="#b12">12</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">18</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">19</a>; (ii) chicks die earlier in asynchronous than in synchronous broods, and thus parents can save energy expenditures not feeding chicks that are likely to die anyway
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" href="#b9">9</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">19</a>, but see ref. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b52" href="#b52">52</a>; or, (iii) HA reduces year-to-year variance in parental fitness via offspring recruitment
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b53" href="#b53">53</a>. Finally, we cannot discard the idea that some physiological, environmental or other factors constrained incubation behavior, and thus influenced HA
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">18</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">19</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b57" href="#b57">57</a>. Once nestlings hatched, other constraints like food allocation among nestlings of different sizes could also influence their growth and mortality
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b58" href="#b58">58</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several sources of evidence support our findings that blue tits are opportunistic species, with a better ability to track environmental variability than great tits: (i) blue tits were more synchronized with vegetation green-up and more strongly influenced by local habitat quality than great tits
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" href="#b3">3</a>; as noted above (ii), blue tits showed generalist feeding habits, with a higher feeding rate, providing smaller prey, and with higher prey diversity than great tits
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">32</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">34</a>; (iii) seasonal movements are a major component of opportunistic species population dynamics, easily responding to environmental fluctuations
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b59" href="#b59">59</a>. Blue tits, but not great tits, responded to warmer winters by decreasing their displacement distances, as closer proximity to the breeding grounds in winter allows better prediction of the spring onset; blue tits also showed a stronger advancement of laying date than great tits
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b60" href="#b60">60</a>; (iv) age of first reproduction is earlier in generalist species, or, in other words, specialists postpone their reproduction
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b59" href="#b59">59</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b61" href="#b61">61</a>. Clutch size, nesting success, brood size and juvenile survival all decreased earlier in blue tits than in great tits; that is, females became old earlier in the former species
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b62" href="#b62">62</a>; (v) generalists do not compete and do not become dominant
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b59" href="#b59">59</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b61" href="#b61">61</a>. In a previous work, we showed that great tits outcompeted blue tits for nest-holes, with some aggressions even leading to blue tit death
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" href="#b36">36</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In sum, our study explored for the first time the natural levels of HA in two sympatric species in relation to food abundance and nestling provisioning. Our findings add to the evidence that there is no single pressure influencing HA in all bird species, as patterns of HA –and, consequently, nestling size hierarchy or fledging rate - differed depending on the degree of specialist/generalist feeding at the species level. They also highlight the importance of simultaneously studying more than one species when analyzing the response of animal populations to a shared, variable environment.</p>
