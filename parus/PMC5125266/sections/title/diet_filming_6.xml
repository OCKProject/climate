 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We filmed 124 nests (63 in 2012, 61 in 2013), 85 (45 and 40, respectively) of them belonging to blue tits and 39 (18 and 21) to great tits. When nestlings were 10 days old (i.e., 24 h before the filming day), we placed a wooden housing fixed to the back of the nest-box facing the entrance hole to allow birds to habituate to the future presence of the camera (Sony DCR-SR-type or HDR-XR550, all of them equipped with Night-shot system
  <span class="sup">TM</span>). When nestlings were 11 days, feeding was recorded with the video camera installed inside the housing, following the protocol described in refs 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" href="#b5">5</a> and 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">38</a>. To control for filming ‘hour’, this variable was included in the analyses (see below). The first 60 minutes of each film were discarded to exclude potential disturbance effects on adult behavior from the camera placing. We studied the diet in the following 60 minutes as described in refs 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" href="#b5">5</a> and 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">38</a>. Recordings were played and analysed frame-by-frame using the software Adobe Premiere Elements 7.0. We used a reference collection with prey sampled in the field to identify the images. Food items from a total of 3209 feeding trips were identified following categories defined in ref. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">34</a>. However, we focused on the larvae of two Lepidoptera families: tortricids and noctuids, as they formed &gt;85% of the nestling diet in our study population
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">34</a>. They are used as a binomial of preferred

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">34</a>. A scale (0–4 cm) was drawn inside the nest-box door to classify every prey into size categories. The variable ‘biomass of noctuids in diet’ used in our analyses was calculated as prey biomass per chick and hour. Thus, we multiplied prey sample size in every category by the ordinal categories of body size, summing all of them, and dividing the total by the number of nestlings (see also 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Table S2</a>, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supporting Information</a>). The same approach applies to ‘biomass of tortricids in diet’. Estimating biomass is a key step as tits select the largest rather than the most abundant prey
