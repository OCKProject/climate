 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The manner in which HA is measured is a pivotal issue. For instance, the level of advantageousness that HA imparts in the case of the HUH depends on the time saved during incubation
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" href="#b9">9</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" href="#b10">10</a>. Because HA is commonly related to larger clutches (e.g., refs 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" href="#b12">12</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" href="#b16">16</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">18</a> and 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">25</a>; but see ref. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">19</a>), it is important to control for clutch size. Additionally, the number of infertile eggs can affect the hatching hierarchy
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">15</a>. Thus, we followed the method described in ref. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">15</a>, in which ‘HA estimates’ (simply ‘HA’ hereafter) are the residuals from a lineal regression of brood size (number of chicks born) on hatching span (in days), assuming that all the eggs have a similar development period, and the laying of one egg per day. This implies that nests with a larger HA have more asynchronous broods relative to that expected for a brood of similar size
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">15</a>. This approach treats brood size as a continuous variable, which is inexact. However, this procedure does not affect results and facilitates the analysis, as sample size does not need to be stratified among the different clutch sizes

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From the estimated day 11 of incubation, (i.e., two days before the expected hatching date), we carried out daily visits to record hatching date. The visits were ended after three consecutive days without new hatchings. To check the suitability of our method, we carried out two visits per day in a subset of 24 nests (12 great and 12 blue tit nests). In these nests, the first visit was before 12:00 P.M. (noon) and the second one after 5:00 P.M. We statistically compared the HA obtained with one visit 
  <span class="italic">vs</span>. that with two visits per day, and confirmed that they resulted in similar estimates (Spearman correlation, R
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.87, P &lt; 0.0001). We thus used HA based on daily visits in all analyses and in all nests.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relative weight difference (RWD) was used to describe the extent of the size hierarchy within broods [RWD = (heaviest − lightest nestling)/(mean nestling weight)]
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" href="#b39">39</a>; see also ref. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" href="#b35">35</a>). This was assessed when chicks were 13 days old.
