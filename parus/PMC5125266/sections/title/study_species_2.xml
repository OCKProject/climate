 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Blue and great tits have similar nesting biology as they lay one egg per day, with incubation periods of 13 days
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">30</a>. The great tit is larger (17–21 g) than the blue tit (7–11 g). The two species widely use nest-boxes provided for nesting (e.g., refs 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">19</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">30</a> and 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" href="#b36">36</a>). As noted above, both species forage on similar prey items.
