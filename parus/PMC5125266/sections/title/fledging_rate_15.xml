 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Modelling procedure generated a subset of 37 models to explain fledging rate (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t4" href="#t4">Table 4</a>). Due to their small differences in AICc values, our results did not lend definitive support to any of them. Nevertheless, the variable year was present in all the models (Σωi = 1.00), as fledging rate was higher in 2013 (
