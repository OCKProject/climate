 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We monitored 211 nests (92 in 2012, 119 in 2013), 135 (56 and 79, respectively) of them belonging to blue tits and 76 (36 and 40) to great tits. Clutches consisting of a single egg were excluded, although these were rare (&lt;1%). Nests were visited daily from early April to mid-July. We assumed that the clutch size was complete when there was no increase in egg number after four days from the day the last egg was laid. We monitored hatching asynchrony in detail (see below). Eggs failing to hatch were those that were still present in the nest eight days after hatching (i.e., when we trapped the parents). Hence, if the brood size was lower than clutch size on these first days, missing eggs were assumed to have hatched, and the chicks concerned were assumed to have died, and to have been removed by the parents
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" href="#b36">36</a>. Parents were captured by means of spring traps when feeding nestlings 8–9 days old. At capture, adults were aged and identified with metal rings. The nestlings were banded and weighed when they were 13 days old. On day 22, nest-boxes were visited to assess the ‘fledging rate’, as chicks have already left the nest at this age
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">30</a>. Fledging rate is the proportion of chicks fledging to the number of chicks hatched, and it was only calculated for broods in which at least two chicks fledged. Second clutches (&lt;1%) as well as mixed clutches (3%

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Table S2</a>, based on that from
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" href="#b5">5</a>. We estimated the size of every single caterpillar with the ordinal scale described in ref. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">38</a>, and the biomass from the corresponding family was the sum of all the individuals from that family, which were used in the analyses as ‘noctuid availability’ or ‘tortricid availability’. We did not include the availability of geometrids in our analyses because this was much lower (
