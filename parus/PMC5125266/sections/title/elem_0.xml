   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">30</a>. The great tit is larger (17–21 g) than the blue tit (7–11 g). The two species widely use nest-boxes provided for nesting (e.g., refs

   <span class="italic">Quercus pyrenaica</span>)-dominated forests of different sizes (range 2.5–26.0 ha), and supplied with a proportional number of wooden nest-boxes (12.0 × 11.5 × 16.5 cm) were chosen (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Table S1</a>, 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supporting Information</a>). The nest-boxes were separated by 30–50 m from each other, and forest plots were at least 400 m apart. In our study region, deciduous woodlands are fragmented and alternate with scrublands, pasturelands, and other less suitable forests, like pinewood plantations

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">General field protocol</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We monitored 211 nests (92 in 2012, 119 in 2013), 135 (56 and 79, respectively) of them belonging to blue tits and 76 (36 and 40) to great tits. Clutches consisting of a single egg were excluded, although these were rare (&lt;1%). Nests were visited daily from early April to mid-July. We assumed that the clutch size was complete when there was no increase in egg number after four days from the day the last egg was laid. We monitored hatching asynchrony in detail (see below). Eggs failing to hatch were those that were still present in the nest eight days after hatching (i.e., when we trapped the parents). Hence, if the brood size was lower than clutch size on these first days, missing eggs were assumed to have hatched, and the chicks concerned were assumed to have died, and to have been removed by the parents
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" href="#b36">36</a>. Parents were captured by means of spring traps when feeding nestlings 8–9 days old. At capture, adults were aged and identified with metal rings. The nestlings were banded and weighed when they were 13 days old. On day 22, nest-boxes were visited to assess the ‘fledging rate’, as chicks have already left the nest at this age
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">30</a>. Fledging rate is the proportion of chicks fledging to the number of chicks hatched, and it was only calculated for broods in which at least two chicks fledged. Second clutches (&lt;1%) as well as mixed clutches (3%
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" href="#b36">36</a>) were excluded.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We surveyed the availability of noctuid, tortricid and geometrid caterpillars with the schema fully described in

We did not include the availability of geometrids in our analyses because this was much lower (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Measuring HA</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The manner in which HA is measured is a pivotal issue. For instance, the level of advantageousness that HA imparts in the case of the HUH depends on the time saved during incubation
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" href="#b9">9</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" href="#b10">10</a>. Because HA is commonly related to larger clutches (e.g., refs 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" href="#b12">12</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" href="#b16">16</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">18</a> and 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">25</a>; but see ref. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">19</a>), it is important to control for clutch size. Additionally, the number of infertile eggs can affect the hatching hierarchy
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">15</a>. Thus, we followed the method described in ref. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">15</a>, in which ‘HA estimates’ (simply ‘HA’ hereafter) are the residuals from a lineal regression of brood size (number of chicks born) on hatching span (in days), assuming that all the eggs have a similar development period, and the laying of one egg per day. This implies that nests with a larger HA have more asynchronous broods relative to that expected for a brood of similar size
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">15</a>. This approach treats brood size as a continuous variable, which is inexact. However, this procedure does not affect results and facilitates the analysis, as sample size does not need to be stratified among the different clutch sizes
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">15</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From the estimated day 11 of incubation, (i.e., two days before the expected hatching date), we carried out daily visits to record hatching date. The visits were ended after three consecutive days without new hatchings. To check the suitability of our method, we carried out two visits per day in a subset of 24 nests (12 great and 12 blue tit nests). In these nests, the first visit was before 12:00 P.M. (noon) and the second one after 5:00 P.M. We statistically compared the HA obtained with one visit 
   <span class="italic">vs</span>. that with two visits per day, and confirmed that they resulted in similar estimates (Spearman correlation, R
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.87, P &lt; 0.0001). We thus used HA based on daily visits in all analyses and in all nests.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relative weight difference (RWD) was used to describe the extent of the size hierarchy within broods [RWD = (heaviest − lightest nestling)/(mean nestling weight)]
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" href="#b39">39</a>; see also ref. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" href="#b35">35</a>). This was assessed when chicks were 13 days old.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Diet filming</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We filmed 124 nests (63 in 2012, 61 in 2013), 85 (45 and 40, respectively) of them belonging to blue tits and 39 (18 and 21) to great tits. When nestlings were 10 days old (i.e., 24 h before the filming day), we placed a wooden housing fixed to the back of the nest-box facing the entrance hole to allow birds to habituate to the future presence of the camera (Sony DCR-SR-type or HDR-XR550, all of them equipped with Night-shot system
   <span class="sup">TM</span>). When nestlings were 11 days, feeding was recorded with the video camera installed inside the housing, following the protocol described in refs 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" href="#b5">5</a> and 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">38</a>. To control for filming ‘hour’, this variable was included in the analyses (see below). The first 60 minutes of each film were discarded to exclude potential disturbance effects on adult behavior from the camera placing. We studied the diet in the following 60 minutes as described in refs 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" href="#b5">5</a> and 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">38</a>. Recordings were played and analysed frame-by-frame using the software Adobe Premiere Elements 7.0. We used a reference collection with prey sampled in the field to identify the images. Food items from a total of 3209 feeding trips were identified following categories defined in ref. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">34</a>. However, we focused on the larvae of two Lepidoptera families: tortricids and noctuids, as they formed &gt;85% of the nestling diet in our study population
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">34</a>. They are used as a binomial of preferred 
   <span class="italic">vs</span>. suboptimal prey by tits
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" href="#b5">5</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">34</a>. A scale (0–4 cm) was drawn inside the nest-box door to classify every prey into size categories. The variable ‘biomass of noctuids in diet’ used in our analyses was calculated as prey biomass per chick and hour. Thus, we multiplied prey sample size in every category by the ordinal categories of body size, summing all of them, and dividing the total by the number of nestlings (see also 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Table S2</a>, 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supporting Information</a>). The same approach applies to ‘biomass of tortricids in diet’. Estimating biomass is a key step as tits select the largest rather than the most abundant prey

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We constructed general linear mixed models (GLMMs) with normal error and identity link, using PROC MIXED in SAS 9.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) to confirm the lack of differences in basic breeding parameters (laying date, hatching date and clutch size) between species and years, including their interactions.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We proceeded with Wilcoxon matched pairs and Student’s paired t tests when appropriate to analyze between-year differences in noctuid and tortricid biomasses within the eight forests and overall. These statistical analyses were performed with Statistica v.10 (Statsoft, Tulsa, OK, USA). Data are expressed as mean ± standard error (SE).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We constructed a GLMM (normal error and identity link) as implemented in the “lmer” procedure of the R package “lme4”
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" href="#b41">41</a> to investigate which variables contributed to explaining the biomass of noctuids in the nestling diet. We included as categorical explanatory variables: ‘year’ (because 2012 and 2013 differed in caterpillar availability, see Results) and ‘species’ (blue tit 
   <span class="italic">vs</span>. great tit). As continuous explanatory variables we used noctuid availability (the mean biomass of noctuids per survey in that forest on the date of filming), and filming hour. Forest identity was included as a random factor. Here and hereafter, we included the interaction terms between categorical variables, and between each categorical variable and each continuous explanatory variable. We used the best subset procedure and second-order AIC corrected for small sample sizes (AICc) to identify the set of models best explaining the biomass of noctuids in the nestling diet, as implemented in “dredge” and “model.avg” procedures of the R package “MuMIn”
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b42" href="#b42">42</a>. To evaluate the relative explanatory power of competing best models, we calculated Akaike weights (ωi). Here we present those model subsets whose weights sum ≥0.95. In order to estimate the relative importance of the variables included in the best models, we calculated the sum of Akaike weights of the models where these variables were included
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" href="#b43">43</a>. We repeated the same schema to evaluate the factors contributing to the biomass of tortricids in the nestling diet, but including tortricid availability as a continuous explanatory variable instead of noctuid availability.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To examine the role of different factors on HA we constructed a GLMM with the following categorical explanatory variables: year, species and ‘female age’ (yearling 
   <span class="italic">vs</span>. adult; because female age could influence HA
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">25</a>). As continuous explanatory variables we included ‘hatching date’, ‘female mass’ (because smaller females could not effectively cover the whole clutch
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">19</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b44" href="#b44">44</a>) and both noctuid and tortricid availabilities. Forest and female identities were included as random factors.
