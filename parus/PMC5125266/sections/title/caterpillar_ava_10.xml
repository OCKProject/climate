 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mean biomass availability of noctuids per survey was 0.90 ± 0.16 in 2012 and 0.63 ± 0.10 in 2013, and although the pattern was consistent in 7 out of 8 forests (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Table S2</a>, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supporting Information</a>), these differences were not significant (t = 1.70, P = 0.09). On the contrary, the mean availability of tortricids was significantly higher in 2013 (2012, 0.43 ± 0.07 
  <span class="italic">vs</span>. 2013, 1.23 ± 0.12; t = 7.10, P &lt; 0.0001), and the pattern was highly consistent among forests (

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supporting Information</a>). Geometrids were the least abundant family with 0.35 ± 0.08 in 2012 and 0.25 ± 0.06 in 2013 (t = 1.23, P = 0.22), but lacked a clear pattern (

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supporting Information</a>). The shapes of the curves of caterpillar availability were variable among forests and between years, presenting two peaks, a single peak or even a plateau (
