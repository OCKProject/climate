 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present work was carried out during the 2012–2013 breeding seasons in San Pablo de los Montes (39°32′44″N, 4°19′41″W), a locality at Montes de Toledo (central Spain). Eight oak (
  <span class="italic">Quercus pyrenaica</span>)-dominated forests of different sizes (range 2.5–26.0 ha), and supplied with a proportional number of wooden nest-boxes (12.0 × 11.5 × 16.5 cm) were chosen (

In our study region, deciduous woodlands are fragmented and alternate with scrublands, pasturelands, and other less suitable forests, like pinewood plantations
