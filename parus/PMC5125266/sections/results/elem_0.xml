  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mean biomass availability of noctuids per survey was 0.90 ± 0.16 in 2012 and 0.63 ± 0.10 in 2013, and although the pattern was consistent in 7 out of 8 forests (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Table S2</a>, 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supporting Information</a>), these differences were not significant (t = 1.70, P = 0.09). On the contrary, the mean availability of tortricids was significantly higher in 2013 (2012, 0.43 ± 0.07 
   <span class="italic">vs</span>. 2013, 1.23 ± 0.12; t = 7.10, P &lt; 0.0001), and the pattern was highly consistent among forests (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Table S2</a>, 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supporting Information</a>). Geometrids were the least abundant family with 0.35 ± 0.08 in 2012 and 0.25 ± 0.06 in 2013 (t = 1.23, P = 0.22), but lacked a clear pattern (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Table S2</a>, 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supporting Information</a>). The shapes of the curves of caterpillar availability were variable among forests and between years, presenting two peaks, a single peak or even a plateau (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, we recorded a total of 3209 feeding trips, 73.6% of which were Lepidoptera larvae, accounting for 78.4% of the total biomass. Within Lepidoptera families, noctuids represented 63.7% and tortricids 15.2% of the total biomass. Geometrids only accounted for 6.6% of the total biomass.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The modelling approach provided a set of 21 models (whose weights summed ≥0.95) to explain the biomass of noctuids in the nestling diet (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>). Our results did not lend definitive support to any of these models due to the relatively small differences in AICc values (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>). Importantly, however, most models included the year (Σωi = 0.99), as the biomass of noctuids in nestling diet was greater in 2012 (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1a</a>). Also influential were species (Σωi = 0.91) and noctuid availability (Σωi = 0.79). Nevertheless, their iteration was influential as well (Σωi = 0.45), as feeding with noctuids by blue tits was positively determined by their availability in the field, but this was not the case in great tits (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1b</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">None of the potential predictor variables influenced nestling feeding with tortricids, as the null model was the one with the lowest AICc, not including any variable, and having a weight of 0.67 (

   <a ref-type="table" rid="t3" href="#t3">Table 3</a>). As expected due to the differences in species size, species was a highly influencing variable in mean nestling weight, being present in all the models (Σωi = 1.00). Year was present in all the models as well, because nestlings were heavier in 2013 (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Fig. S2</a>, 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supporting Information</a>). Also, RWD was present in all the models; however, its interaction with species was highly influential (Σωi = 0.91), as the larger the RWD, the lower the mean weight, but being more pronounced in the case of great tits (

   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Fig. S3</a>, 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supporting Information</a>). Influential were also HA (Σωi = 0.88) and RWD (Σωi = 0.62) as both of them negatively affected fledging rate (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f5" href="#f5">Fig. 5a,b</a>). Finally, species was influential as well (Σωi = 0.70), having blue tits larger fledging rates than great tits (
