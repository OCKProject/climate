 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found that local recruitment in both species showed quadratic relationships with both timing and synchrony, supporting the view of an optimal timing of breeding [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref006">6</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref014">14</a>]. However, the importance of these factors was strongly different. As expected, caterpillar food played a predominant role in predicting the timing of breeding of the great tit–synchrony explained recruitment 3.4 times better than timing. In contrast, for the willow tit, synchrony was outweighed by timing related factors, with timing explaining local recruitment 5,718.0 times better than synchrony. High caterpillar biomass experienced during the pre- and post-fledging periods increased the local recruitment of both species. These contrasting results suggest that different life history strategies of these species result in differential selection pressures acting on the timing of breeding, and hence responses to climate change may differ.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relevance of temporal match with the food peak</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the apparent good timing of the great tit with caterpillar prey [
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref021">21</a>], we found that local recruitment was the highest in broods in which the young were 15–19 days old when the food availability peaked, i.e., at the time of fledging (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g001" href="#pone.0162643.g001">Fig 1a</a>). In accordance, caterpillar biomass during the post-fledging stage (i.e. ages 18–25) was the most influential for local recruitment. Thus, the commonly used measure for ‘good synchrony’ (temporal match between the time of the highest food demand of the nestlings at the age of 10 days and the highest food availability) may not be universal. The temporal match-mismatch hypothesis should be extended to consider several critical periods when high-quality food needs to be abundantly available–not only the period of the fastest growth of the offspring, but also the time of newly fledged young learning to forage independently–for the breeding event to be successful.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The great tit thus appears to breed too late to maximize local recruitment in the northern conditions (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g001" href="#pone.0162643.g001">Fig 1a</a>). Originally a temperate species, great tits have shown the ability to advance breeding [
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref022">22</a>], but may be unable to start breeding at the time that would maximize local recruitment in the northern conditions. Early breeding may be constrained by possible carry-over effects from wintering, high energetic requirements of egg-laying and incubation or food shortage during the nestling stage [
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref024">24</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref037">37</a>]. Thus, the realized timing may be the most optimal possible solution [
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref006">6</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effect of synchrony (but less that of timing) on the local recruitment of the great tit depended on population density (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162643.s002" href="#pone.0162643.s002">S2 Fig</a>). In high densities, early breeding in relation to the caterpillar peak resulted in the highest survival. Therefore, conspecific competition between young may select for earlier breeding, and partly explain the lack of association between peak food demand (10 days old chicks) and highest survival. As the early fledged young are presumably dominant over late fledging young, early fledged young may have higher survival during the period just after gaining independence [
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref038">38</a>]. These results are congruent with [
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref039">39</a>] who found stronger selection on early laying date with increasing population density in a great tit population. This effect may result from differences in quality of territories or from early hatching young faring well in competition for food later in their first autumn and winter [
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref039">39</a>]. It is also possible that high densities result from good conditions (e.g. the abundance of other food sources or weather) that favour survival. Nevertheless, it seems that selection on the timing of breeding is stabilizing at average or lower densities when conditions may be less favourable (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g001" href="#pone.0162643.g001">Fig 1b</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Willow tits timed their breeding so that the young fledged on average at the time of the highest caterpillar availability (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g001" href="#pone.0162643.g001">Fig 1c</a>). Interestingly, while such synchrony maximized local recruitment for the great tit, local recruitment for the willow tit appeared the highest when the chicks were ca. 10 days old at the time of the highest caterpillar availability (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g001" href="#pone.0162643.g001">Fig 1c</a>). This is consistent with theory on phenological matching in Parids [
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref010">10</a>]. In addition, high caterpillar biomass during the nestling stage (but not post-fledging) increased local recruitment but only when timing in relation to conspecifics was considered. The willow tit therefore breeds before the peak of food abundance despite the fact that high caterpillar availability is beneficial for the survival of the young. Such behaviour is apparently adaptive because of other factors affecting the timing of breeding [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Strong directional selection or date dependent dispersal?</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a standalone effect, time-dependence indicated strong directional selection for early breeding in the willow tit (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g003" href="#pone.0162643.g003">Fig 3a</a>). However, distance to the centre interacted with the timing variables. Near the edge of the study area, survival rates declined strongly in time as if there was strong directional selection for early breeding, but at the centre of the study area, where the effect of emigration is smaller, average timing resulted in the highest survival (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g003" href="#pone.0162643.g003">Fig 3b</a>). After controlling for such date dependent dispersal, it seems that selection is more or less balancing (Figs 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g001" href="#pone.0162643.g001">1d</a> and 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g003" href="#pone.0162643.g003">3b</a>). This result is more realistic because without the correction the results would suggest that there are no costs from demanding early season conditions, which were apparent to the great tit.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Time-dependent selection pressures</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Strong social influences in the willow tit are one explanation for the overwhelming importance of timing breeding in relation to conspecifics for local recruitment. Wintering strategy of willow tits involves hoarding food and spending the non-breeding season in their future breeding grounds in highly territorial and coherent non-kin groups, in which both access and dominance ranks are determined by prior residency [
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref018">18</a>]. It is known that late fledging individuals are in a poor situation in terms of intra-specific competition for attaining high dominance positions in the wintering groups and hence survival over the winter (

   <span class="italic">palustris</span>, [

   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref042">42</a>]). This together with strong density dependent local recruitment found in this study suggests that the wintering strategy ultimately affects the timing of breeding via prior residency effects on local recruitment [
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref009">9</a>,

   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref042">42</a>]. However, we note that while it is important for willow tits to breed in relation to conspecifics this mechanism does not seem to result in strong selection for early breeding (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g001" href="#pone.0162643.g001">Fig 1d</a>), rather they should not breed too late.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This view is supported by ecologically similar species that winter in small flocks with strong social hierarchies and food hoarding, and also breed early in relation to caterpillar food (e.g. the marsh tit (

   <span class="italic">palustris</span>; [

   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref047">47</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref048">48</a>]). Most temperate and boreal Parids show similar social systems linked with food hoarding during winter [
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref049">49</a>]. Interestingly, great tits and blue tits (
   <span class="italic">Cyanistes caeruleus</span>) time their breeding to match with caterpillar food, and are exceptions to this rule [
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref012">12</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref050">50</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref052">52</a>]. In the boreal zone, they winter in constantly changing non-territorial flocks in areas that may be located far from their future breeding territories, and while prior residence affects dominance relationships, it does not dictate access to wintering groups [
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref049">49</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref053">53</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref054">54</a>]. Thus, a possible explanation for the lower importance of timing breeding in relation to conspecifics in the great tit may be linked to different adaptations for wintering.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the relevance of social influences during the non-breeding season on the timing of breeding is a reasonable explanation, our results do not strictly confirm this mechanism to be the ultimate one for the different fitness responses. We cannot exclude interspecific competition for nesting sites [
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref031">31</a>] or for food during the nestling period [
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref019">19</a>], both of which may result in temporal niche separation, that is, phenological differences in the timing of breeding. Poor competitors may escape competition by breeding earlier than their competitors, gaining higher breeding success than when breeding in synchrony with the competitors. Likewise, early breeding may result in a temporal escape from a high predation pressure [
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref020">20</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref031">31</a>]. Both of these factors may function as mechanisms for time-dependent, directional selection pressures.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In migratory species, selection pressures related to migratory behaviour can constrain the timing of breeding [
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref055">55</a>] and therefore they are likely to show higher levels of mismatch with food availability than resident species. Our results suggest that a similar pattern of divergent ultimate factors in the timing of breeding can be found also among resident, related species. A certain breeding/wintering strategy is possible only if species’ other life history characteristics permit it. For example, the willow tit can use its winter food caches as an energy resource for egg production and a more diverse diet for providing their young [
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref021">21</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref027">27</a>]. Thus, it can breed early with its breeding success being less conditional on the phenological match with the caterpillar peak than in the great tit.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Natural selection operates on the timing of breeding via several ultimate factors. Our species comparison provides evidence for the importance of life history differences in responses to the climate change. One life history characteristic, e.g. the wintering strategy or the competition ability, can function as a leverage point for the evolution of other characteristics, including the timing of breeding. Thus, detailed information on life histories is required when trying to understand the evolutionary and ecological consequences of climate change.</p>
