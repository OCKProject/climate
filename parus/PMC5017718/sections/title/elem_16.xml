   <p>Local recruitment of the great tit in relation to synchrony with the caterpillar food peak (synchrony = day of 10 days old young–caterpillar peak day, i.e. chicks are 10 days old at the peak day) in high densities (black lines; 940 individual / study area) and in low densities (red lines; 488 individuals / study area). Other variables were set to average values. Dashed lines indicate 95% confidence intervals. See
