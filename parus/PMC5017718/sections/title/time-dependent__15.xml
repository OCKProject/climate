 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Strong social influences in the willow tit are one explanation for the overwhelming importance of timing breeding in relation to conspecifics for local recruitment. Wintering strategy of willow tits involves hoarding food and spending the non-breeding season in their future breeding grounds in highly territorial and coherent non-kin groups, in which both access and dominance ranks are determined by prior residency [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref018">18</a>]. It is known that late fledging individuals are in a poor situation in terms of intra-specific competition for attaining high dominance positions in the wintering groups and hence survival over the winter (

  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref042">42</a>]). This together with strong density dependent local recruitment found in this study suggests that the wintering strategy ultimately affects the timing of breeding via prior residency effects on local recruitment [

  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref042">42</a>]. However, we note that while it is important for willow tits to breed in relation to conspecifics this mechanism does not seem to result in strong selection for early breeding (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g001" href="#pone.0162643.g001">Fig 1d</a>), rather they should not breed too late.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This view is supported by ecologically similar species that winter in small flocks with strong social hierarchies and food hoarding, and also breed early in relation to caterpillar food (e.g. the marsh tit (

  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref048">48</a>]). Most temperate and boreal Parids show similar social systems linked with food hoarding during winter [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref049">49</a>]. Interestingly, great tits and blue tits (
  <span class="italic">Cyanistes caeruleus</span>) time their breeding to match with caterpillar food, and are exceptions to this rule [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref012">12</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref050">50</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref052">52</a>]. In the boreal zone, they winter in constantly changing non-territorial flocks in areas that may be located far from their future breeding territories, and while prior residence affects dominance relationships, it does not dictate access to wintering groups [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref049">49</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref053">53</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref054">54</a>]. Thus, a possible explanation for the lower importance of timing breeding in relation to conspecifics in the great tit may be linked to different adaptations for wintering.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the relevance of social influences during the non-breeding season on the timing of breeding is a reasonable explanation, our results do not strictly confirm this mechanism to be the ultimate one for the different fitness responses. We cannot exclude interspecific competition for nesting sites [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref031">31</a>] or for food during the nestling period [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref019">19</a>], both of which may result in temporal niche separation, that is, phenological differences in the timing of breeding. Poor competitors may escape competition by breeding earlier than their competitors, gaining higher breeding success than when breeding in synchrony with the competitors. Likewise, early breeding may result in a temporal escape from a high predation pressure [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref020">20</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref031">31</a>]. Both of these factors may function as mechanisms for time-dependent, directional selection pressures.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In migratory species, selection pressures related to migratory behaviour can constrain the timing of breeding [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref055">55</a>] and therefore they are likely to show higher levels of mismatch with food availability than resident species. Our results suggest that a similar pattern of divergent ultimate factors in the timing of breeding can be found also among resident, related species. A certain breeding/wintering strategy is possible only if species’ other life history characteristics permit it. For example, the willow tit can use its winter food caches as an energy resource for egg production and a more diverse diet for providing their young [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref021">21</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref027">27</a>]. Thus, it can breed early with its breeding success being less conditional on the phenological match with the caterpillar peak than in the great tit.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Natural selection operates on the timing of breeding via several ultimate factors. Our species comparison provides evidence for the importance of life history differences in responses to the climate change. One life history characteristic, e.g. the wintering strategy or the competition ability, can function as a leverage point for the evolution of other characteristics, including the timing of breeding. Thus, detailed information on life histories is required when trying to understand the evolutionary and ecological consequences of climate change.</p>
