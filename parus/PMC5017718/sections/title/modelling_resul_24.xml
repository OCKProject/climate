 <p>Modelling results for local recruitment of the willow tit (
  <span class="italic">Poecile montanus</span>) examining the effect of synchrony (SYN) when synchrony (SYN) and its quadratic term (SYN) are included in the best model from 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162643.s005" href="#pone.0162643.s005">S3 Table</a> (i.e. a model containing centred hatching date). Models also include DC = distance to the center of the study area, MASS = mass, DEN = density, + additive effects, *interaction and variable name2 = quadratic effect of the variable. QAIC is scaled with Ä‰ = 1.039. Model parameters for survival include also the intercept and age, and for recapture rates the intercept and time, but model names include only the covariates to increase readability.
