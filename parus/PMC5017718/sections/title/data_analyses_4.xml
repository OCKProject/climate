 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The timing in relation to the caterpillar peak was defined with a variable ‘synchrony’ as the difference between the day when the nestling was 10 days old and the caterpillar peak date (synchrony = hatching date + 10 –caterpillar peak date; [

  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref022">22</a>]. A value of zero indicates a perfect match. Timing in relation to the population mean was modelled with the year centred hatching date (‘HD’ = hatching date–annual mean hatching date). For both variables, linear and quadratic terms were tested. The correlation coefficients between ‘synchrony’ and ‘HD’ were 0.82 for the great tit and 0.5 for the willow tit. We first constructed competing models including either the 'synchrony' or 'HD' variable. When the best model for each species was defined (with either 'synchrony' or 'HD'), we tested if the inclusion of linear and quadratic terms of the less important variable improved the model fit.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other variables included in the analysis were autumn population density (‘density’ = (number of parents + fledglings) / study area), both linear and quadratic terms of fledgling mass (‘mass’, g and ‘mass2‘). Models with ‘synchrony’ included ‘peak height’ (the maximum value of caterpillar biomass). We first fitted models with different combinations of the main effects only. We selected the three best main effect models and continued the model selection by including interactions. Only biologically interesting interactions with ‘synchrony’ or ‘HD’ were included. Models had a maximum of two interactions. See

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The importance of food availability encountered by the nestlings was also examined by including daily mean caterpillar biomass (BM). Biomass was measured for the whole pre-fledging period (‘BM1’ = caterpillar biomass at the ages of 0–18 days), the period of the highest food needs (‘BM2’ = caterpillar biomass at the ages of 8–13 days) and the post-fledging period (‘BM3’ = caterpillar biomass at the ages of 18–25 days). Biomass was modelled with and without ‘HD’. This analysis included only those individuals for which we had sufficient data on caterpillar abundance. The global models, [i.e. Phi(age*t) p(t)], fit both data (great tits: p = 0.06, ĉ = 1.27; willow tits: p = 0.38, ĉ = 1.03).</p>

If an interaction was found, survival was predicted for near the centre of the study area (DC = 1000 m) to control for date dependent emigration.
