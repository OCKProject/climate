 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The data were collected in Oulu, Finland (N 65°08', E 25°53') between 1999 and 2012. The study area contains coniferous, deciduous and mixed forests of varying ages and is a part of a continuous managed forest landscape (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162643.s001" href="#pone.0162643.s001">S1 Fig</a>). The main trees include birch (
  <span class="italic">Betula</span> sp.), Scotch pine (
  <span class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</span>) and spruce (
  <span class="italic">Picea abies</span>) [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref028">28</a>]. The willow tit study area is uniform, roundish shaped and ca. 25 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> in size (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162643.s001" href="#pone.0162643.s001">S1 Fig</a>). The great tit study area (ca. 8 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) overlaps that of the willow tits, but is very different in shape (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162643.s001" href="#pone.0162643.s001">S1 Fig</a>). The number of nest boxes was ca. 400 throughout the study period. Intensive field routines ensured that almost all nests were found and all individuals were ringed [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref022">22</a>]. We started searching for territories and nests in early-April. We recorded dates when laying started and visited the nests until clutches were complete. Average clutch sizes are 7.6 eggs for willow tits [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref029">29</a>] and 10 for great tits [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref030">30</a>]. Then, we used the incubation time of ca 14 days (both species; [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref029">29</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref030">30</a>]) to estimate time of hatching, which was confirmed by frequent visits around the estimated hatching date. Nestlings were marked with aluminium rings when 13–15 days old, before fledging which occurs at the age of 18 days [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref030">30</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref031">31</a>]. Recruitment was recorded by recapturing parent birds at their nests in subsequent years. All adults were ringed with individual colour codes. All field procedures adhered to Finnish national legislation. Trapping and ringing of animals was done under license from the Finnish Natural History Museum in Helsinki. This work did not involve invasive sampling that requires permits from the National Animal Experiment Board. Field studies were performed on private and government lands. People have the right to access the Finnish land areas freely under the traditional Finnish legal concept known as everyman's right unless specifically protected or prohibited.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the study populations, Parids mostly forage on caterpillars (e.g. 
  <span class="italic">Epirrita autumnata</span>) occurring in birches (
  <span class="italic">Betula</span> spp.) during the breeding season [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref027">27</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref028">28</a>]. The frassfall method was used to estimate caterpillar availability [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref032">32</a>]. The quantity of caterpillar droppings falling on a certain area (m
  <span class="sup">2</span>) per unit of time (day) was used to estimate the biomass of caterpillars foraging on birch for weekly periods. We used five collectors (one per tree) in four different places (20 collectors) to control for spatial variation in caterpillar phenology within the study area. The annual peak dates of caterpillar abundance were determined to be the middle day of a period when the biomass was at its highest. However, the annual peaks occurred almost always in the same week in different locations. Highly synchronous caterpillar phenology is a consequence of the very synchronous bud burst of birch in the study area; supposedly as this is a very flat area (15–30 m above sea level). Therefore, a single caterpillar peak date was employed for the entire study area.
