 <p>Modelling results for local recruitment of the great tit (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) examining the effects of and synchrony (SYN) when centred hatching date (HD) and its quadratic term (HD2) are included in the best model from 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162643.s004" href="#pone.0162643.s004">S2 Table</a>. Models also include PK = peak height in caterpillar food abundance, DC = distance to the center of the study area, MASS = mass, DEN = density, + additive effects, *interaction and variable name2 = quadratic effect of the variable, k = number of parameters. QAIC is scaled with Ä‰ = 1.137. Model parameters for survival include the intercept and age, and for recapture rates the intercept, but model names include only the covariates to increase readability.
