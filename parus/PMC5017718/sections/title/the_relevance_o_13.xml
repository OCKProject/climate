 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the apparent good timing of the great tit with caterpillar prey [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref021">21</a>], we found that local recruitment was the highest in broods in which the young were 15–19 days old when the food availability peaked, i.e., at the time of fledging (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g001" href="#pone.0162643.g001">Fig 1a</a>). In accordance, caterpillar biomass during the post-fledging stage (i.e. ages 18–25) was the most influential for local recruitment. Thus, the commonly used measure for ‘good synchrony’ (temporal match between the time of the highest food demand of the nestlings at the age of 10 days and the highest food availability) may not be universal. The temporal match-mismatch hypothesis should be extended to consider several critical periods when high-quality food needs to be abundantly available–not only the period of the fastest growth of the offspring, but also the time of newly fledged young learning to forage independently–for the breeding event to be successful.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The great tit thus appears to breed too late to maximize local recruitment in the northern conditions (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g001" href="#pone.0162643.g001">Fig 1a</a>). Originally a temperate species, great tits have shown the ability to advance breeding [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref022">22</a>], but may be unable to start breeding at the time that would maximize local recruitment in the northern conditions. Early breeding may be constrained by possible carry-over effects from wintering, high energetic requirements of egg-laying and incubation or food shortage during the nestling stage [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref024">24</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref037">37</a>]. Thus, the realized timing may be the most optimal possible solution [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref006">6</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effect of synchrony (but less that of timing) on the local recruitment of the great tit depended on population density (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162643.s002" href="#pone.0162643.s002">S2 Fig</a>). In high densities, early breeding in relation to the caterpillar peak resulted in the highest survival. Therefore, conspecific competition between young may select for earlier breeding, and partly explain the lack of association between peak food demand (10 days old chicks) and highest survival. As the early fledged young are presumably dominant over late fledging young, early fledged young may have higher survival during the period just after gaining independence [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref038">38</a>]. These results are congruent with [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref039">39</a>] who found stronger selection on early laying date with increasing population density in a great tit population. This effect may result from differences in quality of territories or from early hatching young faring well in competition for food later in their first autumn and winter [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref039">39</a>]. It is also possible that high densities result from good conditions (e.g. the abundance of other food sources or weather) that favour survival. Nevertheless, it seems that selection on the timing of breeding is stabilizing at average or lower densities when conditions may be less favourable (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g001" href="#pone.0162643.g001">Fig 1b</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Willow tits timed their breeding so that the young fledged on average at the time of the highest caterpillar availability (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g001" href="#pone.0162643.g001">Fig 1c</a>). Interestingly, while such synchrony maximized local recruitment for the great tit, local recruitment for the willow tit appeared the highest when the chicks were ca. 10 days old at the time of the highest caterpillar availability (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g001" href="#pone.0162643.g001">Fig 1c</a>). This is consistent with theory on phenological matching in Parids [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref010">10</a>]. In addition, high caterpillar biomass during the nestling stage (but not post-fledging) increased local recruitment but only when timing in relation to conspecifics was considered. The willow tit therefore breeds before the peak of food abundance despite the fact that high caterpillar availability is beneficial for the survival of the young. Such behaviour is apparently adaptive because of other factors affecting the timing of breeding [
