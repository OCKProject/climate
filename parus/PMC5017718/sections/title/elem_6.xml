Frequency distribution for the observed synchrony values (a sliding average of five days) is shown by a red line in a and c.

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g002" href="#pone.0162643.g002">Fig 2</a>) indicating that individuals born at the edge of the study area had higher probability of emigration. Furthermore, distance to the centre of the study area interacted with both linear and quadratic terms of hatching date (

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g003" href="#pone.0162643.g003">Fig 3</a>). The interaction means that for individuals that originated at the edge of the study area, hatching early was extremely important for recruitment into the study area (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g003" href="#pone.0162643.g003">Fig 3b</a>). However, for birds that originated close to the centre of the study area, average hatching resulted in the highest local recruitment (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g003" href="#pone.0162643.g003">Fig 3b</a>). These interactions suggest date-dependent dispersal, which should be accounted for. We thus used a distance of 1000 metres from the centre of the study area to derive model predictions (i.e. controlling for emigration), that suggested the highest local recruitment to be achieved by hatching one to three days before average (
