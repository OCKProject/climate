 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Correct timing of reproduction is crucial in seasonal environments [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref001">1</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref003">3</a>]. Ecological factors affecting the timing of reproduction as well as the underlying physiological mechanisms have been widely studied, particularly since climate warming has caused many species to advance their reproduction [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref004">4</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref005">5</a>]. However, reproductive phenologies of even very similar species as well as their responses to climate warming are not fully understood [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref005">5</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reproductive timing is affected by many selective pressures acting on different life history stages [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref006">6</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref007">7</a>]. The temporal match-mismatch hypothesis suggests that timing of breeding in animals is selected to match with food availability so that the timing of the highest food demand of offspring is synchronous with the food availability peak [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref008">8</a>], resulting in stabilizing selection [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref009">9</a>]. Ongoing climate change has rapidly changed phenologies at lower trophic levels, sometimes leading to temporal mismatches that have caused directional selection pressures on the timing of reproduction of their predators [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref010">10</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref011">11</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alternatively, time-dependent breeding success can also cause directional selection for earlier breeding (the date hypothesis, [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref012">12</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref013">13</a>]); a universal phenomenon [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref014">14</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref015">15</a>] mainly caused by seasonally deteriorating conditions [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref014">14</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref016">16</a>]. Time-dependence is particularly important for resident species with intraspecific competition for territories and dominance positions [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref009">9</a>]. Earlier born individuals benefit from prior residency, better access to territory ownership and dominant positions in conspecific winter flocks [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref017">17</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref018">18</a>]. These benefits enhance their survival prospects in relation to late born young [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref017">17</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref018">18</a>]. Therefore, timing of breeding with respect to conspecifics is of major importance in species that have territorial groups with social hierarchy [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref017">17</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref018">18</a>], and may outweigh the benefits of a temporal match with abundant food resources. Interspecific competition for resources (e.g. nesting sites or food) is another time-dependent factor that may cause species with low competition abilities to benefit from breeding early [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref019">19</a>]. Also, the predation escape hypothesis [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref020">20</a>] predicts directional selection for earlier breeding if early breeding individuals and their offspring avoid the highest predation pressure either during the breeding event or in later life-history stages (e.g. during migration).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Much of the work on the ecological consequences of climate change has focused on the shifts in the timing of breeding following warming spring temperatures, trophic mismatches and resulting effects on breeding success and population size [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref002">2</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref003">3</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref007">7</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref011">11</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref021">21</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref024">24</a>]. Yet, effects of other time-dependent selective pressures on the current evolution of reproductive timing have so far received much less attention. Differences in other life history stages can strongly affect species’ responses to warming springs [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref009">9</a>], even in coexisting closely related species [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref025">25</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref026">26</a>]. Comparison of sympatric populations of closely related species that differ in some aspects of life history can increase our understanding about the mechanisms underlying these different responses.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We studied the ultimate factors on the timing of breeding: phenological mismatch and time-dependence, in sympatric populations of two related forest-dwelling passerine species in northern Finland, the great tit (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>, L.) and the willow tit (
  <span class="italic">Poecile montanus</span>, 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Conrad_von_Baldenstein" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Conrad</span>). Both species have temporally advanced their breeding along with the availability of their main prey, insect larvae [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref021">21</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref022">22</a>]. However, these species differ in the timing of breeding yet they rely on the same main food source (insect larvae) during the nestling stage [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref027">27</a>]. The great tits time their breeding so that the period of the highest food needs of the nestlings (around the age of 10 days) co-occurs with the period of the highest food availability i.e. caterpillar peak [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref022">22</a>]. Among Parids, such timing of breeding is considered being in good synchrony, a phenological match [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref010">10</a>]. In contrast, boreal willow tits often breed earlier and in poor synchrony with caterpillar food [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref021">21</a>]. We therefore hypothesize that the two ultimate factors affecting the timing of breeding have different relevance for fitness in two study species. We tested this with long-term capture-recapture data (1999–2012) by modelling recruitment, the life history stage that ultimately determines fitness [
  <a rid="pone.0162643.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref014">14</a>]. The results confirmed that local recruitment of great tits was strongly dependent on caterpillar food, whereas in the willow tit, local recruitment depended on the timing of conspecifics, not caterpillar food.
