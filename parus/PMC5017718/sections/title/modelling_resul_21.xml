 <p>Modelling results for local recruitment of the willow tit (
  <span class="italic">Poecile montanus</span>) examining the effects of centred hatching date (HD) and synchrony (SYN). Models also include PK = peak height in caterpillar food abundance, DC = distance to the center of the study area, MASS = mass, DEN = density, + additive effects, *interaction and variable name2 = quadratic effect of the variable. QAIC is scaled with Ä‰ = 1.039. Model parameters for survival include also the intercept and age, and for recapture rates the intercept and time, but model names include only the covariates to increase readability.
