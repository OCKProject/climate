  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The data were collected in Oulu, Finland (N 65°08', E 25°53') between 1999 and 2012. The study area contains coniferous, deciduous and mixed forests of varying ages and is a part of a continuous managed forest landscape (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162643.s001" href="#pone.0162643.s001">S1 Fig</a>). The main trees include birch (
   <span class="italic">Betula</span> sp.), Scotch pine (
   <span class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</span>) and spruce (
   <span class="italic">Picea abies</span>) [
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref028">28</a>]. The willow tit study area is uniform, roundish shaped and ca. 25 km
   <span class="sup">2</span> in size (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162643.s001" href="#pone.0162643.s001">S1 Fig</a>). The great tit study area (ca. 8 km
   <span class="sup">2</span>) overlaps that of the willow tits, but is very different in shape (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162643.s001" href="#pone.0162643.s001">S1 Fig</a>). The number of nest boxes was ca. 400 throughout the study period. Intensive field routines ensured that almost all nests were found and all individuals were ringed [
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref022">22</a>]. We started searching for territories and nests in early-April. We recorded dates when laying started and visited the nests until clutches were complete. Average clutch sizes are 7.6 eggs for willow tits [
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref029">29</a>] and 10 for great tits [
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref030">30</a>]. Then, we used the incubation time of ca 14 days (both species; [

   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref030">30</a>]) to estimate time of hatching, which was confirmed by frequent visits around the estimated hatching date. Nestlings were marked with aluminium rings when 13–15 days old, before fledging which occurs at the age of 18 days [
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref030">30</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref031">31</a>]. Recruitment was recorded by recapturing parent birds at their nests in subsequent years. All adults were ringed with individual colour codes. All field procedures adhered to Finnish national legislation. Trapping and ringing of animals was done under license from the Finnish Natural History Museum in Helsinki. This work did not involve invasive sampling that requires permits from the National Animal Experiment Board. Field studies were performed on private and government lands. People have the right to access the Finnish land areas freely under the traditional Finnish legal concept known as everyman's right unless specifically protected or prohibited.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the study populations, Parids mostly forage on caterpillars (e.g. 
   <span class="italic">Epirrita autumnata</span>) occurring in birches (
   <span class="italic">Betula</span> spp.) during the breeding season [
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref027">27</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref028">28</a>]. The frassfall method was used to estimate caterpillar availability [
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref032">32</a>]. The quantity of caterpillar droppings falling on a certain area (m
   <span class="sup">2</span>) per unit of time (day) was used to estimate the biomass of caterpillars foraging on birch for weekly periods. We used five collectors (one per tree) in four different places (20 collectors) to control for spatial variation in caterpillar phenology within the study area. The annual peak dates of caterpillar abundance were determined to be the middle day of a period when the biomass was at its highest. However, the annual peaks occurred almost always in the same week in different locations. Highly synchronous caterpillar phenology is a consequence of the very synchronous bud burst of birch in the study area; supposedly as this is a very flat area (15–30 m above sea level). Therefore, a single caterpillar peak date was employed for the entire study area.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Apparent juvenile survival from fledging to one year of age (i.e. local recruitment) was analysed from marked fledglings (

   <span class="italic">major</span>: 6294 individuals, 
   <span class="italic">P</span>. 
   <span class="italic">montanus</span>: 7224 individuals) born in first, replacement and second nests. Survival was modelled using CJS-models in program MARK 8.0 [

   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref034">34</a>]. Global models considering time and age structure in survival, and time in the recapture probabilities [i.e. Phi (age*t) p(t)] fit both data (GOF

   <span class="italic">major</span>: p = 0.213, ĉ = 1.137; 
   <span class="italic">montanus</span>: p = 0.364, ĉ = 1.039).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The timing in relation to the caterpillar peak was defined with a variable ‘synchrony’ as the difference between the day when the nestling was 10 days old and the caterpillar peak date (synchrony = hatching date + 10 –caterpillar peak date; [
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref021">21</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref022">22</a>]. A value of zero indicates a perfect match. Timing in relation to the population mean was modelled with the year centred hatching date (‘HD’ = hatching date–annual mean hatching date). For both variables, linear and quadratic terms were tested. The correlation coefficients between ‘synchrony’ and ‘HD’ were 0.82 for the great tit and 0.5 for the willow tit. We first constructed competing models including either the 'synchrony' or 'HD' variable. When the best model for each species was defined (with either 'synchrony' or 'HD'), we tested if the inclusion of linear and quadratic terms of the less important variable improved the model fit.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other variables included in the analysis were autumn population density (‘density’ = (number of parents + fledglings) / study area), both linear and quadratic terms of fledgling mass (‘mass’, g and ‘mass2‘). Models with ‘synchrony’ included ‘peak height’ (the maximum value of caterpillar biomass). We first fitted models with different combinations of the main effects only. We selected the three best main effect models and continued the model selection by including interactions. Only biologically interesting interactions with ‘synchrony’ or ‘HD’ were included. Models had a maximum of two interactions. See

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The importance of food availability encountered by the nestlings was also examined by including daily mean caterpillar biomass (BM). Biomass was measured for the whole pre-fledging period (‘BM1’ = caterpillar biomass at the ages of 0–18 days), the period of the highest food needs (‘BM2’ = caterpillar biomass at the ages of 8–13 days) and the post-fledging period (‘BM3’ = caterpillar biomass at the ages of 18–25 days). Biomass was modelled with and without ‘HD’. This analysis included only those individuals for which we had sufficient data on caterpillar abundance. The global models, [i.e. Phi(age*t) p(t)], fit both data (great tits: p = 0.06, ĉ = 1.27; willow tits: p = 0.38, ĉ = 1.03).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We accounted for possible bias arising from dispersal patterns in relation to the study area boundaries [
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref035">35</a>] by constraining both juvenile survival and recapture probabilities with distance from the natal nest to the centre of the study area (‘DC’) and checked for interactions between ‘DC’ and the ‘HD’ to test for date dependent emigration. If an interaction was found, survival was predicted for near the centre of the study area (DC = 1000 m) to control for date dependent emigration.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used AIC in model selection [
   <a rid="pone.0162643.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0162643.ref036">36</a>]. We first examined relative support for variables ‘synchrony’ and ‘HD’ using cumulative Akaike weights. Because ‘synchrony’ was included in more models than ‘HD’ due to variable ‘peak height’ we averaged the cumulative QAIC-weights. When predicting the responses to synchrony, we first examined if the best model containing the variable of interest (either ‘synchrony’ or ‘HD’) received a better model fit (i.e., smaller QAIC) when the other competing factor and its quadratic term where included in the model. This was done when predicting the response to synchrony in order to control for the effect of timing in relation to others. Uncertainty in model selection was considered by calculating weighted average survival estimates from models with ΔQAIC &lt;2 [
