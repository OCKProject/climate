 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a standalone effect, time-dependence indicated strong directional selection for early breeding in the willow tit (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g003" href="#pone.0162643.g003">Fig 3a</a>). However, distance to the centre interacted with the timing variables. Near the edge of the study area, survival rates declined strongly in time as if there was strong directional selection for early breeding, but at the centre of the study area, where the effect of emigration is smaller, average timing resulted in the highest survival (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g003" href="#pone.0162643.g003">Fig 3b</a>). After controlling for such date dependent dispersal, it seems that selection is more or less balancing (Figs 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g001" href="#pone.0162643.g001">1d</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g003" href="#pone.0162643.g003">3b</a>). This result is more realistic because without the correction the results would suggest that there are no costs from demanding early season conditions, which were apparent to the great tit.
