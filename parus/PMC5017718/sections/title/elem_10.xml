 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Willow tits bred on average 7 to 8 days earlier than the occurrence of the food peak (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g001" href="#pone.0162643.g001">Fig 1c</a>). Local recruitment was strongly affected by hatching date (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162643.s005" href="#pone.0162643.s005">S3</a>, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162643.s006" href="#pone.0162643.s006">S4</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162643.s012" href="#pone.0162643.s012">S10</a> Tables), a standalone effect suggesting strong directional selection for early breeding (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g003" href="#pone.0162643.g003">Fig 3a</a>). However, distance to the centre of the study area had a negative impact on local recruitment (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162643.s005" href="#pone.0162643.s005">S3</a>, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162643.s006" href="#pone.0162643.s006">S4</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162643.s012" href="#pone.0162643.s012">S10</a> Tables; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g002" href="#pone.0162643.g002">Fig 2</a>) indicating that individuals born at the edge of the study area had higher probability of emigration. Furthermore, distance to the centre of the study area interacted with both linear and quadratic terms of hatching date (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162643.s005" href="#pone.0162643.s005">S3</a>, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162643.s006" href="#pone.0162643.s006">S4</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162643.s012" href="#pone.0162643.s012">S10</a> Tables; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g003" href="#pone.0162643.g003">Fig 3</a>). The interaction means that for individuals that originated at the edge of the study area, hatching early was extremely important for recruitment into the study area (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g003" href="#pone.0162643.g003">Fig 3b</a>). However, for birds that originated close to the centre of the study area, average hatching resulted in the highest local recruitment (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g003" href="#pone.0162643.g003">Fig 3b</a>). These interactions suggest date-dependent dispersal, which should be accounted for. We thus used a distance of 1000 metres from the centre of the study area to derive model predictions (i.e. controlling for emigration), that suggested the highest local recruitment to be achieved by hatching one to three days before average (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g001" href="#pone.0162643.g001">Fig 1d</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The hatching date was 5,718.0 times more important than synchrony when explaining local recruitment. Synchrony increased model support when included with the best model with hatching date (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162643.s008" href="#pone.0162643.s008">S6 Table</a>). Nevertheless, its impact remained small (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162643.s011" href="#pone.0162643.s011">S9 Table</a>). When controlling for hatching date (= 0), local recruitment was the highest when synchrony was good, i.e. chicks were 10 days old (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g001" href="#pone.0162643.g001">Fig 1c</a>). Local recruitment was also affected by mass and density but no interactions with hatching date or synchrony were found (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effect of caterpillar biomass on local recruitment was dependent on the hatching date. If hatching date was included, caterpillar biomasses of all periods considered increased local recruitment (

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162643.s016" href="#pone.0162643.s016">S14</a> Tables). The effect was particularly strong for ages 0–18 days and 8–13 days (ΔAIC ≥ 10;
