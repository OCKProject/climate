Because ‘synchrony’ was included in more models than ‘HD’ due to variable ‘peak height’ we averaged the cumulative QAIC-weights. When predicting the responses to synchrony, we first examined if the best model containing the variable of interest (either ‘synchrony’ or ‘HD’) received a better model fit (i.e., smaller QAIC) when the other competing factor and its quadratic term where included in the model. This was done when predicting the response to synchrony in order to control for the effect of timing in relation to others. Uncertainty in model selection was considered by calculating weighted average survival estimates from models with ΔQAIC &lt;2 [
