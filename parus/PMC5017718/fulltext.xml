Breeding phenology even in similar species can differ due to different selective pressures on the timing of reproduction. These selection pressures define species&#x02019; responses to warming springs. The temporal match-mismatch hypothesis suggests that timing of breeding in animals is selected to match with food availability (synchrony). Alternatively, time-dependent breeding success (the date hypothesis) can result from other seasonally deteriorating ecological conditions such as intra- or interspecific competition or predation. We studied the effects of two ultimate factors on the timing of breeding, synchrony and other time-dependent factors (time-dependence), in sympatric populations of two related forest-dwelling passerine species, the great tit (<italic>Parus major</italic>) and the willow tit (<italic>Poecile montanus</italic>) by modelling recruitment with long-term capture-recapture data. We hypothesized that these two factors have different relevance for fitness in these species. We found that local recruitment in both species showed quadratic relationships with both time-dependence and synchrony. However, the importance of these factors was markedly different between the studied species. Caterpillar food played a predominant role in predicting the timing of breeding of the great tit. In contrast, for the willow tit time-dependence modelled as timing in relation to conspecifics was more important for local recruitment than synchrony. High caterpillar biomass experienced during the pre- and post-fledging periods increased local recruitment of both species. These contrasting results confirm that these species experience different selective pressures upon the timing of breeding, and hence responses to climate change may differ. Detailed information about life-history strategies is required to understand the effects of climate change, even in closely related taxa. The temporal match-mismatch hypothesis should be extended to consider subsequent critical periods when food needs to be abundantly available.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005876</institution-id><institution>Biotieteiden ja Ymp&#x000e4;rist&#x000f6;n Tutkimuksen Toimikunta</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>128193</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orell</surname><given-names>Markku</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005876</institution-id><institution>Biotieteiden ja Ymp&#x000e4;rist&#x000f6;n Tutkimuksen Toimikunta</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>258638</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orell</surname><given-names>Markku</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Thule Institute of the University of Oulu</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orell</surname><given-names>Markku</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>Foundations Professor Pool</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orell</surname><given-names>Markku</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005876</institution-id><institution>Biotieteiden ja Ymp&#x000e4;rist&#x000f6;n Tutkimuksen Toimikunta</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>278759</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pakanen</surname><given-names>Veli-Matti</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The Academy of Finland, Research Council for Biosciences and Environment (to MO, project numbers 128193 and 258638; to VMP, project number 278759) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.aka.fi/en/">http://www.aka.fi/en/</ext-link>, Thule Institute of the University of Oulu (to MO) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.oulu.fi/thuleinstitute/">http://www.oulu.fi/thuleinstitute/</ext-link>, and Foundations&#x02019; Professor Pool (to MO) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.professoripooli.fi/index_en.php?cat=1&#x00026;lang=3">http://www.professoripooli.fi/index_en.php?cat=1&#x00026;lang=3</ext-link>.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="15"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>Capture-recapture data are available from the Dryad database: doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.3045r">10.5061/dryad.3045r</ext-link>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>Capture-recapture data are available from the Dryad database: doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.3045r">10.5061/dryad.3045r</ext-link>.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Correct timing of reproduction is crucial in seasonal environments [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Ecological factors affecting the timing of reproduction as well as the underlying physiological mechanisms have been widely studied, particularly since climate warming has caused many species to advance their reproduction [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

The temporal match-mismatch hypothesis suggests that timing of breeding in animals is selected to match with food availability so that the timing of the highest food demand of offspring is synchronous with the food availability peak [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], resulting in stabilizing selection [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Ongoing climate change has rapidly changed phenologies at lower trophic levels, sometimes leading to temporal mismatches that have caused directional selection pressures on the timing of reproduction of their predators [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Alternatively, time-dependent breeding success can also cause directional selection for earlier breeding (the date hypothesis, [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]); a universal phenomenon [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] mainly caused by seasonally deteriorating conditions [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0162643.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Time-dependence is particularly important for resident species with intraspecific competition for territories and dominance positions [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Earlier born individuals benefit from prior residency, better access to territory ownership and dominant positions in conspecific winter flocks [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These benefits enhance their survival prospects in relation to late born young [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, timing of breeding with respect to conspecifics is of major importance in species that have territorial groups with social hierarchy [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and may outweigh the benefits of a temporal match with abundant food resources. Interspecific competition for resources (e.g. nesting sites or food) is another time-dependent factor that may cause species with low competition abilities to benefit from breeding early [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Also, the predation escape hypothesis [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] predicts directional selection for earlier breeding if early breeding individuals and their offspring avoid the highest predation pressure either during the breeding event or in later life-history stages (e.g. during migration).</p><p>Much of the work on the ecological consequences of climate change has focused on the shifts in the timing of breeding following warming spring temperatures, trophic mismatches and resulting effects on breeding success and population size [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0162643.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0162643.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Yet, effects of other time-dependent selective pressures on the current evolution of reproductive timing have so far received much less attention. Differences in other life history stages can strongly affect species&#x02019; responses to warming springs [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], even in coexisting closely related species [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Comparison of sympatric populations of closely related species that differ in some aspects of life history can increase our understanding about the mechanisms underlying these different responses.</p><p>We studied the ultimate factors on the timing of breeding: phenological mismatch and time-dependence, in sympatric populations of two related forest-dwelling passerine species in northern Finland, the great tit (<italic>Parus major</italic>, L.) and the willow tit (<italic>Poecile montanus</italic>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Conrad_von_Baldenstein">Conrad</ext-link>). Both species have temporally advanced their breeding along with the availability of their main prey, insect larvae [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, these species differ in the timing of breeding yet they rely on the same main food source (insect larvae) during the nestling stage [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The great tits time their breeding so that the period of the highest food needs of the nestlings (around the age of 10 days) co-occurs with the period of the highest food availability i.e. caterpillar peak [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Among Parids, such timing of breeding is considered being in good synchrony, a phenological match [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In contrast, boreal willow tits often breed earlier and in poor synchrony with caterpillar food [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We therefore hypothesize that the two ultimate factors affecting the timing of breeding have different relevance for fitness in two study species. We tested this with long-term capture-recapture data (1999&#x02013;2012) by modelling recruitment, the life history stage that ultimately determines fitness [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The results confirmed that local recruitment of great tits was strongly dependent on caterpillar food, whereas in the willow tit, local recruitment depended on the timing of conspecifics, not caterpillar food.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Field methods</title><p>The data were collected in Oulu, Finland (N 65&#x000b0;08', E 25&#x000b0;53') between 1999 and 2012. The study area contains coniferous, deciduous and mixed forests of varying ages and is a part of a continuous managed forest landscape (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162643.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The main trees include birch (<italic>Betula</italic> sp.), Scotch pine (<italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic>) and spruce (<italic>Picea abies</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The willow tit study area is uniform, roundish shaped and ca. 25 km<sup>2</sup> in size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162643.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The great tit study area (ca. 8 km<sup>2</sup>) overlaps that of the willow tits, but is very different in shape (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162643.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The number of nest boxes was ca. 400 throughout the study period. Intensive field routines ensured that almost all nests were found and all individuals were ringed [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We started searching for territories and nests in early-April. We recorded dates when laying started and visited the nests until clutches were complete. Average clutch sizes are 7.6 eggs for willow tits [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and 10 for great tits [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].

Nestlings were marked with aluminium rings when 13&#x02013;15 days old, before fledging which occurs at the age of 18 days [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Recruitment was recorded by recapturing parent birds at their nests in subsequent years. All adults were ringed with individual colour codes. All field procedures adhered to Finnish national legislation. Trapping and ringing of animals was done under license from the Finnish Natural History Museum in Helsinki. This work did not involve invasive sampling that requires permits from the National Animal Experiment Board. Field studies were performed on private and government lands. People have the right to access the Finnish land areas freely under the traditional Finnish legal concept known as everyman's right unless specifically protected or prohibited.</p><p>In the study populations, Parids mostly forage on caterpillars (e.g. <italic>Epirrita autumnata</italic>) occurring in birches (<italic>Betula</italic> spp.) during the breeding season [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The frassfall method was used to estimate caterpillar availability [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The quantity of caterpillar droppings falling on a certain area (m<sup>2</sup>) per unit of time (day) was used to estimate the biomass of caterpillars foraging on birch for weekly periods. We used five collectors (one per tree) in four different places (20 collectors) to control for spatial variation in caterpillar phenology within the study area. The annual peak dates of caterpillar abundance were determined to be the middle day of a period when the biomass was at its highest. However, the annual peaks occurred almost always in the same week in different locations. Highly synchronous caterpillar phenology is a consequence of the very synchronous bud burst of birch in the study area; supposedly as this is a very flat area (15&#x02013;30 m above sea level). Therefore, a single caterpillar peak date was employed for the entire study area.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Data analyses</title><p>Apparent juvenile survival from fledging to one year of age (i.e. local recruitment) was analysed from marked fledglings (<italic>P</italic>. <italic>major</italic>: 6294 individuals, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>montanus</italic>: 7224 individuals) born in first, replacement and second nests.

However, the importance of these factors was strongly different. As expected, caterpillar food played a predominant role in predicting the timing of breeding of the great tit&#x02013;synchrony explained recruitment 3.4 times better than timing. In contrast, for the willow tit, synchrony was outweighed by timing related factors, with timing explaining local recruitment 5,718.0 times better than synchrony. High caterpillar biomass experienced during the pre- and post-fledging periods increased the local recruitment of both species. These contrasting results suggest that different life history strategies of these species result in differential selection pressures acting on the timing of breeding, and hence responses to climate change may differ.</p><sec id="sec010"><title>The relevance of temporal match with the food peak</title><p>Despite the apparent good timing of the great tit with caterpillar prey [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], we found that local recruitment was the highest in broods in which the young were 15&#x02013;19 days old when the food availability peaked, i.e., at the time of fledging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g001">Fig 1a</xref>). In accordance, caterpillar biomass during the post-fledging stage (i.e. ages 18&#x02013;25) was the most influential for local recruitment. Thus, the commonly used measure for &#x02018;good synchrony&#x02019; (temporal match between the time of the highest food demand of the nestlings at the age of 10 days and the highest food availability) may not be universal. The temporal match-mismatch hypothesis should be extended to consider several critical periods when high-quality food needs to be abundantly available&#x02013;not only the period of the fastest growth of the offspring, but also the time of newly fledged young learning to forage independently&#x02013;for the breeding event to be successful.</p><p>The great tit thus appears to breed too late to maximize local recruitment in the northern conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g001">Fig 1a</xref>). Originally a temperate species, great tits have shown the ability to advance breeding [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], but may be unable to start breeding at the time that would maximize local recruitment in the northern conditions. Early breeding may be constrained by possible carry-over effects from wintering, high energetic requirements of egg-laying and incubation or food shortage during the nestling stage [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0162643.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Thus, the realized timing may be the most optimal possible solution [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The effect of synchrony (but less that of timing) on the local recruitment of the great tit depended on population density (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162643.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). In high densities, early breeding in relation to the caterpillar peak resulted in the highest survival. Therefore, conspecific competition between young may select for earlier breeding, and partly explain the lack of association between peak food demand (10 days old chicks) and highest survival. As the early fledged young are presumably dominant over late fledging young, early fledged young may have higher survival during the period just after gaining independence [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. These results are congruent with [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] who found stronger selection on early laying date with increasing population density in a great tit population. This effect may result from differences in quality of territories or from early hatching young faring well in competition for food later in their first autumn and winter [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. It is also possible that high densities result from good conditions (e.g. the abundance of other food sources or weather) that favour survival. Nevertheless, it seems that selection on the timing of breeding is stabilizing at average or lower densities when conditions may be less favourable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g001">Fig 1b</xref>).</p><p>Willow tits timed their breeding so that the young fledged on average at the time of the highest caterpillar availability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g001">Fig 1c</xref>). Interestingly, while such synchrony maximized local recruitment for the great tit, local recruitment for the willow tit appeared the highest when the chicks were ca. 10 days old at the time of the highest caterpillar availability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g001">Fig 1c</xref>). This is consistent with theory on phenological matching in Parids [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In addition, high caterpillar biomass during the nestling stage (but not post-fledging) increased local recruitment but only when timing in relation to conspecifics was considered. The willow tit therefore breeds before the peak of food abundance despite the fact that high caterpillar availability is beneficial for the survival of the young. Such behaviour is apparently adaptive because of other factors affecting the timing of breeding [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Strong directional selection or date dependent dispersal?</title><p>As a standalone effect, time-dependence indicated strong directional selection for early breeding in the willow tit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g003">Fig 3a</xref>). However, distance to the centre interacted with the timing variables.

However, we note that while it is important for willow tits to breed in relation to conspecifics this mechanism does not seem to result in strong selection for early breeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162643.g001">Fig 1d</xref>), rather they should not breed too late.</p><p>This view is supported by ecologically similar species that winter in small flocks with strong social hierarchies and food hoarding, and also breed early in relation to caterpillar food (e.g. the marsh tit (<italic>P</italic>. <italic>palustris</italic>; [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0162643.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], the Siberian tit (<italic>P</italic>. <italic>cincta</italic>; [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], the crested tit (<italic>Lophophanes cristatus</italic>; [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]). Most temperate and boreal Parids show similar social systems linked with food hoarding during winter [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Interestingly, great tits and blue tits (<italic>Cyanistes caeruleus</italic>) time their breeding to match with caterpillar food, and are exceptions to this rule [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0162643.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In the boreal zone, they winter in constantly changing non-territorial flocks in areas that may be located far from their future breeding territories, and while prior residence affects dominance relationships, it does not dictate access to wintering groups [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0162643.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Thus, a possible explanation for the lower importance of timing breeding in relation to conspecifics in the great tit may be linked to different adaptations for wintering.</p><p>Although the relevance of social influences during the non-breeding season on the timing of breeding is a reasonable explanation, our results do not strictly confirm this mechanism to be the ultimate one for the different fitness responses. We cannot exclude interspecific competition for nesting sites [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] or for food during the nestling period [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], both of which may result in temporal niche separation, that is, phenological differences in the timing of breeding. Poor competitors may escape competition by breeding earlier than their competitors, gaining higher breeding success than when breeding in synchrony with the competitors. Likewise, early breeding may result in a temporal escape from a high predation pressure [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0162643.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Both of these factors may function as mechanisms for time-dependent, directional selection pressures.</p><p>In migratory species, selection pressures related to migratory behaviour can constrain the timing of breeding [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and therefore they are likely to show higher levels of mismatch with food availability than resident species. Our results suggest that a similar pattern of divergent ultimate factors in the timing of breeding can be found also among resident, related species. A certain breeding/wintering strategy is possible only if species&#x02019; other life history characteristics permit it. For example, the willow tit can use its winter food caches as an energy resource for egg production and a more diverse diet for providing their young [<xref rid="pone.0162643.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0162643.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Thus, it can breed early with its breeding success being less conditional on the phenological match with the caterpillar peak than in the great tit.</p><p>Natural selection operates on the timing of breeding via several ultimate factors. Our species comparison provides evidence for the importance of life history differences in responses to the climate change. One life history characteristic, e.g. the wintering strategy or the competition ability, can function as a leverage point for the evolution of other characteristics, including the timing of breeding. Thus, detailed information on life histories is required when trying to understand the evolutionary and ecological consequences of climate change.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec013"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0162643.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Map of the study area.</title><p>The great tit study area is shown with the location of the boxes and the boundaries of the willow tit study area are depicted by a line drawn from the outermost nests observed during the study.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0162643.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0162643.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Effects of density and synchrony to local recruitment of great tits.</title><p>Local recruitment of the great tit in relation to synchrony with the caterpillar food peak (synchrony = day of 10 days old young&#x02013;caterpillar peak day, i.e. chicks are 10 days old at the peak day) in high densities (black lines; 940 individual / study area) and in low densities (red lines; 488 individuals / study area).
