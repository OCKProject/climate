 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Parasites have been suggested as a selective force since they might shape host community dynamics [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref001">1</a>], alter interspecific competition and influence energy flow [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref002">2</a>]. An essential trait in studies of host-parasite interactions is prevalence (i.e. the proportion of individuals infected by a parasite or pathogen in a population at one point in time [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref003">3</a>]). The importance of prevalence is reflected in the amount of studies showing how major ecological factors shaped its intra- and interspecific variation [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref004">4</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref005">5</a>]. In bird communities, geographic areas, environmental issues or host species/population have been suggested as factors determining prevalence [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref006">6</a>]. However, more studies are still needed in order to understand the main factors affecting parasite prevalence at the community level.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inferences about host-parasite dynamics based on prevalence may sometimes be difficult, because by definition prevalence combines all host individuals within the same species by a single metric. This approach inherently disregards within-species variance in susceptibility to parasitism. However, considerable among-individual differences may arise due to the fact that different host individuals are in different age or in condition or under the influence of different environmental factors, which all affect the probability of being found infected by a particular parasite [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref007">7</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref009">9</a>]. Accordingly, if a population sample is composed of individuals with different infection status, detected prevalence can vary within a species depending on the individual composition of the sample. As a result, prevalence can be remarkably different in the same species if it is sampled under different environmental conditions [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref010">10</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref011">11</a>]. Therefore, to understand how parasite prevalence is shaped at the community level, it is also crucial to account for among-individual differences in infection status that helps elucidate mechanisms that act at the within-species and the between-species level in the host.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Avian 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> spp. represent a well-studied host-parasite system. These parasites are vector-transmitted organisms that can cause host mortality or morbidity during the acute phase of infection impacting the life histories of their hosts [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref012">12</a>]. Their life-cycle is complex, involving sexual stages in their dipteran vectors and asexual stages in their vertebrate hosts [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref012">12</a>]. Prevalence and infection status of these parasites may be affected by different factors concerning the vector, hosts and the parasites themselves [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref012">12</a>]. Some authors have focused their attention on the possibility that host traits might determine prevalence of these parasites [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref013">13</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref015">15</a>]. For instance, blood parasite susceptibility of both bird individual [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref016">16</a>] and bird species [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref017">17</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref018">18</a>] have been recently suggested as factors affecting prevalence. In this sense, some bird species may have developed species-specific tolerance and resistance mechanisms [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref019">19</a>] underlying the importance of bird species as units in prevalence studies. However, given that individuals within the same species can also depict remarkable variation in terms of susceptibility to parasitism, it would also be essential to account for this variation in interspecific studies of prevalence.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to characteristics of hosts, characteristics of parasites themselves can affect their prevalence in wild communities. Haemosporidians parasites present high plasticity and versatility reflected in the number of parasite lineages found among bird species. Thus, within haemosporidian parasites there are more than 3000 parasite lineages [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref020">20</a>] infecting more that 1500 bird species. Each of these lineages may have different virulence [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref021">21</a>], which could result in an array of different negative effects within the hosts. The plasticity that malaria lineages may have [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref022">22</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref023">23</a>] allow these parasites to fully exploit hosts making them able to respond to changes in the physiological state of the host or the environment [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref024">24</a>]. Thus, prevalence displayed by parasite lineage in a determined host species or individual is simply the interaction between host immune defences (susceptibility or tolerance) and parasite strategy (virulence). Additionally, malaria parasites must find the correct host in order to complete its life cycle and achieve a high transmission rate [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref003">3</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref025">25</a>]. In this sense, two main hypotheses have been suggested to explain the evolutionary mechanisms driving the positive abundance-occupancy relationship (AOR) in parasites. On the one hand, the trade-off hypothesis (TOH) suggests that parasites exploiting many host species will achieve lower mean abundance in these hosts than more host-specific parasites because of the presumably higher costs of adaptations against multiple defence systems [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref026">26</a>]. On the other hand, the resource breadth hypothesis (RBH) predicts that the same attributes that enable species to exploit a variety of hosts allow them to attain higher densities in these hosts [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref027">27</a>]. Thus, a positive correlation between distribution and local abundance is expected, where generalist parasites will attain higher prevalence than more host-specific parasites. These two hypotheses have been broadly discussed and specialist parasites are supposed to display higher prevalence and parasitemia (TOH) on their avian hosts [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref028">28</a>] while generalist parasite can occasionally cause significant mortalities in native birds. However, and despite the large number of studies focused on haemosporidian parasites, there are a scarce number of them dealing with factors affecting prevalence in wild communities from the perspectives of both the host and parasites.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> spp. might be detected in several host species that can be distantly or closely related to each other [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref029">29</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref031">31</a>]. Mechanisms allowing the parasite to switch host is a central issue nowadays in avian malaria studies [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref032">32</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref033">33</a>]. Host switching mechanism is a strategy that malaria parasites may use, in order to infect larger number of bird species [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref033">33</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref034">34</a>], whereby closely related parasite lineages may be detected in bird species with similar immune defences [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref035">35</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref037">37</a>]. Thus, parasite lineages infecting closely related bird species may exhibit the same exploitation strategy to avoid host defences [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref038">38</a>]. Conversely, more generalist parasites would be able to infect a broad range of bird species that might be distantly related [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref039">39</a>]. Analysing phylogenetic distances between bird species sharing the same parasite lineages becomes essential in community studies in order to determine parasite strategies and how specialist and generalist parasites exploit different host species. However, little is know about how haemosporidian parasite lineages infect bird host species depending on the host phylogenetic distance.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fact that haemosporidian parasites need a vector for completing their cycle life extends the number of elements affecting prevalence of these parasites. Although some studies have shown limited or no relationship between climate and prevalence [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref040">40</a>], some have shown that vector populations might increase their number due to climate change and, therefore, vector-borne infectious diseases may increase every year [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref041">41</a>]. Vector availability might also change among seasons, thus, during summer the amount of vectors in the wild increase [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref042">42</a>] raising the probabilities to become infected [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref043">43</a>]. During this season, the probability of host individuals of becoming infected increases significantly not only because of vector availability but also because of the secretion of sexual hormones that may alter immune system and, therefore, facilitate the entrance of blood parasite in the vertebrate host [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref044">44</a>]. These studies emphasize the importance of including both year and season of sampling for studies focusing on host-parasite dynamics of haemosporidians when analysing communities.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main aim of this study is to analyse factors that potentially affect infection status by haemosporidian parasites in a wild community of birds. We will work at the individual level and examine if the incidence of infection by different haemosporidian parasites is influenced by aspects at the individual level (identity and seasonal status), species-specific effects (i.e. effects due to species identity and phylogeny) and parasite-specific effects (i.e. effects due to lineage identity and phylogeny). Furthermore, we will also compare the phylogenetic distances among bird species infected with the same parasite lineage in order to determine whether the same parasite lineage infects host species that are phylogenetically related.</p>
