 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study was carried out from February to October during a 9-year period (2002–2010) in the surroundings of Badajoz (SW Spain) (38°53’00”N 06°58’00”W). Birds were collected always during the sunrise and during the early hours of the morning. Using a mist-net system, we captured a total of 815 adult individuals from 21 bird species belonging to nine different families. We obtained one microcapillary of blood (70μl) from the brachial vein of each individual and stored it in 500 μl of 96% ethanol until analysis. Ethanol (96–100%) is an excellent killing agent and preservative for tissues [

Upon capture we recorded the following variables: calendar date, year and if the bird species was breeding or not.
