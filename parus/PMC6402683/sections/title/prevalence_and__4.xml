 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">DNA from the avian blood samples was extracted in the laboratory using a standard chloroform ⁄ isoamylalcohol method [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref049">49</a>]. Diluted genomic DNA (25 ng/μL) was used as a template in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for detection of the parasites using the nested-PCR protocols described [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref050">50</a>]. The amplification was evaluated by running 2.5 μL of the final PCR on a 2% agarose gel. All PCR experiments contained one negative control for every eight samples. In the very few cases of negative controls showing signs of amplification (never more than faint bands in agarose gels), the whole PCR-batch was run again to make sure that all positives were true. All samples with positive amplification were sequenced directly using procedures described in [
