 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For our statistical models (see below) we created two different phylogenetic trees (supporting information 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205624.s001" href="#pone.0205624.s001">S1 Fig</a>) to control for the common descent of different parties: one for the host of bird species (model 1) and one for the parasite lineages (model 2). The first one relied on the 1000 trees generated by the birdtree.org website [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref055">55</a>], from which a consensus tree was created for the sampled 21 species by using Geneious v5.4 [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref056">56</a>]. The second tree relied on the sequences of the parasite lineages [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref020">20</a>] identified in this study. Then, we created a phylogenetic tree using MrBayes 3.1 [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref057">57</a>]. We used jModelTest 0.1 [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref058" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref058">58</a>] in order to determine which parasite tree offered the best fit to our data. The burn-in was identified through Tracer 1.2.2 [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref059" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref059">59</a>]. We sampled 10 million generations at intervals of 1000. Finally we analysed the files generated by Bayesian MCMC runs by MrBayes in Tracer with the objective of confirm whether the parasite tree generated was the most adequate to our analyses. These phylogenetic trees were entered in the subsequent statistical models sequentially to evaluate the same list of predictors (first, we run the model using the bird phylogenetic tree (model 1) and then we run the same model but we used the parasite phylogenetic tree (model 2)).
