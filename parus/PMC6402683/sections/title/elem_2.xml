  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study was carried out from February to October during a 9-year period (2002–2010) in the surroundings of Badajoz (SW Spain) (38°53’00”N 06°58’00”W). Birds were collected always during the sunrise and during the early hours of the morning. Using a mist-net system, we captured a total of 815 adult individuals from 21 bird species belonging to nine different families. We obtained one microcapillary of blood (70μl) from the brachial vein of each individual and stored it in 500 μl of 96% ethanol until analysis. Ethanol (96–100%) is an excellent killing agent and preservative for tissues [

Upon capture we recorded the following variables: calendar date, year and if the bird species was breeding or not.

   <a rid="pone.0205624.ref059" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref059">59</a>]. We sampled 10 million generations at intervals of 1000. Finally we analysed the files generated by Bayesian MCMC runs by MrBayes in Tracer with the objective of confirm whether the parasite tree generated was the most adequate to our analyses. These phylogenetic trees were entered in the subsequent statistical models sequentially to evaluate the same list of predictors (first, we run the model using the bird phylogenetic tree (model 1) and then we run the same model but we used the parasite phylogenetic tree (model 2)).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given that our parasite screening method allowed us to detect infection status (yes or no) at the individual level for each parasite lineage screened, we regarded these screen results as multiple observations within the same individuals. Therefore, for our statistical modelling we focused on these observations as the units of analyses, while incorporating higher-level hierarchical effects due to host individuals in the statistical model. Accordingly, we applied a generalized mixed models (GLMM) to partition different variance components and to assess the effect of predictors on the binary state variable describing if a particular individual was infected by a particular parasite lineage or not. Accordingly, our general model incorporated the following fixed effects: date (reflecting environmental effects), breeding season (yes or no); and the following random effects: identity of individuals, identity of host species and identity of parasite lineage, the interaction between the latter two (the combination of bird species and parasite lineage by simply using the interaction between the organism names), year of sampling, and the phylogeny of either the host (model 1) or the parasite (model 2). The structure of our focal model defining the probability of a given individual of a host species being infected by a given parasite lineage in a given year (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To fit the above model, we used the Bayesian framework for GLMM incorporating Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation available in the package ‘MCMCglmm’ [
   <a rid="pone.0205624.ref061" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref061">61</a>]. Because dependent variable (a given parasite lineage detected or not in a given individual of a given species) is a binary state variable, we adopted the “categorical” family of the available error distribution. Year of sampling, parasite lineage, bird individual, host species and phylogenetic relationships (parasite or host) were used as random factors. Additionally, we included the interaction between host species and parasite lineage as a random factors. Plots were made with the R package ggplot2 v. 2.1.0 [
   <a rid="pone.0205624.ref062" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref062">62</a>]. All the statistical analyses were carried out with the program R v.1.1.383 [
   <a rid="pone.0205624.ref063" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref063">63</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model reports the mean of the posterior density distribution of model parameters with 95% credible intervals (CI) for independent variables, which indicate the precision of an estimate. Since the model provides parameter estimates (regression slopes) on the logit scale, we back transformed the results for the fixed effects by using the formula e 
   <span class="sup">mean</span> / (1+ e 
   <span class="sup">mean</span>) in order to assess the determinants of the probability of infection on the level of host individuals. In order to explain the effect of random factors, we calculated the marginal parameter modes using kernel density estimation [
   <a rid="pone.0205624.ref061" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref061">61</a>] to partition the variance in the dependent variable (and variance components) on logit scale that is explained by each random factor with 95% credible intervals (CI).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used uninformative priors with a low degree of belief in all parameters due to the scarce prior knowledge about the effect of all these variables on our model, according to the standards suggested by Hadfiled [
   <a rid="pone.0205624.ref061" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref061">61</a>]. The model was run for 180000 iterations preceded by a burn-in of 30000 iterations, and sampling every 100 iterations to avoid autocorrelation. Models were run several times in order to avoid convergence.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We examined phylogenetic relatedness of bird species infected by the same lineages, and determined if species with non-zero prevalence are more closely related to each other than could be expected by chance. For this analyses, therefore, we worked on species-level prevalences. The significance of this metric was tested by comparison to a null distribution derived from 999 random permutations among the tips of the phylogenetic tree followed by calculation of the mean pairwise distance (MPD). Calculations were carried out with the ses.mpd function of the R package Picante [
   <a rid="pone.0205624.ref064" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref064">64</a>]. That analysis provides different values that may determine the MPD. The value called “MPDobs” defines the observed mean pair-wise phylogenetic distance between all species pairs infected with the parasite. The mean and standard deviation of MPD in the null distribution were obtained by randomization of species in the phylogenetic distance matrix (taxa.labels method in Picante). The value called “Z” is calculated by following this formula (MPDobs–mean MPD of the null distribution)/SD of the null distribution. Negative values of Z indicate greater phylogenetic homogeneity (clustering). P is the probability of drawing an MPD from the null distribution at least as extreme as MPDobs, based on 999 randomizations.
