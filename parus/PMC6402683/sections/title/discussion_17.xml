 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study of haemosporidian parasites infecting a community of wild birds breeding in the same area, we found that variation in infection status might be mainly affected by the interaction between host bird species and slightly by parasite lineage. We also found that during breeding season infection status is significantly higher than during non-breeding season. Additionally, we showed that 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">relictum</span> SGS1 is present in most of the bird species but with variable prevalence, while other parasites are more specialist parasites infecting fewer and close related host species as 
  <span class="italic">H</span>. 
  <span class="italic">passeris</span> PADOM05. Below, we discuss these main results in detail.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Virulence of 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> spp. might be highly variable between species and lineages. Some malaria parasites might affect host fitness [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref065" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref065">65</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref066" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref066">66</a>] and others might even influence survival [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref067" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref067">67</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref069" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref069">69</a>]. Conversely, host bird species might also differ in the prevalence displayed due to the tolerance or susceptibility of each organism [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref016">16</a>]. In this sense, the interaction between parasite lineage and host bird species ultimately determines infection severity and therefore prevalence. This idea has been previously suggested by Medeiros et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref035">35</a>] where they found that the host-pathogen compatibility might determine the parasite range. Our results support this hypothesis where variation in prevalence was mainly affected by the interaction between parasite lineage and bird host species. In this sense, it has been showed that avian malaria parasites (
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium ashfordi</span>) express a particular host-specific expression pattern depending on the infected bird [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref016">16</a>]. That study highlighted the role that the interaction between host immune defence (susceptibility or resistance to parasites) and parasite strategy (virulence) may play in the prevalence displayed. Despite the number of studies focused on host-parasite interactions, the knowledge about the mechanisms behind it is still limited [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref070" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref070">70</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref071" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref071">71</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With regard to the previous results, variation in infection status was slightly affected by parasite lineage. These results emphasize the importance not only of the host-parasite interaction 
  <span class="italic">per se</span> but also the parasite exploitation strategy that might vary depending on the bird identity [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref016">16</a>]. In this sense, it has been shown that avian malaria parasites might develop a wide range of different strategies in order to avoid host defenses. For example, 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> spp. can display some evasive mechanisms evading host defenses by clonal antigenic switches [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref072" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref072">72</a>] or even avoid consequences of recognition by the immune system [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref073" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref073">73</a>]. Additionally, it has been shown that, during mix infections, these parasite might compete with one another for access to the available hosts, thus, some lineages show more prevalence in certain bird species simply because an specific lineage may eliminate other parasite species [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref030">30</a>]. Hence, parasite lineage might play an essential role determining the prevalence displayed in a host rather the host bird species itself.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to our results, breeding season might affect the probability of becoming infected in the community. Previous studies have shown that, during the breeding season, prevalence of haemosporidian parasites can significantly increase [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref074" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref074">74</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref075" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref075">75</a>] as a consequence of vector availability. The increase of vectors in the community may expand blood parasites among individuals and, therefore, increase prevalence [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref042">42</a>]. In this sense, previous studies have suggested that the increase of vector availability might produce a proliferation of blood parasites during breeding season [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref076" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref076">76</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref077" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref077">77</a>]. Our results agree with this idea pointing out a clear connexion between breeding season, vector availability and prevalence of blood parasites.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the RBH and TOH hypotheses have been broadly discussed (e.g. [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref038">38</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref078" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref078">78</a>]) there is still no clear consensus about the importance of AOR within parasite ecology research. In this sense, and despite a considerable number of studies supporting the idea that specialist parasites might show higher prevalence than generalist parasites [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref079" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref079">79</a>], some studies have found different result supporting RBH. For instance, in Hawaii, birds 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium relictum</span> caused the extinction of native species of honeycreepers [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref080" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref080">80</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref081" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref081">81</a>] despite being one of the most generalist parasite species. In this sense, it has been suggested that generalist parasites (
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">relictum</span> GRW4 and SGS1) have the ability to infect a broad range of host species, but also display a high prevalence in some of them [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref082" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref082">82</a>]. Our results agree with this hypothesis, where 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">relictum</span> SGS1 was detected in most of the bird species infected, and it displayed differences in prevalence depending on the bird species. Moreover, this haemosporidian parasite lineage was detected in unrelated host species highlighting the parasite’s ability to adapt to distantly related host species and emphasizing the parasite’s generalist strategy. In the case of 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">relictum</span> SGS1 the number of potential host species is 123 [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref020">20</a>], where every host individual and species provide a different environment that need to be overcome by the plasticity of parasites [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref083" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref083">83</a>]. Although the mechanism underlying this plasticity is still unknown, it has been recently shown that the reticulocyte binding proteins, a polymorphic gene family involved in host cell invasion and attributed to host specificity [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref071" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref071">71</a>], is significantly expanded in 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">relictum</span> [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref084" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref084">84</a>]. This discovery could explain the ability of this parasite species to infect a wide range of avian species and its overwhelming capacity to infect a wide range of host species [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref084" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref084">84</a>]. Nevertheless, further studies are needed in order to assess mechanisms allowing generalist parasites to be present in a large number of bird species.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, our analysis revealed that the number of infected bird species by the same parasite lineage does not determine whether a parasite may be more or less specialist. In this sense, 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> spp. CCF2, HIPOL1 lineages were detected in distantly related bird species suggesting that, although each of these lineages was only detected in two bird species, they are not strict specialist parasites [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref038">38</a>]. Additionally, 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> spp. PADOM05, DELURB2 lineages and 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> spp. DELURB5, PADOM1, GRW9 spp. lineages were detected in closely related bird species suggesting that these lineages may tent to be specialist parasites [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref038">38</a>] in our community. The prevalence displayed by these parasite lineages varied depending on the bird species infecting. Thus, in house sparrows (
  <span class="italic">Passer domesticus</span>) prevalence was higher for specialist parasites (
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> spp. PADOM05) than for generalist parasites. In contrast, Spanish house sparrows (
  <span class="italic">Passer hispaniolensis</span>) displayed prevalence was higher for generalist parasites (
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">relictum</span> SGS1). These results agree with previous studies suggesting that, in certain cases, specialist parasites might arise higher prevalence than generalist parasites [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref079" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref079">79</a>] but, in other cases, generalist manage to reach high prevalence [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref082" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref082">82</a>]. This could be because generalist parasites can be better adapted to a subset of host species where they will present higher infection status [
  <a rid="pone.0205624.ref085" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205624.ref085">85</a>]. Our results can only confirm that the association of the parasite lineage and host bird species affects prevalence, and that this association is the ultimate factor affecting the prevalence in the community studied.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, we have shown that, at the community level, the interaction between host and parasite identity might have a stronger effect on the variation of infection status than bird host species or parasite lineage alone. These results highlight the importance of studies focusing on the community level and analysing how different parasite lineages might interact with a variety of host species. The present study also emphasizes that even parasites (such 
  <span class="italic">as P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">relictum</span> SGS1 and 
  <span class="italic">H</span>. 
  <span class="italic">passeris</span> PADOM05) that are considered as generalist or a specialist can display both high and low prevalence per host species. Taken as a whole, these results suggest that detected prevalence mainly result from the interaction between host immune defences and parasite exploitation strategy where parasite lineage might play an important role following an approach depending on the bird species.
