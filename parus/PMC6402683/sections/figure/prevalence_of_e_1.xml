  <div class="title">Prevalence of each parasite lineage in every host species found in the community.</div>
  <p>Bird species with no infection are not present in the figure. Lineages infecting more than one bird species have been colored marked while parasite lineages infected only one host species remain in grey. Note that depending on the underlying sample size, the size of the dots is proportional to the number of individuals.</p>
