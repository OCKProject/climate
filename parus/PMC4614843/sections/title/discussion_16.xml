 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reproductive parameters and body size changed due to the variation of temperature and feeding rate induced by controlled experiments in outdoor mesocosm treatments. When initial body size was controlled for, temperature was the major factor determining the reproductive time of 
  <span class="italic">P. nigromaculatus</span>, which showed a significantly earlier onset under the temperature scenario of post-hibernation warming in both feeding rate treatments. Feeding rate was the major predictor of the reproductive status of individuals, clutch size, and the variation of body size for this species, which showed significantly positive correlation with feeding rate in any temperature treatments. Thus, our study suggests that reproduction and body size of amphibians might be affected by climate warming or food availability variation that caused by climate warming. In addition, we provide new experimental evidence on the allocation strategies of amphibian individuals for adjusting their reproductive output to cope with climate warming.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because the reproductive output positively correlated with the body size of female frogs, inadequate sample sizes may not reflect the variation in clutch size. In this study, our samples covered a natural age structure of the species in each treatment, which were expected to be sufficient to reflect the reproductive variation. In addition, we used an appropriate feeding rate within expectations for this experiment. On one hand, we provided sufficient food for the frogs in these normal food treatments, as sometimes the larger ones did not consume all crickets at feeding time (
  <a rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-32">Lardner &amp; Loman, 2003</a>); on the other hand, even in the low food treatments, the SVL of these frogs increased and some of them even bred successfully.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recently, reports from the field have indicated that climate change has been pervasively affecting biological processes of many animals (
  <a rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-6">Blaustein et al., 2010</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-58">Visser, 2013</a>). Our results show compelling evidence that temperature rather than food availability is the main influencing factor for the reproductive time of female 
  <span class="italic">P. nigromaculatus</span>. A previous study about male calling behavior (i.e., breeding behavior for males) on Korean Peninsula also indicated that temperature was a significant factor for male 
  <span class="italic">P. nigromaculatus</span> (
  <a rid="ref-73" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-73">Yoo &amp; Jang, 2012</a>). This is possibly due to the fact that 
  <span class="italic">P. nigromaculatus</span> is summer breeder independently of weather and with a typical “explosive” phenology (
  <a rid="ref-70" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-70">Wells, 1977</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-15">Fei, 1999</a>). Amphibians, as ectothermic animals, have limited thermoregulation ability and they are exceedingly sensitive to climate change (
  <a rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-14">Feder &amp; Burggren, 1992</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-5">Blaustein et al., 2001</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-33">Lawler et al., 2010</a>). Hence, the aggregated reproduction of this species may be induced by an environmental cue, such as temperature (
  <a rid="ref-61" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-61">Visser et al., 2010</a>). This finding is consistent with those reports in lizards and birds, which showed that temperature could either affect reproductive events of side-blotched lizards (
  <span class="italic">Uta stansburiana</span>) (
  <a rid="ref-55" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-55">Tinkle &amp; Irwin, 1965</a>), or change timing of reproduction of great tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) (
  <a rid="ref-62" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-62">Visser, Holleman &amp; Caro, 2009</a>). As an explosive breeder, the few limited breeding days of 
  <span class="italic">P. nigromaculatus</span> are considered as the key determinant of life-history traits (
  <a rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-30">Kozlowski &amp; Teriokhin, 1999</a>). Therefore, these changes on breeding phenology induced by temperature would influence reproductive success and allocation trade-off pattern of this species. Furthermore, amphibian metabolism is positively correlated with temperature (
  <a rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-19">Gillooly et al., 2001</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-10">Dillon, Wang &amp; Huey, 2010</a>). When the food resource is fixed, there should be a higher energy consumption for metabolism under a warmer condition (
  <a rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-10">Dillon, Wang &amp; Huey, 2010</a>), and as a result, there is a lower energy investment in reproduction or growth. However, no effect of temperature on reproduction or growth parameters except reproductive time was found during our experiments. Our result contrasts with the experimental reports in tadpoles, which showed complex results where they either reduced or increased in size at metamorphosis under warmer temperatures (
  <a rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-1">Álvarez &amp; Nicieza, 2002</a>). Although in a suitable temperature regime, tadpoles in a better food resource could reach a larger size (
  <a rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-1">Álvarez &amp; Nicieza, 2002</a>), we did not find this phenomenon in adult frogs. These differences could be caused by the different developmental constraints between tadpoles and adult frogs (
  <a rid="ref-66" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-66">Warne &amp; Crespi, 2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The variation of food resource, as an indirect effect of climate change, could affect the reproduction of animals through food webs. In our experiment, some small individuals not even breed successfully, since they invested proportionately less on reproduction than larger ones, and spent more in growth to obtain a better fitness following the Cope’s rule (
  <a rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-46">Rensch, 1948</a>). Moreover, the clutch size of 
  <span class="italic">P. nigromaculatus</span> also showed a positive correlation with body size, regardless of temperature scenarios treatments. Such correlations between body size and clutch size and/or egg size usually appeared among amphibians (
  <a rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-32">Lardner &amp; Loman, 2003</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-63" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-63">Wang et al., 2009</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-72" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-72">Xu &amp; Li, 2013</a>), reptiles (
  <a rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-7">Brown &amp; Shine, 2002</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-53">Sun et al., 2013</a>) and other taxa (
  <a rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-22">Grossman, McDaniel &amp; Ratajczak Jr, 2002</a>). After correcting for initial body size, the experiment showed that individuals in normal food treatment displayed better reproductive success, bigger clutch size, and larger body size than those in low food treatments in either temperature scenario. In contrast, egg size was not affected by feeding rate. Therefore, under a limited food resource, females tended to reduce investment or skip reproduction altogether in the upcoming season, and instead, invested residual energy to the following season for a higher fecundity, as found in previous studies of amphibians and reptiles (
  <a rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-38">Loman, 1978</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-50">Schwarzkopf, 1993</a>). On the other hand, some frogs could reserve a portion of or all eggs after reproduction (
  <a rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-38">Loman, 1978</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-47" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-47">Reyer, Frei &amp; Som, 1999</a>), and use these unlaid eggs as stored energy reserves for reproduction in the following breeding season (
  <a rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-32">Lardner &amp; Loman, 2003</a>). Considering that the experimental frogs of control treatments mated and bred successfully in synchrony with the wild population, hence, the decrease in clutch size or skipping in reproduction of experimental individuals may be due to the similar allocation strategy in this species. It means that we should account for the actual investment in reproduction during several successive breeding seasons (
  <a rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-32">Lardner &amp; Loman, 2003</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The negative correlation between clutch size and egg size was documented in previous studies (
  <a rid="ref-65" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-65">Warne &amp; Charnov, 2008</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-63" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-63">Wang et al., 2009</a>) and this was concluded as a universal ecological rule in life-history traits regardless of reproductive mode among many amphibians (
  <a rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-12">Duellman &amp; Trueb, 1986</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-71" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-71">Wells, 2010</a>). There was also a trade-off in allocation between clutch size and egg size investment on female pond frogs. Our results showed that under good food resource conditions the frogs tended to allocate more investment in clutch size rather than egg size. In addition, our experiment suggested that there was a lack of trade-off in allocation between reproduction and growth investment on female pond frogs. Investments in both reproduction and growth were higher in normal food treatments than low food treatments regardless of any temperature scenarios. Another study showed that there was also no trade-off between reproduction and growth in adult female 
  <span class="italic">R. temporaria</span> (
  <a rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-32">Lardner &amp; Loman, 2003</a>). The lack of trade-off might be explained by the Y-model theory (
  <a rid="ref-56" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-56">Van Noordwijk &amp; De Jong, 1986</a>). The theory argued that a huge variation in acquisition (e.g., food availability) could mask a weak allocation (e.g., reproduction/growth investment) among individuals (
  <a rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-28">King, Roff &amp; Fairbairn, 2011</a>). In our experiment, the food availability between high and low food treatments is up to approximately 3:1. This large advantage in food resource could allow the experimental frogs in high food treatments to allocate more resources in both reproduction and growth, rather than to make a trade-off in investment allocation between them. The flexible allocation strategy offers another explanation for the lack of trade-off (
  <a rid="ref-67" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-67">Warne et al., 2012</a>). As it is expected that adult individuals find hibernation sites more efficiently than young ones, age and individual experience might influence the timing of hibernation, although such hypothesis should be further tested.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the species have to spend more energy in metabolism and maintenance under warmer condition (
  <a rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-19">Gillooly et al., 2001</a>), amphibians also have some thermoregulation ability to avoid energy consuming through behavioral adjustment (
  <a rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-43">Pough, 1980</a>). On the other hand, climate warming can also lead an extended season for growing and the frogs could obtain more energy for growth and reproduction due to the continuous food supply. Hence, both of the aspects could alter the life-history traits and further complicate the trade-off in energy allocation under climate warming. In addition, an appropriate choice of parameter may be crucial (
  <a rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-11">Doughty &amp; Shine, 1997</a>), which could non-destructively measure and assess the actual energy invested in growth for the following reproduction when taking into account behavioral thermoregulation and variable food supply.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, our study has demonstrated experimental evidence for food availability, rather than temperature, as a direct factor affecting the reproductive parameters and the variation in body size for 
  <span class="italic">P. nigromaculatus</span>. Although experimental warming can change the reproductive phenology of the species, it did not show an effect on the trade-off allocation of growth vs. reproduction and clutch size vs. egg size. Therefore, our results suggest that the uncertain variation in food availability caused by current climate warming could lead to more complex effects on the life-history of amphibians. These less predictable responses of amphibians may require more thorough species protection plans for dealing with ongoing climate change.
