  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We performed the study during 14th Oct 2011 to 14th Jul 2012 using 18 mesocosm units. Each of them was approximately 45.5 m
   <span class="sup">2</span> (7 × 6.5 m), surrounded by walls of bricks (height 1.2 m). Each unit was covered by an arc-shaped steel frame covered with plastic films (during warming period) or insect screens (during other experimental period). We simulated the typical habitat of the species in each unit: the soil was substituted with deep-lay soil and floored with grass, a 3.6 m
   <span class="sup">2</span> pond (3 × 1.2 m and depth 0.5 m) was dug at the middle of each unit. We provided refuges for frogs such as gaps around bricks, stones or tiles, and the frogs could also make holes on the soft ground by themselves (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our outdoor mesocosm experiments were designed with three temperature scenarios (ambient temperature, pre- and post-hibernation warming) and two food levels (normal and low). In total, six treatments were deployed: (i) control group, with ambient temperature and normal food level (CG), (ii) low food treatment, with ambient temperature and low food level (LF), (iii) pre-hibernation warming treatment, with normal food level (PreW), (iv) pre-hibernation warming and low food treatment (PreW-LF), (v) post-hibernation warming treatment, with normal food level (PostW), and (vi) post-hibernation warming and low food treatment (PostW-LF). Each treatment was replicated in 3 mesocosms, since our experiment designed as semi-natural study, the confined space of each mesocosm unit could not hold too many frogs. The pre-hibernation warming treatments (PreW and PreW-LF) were heated for 85 days (from 14th Oct 2011 to 7th Jan 2012, lasting 20 days; after which, all the frogs naturally went into hibernation) (
   <a rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-17">Gao et al., 2015</a>); analogously, the post-hibernation warming treatments (PostW and PostW-LF) were heated for 141 days (from 24th Feb 2012 to 14th Jul 2012, starting with 3 days of air temperature &gt;8 °C, and lasting 60 days after the last natural spawning behavior). Both pre- and post-hibernation warming treatments used the greenhouse method (
   <a rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-17">Gao et al., 2015</a>). The air temperatures of pre- and post-hibernation warming periods were automatically regulated by real-time monitoring equipment that simulated a daily fluctuating temperature regime (
   <a rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-17">Gao et al., 2015</a>). We recorded air and water temperature of each mesocosm every hour using data-loggers (Jingchuang RC-500+) during the experimental periods. The air temperature was defined as the temperature 1 m above the ground surface, and the water temperature was defined as the temperature 10 cm below the water surface. The air and water temperature were highly correlated in these treatments (Pearson correlation test, ambient temperature: 
   <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.991, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001; experimental warming:

   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001; 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" href="#fig-2">Fig. 2</a>). Finally, we warmed the mesocosm 2.2–2.4 °C above the ambient temperature in pre-/post-hibernation warming period. The increases of temperature are consistent with the prediction range (1.8–4.0 °C) of global average surface temperature by the end of the century (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In mid-October 2011, 270 frogs were captured from the wild in the town of Taohua and assigned to each mesocosm randomly (approximately 6 males and 9 females per mesocosm). Here, we acknowledged that the frogs were collected from one site, despite the fact that the clutch size of this species changes among different sites in the wild (

   <a rid="ref-63" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-63">Wang et al., 2009</a>). Geographic and temporal variations in reproductive parameters are common phenomena in amphibians (
   <a rid="ref-51" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-51">Sparks et al., 2007</a>; 
   <a rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-8">Camargo, Sarroca &amp; Maneyro, 2008</a>; 
   <a rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-21">Green &amp; Middleton, 2013</a>). However, our experiment is dealing with the change of reproductive parameters and allocation trade-off patterns, meaning that there should be qualitatively similar composition of individuals among treatments. Only then can we examine the changing trends of these frogs under experimental conditions (temperature and food) rather than those variations in geographic and temporal dimensions. In addition, we ignored the potential for diseases among experimental frogs, such as chytrids, since there is lack of evidence for risk of diseases in this area (

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the experiment, the frogs were artificially fed with standard commercial crickets one by one (
   <span class="italic">Gryllus bimaculatus</span>, approximately 15 mm long). The crickets were dusted with calcium powder and provided every night for the normal food level treatments (CG, PreW and PostW) and every 3 days for the low food level treatments (LF, PreW-LF and PostW-LF; equaling to 1/3 of the normal food level treatments; 
   <a rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-34">Leips &amp; Travis, 1994</a>). All frogs were divided into four weight classes (≤20 g, 20–40 g, 40–60 g and &gt;60 g) at the beginning and supplied with corresponding cricket numbers 1:2:3:4 (
   <a rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-32">Lardner &amp; Loman, 2003</a>). Each frog was assigned 1-minute feeding time since they preyed on the crickets immediately, after which we cleared uneaten crickets and recorded the information (
   <a rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-17">Gao et al., 2015</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the beginning of the experiment, each frog was measured. Then, they were marked with built-in PIT-tags (2 mm × 8 mm, HongTeng HT950) on the right thighs and each individual could be identified by a hand-held scanner (Kingdoes KD-Pi60) with unique identification code of its tag. During the experiment, we did not artificially induce the frogs to hibernation or reproduction, we only provided suitable environment for frogs and they were spontaneously entered into/emerged from hibernation and bred as they were in the wild. During post-hibernation warming period, the reproductive behaviors of frogs were observed every six hours (6:00, 12:00, 18:00 and 24:00), hence we could immediately record the breeding time, measure clutch size (egg number) and egg size (to reduce the human disturbance, the diameters of 100 eggs were measured, which were randomly sampled per clutch). After the eggs hatched, we released the tadpoles at the place where their parents were captured. At the end of our experiment, we measured the snout-vent length (SVL) and weight of the frogs and estimated their age by skeletochronology (
   <a rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-36">Li et al., 2011</a>), then we released all the frogs too.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After the experiment, we only use the data from females for this research. Given fact that male frogs may mate several times or indulge in post-mating clutch piracy (
   <a rid="ref-57" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-57">Vieites et al., 2004</a>), it was difficult to determine which individuals actually reproduced in our experiment. We used Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests for detecting normality and Levene’s tests to test for heterogeneity of variances. We logarithmically transformed the variances to minimize the heterogeneity if necessary (
   <a rid="ref-74" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-74">Zar, 2009</a>). We defined reproductive time as the day number when the event occurred between the 1st of January (as day 1) and the 31th of December (as day 365; 
   <a rid="ref-59" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-59">Visser &amp; Both, 2005</a>). We used a composite index of body size reflecting both SVL and weight based on the principal component analysis (PCA) scores of the SVL and weight data (see details in 
   <a rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-32">Lardner &amp; Loman, 2003</a>). Then, we used the variation of body size to reflect both changes in SVL and weight during the experiment, which was calculated as the difference between final and initial body size.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because the parameter food level could not reflect the food availability of each individual, we used an index of feeding rate (crickets consumed per individual frog). The feeding rate was defined as the residual in a standardized major axis (SMA) regression of crickets consumed on original weight, using the 
   <span class="italic">smatr</span> package for R software (

   <a rid="ref-68" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-68">Warton &amp; Ormerod, 2007</a>). Because the metabolic rate may vary with temperature (
   <a rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-19">Gillooly et al., 2001</a>), we computed this index in each temperature scenario (hereafter, we used the feeding rate to represent the food level).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We examined the differences in reproductive status of individuals (reproductive or non-reproductive) in these treatments using binary logistic regression model with temperature, feeding rate, temperature × feeding rate, and initial body size as covariates. Further, we examined differences in reproductive time, clutch size, egg size, and the variation in body size among these treatments using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with temperature as a fixed factor, and feeding rate, temperature × feeding rate and initial body size (this variable might have effects on these reproductive parameters) as covariates. In addition, we used multiple linear regression models to examine the relationships among reproductive time, clutch size, egg size, and the variation in body size with temperature, feeding rate, temperature × feeding rate, and initial body size as predictors.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Clutch size investment was defined as the residual of clutch size on original body size by a SMA regression. Similarly, the egg size investment was calculated as the residual of egg size on original body size by a SMA regression. We examined differences in clutch size investment and egg size investment among these treatments using ANCOVA with temperature as a fixed factor, and feeding rate and temperature × feeding rate as covariates. After that, we calculated the residual of clutch size investment on egg size investment by a SMA regression and examined the residual for testing the clutch size/egg size investment trade-off by ANCOVA with temperature as fixed a factor, feeding rate, feeding rate × temperature as covariates. Then, we used the residual of a regression between clutch volume (
   <span class="italic">π</span>/6 × 
   <span class="italic">Egg size</span>
   <span class="sup">3</span> × 
   <span class="italic">Clutch size</span>) and initial body size as a measure of reproduction investment index for these females that have laid eggs successfully. The reproduction investment index was calculated as the residual of clutch volume on original body size by a SMA regression. In addition, we used the residual of a SMA regression as the growth investment index, which was computed as final body size on original body size. We examined differences in reproduction investment and growth investment among these treatments using ANCOVA with temperature as a fixed factor, and feeding rate and temperature × feeding rate as covariates. Finally, we calculated the residual of reproduction investment on growth investment by a SMA regression and examined the residual for testing the reproduction/growth investment trade-off by ANCOVA with temperature as fixed factor, feeding rate, feeding rate × temperature as a covariates. Results were considered significant if
