  <a rid="ref-54" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-54">Thomas et al., 2004</a>). Under current climate warming, the responses of reproductive traits in many animals have attracted more global attention in recent research. Several examples included the mis-timing in reproduction under climate change in birds (
  <a rid="ref-60" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-60">Visser, Both &amp; Lambrechts, 2004</a>), the reproductive performance of the common lizard (
  <span class="italic">Lacerta vivipara</span>) affected by rainfall regime (
  <a rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-39">Marquis, Massot &amp; Le Galliard, 2008</a>), and an advanced reproductive time and increased clutch size under climate warming in the Chinese alligators (
  <span class="italic">Alligator sinensis</span>) (
  <a rid="ref-75" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-75">Zhang et al., 2009</a>). As sensitive taxa, amphibians have been declining worldwide and some of them are facing a real threat of extinction (
  <a rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-42">Pechmann et al., 1991</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-23">Houlahan et al., 2000</a>). With the continuing trend of global warming, there may be increasing unpredictable impacts on amphibian fitness (
  <a rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-20">Gouveia et al., 2013</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-58">Visser, 2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change could either directly change amphibian survival rate and reproductive success via altered temperature and rainfall regimes, or indirectly, due to limited or increased food availability, or phenological responses (
  <a rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-9">Carey &amp; Alexander, 2003</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-20">Gouveia et al., 2013</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-24">Høye et al., 2014</a>). Several studies have performed control experiments to obtain further information for assessing the impact of future climate warming on both amphibian larvae and adults (
  <a rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-18">Garner, Rowcliffe &amp; Fisher, 2011</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-41">O’Regan, Palen &amp; Anderson, 2014</a>). However, there were few experiments examining the allocation trade-off between growth and reproduction of marginal resources, which could affect life-history parameters and even population dynamics (
  <a rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-35">Li, Cohen &amp; Rohr, 2013</a>). This is especially true for meso-scale experiments at a semi-natural state involving the allocation strategy for adult individuals under climate warming scenarios (
  <a rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-48">Roff, 1992</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-52" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-52">Stewart et al., 2013</a>). As ectothermic animals, amphibians have a typical positive relationship between metabolic rate and temperature (
  <a rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-19">Gillooly et al., 2001</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-10">Dillon, Wang &amp; Huey, 2010</a>). For instance, the common toad (
  <span class="italic">Bufo bufo</span>) does not hibernate when exposed to a warmer temperature during the hibernation period (
  <a rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-27">Jørgensen, 1986</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-45">Reading, 2007</a>). Toads that did not hibernate showed lower growth rates, smaller body size at maturity, and higher mortality than ones that experienced hibernation, when food resources are provided 
  <span class="italic">ad libitum</span> (
  <a rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-27">Jørgensen, 1986</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-45">Reading, 2007</a>). In addition, in a suitable temperature range, metabolic and developmental rates of amphibian larva increased with temperature (
  <a rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-1">Álvarez &amp; Nicieza, 2002</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-40">Narayan &amp; Hero, 2014</a>). A shorter larval period may lead to smaller size at metamorphosis under a fixed amount of resources due to a higher metabolic demand (
  <a rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-13">Enriquez-Urzelai et al., 2013</a>). However, an extreme thermal environment could also cause harmful effects for adult 
  <span class="italic">Rhinella marina</span> (
  <a rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-40">Narayan &amp; Hero, 2014</a>). Based on this evidence, we would expect that climate warming would cause an overall fitness reduction in amphibian populations even when food resources remain constant.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change could also affect the food resources of many animals either in phenophase or in quantity (
  <a rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-25">Huston &amp; Wolverton, 2011</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-58">Visser, 2013</a>). These variations in food resources may trigger unpredictable effects on phenophase, body condition, survival and reproduction (
  <a rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-45">Reading, 2007</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-20">Gouveia et al., 2013</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-58">Visser, 2013</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-16">Fox et al., 2014</a>). For instance, reproduction in birds can mismatch the phenology of their insect prey, plants can decrease their reproductive capacity as the result of increased insect abundance, and fish may miss the plankton’s peak abundance (
  <a rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-31">Kristiansen et al., 2011</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-37">Liu et al., 2011</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-58">Visser, 2013</a>). On the other hand, an abundant food resource would lead to bigger clutch sizes and nestlings in birds (
  <a rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-3">Arcese &amp; Smith, 1988</a>), and more cubs in mammals (
  <a rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-2">Angerbjörn et al., 1991</a>). In addition, the eastern fence lizard (
  <span class="italic">Sceloporus undulatus</span>) has an ability to flexibly allocate resources between reproduction and growth to deal with the fluctuation of food resources (
  <a rid="ref-67" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-67">Warne et al., 2012</a>). Such variations in food resources may also affect the fitness of amphibians, which is shown in a controlled experiment with the common frogs (
  <span class="italic">Rana temporaria</span>) revealing that both the females’ growth and reproduction respond positively to high food rations (
  <a rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-32">Lardner &amp; Loman, 2003</a>). Based on such evidence, we predict that there should be a negative effect on amphibian fitness when food availability is reduced as a consequence of climate warming.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As animals with indefinite (indeterminate) growth, amphibians have to allocate their energy to survive, grow and reproduce (
  <a rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-29">Kozlowski, 1996</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-30">Kozlowski &amp; Teriokhin, 1999</a>). Therefore, given a certain amount of energy, there is a trade-off between reproduction at the present and investment in growth for future reproduction, which should lead to an optimal allocation pattern for higher fitness (
  <a rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-48">Roff, 1992</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-29">Kozlowski, 1996</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-30">Kozlowski &amp; Teriokhin, 1999</a>). In addition, the large-sized individuals have better fitness in reproduction than small ones in most amphibians (
  <a rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-12">Duellman &amp; Trueb, 1986</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-71" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-71">Wells, 2010</a>). If the resources were invested in growing a larger body size, the individual would produce more offspring in the future. In the extreme case, the animal could distribute all surplus energy to growth and survival in order to avoid a period of harsh conditions for reproduction, or they would invest in reproduction to avoid disadvantages that might appear in the following seasons (
  <a rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-50">Schwarzkopf, 1993</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-49">Roff, 2002</a>). Some animals, such as 
  <span class="italic">S. undulatus</span> have evolved an allocation strategy between growth and reproduction (
  <a rid="ref-67" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-67">Warne et al., 2012</a>). However, how the allocation strategy between growth and reproduction would change under the current climate warming is unclear. Therefore, a controlled experiment on allocation strategy is an appropriate method that may be able to establish a mechanism generating the trade-off (
  <a rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-48">Roff, 1992</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The pond frogs (
  <span class="italic">Pelophylax nigromaculatus</span>) is a common large-sized anuran species (mean snout-vent length ∼62 mm for males and ∼74 mm for females) widely distributed in Eastern Asia (
  <a rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-15">Fei, 1999</a>). The species is documented as reproducing once every year without parental care of eggs or tadpoles (
  <a rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-15">Fei, 1999</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-63" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-63">Wang et al., 2009</a>). It is an ideal animal to examine the changes of reproductive strategies and trade-offs for our study, since using it excludes other potential confounding effects, such as multiple clutches in a single breeding season and parental care of offspring.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to predict the potential effects of climate warming on life-history trade-offs of amphibians, it is necessary to implement appropriate experimental studies by controlling the interaction between temperature and food resources. In comparison with these fieldwork-based studies, outdoor mesocosm experiments could distinguish between the effects due to climate warming itself, and the variation in food availability caused by climate warming (
  <a rid="ref-52" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-52">Stewart et al., 2013</a>). Hence, we performed a cross-year study using non-destructive measurement techniques to examine the effect of temperature scenarios (ambient vs. pre-/post-hibernation warming) and food levels (normal vs. low) on reproductive parameters and allocation strategies for reproduction. Our mesocosm setting imitated the microhabitats of this species and performed experimental warming under daily temperature fluctuations with an average of around 2.3 °C warmer than ambient temperature. Our study addressed the following questions: (1) whether there existed changes in reproductive parameters under these simulated scenarios of climate warming, (2) whether there existed a trade-off in allocating limited food for growth or reproduction on females, and (3) whether the allocation strategies were affected by temperature or feeding rate.
