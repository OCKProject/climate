 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After the experiment, we only use the data from females for this research. Given fact that male frogs may mate several times or indulge in post-mating clutch piracy (
  <a rid="ref-57" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-57">Vieites et al., 2004</a>), it was difficult to determine which individuals actually reproduced in our experiment. We used Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests for detecting normality and Levene’s tests to test for heterogeneity of variances. We logarithmically transformed the variances to minimize the heterogeneity if necessary (
  <a rid="ref-74" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-74">Zar, 2009</a>). We defined reproductive time as the day number when the event occurred between the 1st of January (as day 1) and the 31th of December (as day 365; 
  <a rid="ref-59" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-59">Visser &amp; Both, 2005</a>). We used a composite index of body size reflecting both SVL and weight based on the principal component analysis (PCA) scores of the SVL and weight data (see details in 
  <a rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-32">Lardner &amp; Loman, 2003</a>). Then, we used the variation of body size to reflect both changes in SVL and weight during the experiment, which was calculated as the difference between final and initial body size.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because the parameter food level could not reflect the food availability of each individual, we used an index of feeding rate (crickets consumed per individual frog). The feeding rate was defined as the residual in a standardized major axis (SMA) regression of crickets consumed on original weight, using the 
  <span class="italic">smatr</span> package for R software (

  <a rid="ref-69" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-69">Warton et al., 2006</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-68" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-68">Warton &amp; Ormerod, 2007</a>). Because the metabolic rate may vary with temperature (
  <a rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-19">Gillooly et al., 2001</a>), we computed this index in each temperature scenario (hereafter, we used the feeding rate to represent the food level).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We examined the differences in reproductive status of individuals (reproductive or non-reproductive) in these treatments using binary logistic regression model with temperature, feeding rate, temperature × feeding rate, and initial body size as covariates. Further, we examined differences in reproductive time, clutch size, egg size, and the variation in body size among these treatments using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with temperature as a fixed factor, and feeding rate, temperature × feeding rate and initial body size (this variable might have effects on these reproductive parameters) as covariates. In addition, we used multiple linear regression models to examine the relationships among reproductive time, clutch size, egg size, and the variation in body size with temperature, feeding rate, temperature × feeding rate, and initial body size as predictors.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Clutch size investment was defined as the residual of clutch size on original body size by a SMA regression. Similarly, the egg size investment was calculated as the residual of egg size on original body size by a SMA regression. We examined differences in clutch size investment and egg size investment among these treatments using ANCOVA with temperature as a fixed factor, and feeding rate and temperature × feeding rate as covariates. After that, we calculated the residual of clutch size investment on egg size investment by a SMA regression and examined the residual for testing the clutch size/egg size investment trade-off by ANCOVA with temperature as fixed a factor, feeding rate, feeding rate × temperature as covariates. Then, we used the residual of a regression between clutch volume (
  <span class="italic">π</span>/6 × 
  <span class="italic">Egg size</span>
  <span class="sup">3</span> × 
  <span class="italic">Clutch size</span>) and initial body size as a measure of reproduction investment index for these females that have laid eggs successfully. The reproduction investment index was calculated as the residual of clutch volume on original body size by a SMA regression. In addition, we used the residual of a SMA regression as the growth investment index, which was computed as final body size on original body size. We examined differences in reproduction investment and growth investment among these treatments using ANCOVA with temperature as a fixed factor, and feeding rate and temperature × feeding rate as covariates. Finally, we calculated the residual of reproduction investment on growth investment by a SMA regression and examined the residual for testing the reproduction/growth investment trade-off by ANCOVA with temperature as fixed factor, feeding rate, feeding rate × temperature as a covariates. Results were considered significant if
