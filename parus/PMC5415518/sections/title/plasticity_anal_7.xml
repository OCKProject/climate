 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From light‐level geolocators, we know that common terns from the “Banter See” population spend their winters on the west‐central coast of Africa (Becker et al., 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0006">2016</a>), although we do not know whether climatic factors in the wintering area or at stopovers along the migration route explain variation in the timing of migration and breeding (but see Szostek et al., 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0083">2015</a>). Using sliding windows (e.g., Brommer, Rattiste, &amp; Wilson, 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0016">2008</a>; Husby et al., 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0044">2010</a>; van de Pol &amp; Cockburn, 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0089" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0089">2011</a>) with an AIC selection process, we therefore explored the population response of breeding phenology to several global climatic indexes (Atlantic Multi‐decadal Oscillation, NAO, Southern Oscillation Index), as well as to average wind speed, sum of rainfall, and sea surface temperature (SST) at the nearest weather station (Cuxhaven, Germany). We did a similar analysis for SST recorded at the wintering grounds and points along the migration route (Senegal, Portugal, France, and the Netherlands). The sliding windows explored periods between August of the previous year and June of the focal year with a step of 1 month.

This analysis included only experienced females with 2 or more years of breeding. We used a generalized mixed model with age as fixed effect, the identity of the female, and the interaction of female identity with SST in Senegal as random effects to quantify phenotypic plasticity. We additionally examined whether individual females exhibited plasticity in laying date by testing for variation in laying date both within and among individuals, using the techniques described by van de Pol and Wright (
