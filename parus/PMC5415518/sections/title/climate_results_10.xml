 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the population level, the sliding window approach showed that, among all the tested climatic factors, the strongest significant relationship was a positive relationship between both the delay from arrival to laying date and mean laying date itself, and mean SST in Senegal in the December prior to breeding (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For experienced common terns that bred in at least 3 years, we used a mixed model to examine the influence of SST in Senegal in December on laying date. Age and age‐squared were included in the model as fixed factors to control for the effects of aging (e.g., Zhang, Vedder, Becker, &amp; Bouwhuis, 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0099" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0099">2015</a>), and female identity and the interaction between female identity and SST were included as random variables. In this analysis, the interaction term represents the slopes of individual females for laying date regressed on values of December SST (i.e., to test for equality of reaction norm slopes among individuals). We then removed the interaction term and reran the model. A LRT did not reveal a significant difference between the models that included and excluded individual plasticity (i.e., the slopes of reaction norms were not significantly different), for female laying date in response to December SST in Senegal (change in

  <span class="sup">2</span> = .12, number of observations = 1,263, number of females = 211; χ
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 2.1, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = .15). For each increase of 1°C of SST temperature in December on the wintering grounds, laying date was delayed on average 6.7 ± 0.5 days (
  <span class="italic">t</span> = 13.31, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; .0001).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We further tested the pattern of plasticity using a partitioning of within and among individual effects of December SST on female laying dates, with female identity a random variable (van de Pol &amp; Wright, 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0090" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0090">2009</a>). In this analysis, both the within‐individual and among‐individual patterns were highly significant (number of observations = 1,263, number of females = 211; 
  <span class="italic">t</span> = 5.9 and 9.3, respectively, both 
  <span class="italic">p</span>s &lt; .0001), but there was no significant interaction between these terms to suggest that females with a different average laying date differed in their level of plasticity. In support of this, a test of random slopes of individual females (
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> ± 1.96 
  <span class="italic">SD</span> = 0.02 ± 0.03) indicated that less than 1% of the variation in the data could be explained by inclusion of the interaction term (LRT; χ
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 4.7, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = .10). These analyses indicated that the slopes of the individual and population‐wide reaction norms were quite similar.
