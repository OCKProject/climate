 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phenotypic plasticity and changes in laying date</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phenotypic plasticity is now recognized as a widespread response to climate changes in birds (e.g., Charmantier &amp; Gienapp, 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0019">2014</a>; Pulido, 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0070">2007b</a>). Recent studies have shown that local temperature, and particularly an increase in temperature, can alter the timing of avian migration and reproduction (Phillimore et al., 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0066">2016</a>; Schaper et al., 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0077">2012</a>; Singh, Budki, Rani, &amp; Kumar, 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0080">2012</a>; Tottrup et al., 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0088" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0088">2010</a>). Individual common terns also exhibited significant phenotypic plasticity in breeding phenology. Our search for environmental variables associated with this plasticity revealed a significant relationship between SST on the wintering grounds in Senegal during the previous December and individual changes in laying date. Over the study period, December SST in Senegal increased, and subsequent laying was delayed.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the mechanism underlying this pattern is not well understood, it likely reflects poorer foraging conditions in warmer tropical waters (Szostek &amp; Becker, 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0082" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0082">2015</a>; Szostek et al., 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0083">2015</a>), and thus, an increased need to replenish body condition before reproduction can occur at the breeding colony in the North Sea. Arrival mass, however, did not decline over the study period (Szostek et al., 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0083">2015</a>). Alternatively, changes in SST might have coincided with changes in local resource conditions in Wilhelmshaven, with the latter actually causing the observed longer prelaying periods during the study. During courtship when males have to feed their female mates with high quality fish to produce eggs in a short period of time (González‐Solís et al., 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0036">2001</a>; Nisbet, 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0063">1973</a>; Wendeln, 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0097" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0097">1997</a>), poor food availability occurred during the years 2002–2009 (Dänhardt &amp; Becker, 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0024">2011</a>) and might have delayed laying date via stronger competition for food resources and slow increases in adult body condition. Alternatively, aspects of body condition of the terns that must be replenished before laying and that are not associated with body mass may be involved. In this case, a role of SST in Senegal directly influencing delayed laying during the study would be supported. Further research should not only test these alternatives, but also examine the possibility of an association between SST in Senegal and local resource conditions in Wilhelmshaven during the prelaying period.

  <span class="italic">Parus major</span> (Nussey et al., 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0064">2005</a>; Visser et al., 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0095" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0095">2011</a>). We examined females that reproduced several times during their lifetimes and used the slope of laying date on December SST in Senegal to estimate reaction norms describing phenotypic plasticity relative to the environmental conditions. We found that both individuals and the population as a whole exhibited similar changes over time in laying date. Further, we found no evidence for significant variation in the slopes of the reaction norms among individual females, as indicated by the lack of significant influence of the interaction of female identity and December SST in Senegal on laying date, under two different statistical models that describe variations in phenotypic plasticity. Given our substantial sample of over 200 individual females, this suggests that the plastic responses of females to December SST in Senegal were fairly similar and that there thus was no evidence of a significant genotype by environment interaction. This suggests that strong selection for a change in plasticity is unlikely and that a substantial plastic response to wintering conditions can oppose natural selection and constrain adaptation.
