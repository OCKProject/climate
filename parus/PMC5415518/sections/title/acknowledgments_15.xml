 <p>This study was facilitated by the long‐term monitoring of the common tern population in Wilhelmshaven (Germany), which relied on the work of many researchers, students, and field assistants. We greatly appreciated the helpful comments of F. Bairlein and A. van Noordwijk on the manuscript. The data collection was supported by the DFG (BE 916). C.A. was supported by a PhD stipend from the AXA Research Fund, A.C. and F.S.D. by the CNRS in France and an Agence Nationale de la Recherche grant (ANR‐08‐JCJC‐0041‐01), and A.C. by the European Research Council (Starting grant ERC‐2013‐StF‐337365‐SHE).</p>
