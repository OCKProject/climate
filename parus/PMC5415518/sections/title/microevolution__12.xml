 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spring timing of annual reproduction became significantly later for common terns, by about 5 days over 15 years. This delay did not appear to be due to later returns from annual migration to the wintering grounds, as there was no significant change in return dates (Arnaud et al., 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0001">2013</a>; Ezard et al., 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0027">2007</a>; Szostek et al., 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0083">2015</a>). Rather, the change in reproductive timing appeared to primarily result from a significant increase in the time between arrival at the breeding grounds and the production of eggs. This increase might have been caused by changes in arrival condition that varied with marine food resources at the wintering grounds (Szostek &amp; Becker, 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0082" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0082">2015</a>; Szostek et al., 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0083">2015</a>), although it might also have resulted from changes in local prey availability on the breeding grounds (see below). Either way, our objective was to evaluate the possible roles of microevolution and phenotypic plasticity in producing the temporal change in the timing of annual reproduction.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For laying date to be delayed via microevolutionary change, significant heritability and fitness differences in reproductive timing are required. As is commonly found in avian species (e.g., Sheldon, Kruuk, &amp; Merilä, 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0079">2003</a>; Brommer &amp; Rattiste, 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0015">2008</a>; and reviewed by Postma, 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0068">2014</a>), laying date in common terns was strongly heritable, with over a quarter of the phenotypic variance in their timing of breeding being explained by additive genetic effects. Significant fecundity selection also occurred, but favoured 
  <span class="italic">earlier</span> breeding, a result in agreement with patterns observed in other bird species (e.g., Brommer, Merilä, Sheldon, &amp; Gustafsson, 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0014">2005</a>; Charmantier et al.,

  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0033">2006</a>; Phillimore, Leech, Pearch‐Higgins, &amp; Hadfield, 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0066">2016</a>; Porlier et al., 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0067">2012</a>; Reed et al., 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0075">2009</a>; Sheldon et al., 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0079">2003</a>; Teplitsky et al., 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0085" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0085">2011</a>; Visser et al., 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0094" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0094">2015</a>). This significant selection for earlier laying co‐occurred with a nearly significant (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = .06) and substantial negative genetic correlation between laying date and fecundity (
  <span class="italic">r</span>
  <sub>G</sub> = −0.65 ± 0.35), which suggested that selection was not acting solely on the environmental component of the trait.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the significant genetic variance, heritability, and selection acting at the genetic level, laying date would be predicted to display a low‐to‐moderate evolutionary potential to evolve in the direction of earlier breeding, unless the fitness variation associated with laying date was due to correlations between laying date and other measures of phenology, particularly arrival from migration at the breeding colony. Arrival has been suggested as a potential constraint for changes in timing of breeding in migratory birds, because of the necessary connection between the sequential events within the annual cycle and because of potential phenotypic and genetic correlations between the life‐history traits (Both &amp; Visser, 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0013">2001</a>; Coppack &amp; Both, 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0023">2002</a>; Teplitsky et al., 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0085" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0085">2011</a>; but see Goodenough, Hart, &amp; Elliot, 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0037">2011</a>; Lourenco et al., 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0052">2011</a>; Visser et al., 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0094" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0094">2015</a>). Arrival date, however, was only marginally and weakly heritable and did not change significantly over the study period (see also Arnaud et al., 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0001">2013</a>; Ezard et al., 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0027">2007</a>; Szostek et al., 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0083">2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We therefore examined the prelaying interval, which became significantly longer during the study. We also found significant fecundity selection on prelaying interval in our univariate analyses, but its sign was negative (
  <span class="italic">i.e</span>., shorter intervals were selected, favouring earlier laying dates), and the prelaying interval exhibited virtually no heritability. It thus seems more likely that the apparent fecundity selection on prelaying interval was influenced by its correlation with laying date, rather than vice versa. All in all, the significant delay in reproductive timing, therefore, must have been primarily due to phenotypically plastic changes in laying date, which is the most general result found in bird studies (Charmantier &amp; Gienapp, 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0019">2014</a>).
