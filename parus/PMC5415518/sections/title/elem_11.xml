  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spring timing of annual reproduction became significantly later for common terns, by about 5 days over 15 years. This delay did not appear to be due to later returns from annual migration to the wintering grounds, as there was no significant change in return dates (Arnaud et al., 
   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0001">2013</a>; Ezard et al., 
   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0027">2007</a>; Szostek et al., 
   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0083">2015</a>). Rather, the change in reproductive timing appeared to primarily result from a significant increase in the time between arrival at the breeding grounds and the production of eggs. This increase might have been caused by changes in arrival condition that varied with marine food resources at the wintering grounds (Szostek &amp; Becker, 
   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0082" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0082">2015</a>; Szostek et al., 
   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0083">2015</a>), although it might also have resulted from changes in local prey availability on the breeding grounds (see below). Either way, our objective was to evaluate the possible roles of microevolution and phenotypic plasticity in producing the temporal change in the timing of annual reproduction.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For laying date to be delayed via microevolutionary change, significant heritability and fitness differences in reproductive timing are required. As is commonly found in avian species (e.g., Sheldon, Kruuk, &amp; Merilä, 
   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0079">2003</a>; Brommer &amp; Rattiste, 
   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0015">2008</a>; and reviewed by Postma, 
   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0068">2014</a>), laying date in common terns was strongly heritable, with over a quarter of the phenotypic variance in their timing of breeding being explained by additive genetic effects. Significant fecundity selection also occurred, but favoured 
   <span class="italic">earlier</span> breeding, a result in agreement with patterns observed in other bird species (e.g., Brommer, Merilä, Sheldon, &amp; Gustafsson, 
   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0014">2005</a>; Charmantier et al.,

   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0085" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0085">2011</a>; Visser et al., 
   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0094" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0094">2015</a>). This significant selection for earlier laying co‐occurred with a nearly significant (
   <span class="italic">p</span> = .06) and substantial negative genetic correlation between laying date and fecundity (
   <span class="italic">r</span>
   <sub>G</sub> = −0.65 ± 0.35), which suggested that selection was not acting solely on the environmental component of the trait.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the significant genetic variance, heritability, and selection acting at the genetic level, laying date would be predicted to display a low‐to‐moderate evolutionary potential to evolve in the direction of earlier breeding, unless the fitness variation associated with laying date was due to correlations between laying date and other measures of phenology, particularly arrival from migration at the breeding colony. Arrival has been suggested as a potential constraint for changes in timing of breeding in migratory birds, because of the necessary connection between the sequential events within the annual cycle and because of potential phenotypic and genetic correlations between the life‐history traits (Both &amp; Visser, 
   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0013">2001</a>; Coppack &amp; Both, 
   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0023">2002</a>; Teplitsky et al., 
   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0085" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0085">2011</a>; but see Goodenough, Hart, &amp; Elliot, 
   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0037">2011</a>; Lourenco et al., 
   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0052">2011</a>; Visser et al., 
   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0094" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0094">2015</a>). Arrival date, however, was only marginally and weakly heritable and did not change significantly over the study period (see also Arnaud et al., 
   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0001">2013</a>; Ezard et al., 
   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0027">2007</a>; Szostek et al., 
   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0083">2015</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We therefore examined the prelaying interval, which became significantly longer during the study. We also found significant fecundity selection on prelaying interval in our univariate analyses, but its sign was negative (
   <span class="italic">i.e</span>., shorter intervals were selected, favouring earlier laying dates), and the prelaying interval exhibited virtually no heritability. It thus seems more likely that the apparent fecundity selection on prelaying interval was influenced by its correlation with laying date, rather than vice versa. All in all, the significant delay in reproductive timing, therefore, must have been primarily due to phenotypically plastic changes in laying date, which is the most general result found in bird studies (Charmantier &amp; Gienapp, 
   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0019">2014</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phenotypic plasticity and changes in laying date</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phenotypic plasticity is now recognized as a widespread response to climate changes in birds (e.g., Charmantier &amp; Gienapp, 
   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0019">2014</a>; Pulido, 
   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0070">2007b</a>). Recent studies have shown that local temperature, and particularly an increase in temperature, can alter the timing of avian migration and reproduction (Phillimore et al., 
   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0066">2016</a>; Schaper et al., 
   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0077">2012</a>; Singh, Budki, Rani, &amp; Kumar, 
   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0080">2012</a>; Tottrup et al., 
   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0088" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0088">2010</a>). Individual common terns also exhibited significant phenotypic plasticity in breeding phenology. Our search for environmental variables associated with this plasticity revealed a significant relationship between SST on the wintering grounds in Senegal during the previous December and individual changes in laying date. Over the study period, December SST in Senegal increased, and subsequent laying was delayed.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the mechanism underlying this pattern is not well understood, it likely reflects poorer foraging conditions in warmer tropical waters (Szostek &amp; Becker, 
   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0082" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0082">2015</a>; Szostek et al., 
   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0083">2015</a>), and thus, an increased need to replenish body condition before reproduction can occur at the breeding colony in the North Sea. Arrival mass, however, did not decline over the study period (Szostek et al., 
   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0083">2015</a>). Alternatively, changes in SST might have coincided with changes in local resource conditions in Wilhelmshaven, with the latter actually causing the observed longer prelaying periods during the study. During courtship when males have to feed their female mates with high quality fish to produce eggs in a short period of time (González‐Solís et al., 
   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0036">2001</a>; Nisbet, 
   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0063">1973</a>; Wendeln, 
   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0097" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0097">1997</a>), poor food availability occurred during the years 2002–2009 (Dänhardt &amp; Becker, 
   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0024">2011</a>) and might have delayed laying date via stronger competition for food resources and slow increases in adult body condition. Alternatively, aspects of body condition of the terns that must be replenished before laying and that are not associated with body mass may be involved. In this case, a role of SST in Senegal directly influencing delayed laying during the study would be supported. Further research should not only test these alternatives, but also examine the possibility of an association between SST in Senegal and local resource conditions in Wilhelmshaven during the prelaying period.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sensitivity to environmental cues to adjust breeding timing displayed a significant genetic variance in the great tit 
   <span class="italic">Parus major</span> (Nussey et al., 
   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0064">2005</a>; Visser et al., 
   <a rid="ece32777-bib-0095" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0095">2011</a>). We examined females that reproduced several times during their lifetimes and used the slope of laying date on December SST in Senegal to estimate reaction norms describing phenotypic plasticity relative to the environmental conditions. We found that both individuals and the population as a whole exhibited similar changes over time in laying date. Further, we found no evidence for significant variation in the slopes of the reaction norms among individual females, as indicated by the lack of significant influence of the interaction of female identity and December SST in Senegal on laying date, under two different statistical models that describe variations in phenotypic plasticity. Given our substantial sample of over 200 individual females, this suggests that the plastic responses of females to December SST in Senegal were fairly similar and that there thus was no evidence of a significant genotype by environment interaction. This suggests that strong selection for a change in plasticity is unlikely and that a substantial plastic response to wintering conditions can oppose natural selection and constrain adaptation.
