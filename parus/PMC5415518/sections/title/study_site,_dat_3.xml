 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Common terns were studied at Wilhelmshaven on the German coast along the North Sea. Between 1992 and 2010, the number of breeding pairs at the “Banter See” colony fluctuated between 90 and 530. Terns arrived from their wintering grounds (in subequatorial Africa; Becker et al., 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0006">2016</a>) in April, laid the first eggs in early May, and returned to their wintering grounds in September (Becker et al., 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0006">2016</a>). Terns nested on six artificial islands that are about 10.7 × 4.6 m and spaced 0.9 m apart. Nests were protected from flooding and rat predation by low concrete walls around the islands. From 1992 to 1995, an initial 101 adults were captured and marked with subcutaneous passive transponders, and since 1992, all fledglings have been marked with transponders (Becker &amp; Wendeln, 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0007">1997</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From 1994, the arrival and presence of transponder‐marked terns was monitored via antennae on resting platforms (see Figure 
  <a rid="ece32777-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece32777-fig-0001">1</a>) that were affixed to the walls of the islands. Arrival date was defined as the first day of return to the breeding grounds after migration, and recorded as the number of days after 1 January for a given year. The automatic detection system (Becker, Ezard, Ludwigs, Sauer‐Guerth, &amp; Wink, 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0004">2008</a>) was extremely accurate, with a probability of resighting close to one (Szostek &amp; Becker, 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0081">2012</a>), due to high breeding site fidelity of common terns.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We restricted analyses to individuals that had prior breeding experience in at least 1 year (mean = 7.4 years old ± 2.9 
  <span class="italic">SE</span>, maximum age = 22 years, 
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 2,787 clutches), because first‐time breeders, which are mostly three or 4 years of age (on average 3.5 ± 0.8 
  <span class="italic">SE</span>), exhibited a strongly different distribution of arrival and laying dates (Arnaud et al., 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0001">2013</a>; Becker et al., 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0004">2008</a>; González‐Solís, Becker, Jover, &amp; Ruiz, 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0035">2004</a>; Ludwigs &amp; Becker, 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0053">2002</a>) and extremely low reproductive success (Limmer &amp; Becker, 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0051">2010</a>). Surveys of the total colony every 2–3 days revealed when new clutches were initiated and new eggs were laid and nests and eggs were marked for subsequent recognition. At each nest, parents were identified using portable antennae placed around the nest for 1–2 days during incubation, which is shared by both partners. From these procedures, laying date of each marked pair was recorded as the number of days between 1 January and the inception of the laying event.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chicks were ringed at hatching and checked every 2–3 days until they fledged (at about 26 days; Becker &amp; Wink, 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0008">2003</a>) or perished. We determined whether a clutch was the first or a replacement clutch (or a second clutch in rare cases) and for each clutch, the number of fledglings was recorded. Chicks were implanted with transponders (see above) prior to fledging. We built pedigrees from the records of parents and offspring. This social pedigree, which comprised 4,023 individuals, is a good approximation of the genetic pedigree, because both social parents were known and because breeding partners exhibit very low levels of extra‐pair paternity (1.3% of copulations and 2.9% of fertilizations were extra‐pair, González‐Solís, Sokolov, &amp; Becker, 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0036">2001</a>). The pedigree covered four generations, and the number of paternities and maternities was 2,377.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A given individual cannot start reproducing before arriving on the breeding grounds; hence, phenotypic measures of arrival and laying dates are statistically collinear. While we focused on breeding timing, we also examined the interval between arrival from migration and onset of breeding (i.e., the number of days between the arrival of the females from the spring migration and the start of the laying event) because it could be involved in the birds' phenological response to environmental conditions. We called this variable the “prelaying interval.” Analyses were thus based on multivariate models including both prelaying interval and laying date.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We ran linear models with year and age as continuous fixed effects on prelaying interval and laying date, in order to estimate the temporal changes in the variables between 1996 and 2010, while controlling for changes in the age structure of the population.</p>
