 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evolutionary change in a phenotypic trait under selection is best predicted by applying the Robertson–Price identity (Morrissey, Kruuk, &amp; Wilson, 
  <a rid="ece32777-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32777-bib-0059">2010</a>), which stipulates that the expected change in mean phenotypic trait between generations is equal to the additive genetic covariance between relative fitness and the trait. We therefore ran bivariate animal models in female experienced breeders with each combination of annual sum of fledgling and life‐history traits in order to estimate the additive genetic covariances and correlations between phenotypic traits and fitness.
