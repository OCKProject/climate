 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The bird monitoring was performed from 1999 to 2002 using the point-count method (Drapeau et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">1999</a>) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Bird surveys were applied five times per year within the main breeding period, from April to June, with intervals of approximately 2 weeks. In 1999, only four observations took place. It is assumed that these numbers of surveys per year cover the actual occurrence of breeding birds in this study area. A regular sample grid of 125 observation points was chosen. On each of five straight parallel transects with a distance of 3000 m, 25 sample points with a distance of 500 m on the transect were selected. The same points were used every year. The basic principle of this method is the stationary recording of species by direct sight and/or sound for 10 min at the sample point. The observations were assigned to three experienced ornithologists and began in the early morning (5 a.m. to 8 a.m., depending on the season) and were finished not later than at 1 p.m. The observation points at one line were visited in a systematic way one after another. However, to avoid rough systematic errors, the surveys during the season started from different ends of the transects, and the transects were judiciously changed among the ornithologists within the years. Although the sampling approach was not completely random, the collected observation data may be considered representative for the study area because of the density and allocation of observation points and the frequency of observations. To avoid double counts from adjacent observation points, only those individuals were documented that occurred within a maximum distance of 250 m. In the following, the term “sample plot” is used for a circular area of ca. 20 ha with the observation point in the centre and a radius of 250 m. Every point represents an independent sample plot and is individually documented by an acquisition sheet as well as its location in coordinates to ensure reproducibility and comparability. From the multitude of data collected at each count, we use here only three: bird species, occurrence (presence/absence) and date.
