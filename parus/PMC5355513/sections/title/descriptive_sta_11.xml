 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To obtain a visual overview of the bird sample data and to describe the validity of the data, various descriptive statistics were performed. Bird population abundances are influenced by several external factors, such as habitat quality, resource availability and species-related reproductive differences, which are not included in our data. The data from particular sampling events were summarized to obtain information on how many bird species were present in the whole observation area per year and to compare the years. Hence, relatively permanent and temporarily occurring bird species could be identified, as could trend information over individual years (Table 
  <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a>). The breeding bird monitoring resulted in a total of 135 bird species sighted over the 4 years of observation, with a total number of 42,361 bird individuals observed during 20,007 sightings.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The breeding bird guild representatives selected for our analyses sum to 17,549 individual observations (41% of the total) registered during 8,432 listed individual sightings; the 15 selected species represent 42% of the observed individuals of the overall bird community. The composition of the different guilds is shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>. Farmland birds constituted the largest group, with a share of 57%, followed by the hedgerow species, with 27%. The numbers underpin the prior characterization of the investigation area as an agricultural landscape. The detailed information for the particular bird species used in our analysis as guild representatives is shown in Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>. The individual plot observation results were then further processed per guild to obtain information on the LOP for each sample plot.
