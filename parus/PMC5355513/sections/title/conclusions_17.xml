 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our paper, we introduce an operational approach to assess the habitat suitability of agricultural landscapes for farmland birds on the basis of landscape metrics. Our aim is to develop an assessment method applicable to a wide range of both landscapes and bird communities. Therefore, we build on a comprehensive consideration of both the whole bird community and the whole landscape through combining the procedures of “guild classification” for the bird species and of “landscape metrics” for the analysis of the structural characteristics of landscapes. The applicability of the novel assessment method was verified by empirical bird monitoring data for a landscape in north-east Germany carried out over a 4-year period with more than 20,000 individual bird observations. The resulting algorithms allow for the discrimination of the habitat requirements for four of the analysed five bird guilds. Finally, a subset of six landscape metrics out of the overall tested 16 metrics variables proved to be meaningful and sufficient for creating habitat suitability maps for the whole landscape and all bird guilds considered. The potential advantages of this approach include its applicability to (i) landscapes with different natural pre-conditioning (setting) and to (ii) different bird fauna compositions (inventories), which we suggest to investigate further.</p>
