 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main objective of the statistical analysis of the bird occurrence data was to determine whether it was possible to predict the guild occurrence within the sample areas based on the values of the specific landscape metrics around the sample areas. The occurrence of a guild in a sample plot was expressed by the occurrence of its 3 characteristic species and their LOP values. The derived LOP values serve as a target variable for subsequent analytical statistics. Due to the statistical properties of the LOP values and of the considered landscape metrics, only analytical methods without special requirements concerning the statistical distributions of the included features were applied.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The pairwise relationships between landscape metrics and the LOPs for the particular guilds were analysed with Spearman rank correlation coefficients. The classification of “preferred” and “less preferred” habitats was then accomplished with a binary logistic regression using input data derived from the LOPs. The binary logistic regression was selected as a principal analytical method because the analytical focus was on the qualitative distinction between rather unsuitable habitats (less preferred) and rather suitable habitats (preferred) based on landscape metrics. The binary logistic regression model is able to predict a binary response dependent on one or more independent inputs and has no particular requirements concerning the scale level of these inputs. Practically any appropriate quantitative or qualitative variable including landscape metrics may serve as input. The binary logistics regression allows a direct and transparent interpretation of input effects, and it is furthermore possible to evaluate the reliability of the classification and to rank the importance of inputs. Mathematically, the binary logistic regression function takes values between 0 and 1, and the binary response is assigned to the function values using a cut point between 0 and 1. In most practical situations, 0.5 serves as the cut point. Mathematical details and the implementation in SPSS are described by Field (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, the binary response (preferred vs. less preferred habitats) is derived from the LOPs as a dependent variable, and a set of landscape metrics is used as independent variables. Among the landscape metrics, those three metrics were selected as inputs that showed the greatest Spearman correlation coefficient with the particular LOP. In case of obviously functionally dependent landscape metrics (absolute values of pairwise correlation coefficients equal to or close to 1), only one of them was used as input in order to keep the inputs as mutually independent as possible. The number of input variables was limited to three to enable a transparent interpretation of the mutual interconnections.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The members of the two alternative classes (preferred vs. less preferred habitats) were taken from the cases that fell below the 25% quartile of the LOPs and above the 75% quartile of the LOPs of every particular guild and observation point. The “lower” class indicates rather unsuitable habitats (less preferred), and the “upper” class indicates rather suitable habitats (preferred). Each class contains approximately 30 cases. Within SPSS, the binary logistic regression was executed with the variable selection method “Enter”, i.e. all independent input variables are entered in a single step (Field 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2013</a>). To evaluate and compare the general classification success and the goodness of fit of the logistical regression models, the share of correct classifications was determined and Nagelkerke

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The statistical significance of individual input variables in the guild models is derived from the 
  <span class="italic">p</span> value of the Wald chi-square statistics. The

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" href="#CR89">2009</a>). To interpret the effect of inputs (the various landscape metrics) as having the same scale, standardized regression coefficients were calculated according to the method proposed by King (
