 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relationship between landscape structure and biota has been extensively described mostly for species richness issues, including birds (Atauri and de Lucio 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2001</a>; Morelli et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">2013</a>). With respect to birds, numerous studies emphasize the importance of landscape complexity (Fischer et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">2011</a>; Rüdisser et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">2015</a>) or heterogeneity (Morelli et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">2013</a>) for high species richness values. However, the “the more, the better” conclusion for the relationship between landscape heterogeneity and bird species richness in many of these studies is ultimately not readily applicable for conservation measures, for multiple reasons. One reason is the quantification problem for the target of conservation measures (“How much heterogeneity is enough?”); another is the disregard of the natural landscape setting (“What is the benchmark?”). Landscapes that differ in abiotic characteristics and land use histories also vary with respect to their species inventories and their ecological potentials and are therefore difficult to compare.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some recent studies have made it clear that addressing species diversity or habitat suitability requires different sets of landscape metrics. Schindler et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">2013</a>) found that metrics quantifying patch shape, proximity, texture and landscape diversity are most suitable for describing species richness (species diversity), while those describing patch area, similarity and edge contrast rarely contribute to significant models for species diversity. In their review of the use of landscape spatial metrics as indicators for various ecosystem functions, Uuemaa et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" href="#CR92">2013</a>) found that metrics describing landscape diversity, complexity or even fragmentation are the most relevant for effects on species and genetic diversity for different organism groups. Many studies stress that the abundance of particular bird species or species groups responds more strongly to the composition of land cover classes or even specific habitats than to metrics addressing landscape configuration (Uuemaa et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" href="#CR92">2013</a>; Carrara et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2015</a>; Rüdisser et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">2015</a>; Kuiper et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Obviously, the habitat suitability of different bird species to landscape structure varies depending on the group of species considered and the species assemblage for a given region (Atauri and de Lucio 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2001</a>). Some studies have shown varying responses of particular guilds to specific landscape metrics (Marja et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">2013</a>; Mimet et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">2014</a>; Rüdisser et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">2015</a>). With the results of our analysis, we introduce a methodology for (i) the differentiation of habitat requirements of guilds for typical habitats in rural areas based on landscape metrics and (ii) the identification of metrics characterizing the overlap in potential habitats of particular guilds using a holistic approach, as suggested, for example, by Marja et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Landscape metrics are widely accepted as a means to analyse the relationships between landscape structure and biodiversity (Schindler et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">2013</a>). The landscape metrics identified by our results as the most suitable for the differentiation of the preferred habitats between the chosen guilds are plausible in the context of the existing literature. In our results, the preferred areas for farmland birds were described best by Simpson’s diversity index, the shape index and the edge density set. The suitable areas can thus be described as basically consisting of only one habitat type, i.e. arable land, as not having highly complex shapes and as being rich in edges between the particular shapes. It is well known that skylarks, the most abundant farmland bird, avoid areas near forests (Fonderflick et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2013</a>; Pätzold 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" href="#CR70">1994</a>) and landscapes with considerable forest cover or patches (Rüdisser et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">2015</a>). Field margins and transition zones were found to be the most attractive for skylarks (Kuiper et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">2013</a>) and corn buntings (Reino et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" href="#CR77">2009</a>) as foraging and breeding areas. Josefsson et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">2013</a>) reported an apparent preference of skylarks for cropped areas adjacent to buffer strips. Grassy or herbaceous field margins are used preferentially by early breeding yellow wagtails, mainly for foraging (Gilroy et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">2009</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The grassland species guild exhibited the lowest reclassification accuracy (66%) and the highest uncertainties of all guilds. This might be due to the lowest numbers of sightings of these bird species in our survey. The preferred areas for the grassland species were identified by the contiguity index distribution, patch density and shape index distribution set and are described as small, isolated grassland plots (low contiguity and low patch density) without highly complex shapes (low shape index). The occurrence of small closed drainage basins with grassland vegetation, which are extensively used or not managed at all, is a specific feature of many North-Middle European landscapes. The preference of the grassland birds for these features, as found in our study, might be strongly affected by the extensive management of such plots. The meadow pipit is known to inhabit open grassy areas with dense, low vegetation cover, such as extensive meadows, and to avoid very short grass in intensive meadows or grazed pastures (Kumstátová et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">2004</a>; Hötker 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">1989</a>). The results of Vanhinsberg and Chamberlain (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95" href="#CR95">2001</a>) suggest a mosaic of heather, bog and grassland as the optimum habitat for meadow pipits. The whinchat primarily inhabits cultivated grassland but with traditional extensive management (Fischer et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2013</a>). In particular, early and frequent cutting is observed as the main driver for the recent population decline (Müller et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">2005</a>). The northern lapwing exhibits a preference for nesting in habitats with wet features (Eglington et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">2010</a>), which in our landscape were provided by the small drainage basins.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Habitat requirements for birds breeding in hedgerows could be distinguished with high statistical significance from the other bird guilds by applying the metric set of the edge density index, largest patch index and Simpson’s diversity index. The preferred habitats were the transient zones (edges) between the different habitat types (high Simpson’s diversity), in contrast to the forest habitats due to their small sizes (largest patches). Batáry et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">2012</a>) found clear differences in the bird community composition between hedgerow and forest edge habitats. The forest species were more abundant along the forest edges and only used hedges as a secondary or alternative habitat. The red-backed shrike was regarded as the most abundant hedgerow breeder in our study area, and Brambilla et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">2009</a>) found positive associations between shrike occurrences and both hedgerow length and partial shrub cover at the landscape and plot scale. Shrikes also showed a positive correlation with the presence of various habitat types in the vicinity of the hedges, such as grassland cover at the landscape level and herbaceous vegetation at the finer scale. The Eurasian chaffinch is partly classified as a forest species in other studies (Pelosi et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">2014</a>; Brambilla et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">2015</a>). Thus, most of the studies describe the Eurasian chaffinch’s preferred complex habitat structures as consisting of neighbouring forest (Pelosi et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">2014</a>), herbaceous ground and urban habitats (Brambilla et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">2015</a>) and especially the presence of fruit resources (Albrecht et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2012</a>). Shake et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" href="#CR82">2012</a>) found that many of the shrubland bird species in the United States were area-sensitive, while the patch shape index and the proportion of forest cover were insufficient predictors of occupancy by the shrubland birds.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Forest birds preferred areas with high shape index values, high Simpson’s diversity index values and low edge density values in our analysis. They can be differentiated from the hedgerow guild as preferring different habitat types, including forests (higher Simpson’s diversity index), that are of irregular shape (high shape index) and as avoiding transient zones (edges) between different habitat types. Within the agricultural matrix, forests are mostly singular patches and seldom share borders with other forest patches. In contrast, in forest-dominated landscapes, the forest patch area could be the most significant variable explaining the patch occupancy of residents and summering forest birds, as reported by Suk et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" href="#CR86">2014</a>). Barbaro et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">2014</a>) reported that landscape diversity had a significant effect on forest bird functional evenness and dispersion, while native forest cover only affected evenness. However, the forest cover or distance to forest remnants is crucial for the conservation of particular guilds or functional groups in fragmented agro-forest landscapes (Tscharntke et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" href="#CR91">2008</a>; Clough et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2009</a>). There are strong structural differences between the forest interior and forest edges. Broughton et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2012</a>) reported that the marsh tit occupation was lower within a 50-m edge buffer than within the forest interior. Edge avoidance is a typical response of specialist forest interior species (Burke and Nol 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">1998</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bird species that prefer settlements and urban environments can be described with the same indices as the hedge breeding birds but with different factor levels. Settlement birds prefer the transient area between settlements and arable land (high edge density), the patchy environment around the settlements (high largest patch index LPI) and the high diversity between habitat types (high Simpson’s diversity index). Birds in urban environments can be classified into groups of distinct habitat requirements (Jokimäki and Suhonen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">1998</a>), especially regarding the density of buildings and trees or green space. The selected species in our case were considered as moderately urbanophilic species (Croci et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">2008</a>), and they require tree coverage (Redhead et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" href="#CR75">2013</a>) and bare ground underneath. They also occur widely in a range of alternative habitats, including parkland, urban gardens and agricultural land (Hinsley et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">2008</a>). DeGraaf and Wentworth (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">1986</a>) noted that suburbs vary in avian composition depending largely on the degree to which they alter natural habitats. Edge species can probably continue to thrive in suburbs. Sandström et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" href="#CR79">2006</a>) found that the two tit species also used in our analysis were increasingly abundant towards the periphery of urban areas, while the sparrow was most abundant in highly diverse residential areas.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results demonstrate the sensitivity of the sets of landscape metrics to describe the potential occurrence of the particular bird guilds. In contrast to the results of Marja et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">2013</a>), who used three fixed landscape metrics at different scales, we identified sets of landscape metrics distinguishing all guilds with high classification accuracy (higher than 80%), except for the grassland species where the re-classification rate was only 66%. We cannot confirm the conclusion drawn by Uuemaa et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" href="#CR92">2013</a>) in their review on the use of landscape metrics, i.e. that bird species generally respond more strongly to the composition of land use classes than to the configuration of landscapes. This statement seems to be related only to bird species diversity, not to habitat suitability for particular guilds. In our results, all groups of landscape metrics (composition, diversity, geometry and configuration indices) appeared in the final models for the particular guilds with changes in the variance explanation loadings. Simpson’s diversity index and the edge density served as explanatory variables for the habitat preferences of four of the five investigated guilds. Moreover, the role of particular landscape metrics seems to be quite sensitive to the selection of the target variable or to the definition of the guilds. Caprio et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2009</a>) found that different response variables predicted the diversity of specialist or generalist forest birds. Edge density is regarded as a good predictor for bird abundances (Fletcher and Koford 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">2002</a>; Rehm and Baldassarre 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" href="#CR76">2007</a>). Reino et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" href="#CR77">2009</a>) drew attention to the fact that the edge response can vary between, for example, steppe and woodland bird guilds. The edge contrast even summarizes the effects of varying strengths, depending on the type of neighbouring habitats. Accordingly, Reino et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" href="#CR77">2009</a>) distinguished between “hard” (habitat types with large qualitative distances) and “soft” (habitat types with low qualitative distances) edges. In our study area, the high number of arable field polygons determined the quality of the edge relationships. In many cases, the arable fields were adjacent to each other but were treated as individual habitats. This might explain the positive correlation of edge density with the farmland birds and the negative correlation with the forest and hedgerow guilds. The interpretation of edge density in isolation from the other metrics may lead to misinterpretations of the habitat models. Shake et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" href="#CR82">2012</a>) reported that the area sensitivity was important for shrubland birds. Similar findings were reported for forest birds (Broughton et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2012</a>; Burke and Nol 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">1998</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many papers emphasize that the spatial scale affects the performance of the landscape metrics for terrestrial birds (Suk et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" href="#CR86">2014</a>; Schindler et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">2013</a>; Oja et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">2005</a>; Morelli et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">2013</a>). Marja et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">2013</a>) showed that the variation explanation of landscape metrics for farmland bird variables increased with the size of the study area. Similarly, Böhning-Gaese (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">1997</a>) revealed that the prediction of bird species richness changed with increasing raster sizes (grains). In particular, the habitat occupancy of habitat specialists and of rare species seems to improve at larger scales (Skórka et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" href="#CR83">2006</a>). Morelli et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">2013</a>) demonstrated that scale effects varied indifferently for both predictor and response variables as well as for different landscape backgrounds. The authors suggested a radius between 125 and 250 m or between 100 and 5,000 m (Rüdisser et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">2015</a>) as the best trade-off between accuracy and variable bird home ranges for correlating landscape metrics with bird census data. The design of our bird survey and the calculation of the landscape metrics are in accordance with these recommendations. For conservation purposes, Morelli et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">2013</a>) suggested multiscale analyses, integrating the spatial distribution of niches and resources at smaller scales. According to our bird monitoring design, the spatial scale was pre-determined by the survey design having a fixed sample area for the field observations (250 m radius) and by the distance to the centre of the next sample area (500 m). To avoid inter-correlation of the data, analyses at larger scales are only possible by omitting data from intermediate overlapping sampling plots (in our case, every second plot). However, the model with reduced replications (
  <span class="italic">N</span>) would lose comparability with respect to the full models.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The lack of land use details might be the reason for the reduced model accuracy in our study with respect to the grassland birds. The evidence of this impact was clearly demonstrated for grassland birds in different European regions (Verhulst et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" href="#CR96">2004</a>; Atkinson et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">2005</a>). Used or abandoned grasslands may have totally different habitat qualities for grassland birds. Morelli et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">2013</a>) suggested the use of multi-scale spatial models combining information on landscape structure with land use intensity at the plot scale to solve this problem. Similar findings have been reported for farmland (Wretenberg et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" href="#CR100">2010</a>; Piha et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">2007</a>), forest (Villard et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" href="#CR97">1999</a>) and hedgerow (Bonifacio et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">2011</a>) birds.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our statistical analysis used LOP values for guilds within the sample areas for classification purposes. This brings some advances to the commonly used presence/absence information of representatives of the guilds (Mimet et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">2014</a>; Morelli et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">2013</a>; Oja et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">2005</a>). We did not use the number of observed individuals in the sample areas in order to avoid influences originating from species-specific home ranges, breeding densities and social behaviour (e.g. flocking), and extreme observation values. Therefore, it is possible that different observation situations lead to identical LOP values. This is not considered as a serious restriction because the distinction between preferred and less preferred habitats should be based on the persistence of the incidence of guild representatives rather than the number of individuals.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To derive qualitative relationships between the occurrence of breeding bird guilds and information concerning the landscape structure, binary logistic regression was applied as a binary classifier. This method is well adopted in habitat selection studies (Keating and Cherry 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">2004</a>; Jokimäki et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">2014</a>). One striking advantage of this method in landscape-related research is the option to combine inputs of different scale levels without further requirements concerning their statistical properties. It is true that the binary logistic regression in the applied form merely generates dichotomous class memberships, but it is possible to evaluate the relative importance of the selected input landscape metrics and their statistical significance. Furthermore, it is possible to refine the current approach with additional input variables (e.g. crop diversity, site conditions). If a finer classification is needed, input and target data could be reclassified to apply a multinomial logistic regression.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It cannot be expected that the detailed results of this study are transferable to other regions without modifications. The derived results are, to a certain degree, specific to the Quillow investigation area. This holds for the definition of the guilds and for the derived dependencies between bird occurrence and landscape structure. Therefore, when moving to other regions, it will certainly be necessary to redefine the guild composition depending on local abiotic situations and land use, that is, the general approach to assess habitat suitability can be retained, but it will require local adaptation.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, the mutual correlations and context sensitivity of single landscape metrics call for multifaceted (Rüdisser et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">2015</a>) and holistic methodological approaches that can be adapted to specific landscape conditions (Caprio et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2009</a>). We suggest the consideration of a wide range of species classified into guilds to represent the bird community of a landscape and different types of landscape metrics. There is an important link that needs to be further explored between the metrics of bird functional diversity and the ecosystem services provided by avian predation (Uuemaa et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" href="#CR92">2013</a>; Gonzalez-Gomez et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2006</a>; Philpott et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">2009</a>).
