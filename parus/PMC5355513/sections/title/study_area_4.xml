 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The bird monitoring used in this study was performed in the AgroScapeLabs Quillow, a central observation area of the Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research, which is located in the north-eastern German lowlands in the federal state of Brandenburg (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). With a size of 290 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>, the investigation area includes the catchment of the Quillow, i.e. a small stream. The climatic conditions of the area are characterized by a transition between the mild oceanic and continental climate with hot and dry summers and cold winters. The long-term temperature mean measured from 1961 to 1990 varies between 7.6 °C in the west and 8.2 °C in the east of the area (Deutscher Wetter Dienst 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">2013</a>). The average precipitation ranges between approximately 470 and 595 mm. The study area is shaped by the glaciations of the Pleistocene (Weichselian Glacial) and post-glacial processes. The soil conditions and landscape structure are typical for the northern portion of central continental Europe. The broad range in soil fertility and a highly heterogeneous distribution of different soil types determine the regional agricultural land-use capabilities. The elevation of the Quillow catchment is between 0 and 100 m above sea level, and the area is dominated by arable land (62.2%), accompanied by forests (12.7%), grasslands (11.9%) and other habitats. The area is typically “agricultural”, with soils of mostly medium and high yield potential (Stackebrandt and Manhenke 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" href="#CR85">2002</a>). Conventional farming is dominant, with an average farm size of 346 ha, and winter wheat and oilseed rape are dominant crops. The population density is quite low (36 inhabitants/km
  <span class="sup">2</span>), with a decreasing trend. Parts of the investigation area belong to a landscape conservation area. The significance of the region for birds is high, as BirdLife International identifies the region as one of the Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs) in Europe (Heath et al.
