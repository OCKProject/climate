 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The occurrence of a guild at a sample plot is expressed by the presence (1) or absence (0) of the three characteristic species, neglecting the actual number of individuals. The occurrences were summarized as follows: in each of the surveys, a maximum of three was possible on each sample plot when all species of the guild could be observed, and 0 when no species was observed. These values are taken to construct a so-called level of persistence (LOP) for every guild at each sample plot, which is the sum of all presence/absence values over the whole survey area and duration, with a theoretical minimum of 0 and a theoretical maximum of 57 (3 years with five surveys, 1 year with four surveys and three species per guild). It is true that the LOP approach introduced here has no direct ecological meaning. Due to its construction, it may be considered a further development of the common presence-absence approach. The addition of the frequency of bird occurrences at particular points may furthermore indicate the habitat quality of the sample areas in an aggregated quantitative way. A high LOP value means that species of a guild are frequently observed, so the area is considered to be a rather preferred habitat of that guild. The LOPs were derived for each of the five guilds, and statistical analysis was conducted for each guild for all sample plots. In total, 120 of the 125 potential sample plots were visited at all occasions and used for the analysis. Five sample plots were excluded due to missing data.</p>
