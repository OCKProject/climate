    </td>
    <td>Assesses the spatial connectedness, or contiguity, of cells within a patch to provide an index on patch boundary configuration and thus patch shape (LaGro 1991); CONTIG equals 0 for a one-pixel patch and increases to a limit of 1.</td>

   <tr>
    <td>Edge density (ED)</td>
    <td>m/ha</td>
    <td>ED = 0 when there is no edge in the landscape, that is, when the entire landscape and landscape border, if present, consists of a single patch.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Largest patch index (LPI)</td>
    <td>%</td>
    <td>The largest patch index quantifies the percentage of total landscape area comprised by the largest patch. As such, it is a simple measure of dominance.</td>

    <td>Patch density (PD)</td>
    <td>
     <span class="italic">N</span>/100 ha
    </td>
    <td>Patch density has the same basic utility as number of patches as an index, except that it expresses number of patches on a per unit area basis that facilitates comparisons among landscapes of varying size.</td>

    <td>Shape index distribution (SHAPE_MN)</td>
    <td>None
     <span class="break"/>SHAPE_MN ≥ 1
    </td>
    <td>SHAPE = 1 when the patch is square and increases without limit as the patch shape becomes more irregular. On the landscape level, the mean of all patches in the landscape is calculated.</td>

    <td>Simpson’s diversity index (SIDI)</td>
    <td>None
     <span class="break"/>0 ≤ SIDI ≤ 1
    </td>
    <td>SIDI = 0 when the landscape consists of only 1 patch (i.e. no diversity). SIDI approaches 1 as the number of different patch types increases and the proportion of the area among patch types becomes more equitable.</td>
