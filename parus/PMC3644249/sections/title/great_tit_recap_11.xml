 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 328 adult great tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) were captured over the three breeding seasons (110 great tits in 2009, 158 in 2010 and 60 in 2011). Amongst them, 55 birds were recaptured in one or both subsequent years to their first capture. In 2010 there was a recapture rate of 22.8% (n = 158) (i.e. birds caught in 2010 that were also trapped the previous year) and a recapture rate of 38.3% (n = 60) in 2011 (birds that were previously trapped in 2009 and/or 2010).
