 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Haemosporidian prevalence was high over sampled years with 98% of 55 recaptured individuals showing infection in at least one year of capture. Eighty-two percent of all positive individuals suffered co-infection, with an overall haemosporidian lineage diversity of seventeen. 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> parasites were found to be highly persistent, with lineages from these genera consistently found in individuals across years and with no differences in individual parasitaemia being recorded at subsequent captures. Conversely, 
  <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span> parasites showed higher turnover with regard to lineage changes or transitions in infection status (infected 
  <span class="italic">vs</span> non-infected) across years. Parasitaemia was found to be lineage specific and there was no relationship between 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> parasitaemia or host body condition and the presence of 
  <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span> parasites.
