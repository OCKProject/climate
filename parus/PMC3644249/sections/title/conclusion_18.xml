 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most studies only consider Plasmodium and Haemoproteus parasites when investigating avian haemosporidian infections and as a result Leucocytozoon is under-represented in the literature. This study has focussed not only on Plasmodium, Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon infection across time at the individual scale, but also considered multiple infections of these parasites and what that might imply for Haemosporida coevolution with their hosts. This study has demonstrated the complexities of interactions (host-parasite and parasite-parasite) and dynamics of parasite communities and their hosts in natural study systems which could affect the ecology of either or both organisms involved.</p>
