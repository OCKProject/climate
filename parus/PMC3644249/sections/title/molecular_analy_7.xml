 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">DNA was extracted from blood using the DNeasy tissue extraction kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s protocol for purification of DNA from blood using the BioSprint 96. After DNA extraction a nested PCR refined by Waldenström

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B14" href="#B14">14</a>] was performed on all samples. The full method is described in [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B37" href="#B37">37</a>] with the following modifications: The PCR cycle profile included an initial denaturation at 94°C for 3 minutes followed by 20 cycles of 94°C for 30 s; 50°C for 30 s; 72°C for 45 s, and with a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The final PCR amplification was run for 35 cycles with the same thermal profile as described here. For 
  <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span> amplification, initial primers HaemNFI and HaemNR3 and nested primers HaemFL and HaemR2L (amplifying a 480 bp 
  <span class="italic">Cyt b</span> fragment) were used [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B38" href="#B38">38</a>] with the same thermal profile and procedure as described. Reactions were run on a Veriti 96 Well Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems). Distilled RNAse-free water was used as a negative control and one negative control was inserted for every nine samples tested. Genomic DNA from individuals with known malarial infections were used as positive control. Nested PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide and a sample deemed positive if a fragment of approximately 500 bp was present when the gel was viewed under a UV light.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nested PCR products were purified using the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega) using the manufacturer’s protocol for DNA purification by centrifugation. Purified PCR products were sequenced in both directions using the primers HaemF and HaemR2 for

The sequences were assembled and edited using CodonCode Aligner (CodonCode Corporation). Sequences were then identified by performing a local BLAST search with the MalAvi database [

  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> sequences could be identified (or characterised as multiple infections), while 3.5% of 
  <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span> samples were unidentifiable after sequencing due to poor DNA quality resulting in unreadable chromatographs. Similarly, identification of lineages involved in multiple infections were not possible (38.9% of infected birds suffered multiple 
  <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span> infections, while 3.7% suffered multiple 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> / 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> infections).

  <span class="italic">α</span> represents the DNA quantity in the sample; m represents the slope of the standard curve; and △Ct is the difference between the mean Ct value of the sample and the intercept of the standard curve. Ct (or threshold cycle) is the fractional cycle number at which the fluorescence is detected to significantly surpass the threshold. This equation then gives a relative quantification value for parasitaemia relative to a standard sample used. Relative parasite density relative to host (R

  <span class="italic">α</span>, the log

  <span class="italic">α</span> was used to linearize this relationship. Parasitaemia is, therefore, unitless. The same reference sample was used for all qPCR standard curves and the efficiency of each qPCR run is taken into account during the calculation, therefore, parasitaemia values for samples collected in different years are directly comparable.
