 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study examined haemosporidian infection at the individual level in wild free-living great tits across time. Parasite prevalence was high (98%) with only one individual remaining parasite free across both years of its capture. A co-infection rate of 82% was found in recaptured birds. While co-infection can influence parasite dynamics, no relationship was found for the presence of 
  <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span> parasites and 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> parasitaemia. The data indicates that 
  <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span> infection is dynamic within a host and between several parasite lineages whilst on the other hand and in agreement with Hasselquist 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>[
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B25" href="#B25">25</a>], Plasmodium and Haemoproteus infection remains constant once a parasite has established itself within a host.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The differences observed in the present study with regard to 
   <span class="italic">Plasmodium, Haemoproteus</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span> lineage turn-over within hosts might be an indication of the differential strategies applied by different parasites when infecting their hosts, and might be explained by two levels of interaction: within-host competition between parasite lineages and host immune defense.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span> parasites in the great tits might not be as effective at competing for resources as 
   <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> or 
   <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> parasites, and as a result cannot increase in frequency to such an extent as to gain enough of a competitive advantage over Plasmodium parasites to be able to persist within the host’s blood in the presence of 
   <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span>. This would not necessarily imply any transmission disadvantage for Leucocytozoon, which might choose to undertake larger-scale sexual reproduction, while Plasmodium infection consists of a globally larger number of asexual parasites. This possibility is illustrated by a study on rodent malaria (Plasmodium chabaudi) where Taylor et al [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B45" href="#B45">45</a>] compared infection dynamics of two lineages when inoculated individually into hosts or as co-infections with different initial inoculation frequencies. This was done to test whether competitive interactions between parasites occur in terms of infection of hosts and transmission to vectors. The authors concluded that malaria parasites might have evolved to maximize transmission from mixed-genotype infections, as asexual abundance did not correlate with transmission success in co-infections. This would therefore imply that different parasites involved in co-infections might differentially invest in either asexual or sexual reproduction, thereby ensuring transmission potential to the parasite occurring in lower numbers in the presence of competition. This may, however, hold true only for mixed infection with lineages belonging to the same genus and which share the same vectors.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another explanation for the differences in turn-over among lineages could be the host’s immune system. Hosts are not passive victims of parasite infections, but actively launch a defensive campaign in the form of the immune system (for a full review on the mechanisms by which haemosporidian parasites evade the host’s immune response see [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B46" href="#B46">46</a>]). The immune components and defense strategies applied during infection will vary amongst different host species, especially with regard to inflammatory response and adaptive immunity (for a review, see [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B47" href="#B47">47</a>]). Little information is available on the evolutionary history of 
   <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span>. One can speculate that in this study system, the bird’s immune system might be more competent at fighting off Leucocytozoon infection than either 
   <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> or 
   <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> infections, indirectly inferring a competitive advantage to the latter and resulting in greater lineage and infection status turn-over.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It must also be noted that the possibility exists that hosts might be able to clear parasites of all genera equally efficiently, but repeat infection probability of 
   <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> parasites (which occur in greater abundances than other parasites within the study population) is higher than for 
   <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span> parasites which show a greater lineage diversity, but at lower prevalences. This could result in an artefact illusion that 
   <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> infection is more persistent. This possibility could be tested by serial sampling throughout the season.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lineage specific differences</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The general life-cycle and process of Haemosporida infection are well-known and accepted as a whole [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B8" href="#B8">8</a>], but very little is known about the exact infection dynamics within hosts. Parasitaemia experienced by great tits in this study was lineage dependent, with SW2 infection resulting in higher parasitaemia than SGS1. This is interesting, as Valkiūnas [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B8" href="#B8">8</a>] reports that infection with P. polare, which is the morphospecies to which SW2 belongs, always results low parasitaemia. This observed discrepancy with the literature could point to sampling time coinciding with peak parasitaemia in SW2, but at this time no other explanation can be given. Such lineage-specific differences between parasites in parasitaemia as observed in this study is in concurrence with Zehtindjiev et al [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B48" href="#B48">48</a>] who found that prepatent period, peak parasitaemia and parasitaemia during chronic infection differed by parasite lineage in great reed warblers (Acrocephalus arundinaceus). Comparably, Palinauskas et al [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B49" href="#B49">49</a>] found that pre-patent period and peak parasitaemia also differed among firstly, different host species and secondly, individuals within the same species experimentally infected with the same parasite lineage. It therefore appears that infection dynamics are idiosyncratic and can depend on many factors and their interactions. One such confounding factor influencing infection dynamics is that hosts face the onslaught of many parasites at the same time, and rarely have to cope with single infections in nature, i.e. within-host competition as a result of mixed infections.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Co-infection</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The data from this study show that co-infections of malaria parasites are common, and our estimate in the great tit of 82% is consistent with the high frequencies of infection with multiple parasites in natural populations of other European bird species reported by Valkiūnas et al [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B50" href="#B50">50</a>]. Despite this high prevalence of co-infections, there does not appear to be a negative effect of co-infection on Plasmodium parasitaemia. This could be evidence for a more synergistic/benign type of interaction as summarized in [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B33" href="#B33">33</a>], where a parasite induces prolonged infection or better establishment of another parasite. In addition, the possibility that the latter could influence Leucocytozoon parasitaemia, cannot be excluded, as this was beyond the scope of this investigation. Another important consideration is that, while this study only considers a co-occurrence of parasites, effects might vary with the number of parasites involved in co-infections.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The large number of Leucocytozoon multiple infections observed, as opposed to multiple Plasmodium and Haemoproteus infections, might indicate Leucocytozoon parasites to be opportunistic parasites which can only establish themselves once a host’s immune system is weakened by prior infections thereby facilitating their establishment. This is in accordance with Cornet and Sorci [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B51" href="#B51">51</a>] who investigated the virulence consequences of parasite-induced immunosuppression on the risk of contracting opportunistic diseases in Gammarus pulex. Their study suggests that parasite exploitation of the host depends on the risk of contracting opportunistic diseases. Parasites should therefore limit their suppression of the host’s immune response if opportunistic infections will result in host death, but should not have to change their exploitation if the risk associated therewith is low. Accordingly, opportunistic Leucocytozoon lineages might not impose significant virulence costs to their hosts so as to allow for infection opportunity. As Leucocytozoon parasitaemia was not tested in this study, it is impossible to know if multiple Leucocytozoon infections result in higher parasitaemia than single infections and is a definite avenue for future investigation. If this is a case of facilitated, opportunistic infection, it would be evidence that not all lineages have equal infection potential.
