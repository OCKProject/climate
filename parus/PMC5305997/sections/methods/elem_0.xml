  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study was carried out at Wytham Woods (51°46′N, 1°20′W, National Grid Reference SP4608), a 385‐ha mixed‐deciduous woodland in Oxfordshire, UK. The canopy composition of the Wytham is primarily pedunculate oak (
   <span class="italic">Quercus robur</span>), common ash (
   <span class="italic">Fraxinus excelsior</span>), sycamore maple (
   <span class="italic">Acer pseudoplatanu</span>, European beech (
   <span class="italic">Fagus sylvatica</span>), and silver birch (
   <span class="italic">Betula pendula</span>), with an understory of common hazel (
   <span class="italic">Corylus avellana</span>), hawthorn (
   <span class="italic">Crataegus momgyna</span>), elder (
   <span class="italic">Sambucus niger</span>), and field maple (
   <span class="italic">Acer campestre</span>) (Perrins, 
   <a rid="ece32718-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0039">1965</a>). Wytham Woods consists of a mosaic of habitat types that can be broadly categorized as (1) ancient seminatural woodland, (2) secondary regeneration, (3) nineteenth‐century broadleaf plantation, and (4) twentieth‐century plantation and is located on a hill (altitude range 60–170 m above sea level). Soil type varies across the site, with thin soil over corallian limestone at higher altitudes, and the lower slopes consisting of deeper clay soil and sandy soil (Savill et al., 
   <a rid="ece32718-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0049">2010</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tree selection</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We selected 825 individual trees of our six focal species (
   <span class="italic">Quercus robur</span>,
   <span class="italic"> Fraxinus excelsior</span>,
   <span class="italic"> Fagus sylvatica</span>,
   <span class="italic"> Betula pendula</span>,
   <span class="italic"> Corylus avellana</span>, and 
   <span class="italic">Acer pseudoplatanus</span>), distributed across the woodland, in order to explore small‐scale individual variation in spring leaf budburst. Grid posts have been placed throughout Wytham on a 100 × 100 m grid, corresponding to points on the Ordnance Survey National Grid. We selected 200 of the 484 Wytham grid posts as sampling locations (see Fig. S1 for focal grid post locations). Site selection was influenced by the fact that this work was done as part of a wider project concerning phenological matching between trees, invertebrates, and birds (
   <span class="italic">Paridae</span> spps.).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We aimed to select one tree of each of our six focal tree species in the 100 m
   <span class="sup">2</span> surrounding each of our 200 sampling locations (where the sample location was in the center of a 100 m × 100 m grid square). However, not all species were present in all areas of the woodland; therefore, the number of trees sampled per location ranged between two and six. Of the 200 locations, oaks was present at 196, ash at 195, beech at 71, birch at 96, hazel at 156, and sycamore at 111. We selected the nearest mature tree (i.e., not a sapling) of each species to the grid post, excluding trees that were obviously unhealthy (trees where more than half of the crown was dead). To avoid any phenological bias in sampled trees, we selected trees prior to leaf development (during March 2013). The diameter at breast height (dbh) of each tree was measured and the location determined using a handheld GPS (Garmin GPSMAP 62). All trees were individually marked with aluminum tree tags (25 mm timber tags, Stanton Hope Ltd) so that they could be easily relocated. Between the 2013 and 2014 spring seasons, 10 of the focal trees fell (due to particularly strong winds in winter 2013/4) or lost their tags (two beech, three birch, three hazel, and two sycamore).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scoring of tree phenology</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observations of leaf development for the focal trees were conducted in 2013 and 2014 (March–May). Observations began when leaf buds started to swell and continued at 3‐day intervals until all shoots on the tree had developed small, unfolded leaves (see Hinks et al., 
   <a rid="ece32718-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0021">2015</a>; Wesołowski &amp; Rowiński, 
   <a rid="ece32718-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0061">2006</a>). Developing buds were scored using a key of phenological stages ranging from “dormant buds” to “visible unfurled leaves.” We used a seven‐stage key for oaks developed by Hinks et al. (
   <a rid="ece32718-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0021">2015</a>), where 1 = small dormant buds, 2 = larger, slightly elongated buds, 3 = larger, loosened greenish brown buds, 4 = further elongated buds with leaves starting to erupt (i.e., budburst), 5 = leaves emerging but still tight, 6 = leaves loosening and extending outwards, and 7 = leaves fully emerged and unfurled (see Figure 
   <a rid="ece32718-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece32718-fig-0001">1</a>b). We created additional five‐stage keys for each of the other species, where one corresponded to stage 1 on the oak scale (i.e., dormant bud), three corresponded to stage 4 on the oak scale (i.e., budburst), and five corresponded to stage 7 (i.e., leaves fully out). Stage 2 described elongated/swollen buds, and stage 4 described leaves emerging and extending outwards (see keys in supplementary material). These five‐stage keys were used because the five distinct stages could be easily observed for all six species. All scores were then normalized to have a range 0–1 and therefore were comparable across species. For each visit to a tree, a leaf development score was calculated by averaging visual scores for 12 sections of the canopy (three equal‐sized vertical sections, each split into four quarters). Any dead parts of the canopy were omitted from this calculation. All observations over the 2 years were carried out by five observers. The 825 trees were divided into nine “rounds,” which were split between three observers each year. Rounds were allocated so that each observer covered a similar range of habitats and altitudes. Before starting data collection, observers scored multiple trees together to minimize observer differences. They then met once a week throughout the scoring period to score a sample of trees together and compare measures to prevent divergence of scoring techniques. “Observer” was also controlled for in analyses (see below).

   <a rid="ece32718-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0062">2001</a>), and habitat type, which is likely to influence microhabitat factors such as humidity levels (Wielgolaski, 
   <a rid="ece32718-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0062">2001</a>) and also early environmental factors. We also test whether tree size, as a proxy for tree age, relates to budburst timing, as younger trees have been shown to bud earlier in the season (Ununger et al.,

A digital temperature logger (DS1923‐F5, HomeChip Ltd) attached to a plastic fob and suspended inside a plastic cup was hung on the north side of each grid post. Metallic foil trays (23 × 23 × 5 centimeters) were attached to the posts to further shade the temperature loggers. All loggers were approximately 1 m from ground level. Temperature was logged automatically every 30 min throughout April. To compare spring temperatures of 2013 and 2014 in the context of long‐term trends, we obtained long‐term temperature records for England from the Met Office (

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bud development trajectories were calculated for each tree in each of the 2 years by fitting three‐parameter sigmoid functions to the time series of bud observations using nonlinear least squares models in R, version 3.2.2 (see Figure 
    <a rid="ece32718-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece32718-fig-0001">1</a>c, e.g., curves). Budburst date is generally defined as the stage in leaf development when green leaves first become visible, and has been used as a measure of leaf development for a range of deciduous trees in numerous studies (Hinks et al., 
    <a rid="ece32718-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0021">2015</a>; Hunter &amp; Lechowicz,

    <a rid="ece32718-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0061">2006</a>). For our study, budburst corresponded to stage four (of seven) in oaks and stage three (of five) in the other species. The budburst date and bud development rate for a given tree were calculated to be the date that the sigmoid curve passed through this budburst stage, and the gradient of the curve at this point, respectively (see Figure 
    <a rid="ece32718-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece32718-fig-0001">1</a>c). The repeatability of annual budburst timing and bud development rate of individual trees was estimated using the intraclass correlation coefficient. The amount of variance in budburst date within versus between species was estimated using linear mixed models.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used spatial linear mixed models to explore potential predictors of intraspecific individual variation in budburst date and bud development rate, controlling for effects of spatial autocorrelation in the data using the R package spaMM (Rousset &amp; Ferdy, 
    <a rid="ece32718-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0047">2014</a>). Only repeatable phenological traits were tested (i.e., species that had either budburst date or development rate repeatabilities that were significant at the 
    <span class="italic">p</span> = .05 level), and each species was analyzed separately. All models included fixed effects: tree size (dbh, centimeters), soil types (sand, clay, corallian limestone), habitat type (ancient seminatural woodland, secondary regeneration, nineteenth‐century broadleaf plantation, and twentieth‐century plantation), observer, and year. Measures of altitude (m) and spring temperature (April mean daily temperature, °C) were highly correlated; we therefore ran all models twice, once including altitude and once including temperature (in addition to the variables stated above). For the majority of models, neither altitude nor temperature were significant predictors, and the model outputs for the two models were broadly comparable; consequently, we present only the models including altitude. When altitude or temperature was significant, we present both effects. All models also included tree ID as a random effect. Spring temperature for a given tree was determined by extracting a measure of local temperature for each tree from an inverse distance‐weighted (IDW) interpolation of temperature data taken from the 200 fixed‐location sampling sites (using ArcMap 10.1). All continuous predictors were 
    <span class="italic">z</span>‐transformed so that their effect sizes could be easily compared. All models (run using spaMM) included spatial data (X and Y coordinates) for each tree to correct for spatial autocorrelation. Support for variables was assessed based on breadth of confidence around the effect sizes; we discuss effects as statistically significant if they are more than twice the standard error around the estimate (Nakagawa &amp; Cuthill, 
    <a rid="ece32718-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0036">2007</a>).

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to assess the extent to which budburst date covaried between different tree species across space, we conducted pairwise correlation analysis between pairs of species (15 possible correlations between six species, see Supplementary Table 
    <a rid="ece32718-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#ece32718-tbl-0001">1</a>), which compared budburst date for species at the same sampling location across the woodland. All analyses were carried out in R, version 3.2.2 (
