 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bud development trajectories were calculated for each tree in each of the 2 years by fitting three‐parameter sigmoid functions to the time series of bud observations using nonlinear least squares models in R, version 3.2.2 (see Figure 
  <a rid="ece32718-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece32718-fig-0001">1</a>c, e.g., curves). Budburst date is generally defined as the stage in leaf development when green leaves first become visible, and has been used as a measure of leaf development for a range of deciduous trees in numerous studies (Hinks et al.,

  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0057">1997</a>; Watt &amp; McFarlane,

  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0061">2006</a>). For our study, budburst corresponded to stage four (of seven) in oaks and stage three (of five) in the other species. The budburst date and bud development rate for a given tree were calculated to be the date that the sigmoid curve passed through this budburst stage, and the gradient of the curve at this point, respectively (see Figure 
  <a rid="ece32718-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece32718-fig-0001">1</a>c). The repeatability of annual budburst timing and bud development rate of individual trees was estimated using the intraclass correlation coefficient. The amount of variance in budburst date within versus between species was estimated using linear mixed models.
