 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We selected 825 individual trees of our six focal species (
  <span class="italic">Quercus robur</span>,
  <span class="italic"> Fraxinus excelsior</span>,
  <span class="italic"> Fagus sylvatica</span>,
  <span class="italic"> Betula pendula</span>,
  <span class="italic"> Corylus avellana</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Acer pseudoplatanus</span>), distributed across the woodland, in order to explore small‐scale individual variation in spring leaf budburst. Grid posts have been placed throughout Wytham on a 100 × 100 m grid, corresponding to points on the Ordnance Survey National Grid. We selected 200 of the 484 Wytham grid posts as sampling locations (see Fig. S1 for focal grid post locations). Site selection was influenced by the fact that this work was done as part of a wider project concerning phenological matching between trees, invertebrates, and birds (
  <span class="italic">Paridae</span> spps.).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We aimed to select one tree of each of our six focal tree species in the 100 m
  <span class="sup">2</span> surrounding each of our 200 sampling locations (where the sample location was in the center of a 100 m × 100 m grid square). However, not all species were present in all areas of the woodland; therefore, the number of trees sampled per location ranged between two and six. Of the 200 locations, oaks was present at 196, ash at 195, beech at 71, birch at 96, hazel at 156, and sycamore at 111. We selected the nearest mature tree (i.e., not a sapling) of each species to the grid post, excluding trees that were obviously unhealthy (trees where more than half of the crown was dead). To avoid any phenological bias in sampled trees, we selected trees prior to leaf development (during March 2013). The diameter at breast height (dbh) of each tree was measured and the location determined using a handheld GPS (Garmin GPSMAP 62). All trees were individually marked with aluminum tree tags (25 mm timber tags, Stanton Hope Ltd) so that they could be easily relocated. Between the 2013 and 2014 spring seasons, 10 of the focal trees fell (due to particularly strong winds in winter 2013/4) or lost their tags (two beech, three birch, three hazel, and two sycamore).
