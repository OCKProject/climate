 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In recent years, there has been an increased effort to integrate perspectives across multiple disciplines in order to improve our ability to predict plant phenology across species, time, and space (reviewed in Wolkovich et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0064">2014</a>). Here, we aim to add to this effort by describing within‐ and between‐species phenological variation at a spatial scale largely neglected in existing literature. Using data collected over two consecutive—and meteorologically extreme—spring seasons, we explored environmental predictors of small‐scale individual variation in budburst date and bud development rate and establish how these phenological traits vary over space. We found that, within species, individual trees showed markedly consistent individual differences in their spring phenology across our 385‐ha study site. Environmental factors explained only a modest amount of this variation, and neither the predictors, nor the spatial patterns of variation, were consistent across species. Our findings suggest that, at the woodland level, phenological landscapes will be highly complex, varying over small spatial scales both within and between species.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The two spring seasons covered by our study were extremes in terms of spring temperature; in 2014, mean March–April temperature ranked the sixth warmest over the past 350 years for Central England, whereas 2013 saw the coldest March since 1917. In accordance with this dramatic difference in spring temperature, five of the six tree species came into leaf earlier in 2014 than 2013, but varied in their response, with oak showing the greatest plasticity with respect to temperature and beech the least (20 and 8 days of difference in budburst date between years, respectively). These results support findings from a study of phenological sensitivity to temperature along altitudinal gradients in seven deciduous tree species, which found oak to be the most sensitive and beech to be the least (Vitasse et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0059">2009</a>). Beech is known to be particularly sensitive to photoperiod and is thought to require long days before bud development can begin, even in particularly warm springs (Schaber &amp; Badeck, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0050">2003</a>). It is becoming clear that tree species have different cue sensitivities and requirements and that this can cause the order and distribution of species budburst throughout spring to differ considerably between years (Roberts et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0045">2015</a>). Interestingly, we found that ash budburst date remained relatively constant in this pair of years, with the mean budburst occurring 3 days later in 2014 than 2013. This contrasts with studies demonstrating sensitivity to spring temperature in ash (Roberts et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0045">2015</a>; Vitasse et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0059">2009</a>) and therefore contradicts previous conclusions that sensitivity to global warming is stable for a given species (Vitasse et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0059">2009</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite a growing literature on interspecific differences in spring timing, few studies have explored interspecific differences in within‐year variability in phenology. Recent work on a subarctic plant community found that early flowering species showed lower intraspecific variability in comparison with late flowering species, such that individual flowering times of early species were more closely tied to environmental predictors (Lessard‐Therrien et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0031">2014</a>). Here, we found that sycamore and ash consistently showed the most intraspecific variability in budburst date, and oak, beech, and birch consistently showed the least, but there was no link between budburst variance and budburst timing across species.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In agreement with previous work (Crawley &amp; Akhteruzzaman, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0013">1988</a>; Hinks et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0021">2015</a>; Wesołowski &amp; Rowiński, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0061">2006</a>), individual trees of all six species we monitored were repeatable in the relative order of their budburst between years. We also found that bud development rate was significantly repeatable in oak, beech, and sycamore, but not ash, birch, or hazel. Such marked individual differences among trees in close proximity (see Figures 
  <a rid="ece32718-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece32718-fig-0001">1</a>a and 
  <a rid="ece32718-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece32718-fig-0004">4</a>) suggest that genetic, early environmental, or developmental differences play a key role in determining spring phenology. Such differences appear to cause trees to interpret the same environmental cues in different ways to one another (Wesołowski &amp; Rowiński, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0061">2006</a>). Spring phenology have been shown to be heritable in a range of species (Frewen et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0018">2000</a>; Scotti‐Saintagne et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0051">2004</a>), and common garden experiments suggest strong local adaptation (Chmura, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0009">2006</a>; Chmura &amp; Rozkowski, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0010">2002</a>; Hannerz et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0020">2003</a>; Jensen &amp; Hansen, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0023">2008</a>). Studies are beginning to identify candidate genes for spring bud development (Alberto et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0001">2013</a>; Derory et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0014">2006</a>; Morin et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0035">2010</a>; Scotti‐Saintagne et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0051">2004</a>; Ueno et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0055">2013</a>; Zohner &amp; Renner, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0065">2014</a>); knowledge of genes that influence phenological traits will be essential for understanding the mechanisms underlying inherent individual differences in this trait, and the genetic structure of populations.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite individuals being consistent in their budburst timing relative to conspecifics within the woodland, we found that annual intraspecific variance in budburst differed considerably between years. All six species showed greater spread in budburst timing in 2014 than 2013 (standard deviations were between 1.7 and 3 times larger in 2014). This suggests that the extent to which intrinsic differences between individual trees influence spring phenology vary between years. While we lack the power to test drivers of this variation in the current study (having data for only two years), temperature would seem a likely candidate, given the marked annual difference observed in 2013 and 2014. To our knowledge, there has been little work exploring temporal or spatial variation in intraspecific budburst variance, despite its likely importance for higher trophic levels. High variability in vegetation phenology among neighboring trees is likely to increase the duration of the resource peak for organisms that feed on newly emerged leaves, and hence the food peak for consumers of these organisms. Increased variability in budburst date at small spatial scales therefore has the potential to relax selection on spring timing at higher trophic levels.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the aims of this study was to test whether observed variation in budburst within a single tree community could be explained by environment factors. The predictors we tested accounted for only a small amount of variation in budburst. We found little evidence for interspecific covariance in budburst across our study site. This suggests that there is no universal environmental predictor of individual variation in budburst date across species at this small spatial scale. Interestingly, despite the fact that temperature has often being found to be a strong predictor of large‐scale spatial variation in budburst timing (e.g., Chen et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0008">2005</a>; Kramer, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0028">1995</a>; Vitasse et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0059">2009</a>), this does not appear to be the case across the comparatively small spatial scales explored here. We found that temperature was a predictor of budburst date in hazel, with trees in colder areas, counter intuitively, coming into bud earlier than those in warmer areas. This perhaps suggests that trees in warmer areas may not receive sufficient chilling. Oak trees at higher altitudes came into bud later than those at lower altitudes, but this effect did not appear to be driven by local temperature differences, as temperature dropped out of the model at early stage. It should be noted that we used average temperature during April in this study; the window of temperature sensitivity triggering budburst in deciduous tree species is likely to start earlier in the year (e.g., window of thermal sensitivity in the UK for pedunculate oak, common ash, European beech, silver birch, and sycamore maple are estimated to be between the start of March and end of April, mid‐February to early May, the start of March and end of April, early March to mid‐April, and the start of February to early April, respectively, Tansey, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0052">2016</a>). Furthermore, winter chilling, which was not measured in present study, is known to be an important determinant of budburst in some species (Hadano et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0019">2013</a>; Richardson et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0044">2006</a>), although not in common ash, pedunculate oak, European beech, and sycamore maple (Tansey, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0052">2016</a>). Temperature data spanning winter and early spring are therefore needed to further explore how micro temperature differences may influence small‐scale patterns of budburst. We further note that the measures of budburst date and development rate used in this study were model‐derived estimates and therefore subject to a degree of uncertainty; this may therefore influence our ability to identify predictors of individual differences in phenology.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The findings from this study suggest that, when considering phenological variation over a small spatial scale, intraspecific differences caused by environment factors are largely overshadowed by inherent individual differences. This observation contrasts with data on variation over larger spatial scales, of tens or hundreds of kilometers, where strong environmental signals are usually present (Chen et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0008">2005</a>; Kramer, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0028">1995</a>; Vitasse et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0059">2009</a>). The question of how observed variation in life‐history traits, such as spring phenology, is dependent on the scale at which it is studied has long been a key issue in ecology (Levin, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0032">1992</a>). There is no single natural scale at which ecological phenomena should be studied, because organisms usually operate over a range of scales, across which there is often substantial environmental heterogeneity. The fact that there appears to be no obvious environmental proxies for budburst variation at the spatial scale we explored in this study presents a significant challenge for those aiming to describe and predict the phenology of tree communities. The ability to quantify these phenologically complex habitats is likely to be key in understanding how evolutionary processes operate on the animals inhabiting these environments. One promising approach for describing landscape‐level vegetation phenology is to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to collect high‐resolution green‐up data. These devices are becoming increasingly affordable and have an extremely high spatial resolution (Chabot &amp; Bird, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0007">2013</a>). As technology improves, these types of devices are likely to play an important role in the study of spatial ecology (Anderson &amp; Gaston, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0002">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During recent years, the range of people interested in vegetation phenology has grown, as have the methods employed to study it (Polgar &amp; Primack, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0042">2011</a>). Our perspective comes from an interest in the phenological landscape as it is experienced by higher trophic levels (e.g., Cole et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0011">2015</a>; Hinks et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0021">2015</a>). The analysis presented here demonstrates the complexity of phenological landscapes, when considered at a small spatial scale. At this resolution, spatial variation is driven largely by inherent individual differences rather than predictable environmental factors. More work is needed to understand how the relative importance of different drivers of phenological variation varies depending on the spatial scale being considered. The genetics of spring budburst timing is a rapidly developing field and likely to provide important insight into the mechanisms governing the distribution of different phenological phenotypes across space.
