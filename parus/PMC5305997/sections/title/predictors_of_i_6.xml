 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Predictors of individual variation in spring phenology</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We tested a range of environmental predictors that have previously been linked to budburst timing: altitude and spring temperature (higher temperatures and lower elevations have been linked to early budburst, Wielgolaski, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0062">2001</a>), soil type (trees rooted in high moisture soil have been found to bud earlier, Wielgolaski, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0062">2001</a>), and habitat type, which is likely to influence microhabitat factors such as humidity levels (Wielgolaski, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0062">2001</a>) and also early environmental factors. We also test whether tree size, as a proxy for tree age, relates to budburst timing, as younger trees have been shown to bud earlier in the season (Ununger etÂ al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0056">1988</a>).
