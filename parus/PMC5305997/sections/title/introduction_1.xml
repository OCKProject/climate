 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over recent decades, climate change has caused dramatic shifts in the timing of life‐history events of many organisms (Durant et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0016">2007</a>; Keenan, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0025">2015</a>; Parmesan &amp; Yohe, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0038">2003</a>; Root et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0046">2003</a>), bringing a renewed interest in the study of plant phenology (Wolkovich et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0064">2014</a>). In temperate regions, the timing of leaf emergence in spring affects a wide variety of ecosystem processes and ecological interactions (Panchen et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0037">2014</a>). In deciduous habitats, for example, the timing of leaf emergence determines the availability of food for many herbivorous insect species (Coyle et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0012">2010</a>; Feeny, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0017">1970</a>) and, in turn, insectivorous birds (Perrins, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0040">1991</a>; Van Noordwijk et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0058">1995</a>). Any disruption to such trophic synchrony, caused by changes in vegetation phenology, could have far‐reaching consequences for community structure and population dynamics (Post et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0043">2009</a>; Thackeray et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0054">2010</a>, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0053">2016</a>). Recent research has demonstrated that species and populations can differ considerably in their phenological responses to climate change (Roberts et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0045">2015</a>; Thackeray et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0054">2010</a>), and this can lead to ecological mismatch between trophic levels (Both et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0005">2009</a>; Sagarin et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0048">1999</a>). Concerns about these disruptions to ecological interactions have increased the relevance of understanding the factors influencing spring leaf emergence in different plant species. Such knowledge is essential to understand how landscapes as a whole are responding to changing climates, which will, in turn, facilitate our understanding of how organisms inhabiting these dynamic environments cope with environmental change.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Timing of leaf emergence reflects a balance between the benefits of maximizing the growing season, and hence photosynthetic carbon uptake, and the costs of frost damage caused by leafing too early in the year (Bennie et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0004">2010</a>; Kramer et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0029">2010</a>). While the precise physiological mechanisms that control bud development are not well understood, for most temperate species, air temperature is the main driver triggering release of bud dormancy. Temperature cues include both increasing spring temperature (“forcing” cues) and chilling requirements, where trees must be exposed to sufficient cold temperatures to be released from dormancy (Linkosalo et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0033">2006</a>). The latter requirement is thought to act as a safeguard to prevent trees from budding prematurely in response to a warm period during winter (Perry, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0041">1971</a>). Once chilling requirements are met, trees require a certain amount of time above a critical temperature to stimulate bud development (Cannell &amp; Smith, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0006">1986</a>). Hence in warm springs, trees usually come into bud earlier; in northern Europe, for example, an increase of 1°C in spring temperature can advance spring budburst by between 3 and 8 days (Karlsen et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0024">2007</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While much work has focused on describing large‐scale temperature effects on phenology, research has been comparatively slow to explore the diversity of phenological responses observed across different species and environments (Panchen et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0037">2014</a>; Wolkovich et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0064">2014</a>). Considerable differences in spring phenology exist between species, even when individuals are exposed to the same conditions (Lechowicz, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0030">1984</a>). For example, sessile oak (
  <span class="italic">Quercus petraea</span>) and European beech (
  <span class="italic">Fagus sylvatica</span>) show marked differences in their sensitivity to spring temperature, advancing their budburst date by 7.26 and 2.03 days per degree Celsius increase, respectively (Vitasse et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0059">2009</a>). Interspecific differences in spring phenology are thought to be largely a result of variation in the warming and chilling requirements between species (Marchin et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0034">2015</a>), as well as variation in sensitivity to nontemperature cues such as photoperiod. Indeed in some species, budburst is primarily controlled by photoperiod, with sensitivity to temperature only developing once a critical day length has been reached time (Basler &amp; Körner, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0003">2012</a>). Like chilling requirements, photoperiod sensitivity is thought to act as a safeguard against premature budding during periods of mild winter temperatures (Marchin et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0034">2015</a>). Differences in cue sensitivity between species can often be explained by differences in physiology or ecology. For example, ring‐porous species tend to leaf out later than diffuse‐porous species, as their larger xylem vessels make them more vulnerable to frost damage (Marchin et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0034">2015</a>). It has also been suggested that more opportunistic pioneer species will adopt a more risky phenological strategies, relying solely on temperature cues, whereas late successional species will be more conservative, using the safeguards of large chilling requirement or high photoperiod sensitivity (Körner &amp; Basler, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0027">2010</a>). In addition to ecological factors, evolutionary history has been shown to explain significant interspecific variation in phenological response (Panchen et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0037">2014</a>; Willis et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0063">2008</a>). For example, one recent large‐scale analysis of over 1,600 woody species revealed a strong phylogenetic signal for leaf out dates (Panchen et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0037">2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within temperate plant comminutes, a large proportion of variation in budburst timing can be explained by interspecific differences, but considerable variation remains within species (Crawley &amp; Akhteruzzaman, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0013">1988</a>; Hinks et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0021">2015</a>; Lechowicz, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0030">1984</a>; Wesołowski &amp; Rowiński, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0061">2006</a>). Budburst of individual pedunculate oak trees (
  <span class="italic">Quercus robur</span>) within a single population have been shown to vary by more than 3 weeks—a similar range to that observed in population means between years (Crawley &amp; Akhteruzzaman, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0013">1988</a>). Studies monitoring interspecific variation in phenology over large spatial scales have shown strong influences of latitude, elevation, and air temperature (e.g., Kramer, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0028">1995</a>, Ducousso et al. 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0015">1996</a>), as well as effects of soil composition (Wielgolaski, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0062">2001</a>), humidity (Wielgolaski, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0062">2001</a>), and tree age (Ununger et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0056">1988</a>). Furthermore, studies comparing the phenology of individuals in close proximity to one another, or in comparable environments, have observed pronounced and consistent individual differences in budburst timing, suggestive of considerable genetic or early environmental effects (Crawley &amp; Akhteruzzaman, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0013">1988</a>; Hinks et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0021">2015</a>; Wesołowski &amp; Rowiński, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0061">2006</a>). However, it is unknown how these multiple factors contribute to explaining phenological variation at small spatial scales, over tens or hundreds of meters. Nor is it known whether species within the same communities show similar spatial patterns of phenological variation to one another.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ability to describe and predict the phenologically heterogeneous landscapes experienced by individual organisms is likely to prove a useful tool in ecological and evolutionary research. Indeed, where vegetation phenology varies at a scale relevant to the movements of individuals (e.g., dispersal or foraging ranges), such knowledge is essential to understand the selective forces operating in these systems. For example, several insect species with limited dispersal have been shown to become locally adapted to specific host trees due to strong selection to match egg hatching with leaf budburst (Komatsu &amp; Akimoto, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0026">1995</a>; Van Dongen et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0057">1997</a>). In addition to driving genetic structure in populations, spatial variation in vegetation phenology can shape community structure and dynamics, influencing both the species composition and relative abundance of insects on different host trees (Crawley &amp; Akhteruzzaman, 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0013">1988</a>). Knowledge of phenological landscapes can also provide insight into how animals adjust their phenology to match their environment, and how selection acts on this plasticity. Breeding great tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>), which are limited in the distance that they can travel from dependent offspring, have been shown to time their egg laying relative to oak budburst, and therefore the timing of the peak in caterpillar abundance, within the immediate vicinity of their nest (Hinks et al., 
  <a rid="ece32718-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32718-bib-0021">2015</a>). Such studies require a good understanding of how vegetation phenology varies over small spatial scales, but research in this area is lacking.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we explore how spring phenology varies both within and between the dominant tree species in a mixed‐deciduous woodland. We use field observations collected over two spring seasons to quantify date of budburst and rate of bud development for 825 trees of six species (pedunculate oak (
  <span class="italic">Quercus robur</span>), common ash (
  <span class="italic">Fraxinus excelsior</span>), European beech (
  <span class="italic">Fagus sylvatica</span>), silver birch (
  <span class="italic">Betula pendula</span>), common hazel (
  <span class="italic">Corylus avellana</span>), and sycamore maple (
  <span class="italic">Acer pseudoplatanus</span>)) in a 385‐ha contiguous wood. We test a range of environmental predictors of individual variation in spring leaf budburst and development rate and explore how these phenological traits vary over space.
