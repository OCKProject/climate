 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spring bud development data for the 825 focal trees showed that five of the six tree species came into leaf earlier in 2014 than 2013 by between 1 and 3 weeks (difference in mean budburst date: oak (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 196) = 20 days, hazel (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 153) = 19 days, birch (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 93) = 18 days, sycamore (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 109) = 13 days, beech (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 69) = 8 days, see Table 
  <a rid="ece32718-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#ece32718-tbl-0001">1</a>). Ash alone showed little difference in mean budburst date between years, coming into leaf 3 days later in 2014 than 2013 (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 195, Table 
  <a rid="ece32718-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#ece32718-tbl-0001">1</a>). The order in which the six species came into leaf was significantly correlated between years (Pearson's 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = .90, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = .016, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 6). In 2013, hazel came into bud first, followed by birch, sycamore, beech, oak, and ash. In 2014, trees followed the same order with the exception of oak, which budburst just before sycamore (see Table 
  <a rid="ece32718-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#ece32718-tbl-0001">1</a>). The relative speed of bud development was also significantly consistent between years for the six tree species (Pearson's correlation: 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = .87, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = .023, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 6), with ash, birch, and beech buds developing faster than oak, sycamore, and hazel buds.
