 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The dampening in biotic resources and bird species composition in urban areas may impact the trophic dynamics of vertebrate predators, such as cats or raptors. For example, free-ranging cats had less marked seasonal variations of diet composition in urban than in rural areas (
