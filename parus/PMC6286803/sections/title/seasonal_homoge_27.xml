 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The lower seasonal variation of bird communities in urban than in non-urban areas may be related to the extinction of migratory species and to the lower seasonal variation of resident species (
  <a rid="ref-172" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-172">Pennington, Hansel &amp; Blair, 2008</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-102" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-102">Jokimäki &amp; Kaisanlahti-Jokimäki, 2012b</a>). Migratory species arrive at a site to exploit surplus resources not used by year-round residents (

  <a rid="ref-94" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-94">Hurlbert &amp; Haskell, 2003</a>). If urban areas were characterized by a stabilization of resources, the surplus provided to migratory species would be diminished (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" href="#fig-1">Fig. 1</a>). Nevertheless, urban areas may be characterized by a low amount of food resources to migrants, especially those that feed on insects (
  <a rid="ref-64" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-64">Faeth et al., 2005</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-205" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-205">Teglhøj, 2017</a>). Moreover, human disturbance such as pedestrian and car traffic, and nest parasitism may be especially negative to migratory birds (
  <a rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-21">Burger &amp; Gochfeld, 1991</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-226" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-226">Zhou &amp; Chu, 2012</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-183" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-183">Rodewald &amp; Shustack, 2008</a>) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" href="#fig-1">Fig. 1</a>). In seasonally temperate areas, constant food availability to omnivorous and insectivorous species throughout the year may stabilize their temporal variation relative to populations in rural or natural areas. For instance, the African woolly-necked stork (
  <span class="italic">Ciconia microscelis</span>) were provided supplementary food by humans year-round in KwaZulu-Natal (South Africa), and humans were motivated by pleasure (
  <a rid="ref-206" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-206">Thabethe &amp; Downs, 2018</a>). Silvereyes (
  <span class="italic">Zosterops lateralis</span>) in Dunedin (New Zealand) complemented their seasonal foraging on insects by using exotic and native trees (
  <a rid="ref-213" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-213">Waite et al., 2013</a>); the exotic English oak (
  <span class="italic">Quercus robur</span>) had the highest abundance of arthropods. The advance of reproductive phenology in the Abert ’s Towhee (
  <span class="italic">Melozone aberti</span>) in Phoenix was related to predictability and limited change of food resources in urban areas (
  <a rid="ref-47" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-47">Davies et al., 2016</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The increased stable presence of resident species may negatively affect migratory species by interspecific competition for food and nesting places (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" href="#fig-1">Fig. 1</a>). For example, House sparrows may use aerial hawking of insects, depleting resources for migratory species that exploit the same resources. House Sparrows and European Starlings nest in holes of buildings and trees, the same nest substrates as those used by several migratory swallow and swift species in the Neotropic, Neartic and Paleartic regions (
  <a rid="ref-168" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-168">Palomino &amp; Carrascal, 2006</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-124" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-124">Leveau, Isla &amp; Bellocq, 2015</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-30">Chantler &amp; Boesman, 2018</a>). Finally, supplementary feeding during winter may generate a surplus of resources, favouring the arrival of winter migrants (
  <a rid="ref-175" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-175">Plummer et al., 2015</a>), and therefore promoting an opposite process to seasonal homogenization of bird communities.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the other hand, quantity and quality of food, artificial light and the urban heat island phenomenon may affect the physiology of bird individuals, altering their phenology by lengthening the breeding season (
  <a rid="ref-55" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-55">Deviche &amp; Davies, 2014</a>). A continental study across Europe showed that several species had a longer singing period (as a proxy of the breeding season) in urban than in rural areas (
  <a rid="ref-156" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-156">Møller et al., 2015</a>). Moreover, this effect of urbanization was higher in species that colonized cities long before other species and in the biggest cities, due to a target effect and a lower risk of extinction (mechanism of island biogeography 
  <a rid="ref-156" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-156">Møller et al., 2015</a>). It is noteworthy that this longer breeding season in urban areas was also observed in migratory species, despite the negative effects of urbanization on this group of species (see references above).
