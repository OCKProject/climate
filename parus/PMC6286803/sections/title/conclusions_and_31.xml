 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Published evidence suggests that urban areas dampen the natural cycles at several temporal scales. The stabilization of biotic and abiotic factors, such as light, temperature, food and habitat structure, are desynchronized from natural diurnal, seasonal and interannual cycles. These changes induced by urbanization are expected to influence the temporal dynamics of bird composition. In fact, the reviewed literature showed that bird composition was temporally most stable in the most urbanized areas, leading to a temporal homogenization of bird communities (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" href="#fig-1">Fig. 1</a>). As a result, urbanization promotes a decline of temporal beta diversity. However, the studies analyzed only covered taxonomic diversity, whereas other facets of biodiversity, such as functional or phylogenetic diversities, remain unexplored.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A possible consequence of resource and habitat stabilization is population growth and range expansion of bird species adapted to urban conditions. For instance, a recent study showed that daily nest survival rates of Blackbirds increased with artificial light at night (
  <a rid="ref-184" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-184">Russ, Lučeničová &amp; Klenke, 2017</a>). On the other hand, clear examples of species with range expansions associated with urban conditions are hummingbirds; for example, the Anna’s Hummingbird (
  <span class="italic">Calypte anna</span>), the Allen’s Hummingbird (
  <span class="italic">Selasphorus sasin sedentarius</span>) and the White-throated Hummingbird (
  <span class="italic">Leucochloris albicollis</span>) have expanded their range sizes and are highly associated with residential areas, which provide supplementary food resources such as nectar, year-round flowering plants and nesting sites (
  <a rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-34">Clark &amp; Russell, 2012</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-33">Clark, 2017</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-81" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-81">Greig, Wood &amp; Bonter, 2017</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-217" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-217">Weller, Kirwan &amp; Boesman, 2017</a>). Psitacidae species, such as the Rose-ringed parakeet (
  <span class="italic">Psittacula krameri</span>) and the Monk Parakeet (
  <span class="italic">Myiopsitta monachus</span>) in Europe and the Rainbow Lorikeet (
  <span class="italic">Trichoglossus haematodus</span>) in Australia, expanded their distributions associated with food and nesting resources provided in urban areas (
  <a rid="ref-196" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-196">Shukuroglou &amp; Mccarthy, 2006</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-202" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-202">Strubbe &amp; Matthysen, 2009</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-36">Clergeau &amp; Vergnes, 2011</a>). Despite these findings, there are many research gaps that need to be filled.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Studies concerning the nocturnal activity of diurnal species were focused on the analysis of intervening factors and experimentation, but research was exhaustive only on the European Blackbird. It is noteworthy that other globally distributed species with nocturnal activity such as the Rock Dove have still not been studied (
  <a rid="ref-138" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-138">Luniak, 2004</a>). This is an interesting model species to explore environmental conditions affecting nocturnal activity.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although there are no studies that compare bird composition similarity between day and night, in those studies reporting nocturnal activity of some diurnal species, I assumed that those species also had diurnal activity that was not mentioned. In fact, several studies showed this pattern (
  <a rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-23">Byrkjedal, Lislevand &amp; Vogler, 2012</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-143" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-143">MacGregor-Fors et al., 2011</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-185" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-185">Russ, Rüger &amp; Klenke, 2015</a>). Therefore, in those urbanized areas, species similarity between day and night is higher than in areas where there is no nocturnal activity of typical diurnal birds. However, there is a need to formally compare the similarity in composition between day and night along urbanization gradients.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparisons of seasonal and interannual compositional stability between urbanization levels have been conducted for different countries (
  <a rid="table-1" ref-type="table" href="#table-1">Table 1</a>); however, studies that relate compositional stability to temporal environmental variation are scarce. A recent study showed that seasonal change of primary productivity was directly related to seasonal change of bird composition (
  <a rid="ref-125" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-125">Leveau, Isla &amp; Bellocq, 2018</a>). In addition, experimental studies controlling or altering the temporal availability of resources and their effect on bird composition stability are needed. A relevant example is a work of 
  <a rid="ref-72" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-72">Galbraith et al. (2015)</a>, in which supplementary food was experimentally added in residential areas and removed after 18 months, promoting a higher temporal variation of bird composition than in control sites where food availability was not altered.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given that wealthier householders may provide more resources for habitat management and bird feeding, leading to a higher biodiversity (the so called luxury effect, 
  <a rid="ref-118" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-118">Leong, Dunn &amp; Trautwein, 2018</a>), it is expected that this type of intervention may promote an increase in temporal stabilization in bird composition. These socioeconomic contrasts may act at different spatial scales, from the local scale, comparing different residential areas within a city, to the global scale, comparing cities of developed and developing countries, or arid versus tropical biomes (
  <a rid="ref-118" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-118">Leong, Dunn &amp; Trautwein, 2018</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The stabilizing role of urbanization in environmental conditions may be more or less evident, depending on the geographical location of cities. For example, desert biomes are highly variable according to interannual precipitations (
  <a rid="ref-65" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-65">Fang et al., 2001</a>) and, therefore, irrigation in residential areas may exert higher effects on the stability of bird composition than irrigation in urban areas of forested biomes, which may have lower interannual fluctuations in precipitation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a result of higher environmental and population variability with time and habitat succession, bird communities are expected to show more variability as the time of observations of studies increases (
  <a rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-14">Bengtsson, Baillie &amp; Lawton, 1997</a>). In part, our review resulted in patterns of interannual variability opposed to those expected for those studies with more than 10 years of observation period (
  <a rid="table-1" ref-type="table" href="#table-1">Table 1</a>). Therefore, studies conducted at longer temporal scales are needed (see also 
  <a rid="ref-69" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-69">Fidino &amp; Magle, 2017</a>). On the other hand, although bird composition may change greatly between years, it is necessary to explore whether bird communities of urban areas undergo directional changes through time (
  <a rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-39">Collins, 2000</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-40">Collins, Micheli &amp; Hartt, 2000</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An overlooked aspect of urban environments is the possible creation of rhythms in bird communities as a response to massive movement of people between weekdays and weekends. Car traffic may promote weekly cycles of pollutants, wind speed and noise, which may cause changes in bird activity (
  <a rid="ref-197" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-197">Shutters &amp; Balling, 2006</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-123" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-123">Leveau, 2008</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-85" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-85">Halfwerk et al., 2011</a>). Along a road near Madrid, 
  <a rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-12">Bautista et al. (2004)</a> found changes in raptor composition between weekdays and weekends. On the other hand, 
  <a rid="ref-67" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-67">Fernández-Juricic et al. (2003)</a> found that the presence of pedestrians in urban parks of Madrid affected the abundance of House Sparrows. 
  <a rid="ref-116" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-116">Lafferty (2001)</a> found a marginal difference (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.10) of bird abundance between weekdays and weekends in sandy beaches of California and a significant interaction between weekends and seasons, suggesting that the effect of human density may depend on the period of the year and bird phenology. Therefore, we may expect significant changes in bird composition between weekdays and weekends in urban green spaces, because a massive number of people usually visit them on weekends.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The dampening of temporal variation in bird composition may be another aspect of the so-called extinction of experience (
  <a rid="ref-177" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-177">Pyle, 1978</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-152" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-152">Miller, 2005</a>), i.e., humans are disconnected from natural cycles. It has been reported that most people liked the change of seasons (
  <a rid="ref-99" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-99">Jauhiainen &amp; Mönkkönen, 2005</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-199" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-199">Soga et al., 2016</a>), and 
  <a rid="ref-167" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-167">Palang et al. (2005)</a> recommended to pay more attention to seasonality in landscape planning. Moreover, although little explored, the seasonal variation of vegetation and animal activity may have an aesthetic value and support ecosystem services (
  <a rid="ref-60" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-60">Dronova, 2017</a>). For instance, 
  <a rid="ref-79" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-79">Graves, Pearson &amp; Turner (2018)</a> found that the type of cultural ecosystem services, such as birdwatching, varied spatio-temporally along an urbanization gradient, because resident and migrant species had different responses to land covers. From a point of view of urban design, it is a paradox that urban habitats that we ignore, such as vacant lots, are more related to the particular natural processes of the region in which the city is located than those places designed in a formal way with particular proportions of lawn, shrubs and trees (
  <a rid="ref-91" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-91">Hough, 1994</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-112" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-112">Kwok, 2018</a>). Therefore, a crucial step to restoring nature in cities is to pay attention to the natural cycles that are characteristic of the surroundings of cities.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recently, a collaborative project that encompassed six metropolitan areas of varied climatic regions of the USA aimed to elucidate the ecological homogenization of urban areas compared to natural areas, showing convergences of soil moisture, amount of organic matter and microclimate among residential areas (
  <a rid="ref-83" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-83">Groffman et al., 2014</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-86" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-86">Hall et al., 2016</a>). In my opinion, a step forward would be to analyze how these ecosystem properties are stabilized over time, and how this affects the temporal persistence of bird species.
