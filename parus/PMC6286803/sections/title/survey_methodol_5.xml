 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first step in the selection of literature for this review consisted of searching for studies on the temporal variation of bird communities and the resources they use, using keywords such as “interannual”, “seasonal”, “nocturnal” coupled with “urban” and “bird”, and “interannual”, “seasonal”, “nocturnal” coupled with “fruits”, “insects” “resources” and “vegetation phenology” (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1" href="#supp-1">Table S1</a>). I used Google Scholar during December 2017 and reviewed the first 300 returns ordered by relevance for each keyword, and the Scopus database in March 2018 for papers published since database inception, including those terms in the title, abstract and keywords. Moreover, I received weekly Google scholar alerts about papers published with the terms “urban” and “birds”. I included only articles that compared temporal variation of bird composition or resources between different levels of urbanization (urban vs suburban, urban vs rural, etc.) or different levels or environmental conditions related to urbanization (impervious cover, light and noise levels). I did not include studies that analyzed long-term dynamics of bird communities in urban parks or suburban areas that also underwent changes in local habitat structure and landscape composition (for example,
