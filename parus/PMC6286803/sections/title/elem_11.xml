  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Abiotic factors altered by urbanization were mainly temperature and wind. Temperature may influence birds directly via the urban heat island phenomenon (
   <a rid="ref-182" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-182">Rizwan, Dennis &amp; Chunho, 2008</a>), by increasing temperatures during winter and favoring bird presence (
   <a rid="ref-122" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-122">Leston &amp; Rodewald, 2006</a>). The urban heat island may have an indirect effect on seasonal stabilization of resources used by birds by favoring an extended growing season of vegetation (see below Biotic factors).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A number of studies analyzed the seasonal variation of temperature along urbanization gradients. However, most of them were concentrated in China, especially in Beijing (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1" href="#supp-1">Table S2</a>). The majority of studies were concentrated between 2010 and 2018 (22 of 24 studies), and the most widely used remote sensors were the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat 5 and 7, although both have contrasting spatial resolutions (1,000 and 60–120 m, respectively). These remote sensors measured the land surface temperature (LST). In general, studies found that urban areas had a higher seasonal LST variation than rural or natural areas. Other studies that compared urban with desert or sand dune areas showed a smaller seasonal change of LST in urban areas. This heterogeneity in results suggest that seasonal fluctuations of LST associated with urbanization are context-dependent. Even within a given study area, results vary for different land uses compared to the urban area. For example, 
   <a rid="ref-149" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-149">Meng et al. (2009)</a> found that the seasonal change of LST was higher in the urban area than in the forest, but seasonal change of LST was bigger in the grassland than in the urban area.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seasonal fluctuation of wind intensity may be altered by urbanization. A study in Phoenix (USA) showed that in urban areas, wind speed was significantly reduced, contributing to increased plant growth and accumulated biomass (
   <a rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-8">Bang, Sabo &amp; Faeth, 2010</a>). This increase in plant biomass can have positive impacts on higher trophic levels, such as birds. Similarly, a reduced wind speed may have direct positive effects on the reproductive success of birds by reducing the probabilities that eggs and nestlings fall from the nest (L Leveau, pers. obs., 2014).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Biotic factors stabilized by urbanization at the seasonal scale included vegetation, abundance of arthropods and food supplied by humans. Abiotic factors, such as temperature and irrigation, also affected the extended growing season of vegetation.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evidence of altered seasonal patterns of resources came mainly from data of leaf and flowering phenology and vegetation indices obtained from remote sensors; those data are mainly indicators of the net primary productivity. Most studies were conducted in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly in USA and China; and were concentrated in the 2010–2018 period (10 out of 12 studies) (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1" href="#supp-1">Table S3</a>). The most widely used remote sensor was MODIS, which produces the MOD13Q1 database that contains images of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). These images are produced every 16 days and are freely available. Several studies found an extended growing period of vegetation in urban environments, associated with the increase in temperature induced by the urban heat island (

   <a rid="ref-227" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-227">Zhou et al., 2016</a>). Other studies showed a smaller seasonal change of primary productivity in urban areas than in natural and rural areas (

   <a rid="ref-125" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-125">Leveau, Isla &amp; Bellocq, 2018</a>). Along the urban-rural gradient of Mar del Plata (Argentina), the lowest seasonal change of primary productivity was related to high percentage cover of buildings and vegetation typical of residential houses (lawn, shrubs and trees), whereas the greatest seasonal change of primary productivity was related to non-managed herbaceous vegetation and crops (

Then, a Gower dissimilitude distance was calculated. Finally, a surface of the seasonal change of NDVI (red lines with their values) was added to the ordination.

   <a rid="ref-162" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-162">Neil &amp; Wu (2006)</a> conducted a review about the effect of urbanization on plant phenology and found that spring-blooming plants tended to bloom earlier in a variety of ecosystems in North America, Europe and China. Moreover, 
   <a rid="ref-68" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-68">ffrench Constant et al. (2016)</a> related budburst data from four deciduous trees to night-time lighting using satellite data as well as spring temperature. The authors found that tree budburst occurred 7.5 days earlier in brighter areas, which indicated the presence of urban areas in United Kingdom. In Florence (Italy), light exposure from luminaires extended the greening of leaves by nearly 20 days (
   <a rid="ref-146" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-146">Massetti, 2018</a>). Due to a warmer microclimate, plants had less frost damage in urban areas of Phoenix (USA) than in the desert and, therefore, green leaves were more persistent in urban areas (
   <a rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-7">Bang, Faeth &amp; Sabo, 2012</a>). In the same city, plants flowered for a longer period than their desert counterparts, promoting a higher abundance of pollinators in urban areas (
   <a rid="ref-163" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-163">Neil et al., 2014</a>). In South Korea, four species of plants extended their flowering period in the most urbanized areas (

   <a rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-41">Comber &amp; Brunsdon (2015)</a> found that the first flowering occurred earlier in urban areas of the United Kingdom than in other land uses, but the effect of urbanization varied spatially, suggesting the need for spatially explicit analysis. 
   <a rid="ref-77" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-77">Gorton, Moeller &amp; Tiffin (2018)</a> found that the plant 
   <span class="italic">Ambrosia artemissifolia</span> flowered earlier in urban than in rural habitats of Minneapolis (USA), and attributed this asynchronous flowering to genetic differences between populations. On the other hand, 
   <a rid="ref-52" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-52">Davis, Major &amp; Taylor (2016)</a> found that native trees in Sydney (Australia) flowered longer in streets than in remnant and continuous forests, providing more food resources to nectarivorous birds. Nectar and fruits may be available during seasons when they would be naturally absent or scarce due to the planting of ornamental trees (

   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1" href="#supp-1">Table S4</a>). In general, there was a lower seasonal change in abundance of arthropods in urban than in rural or natural areas. Some studies showed a lower variation in intermediate levels of urbanization and industrial areas (
