  <a rid="ref-160" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-160">Navara &amp; Nelson, 2007</a>). For example, Black-tailed godwits (
  <span class="italic">Limosa limosa</span>) avoided illuminated areas when selecting nest sites (

  <a rid="ref-55" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-55">Deviche &amp; Davies, 2014</a>; see examples below). Global maps indicate that the areas most impacted by artificial lighting are the most urbanized ones, such as east North America and Europe (

  <a rid="ref-141" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-141">Ma, 2018</a>) than in residential areas. In Berlin, most of zenith directed light comes from streets, including direct and scattered lights from lamps, automobile headlights, advertising lights located in the street area and, to some extent, light from building facades (
  <a rid="ref-111" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-111">Kuechly et al., 2012</a>). The next land use with high light emissions was the commercial/industrial/service and public service area. 
  <a rid="ref-225" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-225">Zheng et al. (2018)</a> found that main roads, commercial and institutional areas were brightly lit in Hangzhou (China), whereas residential, industrial and agricultural areas were dark at night. In Flagstaff (USA), 33% of uplight was found to arise from sports lighting; when sport lighting was off, commercial and industrial lighting accounted for 62% (
  <a rid="ref-137" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-137">Luginbuhl et al., 2009</a>). In Reykjavik (Island), almost 50% of artificial light at night came from street lights (
