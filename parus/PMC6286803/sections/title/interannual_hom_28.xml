 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interannual composition stability in highly urbanized areas is probably driven by the high densities that some species reach there, favoured by several factors such as a constant food supply, habitat stability and a favourable microclimate during winter (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" href="#fig-1">Fig. 1</a>). A high dominance of a few species, typically the House Sparrow and the Rock Dove, may diminish their extinction probabilities at local scales, at least in the short and mid-term (between 2 and 10 years). However, at longer temporal scales (&gt;10 years), biotic instabilities may occur due to strong competitive interactions between species (

  <a rid="ref-193" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-193">Shochat et al. (2010)</a> showed that dominant bird species were highly efficient foragers that leave scarce resources to subordinate species, probably leading to their exclusion in the long term. On the other hand, bird community fluctuations are probably more governed by environmental stochasticities in rural or natural than in urban areas, due to natural disturbances or climatic fluctuations, which affect the persistence of rare species, leading to increased temporal variation of bird composition (
