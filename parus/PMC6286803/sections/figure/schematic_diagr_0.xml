  <div class="title">Schematic diagram of intervening factors and possible mechanisms influencing the temporal dynamics of bird composition in urban areas.</div>
  <p>Urbanization promotes the temporal stabilization of several environmental characteristics such as light, food, temperature and habitat structure (red boxes and circles). Human disturbance, such as the passing of pedestrians may provide food for birds, whereas the passing of cars may increase the urban heat island. Factors in circles may be strongly affected by the socioeconomic characteristics of citizens. The environmental stabilization is produced at different temporal scales (purple boxes), which in turn promote the temporal homogenization of bird communities. Dashed lines and boxes indicate factors and processes that require further research</p>
