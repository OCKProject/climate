  <div class="title">Non-metric multidimensional scaling showing the relationship between habitat types and the seasonal change of NDVI.</div>
  <p>The ordination was constructed with a matrix of percent cover of land cover types (vegetation and impervious surfaces) and the number of high trees (&lt;5 m, Tree_more5m) and low trees (&lt;5 m, Tree_less5m) as columns, and each sampling unit as rows. Then, a Gower dissimilitude distance was calculated. Finally, a surface of the seasonal change of NDVI (red lines with their values) was added to the ordination. The seasonal change is the mean NDVI of springâ€“summer minus the mean NDVI of fall-winter. Thicker lines indicate higher values of the seasonal change of NDVI. Modified from
