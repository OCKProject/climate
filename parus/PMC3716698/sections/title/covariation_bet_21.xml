 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found evidence for a positive and significant phenotypic covariation between offspring begging and parental feeding levels, the latter was estimated via the mean nestling growth rates of the foster nestlings parents reared. Thus, we were able to confirm the existence of a positive covariation between offspring begging and parental feeding, as has recently been reported in canaries 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Hinde2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Hinde2">[16]</a>. This adds to the evidence and importance of the previous findings, even more so since we used a slightly different experimental design

  <a rid="pone.0070463-Parker1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Parker1">[40]</a>. The positive phenotypic correlation may represent a truly genetic correlation

  <a rid="pone.0070463-Hager1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Hager1">[17]</a>, but we cannot rule out that environmental factors before cross-fostering contribute to this relationship. In birds, prime candidates for generating such phenotypic covariation are effects that act via maternally derived egg components. Maternally derived steroid hormones in the yolk of bird eggs have been shown to modulate offspring begging behaviour in a number of bird species including canaries (e.g. 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Schwabl1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Schwabl1">[41]</a>, reviewed in 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Groothuis1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Groothuis1">[42]</a> but see e.g. 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Mller1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Mller1">[35]</a>). Maternal yolk carotenoids transferred into the egg yolks may be another candidate to match offspring demand to parental feeding (e.g. 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Biard1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Biard1">[43]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Helfenstein1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Helfenstein1">[44]</a>). Our experimental design, however, does not enable us to estimate the relative contributions of genes and other prenatally acting factors any further.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even though we were able to confirm the outcome of a previous study, indirect measures of parental care were used, as the parental feeding levels were estimated via the growth pattern of the foster nestlings 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Hinde2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Hinde2">[16]</a>. Thus, it remained to be shown whether these traits correlate at the behavioural level, which will also allow testing whether this relationship differs between males and females. We indeed found a significant relationship between the actual rate of parental feeding (to foster nestlings) and offspring begging, with no evidence for a sex specific pattern (but see 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Klliker2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Klliker2">[10]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Hager1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Hager1">[17]</a>). However, the power to detect sex specific relationships on the behavioural level is likely to be lower as the rate of parental feeding is based on fewer feeding visits as it considers only one sex.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, the observed covariation indicates that the previously established (indirect) relationship also holds at the behavioural level. But this was only the case when considering the begging intensity at the highest level of food deprivation (after 90 min) as response variable. The reasons for this may be multifold:</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Offspring growth may in general represent a more robust measure for parental feeding, as it integrates the parental feeding over a period of 13 days. In contrast, parental feeding rates were recorded during 2 h sessions on a particular day, which is obviously a much shorter timeframe. Yet, offspring growth integrates not only a much larger timeframe, but also other aspects such as the parental responsiveness to (changes in) nestlings' food demand, while we control for variation in hunger level during the measurement of parental feeding by standardizing the satiation of the nestlings. Thus, there may be no covariation between offspring begging and actual number of dips at a certain hunger level, but with parental responsiveness to offspring needs 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Klliker2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Klliker2">[10]</a>. This may be less well captured in our measure of parental feeding during a standardized 2 h observation. Experimental designs in which changes in begging demands are implemented, for instance by changing the brood size or using playbacks of begging nestlings (sensu 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Klliker2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Klliker2">[10]</a>) could provide useful insights in this respect.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The standardization of both the begging and the parental feeding may also explain why we only find covariation between parental feeding and begging at the highest level of food deprivation. Before the parental feeding behaviour was recorded, nestlings were food deprived, and in contrast to the begging trial, in this case they were not satiated. Furthermore, parents need to pre-digest the food before feeding the nestlings (which can take up to 14 min from the time new food is introduced into the cage, N. Estramil pers. observ.), increasing once more the period of food deprivation. Finally, the begging intensity may have been higher at a given hunger level due to the presence of siblings in the nest. The begging intensity of nestlings during the video-recordings was, therefore, likely comparable to the level of nestlings, which were food deprived for 90 min. Thus, parental feeding may covary with offspring behaviour, when both are measured at similar hunger levels suggesting a close match between offspring demand and the rate of parental feeding.</p>
