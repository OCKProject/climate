 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The family, which is defined as a social unit consisting of one or two parents and their offspring, forms a social environment with significant consequences for individual fitness and trait evolution. Social interactions between parents and offspring as expressed in the family context are of particular interest, since these traits are not only target of selection but can also act as agent of selection by exerting a selective pressure on the trait expression of other family members 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Wolf1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Wolf1">[1]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Klliker1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Klliker1">[3]</a>. Consequently both the social trait expressed and the social environment can evolve 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Lock1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Lock1">[2]</a>. Studying the expression of behaviours during parent-offspring interactions between parents and offspring and their (co-)evolution has consequently become an important line of research (e.g. 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Curley1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Curley1">[4]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Hinde1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Hinde1">[6]</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within the family environment, offspring solicitation displays and parental provisioning are probably the most commonly studied behaviours, particularly in birds, insects and mammals 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Kilner1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Kilner1">[7]</a>. In birds, for instance, parents provide food in response to the begging behaviour of their offspring while offspring adjust their begging behaviour according to their need, quality or the amount of food they receive 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Kilner2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Kilner2">[8]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Mock1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Mock1">[9]</a>. Offspring begging and parental feeding have a heritable basis 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Klliker2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Klliker2">[10]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0070463-MacColl1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-MacColl1">[14]</a> and are thus able to respond to selection. However, their evolution may not be independent, as the expression of each of these traits depends on the expression of the other. That is, parental provisioning is influenced by offspring begging and parental provisioning alters the begging behaviour of the offspring. As both behaviours affect each other and exert a selective pressure on the expression of the other, quantitative genetic models predict that offspring begging and parental provisioning should become coadapted and ultimately genetically correlated 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Wolf1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Wolf1">[1]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Klliker3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Klliker3">[15]</a>. The genetic correlations are expected to be mostly positive when parents control provisioning and selection predominantly acts on offspring begging (as has been found in birds 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Hinde1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Hinde1">[6]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Klliker2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Klliker2">[10]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Hinde2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Hinde2">[16]</a>, mice 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Curley1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Curley1">[4]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Hager1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Hager1">[17]</a> and burying beetles 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Lock1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Lock1">[2]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Lock2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Lock2">[18]</a> and mostly negative when offspring control parental provisioning and selection predominantly acts on parental provisioning (as has been found in burrower bugs 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Agrawal1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Agrawal1">[19]</a>). There is some evidence that these correlations are truly genetic 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Curley1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Curley1">[4]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Hager1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Hager1">[17]</a>. However, a phenotypic covariation of parental provisioning and offspring begging may also depend on (prenatal) maternal effects 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Klliker2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Klliker2">[10]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Hinde2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Hinde2">[16]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Nussey1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Nussey1">[20]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The degree and architecture of covariance is further complicated by an evolutionary conflict of interest between the parents and their young, since parents and offspring rate the costs and benefits of parental investment differently 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Trivers1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Trivers1">[21]</a>. Typically offspring, which depend on the energetic resources provided by the parents, demand more resources from their parents than their parents are selected to give 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Trivers1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Trivers1">[21]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Crespi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Crespi1">[22]</a>. It is, therefore, of interest to establish whether the degree of coadaptation represents the optimum for parents or offspring 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Kilner1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Kilner1">[7]</a>, which depends on whether offspring or parents exert behavioural control on the level of food provisioning 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Hinde1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Hinde1">[6]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Klliker3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Klliker3">[15]</a>. Ultimately, such coadaptation should be stabilized by fitness costs either to parents and/or offspring (e.g. 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Wolf1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Wolf1">[1]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Klliker3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Klliker3">[15]</a>). Conversely, the evolutionary resolution of parent-offspring conflict may also depend on the genetic covariance between offspring begging and parental provisioning, for instance in a runaway process 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Klliker2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Klliker2">[10]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-WestEberhard1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-WestEberhard1">[23]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Klliker4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Klliker4">[24]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In birds, the available evidence for coadaptation, which is mainly based on cross-fostering studies, is still limited. No evidence for a phenotypic covariation has been reported for the house sparrow (
  <span class="italic">Passer domesticus</span>) 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Dor2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Dor2">[12]</a>. A positive covariation has been found in great tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) and canaries (
  <span class="italic">Serinus canaria</span>) 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Hinde1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Hinde1">[6]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Klliker2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Klliker2">[10]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Hinde2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Hinde2">[16]</a> suggesting that parents, at least in these two species, control feeding, while selection predominantly acts on offspring begging. Interestingly, the phenotypic covariation between the feeding response of great tit parents and the begging intensity of their biological nestlings was only expressed in the maternal line 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Klliker2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Klliker2">[10]</a>. In the canary study, the nestling growth rates were used as a proxy for parental feeding rate 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Hinde2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Hinde2">[16]</a> and it is still unknown whether there is covariation on the behavioural level and, more importantly, whether it differs between male and female parents. Furthermore, little attention has as yet been paid to the question how this coadaptation is stabilized by fitness costs to parents and/or offspring 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Wolf1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Wolf1">[1]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Klliker3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Klliker3">[15]</a>. An exception to this is a recent study showing that female canaries laid fewer eggs when they had raised foster nestlings that begged more intensively than their biological offspring and vice versa. In addition, foster nestlings grew less well when their begging behaviour differed from that of the biological nestlings 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Hinde1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Hinde1">[6]</a>. Even though both parties apparently paid a cost for a mismatch between begging and parental feeding, these costs appeared to be higher for the offspring as revealed in a second experiment 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Hinde1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Hinde1">[6]</a>. However, it is not yet known whether and how a mismatch between these behaviours impinges on the future reproductive investment of the offspring.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using domestic canaries (
  <span class="italic">Serinus canaria</span>) as a model species we applied a reciprocal cross-fostering in order to establish a phenotypic covariation between offspring begging and parental feeding, and to test for differences in this relationship between males and females. Canaries are highly suitable to test predictions made by parent-offspring theory as they breed easily in captivity. Both males and females provide food to the offspring, parents increase their feeding rate in response to increasing begging demands 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Kilner3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Kilner3">[25]</a> and begging is costly 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Kilner4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Kilner4">[26]</a>. Furthermore, we studied potential costs to parents and offspring that stabilize such coadaptation with a focus on the females, because the costs to mothers and daughters, in terms of fecundity (clutch size/mass) can both be measured in the same way, which allows for a direct comparison.
