 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The begging intensity of focal nestlings was significantly and positively related to the growth rate of foster nestlings that were raised by the focal parents (LMM,

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070463-g001" href="#pone-0070463-g001">Figure 1B</a>). The begging intensity and growth rate of focal nestlings tended to covary negatively, but this was not statistically significant (
  <span class="italic">F
   <sub>1,15</sub>
  </span> = 3.52, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.08). Removing the term “growth rate of focal nestlings”, made little difference to the results (

  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.008).
