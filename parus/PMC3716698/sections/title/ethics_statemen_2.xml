 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The experiments reported here comply with the current Flemish and Belgian institutional laws and were performed under licenses of Ethical Committee on animal experimentation (ECD) of the University of Antwerp [experiment specific licenses 2008-26 (2010), 2011-07 (2011)]. No deterioration of condition or abnormalities in appearance or behaviour as consequence of the experimental handling (behavioural trials, video recordings, bird measurements and handling) were observed. During reproduction, birds were kept as detailed in this section. In between, birds of the parental generation were kept in large single-sex outdoor aviaries, while their offspring was kept in single-sex indoor aviaries at room temperature (19–24°C) and under a natural light: dark regime.</p>
