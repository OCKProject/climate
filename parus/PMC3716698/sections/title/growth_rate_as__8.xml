  <a rid="pone.0070463-Hinde2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Hinde2">[16]</a>, we used the data obtained in (i). We applied a linear mixed model in R (version 2.10.1, R development core team 2009; 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.r-project.org</span>) to test for a relationship between the total number of dips given to 9 and 10 day old nestlings (N = 34 broods) and their body mass gain on that day (from 12am–17pm). The natural logarithm of the number of dips given per hour was the response variable, nestling age and the natural logarithms of body mass gain were included as covariates. Brood identity was used as a random factor. We checked for an interaction between the covariates. Neither the interaction between the covariates (LMM,

  <a rid="pone.0070463-Boncoraglio1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Boncoraglio1">[36]</a>). Having confirmed that nestling body mass gain can be used as a proxy of the parental feeding rate, we estimated the mean growth rate per nest from the slopes of simple linear regressions of nestling mass on age for each nestling from day 0 to day 13 and averaged the slopes per nest (all nestlings, 0.936≤
  <span class="italic">r
   <span class="sup">2</span>
  </span>≤0.997). Even though nestling growth curve is sigmoidal (e.g. 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Ricklefs1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Ricklefs1">[37]</a>), the slope of a linear regression between days 0 and 13 is a reliable indicator of nestling growth (see also 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Hinde2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Hinde2">[16]</a>).
