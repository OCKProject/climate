No deterioration of condition or abnormalities in appearance or behaviour as consequence of the experimental handling (behavioural trials, video recordings, bird measurements and handling) were observed. During reproduction, birds were kept as detailed in this section. In between, birds of the parental generation were kept in large single-sex outdoor aviaries, while their offspring was kept in single-sex indoor aviaries at room temperature (19–24°C) and under a natural light: dark regime.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In February 2010, we moved approximately two hundred canaries from our own outbred breeding population to single-sex indoor aviaries (2*2*2 m
   <span class="sup">3</span>). They were kept on a long day photoperiod (14∶10 h light∶dark) and room temperature of 19–24°C to stimulate their reproductive activity. Birds had 
   <span class="italic">ad libitum</span> access to a canary seed mixture (Van Camp, Belgium), cuttlefish bone and fresh water, while egg food (Van Camp, Belgium) was given twice a week. After five to nine weeks, we moved the birds to their breeding cages (50*64*40 cm
   <span class="sup">3</span>, GEHU cages The Netherlands) randomly mating each bird with a non-related sexual partner randomly mating each bird with a non-related sexual partner. Due to logistical reasons, we conducted two successive series of experiments: the first group of pairs was established in March (N = 37 pairs) and the second in April (N = 59 pairs). During the experiments, each pair occupied a single breeding cage, which was supplied with a nest box, nesting material, food (see above) and water. After the nestlings had hatched, germinated seeds and egg food were given on a daily basis. Parents and nestlings were moved to single-sex indoor aviaries (2*2*2 m
   <span class="sup">3</span>) when the nestlings were independent (day 30 after hatching).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nests were checked for eggs daily from the day the pairs were formed onwards. Eggs were marked with a non-toxic pen for recognition and replaced with dummy eggs. We stored the eggs on a foam tray at room temperature, with the tip or blunt end pointing downwards. The eggs were turned twice a day. We synchronized hatching within broods to minimize within-brood differences in begging, growth and survival. The synchronization may in addition result in a higher competition between - more equal -nestlings (as predicted by the “sibling rivalry hypothesis”: e.g. 
   <a rid="pone.0070463-Hahn1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Hahn1">[27]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0070463-Gilby1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Gilby1">[28]</a>) and increase the food demand at peak moments (the “peak load reduction hypothesis” e.g. 
   <a rid="pone.0070463-Hussell1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Hussell1">[29]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0070463-Mock2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Mock2">[30]</a>). Both may lead to higher levels of begging and parental provisioning respectively, when compared to asynchronous broods. However, it is unlikely that this changes the interpretation of our results, given also that all nests were treated in the same way, but these considerations are relevant for a comparison with previous or forthcoming studies. Finally, differences between asynchronous and synchronous broods may be most pronounced under harsh conditions (e.g. 
   <a rid="pone.0070463-Lack1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Lack1">[31]</a>, but see also 
   <a rid="pone.0070463-Magrath1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Magrath1">[32]</a>), while we provide 
   <span class="italic">ad libitum</span> quantities of food. We returned all eggs on the day the 4
   <span class="sup">th</span> egg (first series of experiments) or 3
   <span class="sup">rd</span> egg (second series of experiments) was laid, as the latter appeared to be sufficient for synchronization. We reciprocally cross-fostered complete clutches between nests to ensure that any observed phenotypic covariation between offspring begging and parental feeding was not attributed to experience with their biological ( =  focal) parents after hatching. Therefore, focal parents raised foster nestlings, while their biological nestlings ( =  focal nestlings) were raised by foster parents. The number of experimental nests was lower than the number of breeding pairs due to reproductive failures, small clutch size or the lack of a matching partner nest. At hatching (day  = 0) nestlings were weighed and coloured with a non-toxic pen for individual recognition. The modal brood size was 4 (range 2–4). Nestling weight was measured daily until day 13.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Begging tests were performed on day five after hatching, when the nestlings still do not show a fear response, following a previously established protocol 
   <a rid="pone.0070463-Hinde2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Hinde2">[16]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0070463-Goodship1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Goodship1">[33]</a> with slight modifications. Briefly, before testing, each focal nest was removed from its cage and all nestlings were fed until satiation with Orlux Handmix (Orlux Versele, Laga Belgium). We selected two intermediate nestlings per nest, and placed each of them individually in a wooden test box (10*10*13 cm
   <span class="sup">3</span>) and returned the nest with the remaining nestlings to their original cage. We completely removed the food from the cage 15 min before starting each trial to ensure that the remaining nestlings were not fed while focal nestlings were tested. Each wooden box had two lids, enabling us to open the top and the upper half of the front section of the box when testing. Each box was filled with expanded polystyrene in the lower half. This filling had a central hole (2 cm diameter, 1.5 cm deep) where the nestling was placed. Once a nestling was placed in the central hole, the lids were closed. Each box was moved to a heated climate room (29–30°C) and placed on a separate table (since the vibrations of tapping and the light and vibration stimulus when opening a given box - rather than the (very soft) begging calls of other tests elicit begging, NE pers. observation). After 60 min of food deprivation, the box was opened and we immediately tapped the box three times with an iron bar (21 cm, 51.63 g). Each nestling received, therefore, sound and light stimuli once the box was opened. The begging behaviour of all nestlings was video recorded using Sony video cameras (DCR-SX 30). Each trial ended after five seconds without begging. We closed the boxes and repeated the begging test 30 min later (90 min of food deprivation). In most cases, a maximum of eight nestlings were tested at one time. After testing, we returned the nestlings to their original cage, fed all nestlings until satiation with Orlux Handmix and placed the food back in the cage. Videos were analysed using Windows media player. Nestling begging intensity after 60 and 90 min of food deprivation was estimated by giving a score every second (0 =  not begging; 1 =  gape open; 2 =  gape open, head back; 3 =  gape open, head back and neck stretched; 4 =  as in 3 plus back vertical) and summing up all the scores over the time period, according to

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We recorded the feeding behaviour of the focal parents to their foster nestlings five days after the begging tests, when the nestlings were 10 days old. At this age it is possible to quantify the feeding rates of females and males separately, while the females do the brooding and most of the food transfers at earlier stages. Video recordings were made with Sony cameras (DCR-SX 30), which were installed 30 min before starting each 2 h video session. We removed all food from the cages as soon as the cameras were set. Fresh egg food and germinated seeds were provided immediately before starting the video recording in order to stimulate parents to feed. Nests were video recorded between 10:00 am and 16:00 pm. We weighed the nestlings before and after each trial. Videos were analysed with The Observer XT 10 (Noldus, The Netherlands).</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is difficult to estimate the exact amount of delivered food in granivorous species since parent can vary the amount of food with each food transfer 
    <a rid="pone.0070463-Gilby2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Gilby2">[34]</a>. But the number of feeds per feeding visit has been shown to be a good estimate of parental effort in granivorous bird species in captivity (e.g. 
    <a rid="pone.0070463-Gilby2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Gilby2">[34]</a>). Similarly, the total number of dips has been shown to correlate with mass gain in canaries, indicating its significance 
    <a rid="pone.0070463-Hinde2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Hinde2">[16]</a> (see also below). We used, therefore, the total number of dips of parents' bills into the nestlings beaks 
    <a rid="pone.0070463-Mller1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Mller1">[35]</a> to estimate the parental feeding rate ( =  food transfers) and the respective contribution of each parent for the individual feeding rates. Feeding in canaries consists of direct feeding ( =  when either sex feeds the nestlings directly) and indirect feeding ( =  when food transfer to the nestlings occurs after being fed by the partner, typically the male). The dips that were given to the nestlings by one of their parents after receiving food from their partner were credited as (indirect) dips given by the partner, who did the food preparation and pre-digestion.

The natural logarithm of the number of dips given per hour was the response variable, nestling age and the natural logarithms of body mass gain were included as covariates.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Costs for parents and offspring</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Females of the parental generation laid a second clutch immediately after the first clutch in 2010, when the first brood had just fledged. However, we only registered clutch size and clutch mass for the second group of females (April, N = 22). All females laid a clutch immediately after the first was fledged. All surviving females were re-mated with the same partner in 2011 (N = 29) and laid another clutch ( =  third clutch). We checked their nests daily and all eggs were weighed on the day they were laid. The experiments in 2011 were performed under the same conditions as those in 2010. The impact of raising foster nestlings that differed in their begging behaviour from the biological nestlings ( =  focal nestlings) on the future reproductive success of the parents was estimated via the difference in begging intensity between focal and foster nestlings (for all nests) after 90 min of food deprivation. We tested whether these differences in begging impinged on the future reproductive investment (of the female) in terms of total clutch mass and the total number of eggs laid in subsequent clutches.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In case of the nestlings we measured focused on changes in nestling growth and future reproductive investment. Since we were interested in changes to growth as a consequence of the cross-fostering, we first tested whether the growth of the focal nestlings, which were raised by foster parents, was related to the difference in begging between foster nestlings ( =  biological nestlings of the foster parents) and focal nestlings. This approach allows us to study whether focal nestlings that begged more than the foster nestlings also grew at a faster rate and vice versa. Daughters (N = 26) were then randomly mated with non-closely related sexual partners in 2011 to test whether differences in parental feeding between focal and foster parents had an impact on their future reproductive success ( =  measured as total clutch mass and size laid in 2011). To this end, we calculated both i) the difference in the actual feeding rate between foster and focal parents (in 2010) and ii) the difference in growth between foster and focal nestlings (growth rate  =  proxy for parental feeding, in 2010).</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Shapiro-Wilk and Bartlett tests were used to analyse the normality and homogeneity of variance, respectively. We tested for a relationship between offspring begging and the actual parental feeding rate of both parents by using a linear mixed model. In this case, mean brood begging intensity of focal nestlings was used as response variable and the total number of dips given by focal and foster parents as covariates. Mean brood begging represents the average value of two nestlings per nest, except in two cases where only a single nestling could be included, and forms a repeated measurement (after 60 and 90 min of food deprivation). Nest identity and dyads were used as random effects with nest identity being nested in dyads. The feeding behaviour of foster parents was included to control for its effect on the begging levels of focal nestlings. Since nestlings were more responsive after 90 min of food deprivation, we applied a similar test by using begging intensity of nestlings at 90 min as the only response variable.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We repeated these analyses (i.e. either by using the begging intensity at 60 and 90 min as repeated measurements or only 90 min) using the total number of dips given by male and females, separately.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A similar linear mixed model was applied to test for a relationship between offspring begging and growth rate ( =  proxy of the parental feeding behaviour) with mean brood begging intensity of focal nestlings (after 60 and 90 min of food deprivation) as response variable and mean growth rate of foster nestlings as covariate. In this case, the mean growth rate of focal nestlings was kept to control for the effect of parental feeding of their foster parents on their begging levels.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Begging at 90 min of food deprivation was used as an estimate for the maximum begging levels for the analyses of parental reproductive costs and offspring growth costs. Differences in begging intensities between focal and foster nestlings indicate changes in demand. Therefore, we applied multiple linear regressions to test whether changes in nestling demands had an effect on the investment of the parents (mothers) in subsequent clutches. Total clutch mass of the second or the third clutch respectively, was used as a dependent variable whereas the difference in begging intensity and the total number of eggs laid in the first clutch were used as covariates, in order to control for intrinsic variation in egg size/egg mass.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similarly, we applied a generalized linear model (Poisson distribution) by using either the total number of eggs laid in the second or the third clutch as the dependent variable and begging intensity differences and total number of eggs laid in the first clutch as covariates. In two nests, data were only available for clutch size but not for clutch mass.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test whether focal nestlings pay a cost of begging at a different rate than foster nestlings, we used a simple linear regression with growth rate as the response variable and changes in begging demands as the explanatory variable. We repeated this analysis for the daughters, only. We also applied a simple linear regression to test whether the clutch mass of daughters was affected by changes in begging demands and a generalized linear model (Poisson distribution) to test for this effect on clutch size. No covariation would be expected under stabilizing selection and parental control, if parents do not increase their feeding rate when exposed to more demanding nestlings.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effect of parental feeding changes on the future investment of the daughters was tested by applying a simple linear regression with total clutch mass laid in 2011 as a response variable. Either the difference in number of dips given by foster and focal parents during the 2 h video recordings or the difference in growth rate between the foster and focal nestlings was used as a covariate.
