 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In February 2010, we moved approximately two hundred canaries from our own outbred breeding population to single-sex indoor aviaries (2*2*2 m
  <span class="sup">3</span>). They were kept on a long day photoperiod (14∶10 h light∶dark) and room temperature of 19–24°C to stimulate their reproductive activity. Birds had 
  <span class="italic">ad libitum</span> access to a canary seed mixture (Van Camp, Belgium), cuttlefish bone and fresh water, while egg food (Van Camp, Belgium) was given twice a week. After five to nine weeks, we moved the birds to their breeding cages (50*64*40 cm
  <span class="sup">3</span>, GEHU cages The Netherlands) randomly mating each bird with a non-related sexual partner randomly mating each bird with a non-related sexual partner. Due to logistical reasons, we conducted two successive series of experiments: the first group of pairs was established in March (N = 37 pairs) and the second in April (N = 59 pairs). During the experiments, each pair occupied a single breeding cage, which was supplied with a nest box, nesting material, food (see above) and water. After the nestlings had hatched, germinated seeds and egg food were given on a daily basis. Parents and nestlings were moved to single-sex indoor aviaries (2*2*2 m
  <span class="sup">3</span>) when the nestlings were independent (day 30 after hatching).
