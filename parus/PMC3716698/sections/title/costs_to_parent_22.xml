 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We investigated potential consequences of a mismatch between parental feeding and offspring begging on the basis of a reciprocal cross-fostering design. Our results suggest that parents control the amount of resources that are provided and that the costs of a mismatch are paid by the offspring:</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Firstly, the difference in begging behaviour between foster and focal nestlings did not affect the future reproductive investment of the mothers, neither in terms of total clutch mass or total number of laid eggs within and across years. This is in contrast with a previous study by Hinde and colleagues 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Hinde1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Hinde1">[6]</a> showing that canary females that raised more demanding nestlings than their own laid fewer eggs in the following year, while the opposite was true for females that raised less demanding foster nestlings. These differences may relate to slightly different experimental designs. The breeding design of Hinde and colleagues 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Hinde1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Hinde1">[6]</a> was more demanding, with females raising two broods in the first year and laying eggs in the second year of study. Furthermore, the focal nestlings in the previous study were raised by their own parents, while we applied a reciprocal cross-fostering. This may become relevant if the foster parents would influence the begging behaviour of the focal nestlings, which should be taken into account when interpreting the data. The reciprocal design may then lead to smaller differences within dyads. But this remains speculative, and it will require further studies to estimate the potential fitness costs for parents under a number of different conditions. As pointed out above, there is still a lack of studies investigating the costs that may stabilize coadaptation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Secondly, the growth rate of the focal brood did not vary with the difference in begging intensity between foster and focal brood. Thus, offspring begging at a lower level than the biological nestlings benefited from the higher generosity of their foster parents, while offspring begging more vigorously than the biological nestlings were unable to extract sufficient resources to reach a higher growth rate than low begging nestlings. In fact, they may have been able to obtain slightly more food than the parents initially intended. However, these benefits may vanish due to the costs of begging (e.g. 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Kilner4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Kilner4">[26]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Noguera1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Noguera1">[45]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-MorenoRueda1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-MorenoRueda1">[46]</a>). The lack of long-lasting effects of the difference in begging on the clutch size and clutch mass of the daughters in the subsequent year further supports this argumentation
  <span class="monospace">. </span>Alternatively, the difference in begging intensity may be too small to have long-lasting consequences (but see 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Hinde1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Hinde1">[6]</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thirdly, daughters suffered from a mismatch between offspring begging and parental feeding in terms of future fecundity. We found a marginally non-significant tendency for a relationship between differences in parental feeding rates ( =  when using the growth rate as a proxy) between foster and focal parents and the future reproductive investment of the daughters. This implies that daughters made a smaller reproductive investment when they were raised by foster parents that were less generous than their biological parents and larger investment when raised by more generous parents. The most likely explanation for this are costs from (unrewarded) high levels of begging, given that there were no direct costs in terms of reduced growth rate (see above). Thus the possibilities to demand additional resources from the parents appear to be limited for the offspring, while the costs of changes in begging demand were smaller for parents than in a previous study 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Hinde1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Hinde1">[6]</a>. Yet, this is also the first study to measure the costs to mothers and daughters in the same currency (clutch mass/size) within the same experiment, which facilitates the comparison between mothers and daughters. These results show that daughters' investment tend to be more affected by changes in parental feeding than their mothers by changes in begging demands, both suggesting that parents do have the control over feeding rates 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Hinde1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Hinde1">[6]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Klliker3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Klliker3">[15]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, our results provide evidence for covariation between offspring begging and parental feeding at the behavioural level and suggest that parents control the feeding rates. These findings may also be taken as evidence for a resolved conflict dictated by selection acting more strongly on offspring begging 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Klliker3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Klliker3">[15]</a>. However, we did not find direct antagonistic fitness consequences 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Kilner1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Kilner1">[7]</a>. Conversely, parents may be too powerful for the offspring to manipulate feeding and therefore, this conflict will never emerge at the phenotypic level 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Kilner1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Kilner1">[7]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Mock3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Mock3">[47]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Alexander1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Alexander1">[48]</a>. More detailed empirical studies on parent-offspring interactions and the fitness costs to both counterparts will be necessary to understand how this covariation is maintained.
