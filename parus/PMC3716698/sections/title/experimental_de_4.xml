 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nests were checked for eggs daily from the day the pairs were formed onwards. Eggs were marked with a non-toxic pen for recognition and replaced with dummy eggs. We stored the eggs on a foam tray at room temperature, with the tip or blunt end pointing downwards. The eggs were turned twice a day. We synchronized hatching within broods to minimize within-brood differences in begging, growth and survival. The synchronization may in addition result in a higher competition between - more equal -nestlings (as predicted by the “sibling rivalry hypothesis”: e.g. 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Hahn1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Hahn1">[27]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Gilby1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Gilby1">[28]</a>) and increase the food demand at peak moments (the “peak load reduction hypothesis” e.g. 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Hussell1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Hussell1">[29]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Mock2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Mock2">[30]</a>). Both may lead to higher levels of begging and parental provisioning respectively, when compared to asynchronous broods. However, it is unlikely that this changes the interpretation of our results, given also that all nests were treated in the same way, but these considerations are relevant for a comparison with previous or forthcoming studies. Finally, differences between asynchronous and synchronous broods may be most pronounced under harsh conditions (e.g. 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Lack1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Lack1">[31]</a>, but see also 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Magrath1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Magrath1">[32]</a>), while we provide 
  <span class="italic">ad libitum</span> quantities of food. We returned all eggs on the day the 4
  <span class="sup">th</span> egg (first series of experiments) or 3
  <span class="sup">rd</span> egg (second series of experiments) was laid, as the latter appeared to be sufficient for synchronization. We reciprocally cross-fostered complete clutches between nests to ensure that any observed phenotypic covariation between offspring begging and parental feeding was not attributed to experience with their biological ( =  focal) parents after hatching. Therefore, focal parents raised foster nestlings, while their biological nestlings ( =  focal nestlings) were raised by foster parents. The number of experimental nests was lower than the number of breeding pairs due to reproductive failures, small clutch size or the lack of a matching partner nest. At hatching (day  = 0) nestlings were weighed and coloured with a non-toxic pen for individual recognition. The modal brood size was 4 (range 2–4). Nestling weight was measured daily until day 13.
