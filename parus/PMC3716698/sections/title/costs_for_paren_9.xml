 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Females of the parental generation laid a second clutch immediately after the first clutch in 2010, when the first brood had just fledged. However, we only registered clutch size and clutch mass for the second group of females (April, N = 22). All females laid a clutch immediately after the first was fledged. All surviving females were re-mated with the same partner in 2011 (N = 29) and laid another clutch ( =  third clutch). We checked their nests daily and all eggs were weighed on the day they were laid. The experiments in 2011 were performed under the same conditions as those in 2010. The impact of raising foster nestlings that differed in their begging behaviour from the biological nestlings ( =  focal nestlings) on the future reproductive success of the parents was estimated via the difference in begging intensity between focal and foster nestlings (for all nests) after 90 min of food deprivation. We tested whether these differences in begging impinged on the future reproductive investment (of the female) in terms of total clutch mass and the total number of eggs laid in subsequent clutches.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In case of the nestlings we measured focused on changes in nestling growth and future reproductive investment. Since we were interested in changes to growth as a consequence of the cross-fostering, we first tested whether the growth of the focal nestlings, which were raised by foster parents, was related to the difference in begging between foster nestlings ( =  biological nestlings of the foster parents) and focal nestlings. This approach allows us to study whether focal nestlings that begged more than the foster nestlings also grew at a faster rate and vice versa. Daughters (N = 26) were then randomly mated with non-closely related sexual partners in 2011 to test whether differences in parental feeding between focal and foster parents had an impact on their future reproductive success ( =  measured as total clutch mass and size laid in 2011). To this end, we calculated both i) the difference in the actual feeding rate between foster and focal parents (in 2010) and ii) the difference in growth between foster and focal nestlings (growth rate  =  proxy for parental feeding, in 2010).</p>
