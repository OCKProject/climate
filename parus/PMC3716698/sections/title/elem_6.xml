 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Parental feeding was measured by using both (i) the actual parental feeding rate during 2 h video observations (ii) the growth rate of the foster nestlings as a proxy for parental feeding behaviour of the focal parents 
  <a rid="pone.0070463-Hinde2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Hinde2">[16]</a>. To this end we tested for a relationship between offspring begging and parental feeding by comparing the begging intensity of the focal nestlings in their foster nest and the parental feeding of focal parents to their foster nestlings sensu

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Actual parental feeding rate</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We recorded the feeding behaviour of the focal parents to their foster nestlings five days after the begging tests, when the nestlings were 10 days old. At this age it is possible to quantify the feeding rates of females and males separately, while the females do the brooding and most of the food transfers at earlier stages. Video recordings were made with Sony cameras (DCR-SX 30), which were installed 30 min before starting each 2 h video session. We removed all food from the cages as soon as the cameras were set. Fresh egg food and germinated seeds were provided immediately before starting the video recording in order to stimulate parents to feed. Nests were video recorded between 10:00 am and 16:00 pm. We weighed the nestlings before and after each trial. Videos were analysed with The Observer XT 10 (Noldus, The Netherlands).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is difficult to estimate the exact amount of delivered food in granivorous species since parent can vary the amount of food with each food transfer 
   <a rid="pone.0070463-Gilby2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Gilby2">[34]</a>. But the number of feeds per feeding visit has been shown to be a good estimate of parental effort in granivorous bird species in captivity (e.g. 
   <a rid="pone.0070463-Gilby2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Gilby2">[34]</a>). Similarly, the total number of dips has been shown to correlate with mass gain in canaries, indicating its significance 
   <a rid="pone.0070463-Hinde2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Hinde2">[16]</a> (see also below). We used, therefore, the total number of dips of parents' bills into the nestlings beaks 
   <a rid="pone.0070463-Mller1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Mller1">[35]</a> to estimate the parental feeding rate ( =  food transfers) and the respective contribution of each parent for the individual feeding rates. Feeding in canaries consists of direct feeding ( =  when either sex feeds the nestlings directly) and indirect feeding ( =  when food transfer to the nestlings occurs after being fed by the partner, typically the male). The dips that were given to the nestlings by one of their parents after receiving food from their partner were credited as (indirect) dips given by the partner, who did the food preparation and pre-digestion.

   <a rid="pone.0070463-Hinde2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Hinde2">[16]</a>, we used the data obtained in (i). We applied a linear mixed model in R (version 2.10.1, R development core team 2009; 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.r-project.org</span>) to test for a relationship between the total number of dips given to 9 and 10 day old nestlings (N = 34 broods) and their body mass gain on that day (from 12am–17pm). The natural logarithm of the number of dips given per hour was the response variable, nestling age and the natural logarithms of body mass gain were included as covariates. Brood identity was used as a random factor. We checked for an interaction between the covariates. Neither the interaction between the covariates (LMM,

Having confirmed that nestling body mass gain can be used as a proxy of the parental feeding rate, we estimated the mean growth rate per nest from the slopes of simple linear regressions of nestling mass on age for each nestling from day 0 to day 13 and averaged the slopes per nest (all nestlings, 0.936≤
   <span class="italic">r

   <a rid="pone.0070463-Ricklefs1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0070463-Ricklefs1">[37]</a>), the slope of a linear regression between days 0 and 13 is a reliable indicator of nestling growth (see also
