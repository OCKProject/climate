  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There was no significant relationship between the begging intensity of focal nestlings and the total number of dips given by the focal ( =  biological) parents to foster nestlings (LMM,

   <span class="italic">F

   </span> = 1.12, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.31). However, when using the begging intensity after 90 min of food deprivation (maximum begging level) as the only response variable, we found a positive and significant covariation between the begging intensity of the focal nestlings and the total number of dips given by their biological parents (

However, the clutch mass of the daughters tended to be affected by the difference in parental feeding rates between foster and focal parents, when using the difference in growth rate between foster and focal nestlings as a proxy of changes in parental feeding rate (

This indicates that daughters tend to lay heavier clutches when they are raised by foster parents feeding at higher rates than focal parents and vice versa.
