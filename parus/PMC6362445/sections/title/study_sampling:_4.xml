 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Between 1991 and 1992, an intensive monitoring program was conducted as part of a forestry plan in all the region of Murcia with the aim of characterizing breeding bird communities as a basis for assessing the state of the region forest heritage (Esteve, 
  <a rid="ece34829-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34829-bib-0014">1991</a>). The classical surveys consist of 377 1‐km transects covering the whole study area and distributed randomly in forested areas (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34829-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34829-fig-0002">2</a>a,b) during the reproductive period (May to July; Hernández &amp; Barberá, 
  <a rid="ece34829-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34829-bib-0018">1997</a>). Each transect was conducted by walking and recording the number of each species detected (by sight or song), giving a total of 73 forest bird species recorded (Supporting Information Table

   <p>Distribution of 1‐km bird transects conducted in Mediterranean forest areas in the study area (region of Murcia, SE Spain), considering two different grid sizes: (a) aggregation scheme AS2x2 (60‐s latitude/longitude) and (b) aggregation scheme AS3x3 (90‐s latitude/longitude). Cross symbols represent the mean positions for the 377 transects, which were grouped as spatial replicates considering two different aggregation schemes for sites: (c) 246 sites for AS2x2; (d) 185 sites for AS3x3</p>
