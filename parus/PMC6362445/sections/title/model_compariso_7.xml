 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In each aggregation scheme (AS2x2 and AS3x3), we evaluated the estimates of detectability and occupancy for each species, as well as the estimates of regression coefficients for predictor variables. A linear correlation was performed among species estimates of detectability and occupancy, comparing both aggregation schemes.</p>
