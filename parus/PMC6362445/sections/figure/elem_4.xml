 <div class="caption">
  <p>Relationships between the number of bird species (community size, 
   <span class="italic">Nsite</span>) and the covariates of each sampled site: (a) forest cover, (b) temperature, and (c) precipitation. Each point represents the richness of each cell site surveyed (
   <span class="italic">n = </span>246 and 
   <span class="italic">n = </span>185 for the aggregation schemes AS2x2 and AS3x3, respectively). Lines represent splines smooth. Comparison of aggregation schemes shown in different colors: AS2x2 (black) and AS3x3 (green, yellow, and blue for the percentage of forest cover, annual mean temperature, and annual precipitation, respectively). Note slight offset of color points in the 
   <span class="italic">x</span> direction for the aggregation scheme AS3x3
