 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study sites were supplied with wooden nest-boxes (approximately 180 in the parkland area and 250 in the forest). Regular inspections of nest-boxes started at the beginning of April in each breeding season. The purpose of inspections was to record nesting bird species; basic breeding traits, such as laying date, clutch size, and brood size at the moment of hatching; and number of fledglings. The nestlings were individually ringed and measured (wing length and body mass) when they were 13–15 days old (Bańbura et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">2007</a>). At the same time, two proximal secondary flight feathers were sampled from each nestling from the same brood to avoid the effect of differences in nestling development. Feathers taken from the nestlings of the same brood were pooled into one sample. They were kept at −18 °C until the time of laboratory analyses. In total, we evaluated heavy metals in 219 samples collected during the breeding seasons 2006–2008, including 123 samples from great tits (61 from parkland and 62 from forest site) and 96 from blue tits (23 from parkland and 73 from forest site). More detailed description of sample size, including species, year, and study site, is listed in the tables herein.
