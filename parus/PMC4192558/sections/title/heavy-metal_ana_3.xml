 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The feathers used for analysis were rinsed in deionized water to remove externally adsorbed heavy metals (Pilastro et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">1993</a>; Pain et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">2005</a>; Metcheva et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">2006</a>). The samples were dried for 24 h in the oven at 60 °C. The leaf samples were not washed so that surface deposition could be estimated as well (Dauwe et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2004a</a>). They were dried in an oven at 65 °C for 72 h and then weighed and ground into a powder (Fayiga et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2007</a>). Subsequently, feather and leaf samples were digested in a 4:1 mixture of 65 % nitrogenous acid and 70 % perchloric acid. After the end of the digestion process, all samples were diluted in deionized water and stored in polypropylene metal-free vials at −18 °C until analysis (Markowski et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">2013</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The analyses were performed in the Laboratory of Computer and Analytic Techniques, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Łódź. Lead, cadmium, and zinc concentrations were measured in the samples using atomic absorption spectrophotometer Spectr AA-300. Lead and cadmium, due to very their low concentrations in samples, were measured using electro-thermal atomizer GTA96. Zinc was determined in the flame atomizer using the technique of low-temperature plasma. In one case, lead concentration was not detected; thus, it was omitted from the statistical analysis. The detection limit for lead was 0.02 ng/g, for cadmium was 0.006 ng/g, and for zinc was 8 ng/g. The samples were analyzed in batches with the use of blind samples and determination of calibration curves. All metal concentrations were expressed in µg/g on a dry-weight basis. We used certified reference material (ERM-CE278 k) from the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (Geel, Belgium) to verify the quality and accuracy of the performed analysis. Recovery rates for the certified reference material were within an acceptable margin.</p>
