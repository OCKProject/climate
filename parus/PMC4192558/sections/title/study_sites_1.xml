 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Study sites were located within administrative boundaries of Łódź in two differing habitats: urban parkland and deciduous forest. The parkland area is situated in the southwest part of Łódź and includes botanical and zoological gardens covering approximately 80 ha (Kaliński et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">2009</a>). This area is situated approximately 3 km from the city center and is surrounded by roads of considerable traffic intensity, thus contributing one of the highest line emissions in Łódź ranging from 4.47 to 7.74 mg/y (Raport o Stanie Środowiska 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" href="#CR70">2009</a>). The parkland site is characterized by a mosaic, highly fragmented arrangement of vegetation and a visible influence of human activity connected with urban processes. The forest site covers approximately 140 ha in the central part of the Łagiewniki Forest (total of 1,250 ha). Tree stands consist of mature deciduous trees of diverse species with predomination of oaks

  <span class="italic">petraea</span> (Marciniak et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">2007</a>). This area is situated in the northeast part of Łódź, further away from the city center, compared with the parkland site. The forest complex in which the study site was established has a low number of roads, which are to the most extent excluded from traffic. Consequently, the Łagiewniki Forest area is characterized by a decreased influence of human activity and car traffic. Study sites were separated by a distance of 10 km (Kaliński et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">2009</a>).
