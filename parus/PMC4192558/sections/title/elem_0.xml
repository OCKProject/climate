 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study was performed during the breeding seasons of 2006–2008 as part of a long-term project on the breeding biology of tits around Łódź in central Poland (Bańbura et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">2007</a>). All procedures were approved by the local Ethical Committee and the State Office for Environment Protection.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Study Sites</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Study sites were located within administrative boundaries of Łódź in two differing habitats: urban parkland and deciduous forest. The parkland area is situated in the southwest part of Łódź and includes botanical and zoological gardens covering approximately 80 ha (Kaliński et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">2009</a>). This area is situated approximately 3 km from the city center and is surrounded by roads of considerable traffic intensity, thus contributing one of the highest line emissions in Łódź ranging from 4.47 to 7.74 mg/y (Raport o Stanie Środowiska 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" href="#CR70">2009</a>). The parkland site is characterized by a mosaic, highly fragmented arrangement of vegetation and a visible influence of human activity connected with urban processes. The forest site covers approximately 140 ha in the central part of the Łagiewniki Forest (total of 1,250 ha). Tree stands consist of mature deciduous trees of diverse species with predomination of oaks 
   <span class="italic">Quercus robur</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Q.</span> 
   <span class="italic">petraea</span> (Marciniak et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">2007</a>). This area is situated in the northeast part of Łódź, further away from the city center, compared with the parkland site. The forest complex in which the study site was established has a low number of roads, which are to the most extent excluded from traffic. Consequently, the Łagiewniki Forest area is characterized by a decreased influence of human activity and car traffic. Study sites were separated by a distance of 10 km (Kaliński et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">2009</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sample Collection</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study sites were supplied with wooden nest-boxes (approximately 180 in the parkland area and 250 in the forest). Regular inspections of nest-boxes started at the beginning of April in each breeding season. The purpose of inspections was to record nesting bird species; basic breeding traits, such as laying date, clutch size, and brood size at the moment of hatching; and number of fledglings. The nestlings were individually ringed and measured (wing length and body mass) when they were 13–15 days old (Bańbura et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">2007</a>). At the same time, two proximal secondary flight feathers were sampled from each nestling from the same brood to avoid the effect of differences in nestling development. Feathers taken from the nestlings of the same brood were pooled into one sample. They were kept at −18 °C until the time of laboratory analyses. In total, we evaluated heavy metals in 219 samples collected during the breeding seasons 2006–2008, including 123 samples from great tits (61 from parkland and 62 from forest site) and 96 from blue tits (23 from parkland and 73 from forest site). More detailed description of sample size, including species, year, and study site, is listed in the tables herein.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the end of May 2008, we also collected 10 vegetation samples: 6 from the urban parkland area (
   <span class="italic">Tilia cordata, Q.</span> 
   <span class="italic">rubra, Carpinus betulus</span> leaves) and 4 from the forest site (
   <span class="italic">C.</span> 
   <span class="italic">betulus, Q.</span> 
   <span class="italic">robur</span> leaves). The leaves were of average size, undamaged, and taken from a height of 2–3 m at ≤10 m away from nest boxes (Dauwe et al.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Heavy-Metal Analysis in Samples</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The feathers used for analysis were rinsed in deionized water to remove externally adsorbed heavy metals (Pilastro et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">1993</a>; Pain et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">2005</a>; Metcheva et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">2006</a>). The samples were dried for 24 h in the oven at 60 °C. The leaf samples were not washed so that surface deposition could be estimated as well (Dauwe et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2004a</a>). They were dried in an oven at 65 °C for 72 h and then weighed and ground into a powder (Fayiga et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2007</a>). Subsequently, feather and leaf samples were digested in a 4:1 mixture of 65 % nitrogenous acid and 70 % perchloric acid. After the end of the digestion process, all samples were diluted in deionized water and stored in polypropylene metal-free vials at −18 °C until analysis (Markowski et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">2013</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The analyses were performed in the Laboratory of Computer and Analytic Techniques, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Łódź. Lead, cadmium, and zinc concentrations were measured in the samples using atomic absorption spectrophotometer Spectr AA-300. Lead and cadmium, due to very their low concentrations in samples, were measured using electro-thermal atomizer GTA96. Zinc was determined in the flame atomizer using the technique of low-temperature plasma. In one case, lead concentration was not detected; thus, it was omitted from the statistical analysis. The detection limit for lead was 0.02 ng/g, for cadmium was 0.006 ng/g, and for zinc was 8 ng/g. The samples were analyzed in batches with the use of blind samples and determination of calibration curves. All metal concentrations were expressed in µg/g on a dry-weight basis. We used certified reference material (ERM-CE278 k) from the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (Geel, Belgium) to verify the quality and accuracy of the performed analysis. Recovery rates for the certified reference material were within an acceptable margin.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analysis of Rainfall</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data on rainfall for Łódź during the study seasons were obtained from 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/Lodz" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/Lodz</span> (Tutiempo Network, S.L., Madrid, Spain), a Web site containing records provided by the state weather station located in Łódź. We calculated individual total rainfall for every brood as a sum of daily rainfall during the period starting on March 1 and ending 20 days after the hatch of a given brood. Those sums were used as indicators of rainfall intensity, thus indirectly influencing the level of pollutants in the food of particular broods. For both great and blue tits, we assumed that fledglings leave the nest on the day 20 day after hatch (Gibb

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistical Analysis</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistical analyses of data were performed using Statistica 9.1 software (StatSoft, Inc. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR740" href="#CR740">2010</a>). All statistical analyses were performed on ln-transformed values of response variables to normalize their distributions and stabilize variances (Sokal and Rohlf 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">1981</a>). Arithmetic means of nontransformed heavy-metal concentrations per nest with SE values are presented in tables and figures.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To analyze the overall differences in heavy-metal concentrations between great and blue tit nestlings from two different study sites during 3 consecutive years, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used. Heavy-metal concentrations were used as a multiple dependent variable with species, site, and year as factors. We applied the protected ANOVA approach by examining concentrations of particular metals using univariate ANOVAs after obtaining significant effects in MANOVA, which led to assessing which individual dependent variables contributed to significant multivariate effects (Scheiner 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">1993</a>). To examine differences among years, we used Tukey’s honestly significant difference (HSD) test preceded by Fisher LSD test. A similar approach to MANOVA, as an introductory step to protected univariate ANOVA, was also used to test differences in heavy-metal concentrations between years within the same site and between sites within each year for each study species separately. To evaluate differences in heavy-metal concentrations in vegetation samples from the two study areas, MANOVA followed by univariate ANOVA was used as well. To analyze the differences in rainfall between breeding seasons, we used ANOVA. Correlations between metals were calculated as Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients. In all statistical analyses, we assumed a level of significance at
