 <p>(
  <span class="bold">a</span>) Genome-wide distribution of Watterson's Θ and (
  <span class="bold">b</span>) Tajima's D measured in sliding window sizes of 50 kB and step size of 10 kB, as well as (
  <span class="bold">c</span>) CLR (composite likelihood score, measured as the sum of neighbouring sweep targets, see Methods) from the sweep analysis with labelled cognition-related genes (see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Data 5a</a>) that were among the top 3% of gene-associated sweep targets (indicated by the dashed line). Chromosomes are separated by colour in ascending order according to their chromosome number. The Z chromosome is the furthest right. The solid lines in the upper two panels denote smoothing splines.
