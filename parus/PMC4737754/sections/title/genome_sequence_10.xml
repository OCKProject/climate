This reference bird originated from a captive population that was derived from wild-caught birds from the Netherlands four generations ago and has since been artificially selected for avian personality
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" href="#b39">39</a>. In the great tit genome assembling, we relied on the creation of de Bruijn graphical structures, a directed graph that evolves from defined sequence length (kmer) progression (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Methods</a> for a detailed description of genome assembly and annotation). In brief, our genome assembling involved four principal steps that progressed from sequence quality revisions, to forming contigs from these sequence reads, to connecting contigs into scaffolds using paired-end sequence of large fragments (jumping libraries) and finally gap filling. In this study, the total input genome coverage of Illumina HiSeq sequences was ∼95 × (fragments, 3 and 8 kb spanning inserts) based on a genome size estimate of 1.2 Gb. The combined sequence reads were assembled using the ALLPATHS software
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" href="#b40">40</a>. This draft assembly was referred to as Parus_major 1.0.1. This version has been gap filled and cleaned of contaminating contigs. The assembly is made up of a total of 2,066 scaffolds with an N50 scaffold length of over 7.7 Mb (N50 contig length was 133 kb). The total assembled contigs spans 1.0 Gb, and has an assembled coverage of 40 × using fragment reads aligned to the assembly. The final assembly (Pmajor1.04) has been deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the accession
