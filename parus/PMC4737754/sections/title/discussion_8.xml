 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have generated a high quality 
  <span class="italic">de novo</span> assembled and annotated genome for the great tit, a model organism in ecology and evolutionary biology. Our study adds to the growing number of representative genomes sequenced across the bird family tree
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" href="#b37">37</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">38</a>. Further, unlike these recent genome studies, we assembled the great tit genome into chromosomes, which was useful for determining chromosomal regions of selective sweeps and larger-scale synteny conservation across species. The great tit genome assembly represents a powerful tool, especially when combined with the extensive availability of individual phenotypes of known birds for which DNA is available via routine blood sampling. Using sequence analysis of birds from a wide range of European populations, we identified selective sweep areas enriched with genes related to learning and cognition. Using whole-genome methylation data, we not only revealed conserved non-CpG methylation patterns between birds and mammals, but also extended these observations by showing that methylation is correlated with rates of molecular evolution, thereby suggesting an important role for DNA methylation in evolution. Our 
  <span class="italic">de novo</span> assembled genome will help us to reveal the genetic basis of phenotypic evolution, which is essential for understanding how wild species have adapted to our changing planet.
