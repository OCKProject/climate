 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To compare expression levels and methylation in the brain, 200,793,186 trimmed paired-end reads from the brain were aligned against the assembled genome using Tophat version v2.0.10 (ref. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" href="#b43">43</a>; Bowtie v2.1.0 (ref. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b44" href="#b44">44</a>)) with the same settings as described above, except that multiple hits were prefiltered against the genome (-M option) and the reads were first aligned against the final annotation (-G option). The brain Tophat alignment was analysed with Cufflinks v2.2.0 using the same settings as above, except that the annotation was also included (-g option). Expression levels of brain genes were extracted from the Cufflinks output.
