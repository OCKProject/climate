 <p>Results of an enrichment test conducted for GO terms associated with the genes found from selective sweep and that were positively selected by using human orthologs (a and b) and chicken orthologs (c and d). From the random gene set test, the GO term groups appeared no more than three times except for phosphatidylinositol-mediated signalling GO group which appeared seven times.</p>
