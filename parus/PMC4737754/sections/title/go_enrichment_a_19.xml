 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Human orthologues were obtained for the great tit genes by using a combination of Ensembl and Uniprot databases. In the sweep areas, orthologues were found for 460 genes. Functional relatedness of GO terms was done using the Cytoscape plugin ClueGo 2.1.4 (ref. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b62" href="#b62">62</a>). ClueGo constructs and compares networks of functionally related GO terms with kappa statistics. A two-sided hypergeometric test (enrichment/depletion) was applied with GO term fusion, network specificity was set to ‘medium' and false discovery correction was carried out using the Bonferroni step-down method. We used both human (08.10.2015) and chicken gene ontologies (08.10.2015) for comparison. With human gene ontologies, we detected 13 functional groups of GO terms across all sweep areas (

These groups were largely involved in functions concerning dendrite, cytoskeleton organization, protein oligomerization, synaptic transmission, regulation of phosphatase activity, synaptic membrane and cognition. We also did a GO enrichment analysis for the positively selected genes, as defined by the PAML-based analysis, in the same way as for the sweep genes, and obtained 12 functional GO groups (

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Data 5c,d</a>) because the chicken genes were not as well GO annotated as the human ones.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To further confirm our GO enrichment results, we randomly selected 50 sets of genes from outside the sweep area, each containing ∼460 genes (the same number as in our selective sweep set), and analysed them using the same Cluego settings. We found that the GO term groups significantly enriched in our selective sweep set appeared no more than three times except for phosphatidylinositol-mediated signalling GO group which appeared seven times. This additional analysis further supports the robustness of our results.</p>
