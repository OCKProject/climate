 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Assembled scaffolds were assigned to specific chromosomes using two 
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span> linkage maps
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">19</a> constructed from different populations; one at Wytham Woods, Oxford (UK) and the other at de Hoge Veluwe (Netherlands), which is the population that the reference bird descended from. Flanking sequences of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) positioned on the linkage map were aligned against the assembled scaffolds using BLAT. Scaffolds that contained multiple SNP markers were then oriented and positioned on the basis of the positions of the SNP markers on the linkage map. The order of the SNP markers on the scaffolds and the linkage map were in good agreement (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</a>). Regardless of whether the Netherlands or UK map was used, the Spearman rank correlation coefficient between the linkage map marker order and the assembly marker order was 0.99 or greater for nearly all the chromosomes. Exceptions were only on microchromosomes with just a few markers, for example, linkage group 25LG22. If anything, correlation coefficients were slightly higher when the UK map was used, despite the genome assembly being performed on a Netherlands bird. This indicates that the assembly is equally applicable to other great tit populations as it is to the ‘source' population. Most discrepancies between the orders on the sequence and linkage map were caused by the lower resolution of the linkage map involving SNPs that were less than 1 cM apart. Two scaffolds (22 and 28) appeared to be chimeric and were manually split between contigs Contig22.251-Contig22.250 and contigs Contig28.53-Contig28.51, respectively. Because of a lack of any genetic marker on Contig28.52, this contig was not assigned to a specific chromosome.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Small scaffolds that were assigned to a chromosome based on only a single marker were oriented based on the zebra finch-great tit comparative map, taking into account the orientation of the flanking scaffolds assigned to that chromosome. Next, we used MUMMER to align all unassigned scaffolds against the zebra finch genome
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" href="#b20">20</a> and larger scaffolds that unambiguously mapped to a specific region of the zebra finch genome at a location between assigned scaffolds were assigned to that location in the genome. The orientation of these scaffolds was chosen in relation to the adjacent mapped scaffolds, thus minimizing the number of rearrangements. In total, 300 scaffolds could be assigned to a chromosomal location based on the linkage map
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">19</a> totalling 975,330,736 bp and 124 scaffolds were assigned to a chromosomal location based on the alignment with the zebra finch genome, totalling 23,489,268 bp (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Data 1</a>). Although the final genome assembly therefore is not completely 
  <span class="italic">de novo</span>, these contigs only represent 2.4% of the assembled sequence and 97.6% of the assembly represents a truly 
  <span class="italic">de novo</span> genome assembly.
