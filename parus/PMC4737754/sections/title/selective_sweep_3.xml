  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Data 4</a>) compromising roughly 0.2% of the genome. We extracted 460 genes that had human orthologues from these regions and assessed their functional importance by performing a gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. Thirteen different GO categories were overrepresented in these selected regions relative to the rest of the genome (

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Data 5a</a>). Among these categories were dendrite, cognition and several other categories related to neuronal function. Therefore genes related to neuronal function are likely to have been targets of recent positive selection.
