  <span class="italic">EGR1</span> in birds. Pairwise dN/dS rates revealed that there is a substantial increase in dN/dS between great tit and ground tit relative to other pairwise values (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</a>, upper panel). We also tested whether the increased fixations are unique to the captive reference bird by using variable positions from the 29 re-sequenced birds, the reference bird and the ground tit genome and found no evidence for this (
