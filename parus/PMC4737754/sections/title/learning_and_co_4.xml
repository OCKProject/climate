 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the striking genes presented in the learning/cognition category was early growth response protein 1 (
  <span class="italic">EGR1</span>), whose gene expression has been particularly well studied within vocal communication and social contexts in Passerines

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">25</a>. 
  <span class="italic">EGR1</span> is one of the immediate early genes, which are known to be important in learning and memory
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" href="#b26">26</a>. In zebra finches, its expression has been shown to be correlated with song learning and practice and is social context dependent

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" href="#b27">27</a>. To further investigate the role of 
  <span class="italic">EGR1</span> in great tit evolution, we obtained additional EGR1 sequences from 45 bird species (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Data 6</a>). We found that rapid evolution of 
  <span class="italic">EGR1</span> is specific to the tit lineage (as signified by an elevated ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rate (dN/dS)) and has occurred after the split with the nearest sequenced relative, the ground tit and that this is not a feature related to the captive nature of the reference bird (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</a>). These results are consistent with 
  <span class="italic">EGR1</span> being subject to frequent, recurrent positive selection. Another relevant gene from this category was the forkhead box protein P2 (
  <span class="italic">FOXP2</span>), a well-studied gene that affects speech and language development in humans
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" href="#b28">28</a> and linked to song learning in birds
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" href="#b29">29</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">30</a>. The combination of these song-related genes and the other neuronal genes within sweep areas points to a role of these genes in the evolution of song learning and memory in great tits.
