 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the genome annotation, both PASA v. 2-r20130605 (ref. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b45" href="#b45">45</a>) and MAKER v. 2.31.5 (ref. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" href="#b46">46</a>) pipelines were used (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</a>). First PASA (program to assemble spliced alignments) was used for the identification of spliced transcripts and the grouping of the identified transcripts belonging to the same gene. PASA was run using the assembled Trinity transcripts and the Cufflinks gtf output file from Tophat/Bowtie as input. Alignment within PASA was done using gmap. The PASA analysis resulted in a total of 74,229 different assembled transcripts with an average size of 1,564â€‰bp. A comparison (using blast) with the annotated transcriptomes of chicken
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">21</a>, zebra finch
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" href="#b20">20</a>, flycatcher
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" href="#b47">47</a> and ground tit
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b48" href="#b48">48</a> (derived from Ensembl release 75 or NCBI refseq release 66) indicated that these transcripts represented 13,626 different genes in these other birds.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the MAKER pipeline, the output of PASA was used as EST evidence. From the 
  <span class="italic">ab initio</span> predictors, AUGUSTUS version 3.0.2 (ref. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b49" href="#b49">49</a>) was applied by using the chicken gene model. The same RNA-seq 
  <span class="italic">de novo</span> assembly as used in PASA was included in MAKER. In addition to 
  <span class="italic">de novo</span> assembly, reference-based RNA-seq assembly was used. Last, protein evidence from zebra finch (version 3.2.4.75) and chicken (version 4.75) obtained from Ensembl version 75 was aligned to the great tit genome. By combining these two pipelines, we obtained 21,057 transcripts for 13,036 great tit genes. See additional information about functional annotation and repeat/RNA masking in
