 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To obtain further insight into the evolutionary genetics of the great tit, an additional 29 wild individuals from across Europe were re-sequenced at an average depth of 10 × (

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" href="#b23">23</a> of the reference individual suggested a large effective population size that increased from an already large ∼2 × 10

  <span class="sup">5</span> individuals 70 Kyr ago (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1b</a>). There was evidence that the expansion was interrupted by a very mild decline in population size beginning ∼110 Kyr ago, coinciding with the start of the last glacial period in Europe, followed by a quick recovery. Consistent with expectation for a population that has undergone a recent increase, there is a genome-wide excess of low-frequency variation, as indicated by negative Tajima's
