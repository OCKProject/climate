 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We obtained genome-wide sliding window estimates (step size 10 kb, window size 50 kb) of Watterson's Θ (

  <span class="italic">D</span> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>) along each chromosome based on the SNP calls from ANGSD. For most macrochromosomes, diversity is increased towards the chromosome ends, and there are remarkable local drops of diversity on chromosomes 3, 6 and Z (
