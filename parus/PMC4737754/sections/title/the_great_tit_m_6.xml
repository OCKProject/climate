 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Epigenetic control of gene expression is increasingly recognized as playing a major role in many different cellular processes affecting a large variety of traits
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" href="#b31">31</a>, with DNA methylation of cytosines being the most widely studied epigenetic mark. Great tit DNA methylation patterns were investigated by performing whole-genome bisulfite sequencing in whole brain and blood tissue of the reference bird. A total of 10.2 million CpG sites, representing 66.7% of all CpG sites, could be called in both tissues. The observed genome-wide methylation patterns in both tissues, including reduced methylation within CpG islands and at transcription start sites (TSS), are consistent with previous findings in human and mouse cells

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</a>). We also observed low, but significant non-CpG methylation in the brain tissue that was not observed in the blood (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4a</a>). The neuronal non-CpG methylation patterns seen at 167.4 million sites (42% of all non-CpG sites) display similar genome-wide patterns to those seen for CpG methylation, including reduced methylation within CpG islands and at TSS, albeit at a much lower level. Similar non-CpG methylation has recently been found in embryonic stem cells and oocytes of many mammalian species

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both CpG and non-CpG methylation has been shown to negatively correlate with gene expression at TSS and in gene bodies in mouse neurons
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" href="#b33">33</a>, while hypomethylation of both CpG and non-CpG sites in gene bodies has been reported in highly expressed genes of human neurons
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" href="#b35">35</a>. Consistent with these results, both CpG and non-CpG methylation were negatively correlated with gene expression within gene bodies and at TSS in the great tit brain (Spearman's rho &lt; −0.23, 
  <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;1.0 × 10
  <span class="sup">−95</span> for all comparisons, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4b,c</a>). In addition, the negative correlation between non-CpG methylation and expression was observed in the regions directly upstream and downstream of gene bodies (Spearman's rho &lt;−0.22, 
  <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;0.0001 for all comparisons, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4c</a>). Therefore, our findings now extend a potential functional role of non-CpG methylation in neuronal tissue to Aves, suggesting evolutionary conservation of this epigenetic regulation in brains.
