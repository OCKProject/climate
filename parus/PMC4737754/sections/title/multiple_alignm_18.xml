 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Natural selection affects the composition of genomes and we were interested in estimating gene-specific rates of molecular evolution (dN/dS) and finding evidence for the action of positive selection in protein coding genes. Since alignment quality is crucial for reliably conducting tests of positive selection using substitution rate analyses, we chose a very conservative approach. We used homologous genes from zebra finch and chicken, the two best annotated bird genomes to date. We only analysed genes with a homologue in both, and used MUSCLE
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b58" href="#b58">58</a> along with ZORRO
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b59" href="#b59">59</a> to exclude positions of low alignment certainty. To obtain the corresponding multiple DNA codon alignments, protein alignments along with the unaligned DNA sequences were prepared with PAL2NAL
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b60" href="#b60">60</a>. Altogether, we constructed ≈11,107 triplet alignments. Substitution rates were calculated using PAML
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b61" href="#b61">61</a> to obtain the nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate ratio (dN/dS=
  <span class="italic">ω</span>). 
  <span class="italic">ω</span> values &lt;1, =1 and &gt;1 indicate purifying selection, neutral evolution and diversifying (positive) selection, respectively. Rates of molecular evolution (dN/dS) for each gene were obtained from the one-ratio model M0 from PAML that assumes a constant 
  <span class="italic">ω</span> for the whole gene phylogeny. In addition, a site test was used to detect positive selection. Specifically, we compared the likelihoods calculated using model M8, which assumes a proportion of sites to evolve under positive selection, and model M7, which does not assume a site class with 
  <span class="italic">ω</span> exceeding one. Positive selection was inferred when the model M7 and M8 were significantly different as assessed by a likelihood-ratio test that assumes that 2ΔlnL (twice the log likelihood difference) is

  <span class="italic">P</span> values were adjusted for multiple testing (Benjamini and Hochberg) with a false discovery rate of 0.2;
