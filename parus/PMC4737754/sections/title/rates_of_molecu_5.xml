 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To examine whether the identified GO categories in general play an important role in great tit evolution, we extracted all great tit genes that are associated with the enriched GO terms of the sweep regions (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3</a>, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Data 5a</a>) and conducted evolutionary rate (dN/dS) analyses by using orthologous genes from chicken and zebra finch. We found that median dN/dS for genes associated with the identified GO terms is reduced compared with all other GO-annotated genes (0.066 versus 0.087,

  <span class="sup">−22</span>, Mann–Whitney 
  <span class="italic">U</span>-test), and yet these genes have significantly more targets of probable positive selection based on a site test of positive selection (

  <span class="sup">−3</span>, 
  <span class="italic">χ</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> test; see Methods for details). Moreover, on a genome-wide scale, ∼1% of the genes in the great tit genome show evidence for positive selection based on their long-term evolutionary rates. These genes are generally enriched for neuronal traits, such as cerebellar Purkinje cell layer formation and axon extension (
