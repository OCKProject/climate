  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We selected a male great tit (hereafter the reference bird) from a recent captive population (four generations in captivity) in the Netherlands for genome sequencing and 
   <span class="italic">de novo</span> assembly (see Methods and 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Information</a> for a detailed description of genome assembly and annotation). We generated a total of 114 Gb of Illumina HiSeq sequence data; after gap-filling and removal of adaptor sequences, the assembly consisted of a total of 2,066 scaffolds with an N50 scaffold length of over 7.7 Mb and an N50 contig length of 133 kb. Taken together, the assembled contigs span 1.0 Gb. We were able to assign 98% of the assembled bases to a chromosomal location using the recently described high-density linkage map
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">19</a> (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Data 1</a>). The total number of chromosomes covered by the assembly is 29 with three additional linkage groups (Chr25LG1, Chr25LG2 and LGE22). The assignment of chromosomal locations to the majority of the assembly resulted in a very high quality reference genome and enabled detailed comparisons with other bird genomes. A comparison between the genomes of the great tit and zebra finch (

   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</a>) showed only intra-chromosomal inversions, and not a single inter-chromosomal rearrangement, confirming high synteny in birds. For the genome annotation step, we combined RNA sequencing data from eight different tissues of the reference bird with gene models from chicken (
   <span class="italic">Gallus gallus</span>)
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">21</a> and zebra finch
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" href="#b20">20</a>. The final annotation resulted in a total of 21,057 transcripts for 13,036 high-confidence gene predictions.

   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Data 2</a>, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1a</a>). We found very little differentiation among populations (

   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Data 3</a>) which is in line with previous phylogenetic analyses of the spatial genetic structure of great tits in Europe using mtDNA markers
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">22</a>. This suggests a largely panmictic European great tit population

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" href="#b23">23</a> of the reference individual suggested a large effective population size that increased from an already large ∼2 × 10

   <span class="sup">5</span> individuals 70 Kyr ago (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1b</a>). There was evidence that the expansion was interrupted by a very mild decline in population size beginning ∼110 Kyr ago, coinciding with the start of the last glacial period in Europe, followed by a quick recovery. Consistent with expectation for a population that has undergone a recent increase, there is a genome-wide excess of low-frequency variation, as indicated by negative Tajima's

   <span class="italic">D</span> (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2a,b</a>), indicative of recent selective sweeps. To investigate the role of recent positive selection in greater detail, we conducted a genome-wide scan for selective sweeps and identified 813 genomic regions (

   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Data 4</a>) compromising roughly 0.2% of the genome. We extracted 460 genes that had human orthologues from these regions and assessed their functional importance by performing a gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. Thirteen different GO categories were overrepresented in these selected regions relative to the rest of the genome (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3</a>, 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Data 5a</a>). Among these categories were dendrite, cognition and several other categories related to neuronal function. Therefore genes related to neuronal function are likely to have been targets of recent positive selection.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Learning and cognition</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the striking genes presented in the learning/cognition category was early growth response protein 1 (
   <span class="italic">EGR1</span>), whose gene expression has been particularly well studied within vocal communication and social contexts in Passerines
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">24</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">25</a>. 
   <span class="italic">EGR1</span> is one of the immediate early genes, which are known to be important in learning and memory
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" href="#b26">26</a>. In zebra finches, its expression has been shown to be correlated with song learning and practice and is social context dependent
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">25</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" href="#b27">27</a>. To further investigate the role of 
   <span class="italic">EGR1</span> in great tit evolution, we obtained additional EGR1 sequences from 45 bird species (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Data 6</a>). We found that rapid evolution of 
   <span class="italic">EGR1</span> is specific to the tit lineage (as signified by an elevated ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rate (dN/dS)) and has occurred after the split with the nearest sequenced relative, the ground tit and that this is not a feature related to the captive nature of the reference bird (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</a>). These results are consistent with 
   <span class="italic">EGR1</span> being subject to frequent, recurrent positive selection. Another relevant gene from this category was the forkhead box protein P2 (
   <span class="italic">FOXP2</span>), a well-studied gene that affects speech and language development in humans
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" href="#b28">28</a> and linked to song learning in birds
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" href="#b29">29</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">30</a>. The combination of these song-related genes and the other neuronal genes within sweep areas points to a role of these genes in the evolution of song learning and memory in great tits.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rates of molecular evolution</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To examine whether the identified GO categories in general play an important role in great tit evolution, we extracted all great tit genes that are associated with the enriched GO terms of the sweep regions (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3</a>, 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Data 5a</a>) and conducted evolutionary rate (dN/dS) analyses by using orthologous genes from chicken and zebra finch. We found that median dN/dS for genes associated with the identified GO terms is reduced compared with all other GO-annotated genes (0.066 versus 0.087, 
   <span class="italic">P</span>=1.4 × 10
   <span class="sup">−22</span>, Mann–Whitney 
   <span class="italic">U</span>-test), and yet these genes have significantly more targets of probable positive selection based on a site test of positive selection (
   <span class="italic">P</span>=1.84 × 10
   <span class="sup">−3</span>, 
   <span class="italic">χ</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> test; see Methods for details). Moreover, on a genome-wide scale, ∼1% of the genes in the great tit genome show evidence for positive selection based on their long-term evolutionary rates. These genes are generally enriched for neuronal traits, such as cerebellar Purkinje cell layer formation and axon extension (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Data 5b</a>). Taken together, it becomes apparent that selection on traits for brain function has played a major role in the evolution of great tits.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Epigenetic control of gene expression is increasingly recognized as playing a major role in many different cellular processes affecting a large variety of traits
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" href="#b31">31</a>, with DNA methylation of cytosines being the most widely studied epigenetic mark. Great tit DNA methylation patterns were investigated by performing whole-genome bisulfite sequencing in whole brain and blood tissue of the reference bird. A total of 10.2 million CpG sites, representing 66.7% of all CpG sites, could be called in both tissues. The observed genome-wide methylation patterns in both tissues, including reduced methylation within CpG islands and at transcription start sites (TSS), are consistent with previous findings in human and mouse cells
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">32</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" href="#b33">33</a>(
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</a>). We also observed low, but significant non-CpG methylation in the brain tissue that was not observed in the blood (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4a</a>). The neuronal non-CpG methylation patterns seen at 167.4 million sites (42% of all non-CpG sites) display similar genome-wide patterns to those seen for CpG methylation, including reduced methylation within CpG islands and at TSS, albeit at a much lower level. Similar non-CpG methylation has recently been found in embryonic stem cells and oocytes of many mammalian species
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">34</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" href="#b35">35</a>, as well as in the neuronal tissue of humans and mice
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" href="#b33">33</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" href="#b35">35</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both CpG and non-CpG methylation has been shown to negatively correlate with gene expression at TSS and in gene bodies in mouse neurons
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" href="#b33">33</a>, while hypomethylation of both CpG and non-CpG sites in gene bodies has been reported in highly expressed genes of human neurons
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" href="#b35">35</a>. Consistent with these results, both CpG and non-CpG methylation were negatively correlated with gene expression within gene bodies and at TSS in the great tit brain (Spearman's rho &lt; −0.23, 
   <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;1.0 × 10
   <span class="sup">−95</span> for all comparisons, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4b,c</a>). In addition, the negative correlation between non-CpG methylation and expression was observed in the regions directly upstream and downstream of gene bodies (Spearman's rho &lt;−0.22, 
   <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;0.0001 for all comparisons, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4c</a>). Therefore, our findings now extend a potential functional role of non-CpG methylation in neuronal tissue to Aves, suggesting evolutionary conservation of this epigenetic regulation in brains.

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4e</a>). These patterns are not due to systematic differences in expression levels between sweep and non-sweep genes because the observed CpG and non-CpG methylation differences are in opposing directions. In addition, although the overall expression profiles reveal a higher proportion of non-sweep genes with no or low expression (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 4e</a>), differences seen between CpG and non-CpG methylation in sweep gene regions were also observed when comparing genes with similar expression levels (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a–d</a>). While previous studies in chickens and humans have also shown altered CpG methylation in regions under selective pressure
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" href="#b36">36</a>, it is unclear what causes the observed higher CpG and lower non-CpG methylation in great tit sweep regions. In addition, lowly methylated genes in the brain were found to evolve significantly slower in comparison with highly methylated genes as shown by differences in the rate of nonsynonymous mutations between the two groups of genes (
   <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;0.001 for all pairwise comparisons, 
   <span class="italic">U</span>-test, 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</a>). This pattern was observed for both CpG and non-CpG methylation at TSS and within gene bodies. Overall these results not only show, for the first time, conserved neuronal non-CpG methylation patterns between birds and mammals, but also extend them by showing that methylation is correlated with rates of molecular evolution, thereby suggesting an important role for DNA methylation in evolution.
