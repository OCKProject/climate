However, we know little about whether, or how, natural selection acts on cognitive traits related to social living in any species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Great tits learn socially in the wild<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, solve complex learning tasks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> and there is evidence that cognitive abilities may have important fitness implications<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. A literature survey of records of technical (for example, tool use) and opportunistic (for example, exploring novel food items) innovation spanning 803 bird species from 76 families shows that great tits are among the top avian species in terms of overall number and diversity of foraging innovations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. This suggests rapid evolution in the great tit lineage of learning and cognition-associated traits compared with many other birds, making great tits an excellent model for studying complex social-cognitive behaviour.</p><p>In addition to studies of cognitive and learning abilities of great tits<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, great tit research has contributed significantly to our general understanding of life history evolution<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, the effects of climate change on natural populations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, the allocation of resources to breeding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> including trade-offs between reproduction and immunity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, the extent and consequences of individual variation in rates of ageing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, inbreeding and inbreeding depression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, host&#x02013;parasite coevolution<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, territorial and foraging behaviour<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> and the impact of variation in personality traits on other life history characters<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. This considerable contribution of studies of great tits to our understanding of basic ecological and evolutionary processes is largely due to work on numerous long-term study systems throughout Europe.</p><p>To explore the molecular basis for learning and cognition, we developed a complete set of <italic>de novo</italic> molecular genomic tools to ascertain evidence of natural selection on genetic and epigenetic variation in great tits. Here, we test the hypothesis that learning and cognition have been important targets of selection in great tit evolution by exploring footprints of selection in the great tit genome. We find an overrepresentation of genes related to neuronal functions, learning and cognition in regions under positive selection, as well as increased CpG methylation in these regions. In addition, great tit neuronal non-CpG methylation patterns are very similar to those observed in mammals. The development of high-quality genomic resources for great tits provides tools that will allow the integration of genomics into ecological, evolutionary and behavioural research in wild populations in this important study system.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Genome sequencing, assembly and annotation</title><p>We selected a male great tit (hereafter the reference bird) from a recent captive population (four generations in captivity) in the Netherlands for genome sequencing and <italic>de novo</italic> assembly (see Methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Information</xref> for a detailed description of genome assembly and annotation). We generated a total of 114&#x02009;Gb of Illumina HiSeq sequence data; after gap-filling and removal of adaptor sequences, the assembly consisted of a total of 2,066 scaffolds with an N50 scaffold length of over 7.7&#x02009;Mb and an N50 contig length of 133&#x02009;kb. Taken together, the assembled contigs span 1.0&#x02009;Gb. We were able to assign 98&#x00025; of the assembled bases to a chromosomal location using the recently described high-density linkage map<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). The total number of chromosomes covered by the assembly is 29 with three additional linkage groups (Chr25LG1, Chr25LG2 and LGE22). The assignment of chromosomal locations to the majority of the assembly resulted in a very high quality reference genome and enabled detailed comparisons with other bird genomes. A comparison between the genomes of the great tit and zebra finch (<italic>Taeniopygia guttata</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>) showed only intra-chromosomal inversions, and not a single inter-chromosomal rearrangement, confirming high synteny in birds. For the genome annotation step, we combined RNA sequencing data from eight different tissues of the reference bird with gene models from chicken (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> and zebra finch<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. The final annotation resulted in a total of 21,057 transcripts for 13,036 high-confidence gene predictions.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Population genomics</title><p>To obtain further insight into the evolutionary genetics of the great tit, an additional 29 wild individuals from across Europe were re-sequenced at an average depth of 10 &#x000d7; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). We found very little differentiation among populations (<italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub>&#x0003c;0.02; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 3</xref>) which is in line with previous phylogenetic analyses of the spatial genetic structure of great tits in Europe using mtDNA markers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. This suggests a largely panmictic European great tit population<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Pairwise sequential Markovian coalescent analysis (PSMC)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> of the reference individual suggested a large effective population size that increased from an already large &#x0223c;2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> individuals 1 Myr ago to &#x0223c;5.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> individuals 70 Kyr ago (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). There was evidence that the expansion was interrupted by a very mild decline in population size beginning &#x0223c;110 Kyr ago, coinciding with the start of the last glacial period in Europe, followed by a quick recovery. Consistent with expectation for a population that has undergone a recent increase, there is a genome-wide excess of low-frequency variation, as indicated by negative Tajima's <italic>D</italic> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Selective sweeps</title><p>We found that several regions with reduced diversity coincide with regions of extremely negative Tajima's <italic>D</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>), indicative of recent selective sweeps. To investigate the role of recent positive selection in greater detail, we conducted a genome-wide scan for selective sweeps and identified 813 genomic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 4</xref>) compromising roughly 0.2&#x00025; of the genome. We extracted 460 genes that had human orthologues from these regions and assessed their functional importance by performing a gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. Thirteen different GO categories were overrepresented in these selected regions relative to the rest of the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 5a</xref>). Among these categories were dendrite, cognition and several other categories related to neuronal function. Therefore genes related to neuronal function are likely to have been targets of recent positive selection.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Learning and cognition</title><p>One of the striking genes presented in the learning/cognition category was early growth response protein 1 (<italic>EGR1</italic>), whose gene expression has been particularly well studied within vocal communication and social contexts in Passerines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. <italic>EGR1</italic> is one of the immediate early genes, which are known to be important in learning and memory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. In zebra finches, its expression has been shown to be correlated with song learning and practice and is social context dependent<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. To further investigate the role of <italic>EGR1</italic> in great tit evolution, we obtained additional EGR1 sequences from 45 bird species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 6</xref>). We found that rapid evolution of <italic>EGR1</italic> is specific to the tit lineage (as signified by an elevated ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rate (dN/dS)) and has occurred after the split with the nearest sequenced relative, the ground tit and that this is not a feature related to the captive nature of the reference bird (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>).

These patterns are not due to systematic differences in expression levels between sweep and non-sweep genes because the observed CpG and non-CpG methylation differences are in opposing directions. In addition, although the overall expression profiles reveal a higher proportion of non-sweep genes with no or low expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4e</xref>), differences seen between CpG and non-CpG methylation in sweep gene regions were also observed when comparing genes with similar expression levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a&#x02013;d</xref>).

Using sequence analysis of birds from a wide range of European populations, we identified selective sweep areas enriched with genes related to learning and cognition.

Flanking sequences of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) positioned on the linkage map were aligned against the assembled scaffolds using BLAT. Scaffolds that contained multiple SNP markers were then oriented and positioned on the basis of the positions of the SNP markers on the linkage map. The order of the SNP markers on the scaffolds and the linkage map were in good agreement (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Regardless of whether the Netherlands or UK map was used, the Spearman rank correlation coefficient between the linkage map marker order and the assembly marker order was 0.99 or greater for nearly all the chromosomes. Exceptions were only on microchromosomes with just a few markers, for example, linkage group 25LG22. If anything, correlation coefficients were slightly higher when the UK map was used, despite the genome assembly being performed on a Netherlands bird. This indicates that the assembly is equally applicable to other great tit populations as it is to the &#x02018;source' population. Most discrepancies between the orders on the sequence and linkage map were caused by the lower resolution of the linkage map involving SNPs that were less than 1 cM apart. Two scaffolds (22 and 28) appeared to be chimeric and were manually split between contigs Contig22.251-Contig22.250 and contigs Contig28.53-Contig28.51, respectively.

Rates of molecular evolution (dN/dS) for each gene were obtained from the one-ratio model M0 from PAML that assumes a constant <italic>&#x003c9;</italic> for the whole gene phylogeny. In addition, a site test was used to detect positive selection. Specifically, we compared the likelihoods calculated using model M8, which assumes a proportion of sites to evolve under positive selection, and model M7, which does not assume a site class with <italic>&#x003c9;</italic> exceeding one. Positive selection was inferred when the model M7 and M8 were significantly different as assessed by a likelihood-ratio test that assumes that 2&#x00394;lnL (twice the log likelihood difference) is <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> distributed with two degrees of freedom. The <italic>P</italic> values were adjusted for multiple testing (Benjamini and Hochberg) with a false discovery rate of 0.2; <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> test results for an enrichment of positively selected genes were qualitatively similar for FDRs=0.1, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 (<italic>P</italic>=2.17 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>, 3.97 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>, 2.58 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> and 2.17 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>, respectively).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>GO enrichment analyses</title><p>Human orthologues were obtained for the great tit genes by using a combination of Ensembl and Uniprot databases. In the sweep areas, orthologues were found for 460 genes. Functional relatedness of GO terms was done using the Cytoscape plugin ClueGo 2.1.4 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>). ClueGo constructs and compares networks of functionally related GO terms with kappa statistics. A two-sided hypergeometric test (enrichment/depletion) was applied with GO term fusion, network specificity was set to &#x02018;medium' and false discovery correction was carried out using the Bonferroni step-down method. We used both human (08.10.2015) and chicken gene ontologies (08.10.2015) for comparison. With human gene ontologies, we detected 13 functional groups of GO terms across all sweep areas (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 5a</xref>). These groups were largely involved in functions concerning dendrite, cytoskeleton organization, protein oligomerization, synaptic transmission, regulation of phosphatase activity, synaptic membrane and cognition. We also did a GO enrichment analysis for the positively selected genes, as defined by the PAML-based analysis, in the same way as for the sweep genes, and obtained 12 functional GO groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 5b</xref>). When using the chicken orthologues for both sweep and positively selected genes, the results were comparable but with lower significance levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 5c,d</xref>) because the chicken genes were not as well GO annotated as the human ones.</p><p>To further confirm our GO enrichment results, we randomly selected 50 sets of genes from outside the sweep area, each containing &#x0223c;460 genes (the same number as in our selective sweep set), and analysed them using the same Cluego settings. We found that the GO term groups significantly enriched in our selective sweep set appeared no more than three times except for phosphatidylinositol-mediated signalling GO group which appeared seven times. This additional analysis further supports the robustness of our results.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Test of accelerated evolution in great tit <italic>EGR1</italic></title><p>We used BLAST to obtain orthologous sequences of the <italic>EGR1</italic> gene from 45 additional bird species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> downloaded from Ensembl version 75 or from Gigascience (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gigadb.org/dataset/101000">http://gigadb.org/dataset/101000</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>, detailed species list provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 6</xref>) to test whether there was additional evidence for the action of positive selection during the evolution of <italic>EGR1</italic> in birds. Pairwise dN/dS rates revealed that there is a substantial increase in dN/dS between great tit and ground tit relative to other pairwise values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>, upper panel). We also tested whether the increased fixations are unique to the captive reference bird by using variable positions from the 29 re-sequenced birds, the reference bird and the ground tit genome and found no evidence for this (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref> lower panel).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Brain gene expression</title><p>To compare expression levels and methylation in the brain, 200,793,186 trimmed paired-end reads from the brain were aligned against the assembled genome using Tophat version v2.0.10 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>; Bowtie v2.1.0 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>)) with the same settings as described above, except that multiple hits were prefiltered against the genome (-M option) and the reads were first aligned against the final annotation (-G option). The brain Tophat alignment was analysed with Cufflinks v2.2.0 using the same settings as above, except that the annotation was also included (-g option). Expression levels of brain genes were extracted from the Cufflinks output.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Methylation analysis</title><p>Blood and brain DNA libraries were constructed according to the Epitect whole-genome bisulfite sequencing workflow (Illumina) with 18 PCR cycles. Whole-genome sequencing data were generated using the Illumina HiSeq 2,500 platform at Business Unit Bioscience, Wageningen UR. The number of paired-end reads (101&#x02009;bp) were 358M and 292M for the brain and the blood, respectively. Raw sequencing reads were trimmed for quality (&#x02a7e;20) and adaptor sequence using trim_galore v.0.1.4 (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/</ext-link>). The methylation data has been submitted to NCBI with accession numbers SRR2070790 and SRR2070791 for the brain and the blood, respectively. Trimmed sequences were aligned to the reference genome using BSseeker2 v2.0.6 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>) with Bowtie2 v.2.1.0 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>) in the local alignment mode. A total, 97.63&#x00025; and 99.93&#x00025; of the genome was covered to an average depth of 31.88 &#x000d7; and 33.04 &#x000d7; in brain and blood, respectively. Methylation levels for each site were determined using the BSseeker2 methylation call script. All the analyses were done using sites covered by a minimum of 10 reads in both the samples. Only genes found to be 1:1:1 orthologues with chicken and zebra finch were used for methylation analysis. Gene bodies (annotated gene boundaries excluding the 5&#x02032; 5&#x00025; of genes) and TSS (300&#x02009;bp upstream to 50&#x02009;bp downstream of the annotated starting position of each gene) for which we had information from at least 50&#x00025; of the potential methylation sites were used in the dN/dS and expression correlation analysis. Average methylation levels for TSS and gene bodies were calculated for each individual gene. The upper (highly methylated) and lower (lowly methylated) quartiles were compared for differences in their evolutionary rates (dN/dS) using a Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test. Correlations between the average methylation level of a given region (TSS or gene body) per gene with expression were performed using Spearman's rank correlation. A sliding window approach was used to infer differences in methylation levels between sweep and non-sweep gene regions. Non-sweep genes located on scaffolds were not included in the analysis, as these regions were not tested for sweeps. For this, genes were divided into different regions: the gene body (described above), 10&#x02009;kb upstream and 10&#x02009;kb downstream of the gene body and the TSS region (described above). Each gene body was subdivided into 40 bins, with the length of each bin therefore depending on the length of the gene. We calculated the mean methylation levels of these 40 bins with an overlap between neighbouring bins of 250&#x02009;bp. Upstream and downstream regions were divided into bins of exactly 250&#x02009;bp with an overlap of 125&#x02009;bp between consecutive bins.</p><p>To compare TSS methylation between sweep and non-sweep genes, we conducted a <italic>t</italic>-test with equal variance assumed. Only TSS regions with a minimum of 10 covered sites were used for comparative analysis. To compare methylation levels between sweep and non-sweep genes for other gene regions, we conducted LMM analyses with methylation level as the dependent variable, sweep (yes or no) as a fixed factor and bin as a random factor. A likelihood-ratio test was conducted comparing the model with and without sweep as a fixed factor. All criteria were met for conducting parametric analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article:</bold> Laine, V.
