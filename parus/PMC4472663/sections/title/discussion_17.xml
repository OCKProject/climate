 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study shows differences between rural and urban areas in the number of individuals, the whole assemblage, as well as in the densities of particular species in winter. However, our results do not seem as well supported as those described in many studies during the breeding season [
  <a rid="pone.0130299.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref016">16</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0130299.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref017">17</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0130299.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref041">41</a>]. Indeed, among our summary variables, we only detected statistical significance for the number of individuals, which, on average, was more than twice as high in urban than in rural areas. Species diversity was also higher in urban areas. However, for individual species there were strong preferences between rural and urban environments in winter, which is probably not related to urbanization 
  <span class="italic">per se</span>, but to food availability, microhabitat preferences, and direct and indirect human activity [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recently, many studies have indicated that rural and urban populations of birds differ from one another [
  <a rid="pone.0130299.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref008">8</a>]). The main finding of our study, i.e. differences in the density of particular species, also supports this view. However, the factors affecting wintering bird communities were related not only to the main environment difference (urban 
  <span class="italic">vs</span>. rural), but also to other variables. For example, our study clearly revealed that longitude, human population size and bird feeders have an important impact on wintering birds. The importance of these variables for birds, mostly during the breeding season, has been already identified (e.g. [
  <a rid="pone.0130299.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref002">2</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0130299.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref008">8</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0130299.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref009">9</a>]). Areas located in western Poland had a significantly higher abundance of some species than those in the eastern part of the country. This is not surprising, because in western Poland the winter climate is characterized by higher temperature and lower snow cover [
  <a rid="pone.0130299.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref020">20</a>]. Both these factors generally positively affect wintering bird species [
  <a rid="pone.0130299.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref012">12</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0130299.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref016">16</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0130299.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref042">42</a>]. However, our results indicated that longitude had a stronger effect on some bird species in rural areas. For example, for Rooks and Jackdaws longitude negatively affected abundance, however the effect was greater in rural areas indicating that urban areas buffer against harsh winter climate mediated by geographical location. Thus, it is possible that urban environments located within colder areas are an especially good wintering habitat for birds and, consequently, urbanization processes may be especially rapid in towns and cities located in cold climates. The effect of human population size also positively influenced some birds, such as Eurasian Greenfinch and Magpie. A statistically significant interaction between this variable and environment type indicated that the positive effect of human population size was stronger in urban areas, suggesting dependence of bird populations on human-related resources in urban environment. The dependence of some species on human resources was also detected as a positive relationship between the number of bird feeders and bird abundance, e.g. in Eurasian Greenfinch or Eurasian Collared Dove.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The significant difference between early (December) and late (January) winter may be important in understanding changes in wintering bird communities. These changes are probably related to large geographical bird movements due to winter severity [
  <a rid="pone.0130299.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref023">23</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0130299.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref043">43</a>], because differences between environments are similar, as indicated by the non-significance of the interaction term in analyses. Results also indicate that birds in midwinter move closer to humans, both in cities and villages, because access to food is easier there, especially during snowy days [
  <a rid="pone.0130299.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref023">23</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0130299.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref041">41</a>,

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results indicate that habitat variables are also important for the diversity of wintering species. To the best of our knowledge there are only a few large scale studies of birds wintering in rural and urban environments [
  <a rid="pone.0130299.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref044">44</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0130299.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref045">45</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0130299.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref046">46</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0130299.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref047">47</a>]. Studies in Finland [
  <a rid="pone.0130299.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref013">13</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0130299.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref014">14</a>] showed that residential areas had higher densities of birds during winter than areas occupied by other types of development, roads and open grassland, but generally those authors underlined the importance of cities to wintering birds under the harsh winter conditions in Finland. On the other hand, a negative effect of urban areas on the density and number of bird species in adjacent rural areas has been shown [
  <a rid="pone.0130299.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref048">48</a>]. One potential explanation is that birds used urban areas for wintering and therefore avoided rural habitats in winter. For particular species, other traits of the study squares were also important, such as amenity grass (with a positive effect for some species), mainly used as a foraging place for birds, especially in bigger agglomerations [
  <a rid="pone.0130299.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref023">23</a>]. Interestingly, our study suggests that urban areas may be important for many bird groups including seed-eating passerines and insectivores. Considering the strong decline of many common farmland birds in Europe, including sedentary species [
  <a rid="pone.0130299.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref049">49</a>], it is of interest to note that not only rural habitats, including villages and small farms, but also urban areas may be one of the key habitats providing refuge and food resources, and, eventually may improve the winter survival of some farmland species [
  <a rid="pone.0130299.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref018">18</a>,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As in every large-scale study our methodology has some issues that must be taken into account when interpreting results. Time spent on bird counting was long and pseudoreplication might have played a role. However, birds were noted on maps and carefully watched to avoid counting the same individuals more than once. Moreover, the generally low number of species allowed individual birds to be followed. On the other hand, if the duration of observation had been shorter, then problems in species detectability would have been more serious.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found that detectability corrections played a role in analyses and interpretation of findings. The analysis of differences between uncorrected and corrected numbers of species revealed that observers usually detected, on average, one or two more species in the urban environment than in the rural one. It must also be stressed that for some species we were not able to calculate detectability due to their low numbers. This, however, should not affect inter-environment and inter-survey (December-January) analyses since these rarer species did not contribute much to total abundance.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, we have shown that winter density and species diversity of birds differs between urban and rural areas, and that preferences for the two types of environment exist. Obviously those preferences appear to be highly species-specific, but in both environments birds are responding to environmental variables, such as habitat cover and geographic location (longitude) and human related food resources.</p>
