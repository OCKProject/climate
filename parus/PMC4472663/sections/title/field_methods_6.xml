 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Birds were counted twice in the winter of 2012/2013: firstly in December 2012 and repeated in January 2013. At this time of year, only truly wintering birds occur in Poland. As stated above, counts were carried out within three 0.25 km2 squares (500 × 500 m) in each of the urban areas, and in three 0.25 km2 squares within the neighbouring rural area, with surveys paired in time as closely as possible. The order of recording rural and urban squares was chosen randomly by observers. Birds were surveyed during favourable weather conditions (no snowfall or rain, wind below 4 m s-1) between 8:00 and 13:00. Single observers, with at least 10 years’ experience in counting wintering birds, walked in a 
  <span class="italic">zig-zag</span> pattern in order to cover the entire square visually and to note bird vocalizations [
  <a rid="pone.0130299.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref013">13</a>]. The duration of the survey was 
  <span class="italic">ca</span> 2 hours for each square. Only birds exhibiting resting or foraging behaviour were included in the analysis. Hence, for example, high flying gulls, geese and corvids were ignored. The survey time ensured that birds were mainly foraging, and flights were rare. In some species, flights occurred between foraging and roosting places, however these occur mainly in the early morning and late afternoon and are thus outside the period devoted to fieldwork.
