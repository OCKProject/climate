  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the same methods, we recorded wintering birds in 26 towns and cities (hereafter called urban areas), each paired with a nearby rural area, across Poland (
   <a rid="pone.0130299.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0130299.g001">Fig 1</a>; for more details see 
   <a rid="pone.0130299.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0130299.s006">S1 Table</a>). The study areas were chosen to cover all of Poland and span the entire Polish winter climate. Within each urban and rural area there were three square plots (25 ha) where birds were surveyed. Thus, the total number of squares was 156. The distance between paired rural and urban squares was 1–12 km. The benefit of this approach is that paired rural and urban study squares were characterised, as far as is practical, by similar climatic conditions. Squares were classified as urban or rural based on two criteria which both had to be met: (1) local authority designated as urban or rural (land management and policy in cities differs from that in rural districts); (2) squares in both environments had to include built up areas. For example, squares consisting only of arable land in urban local authorities were not considered. On average, each observer surveyed 1.81 ± 0.17 SE paired areas (range: 1–3), and all paired squares (urban-rural) were always visited by the same observer.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Birds were counted twice in the winter of 2012/2013: firstly in December 2012 and repeated in January 2013. At this time of year, only truly wintering birds occur in Poland. As stated above, counts were carried out within three 0.25 km2 squares (500 × 500 m) in each of the urban areas, and in three 0.25 km2 squares within the neighbouring rural area, with surveys paired in time as closely as possible. The order of recording rural and urban squares was chosen randomly by observers. Birds were surveyed during favourable weather conditions (no snowfall or rain, wind below 4 m s-1) between 8:00 and 13:00. Single observers, with at least 10 years’ experience in counting wintering birds, walked in a 
    <span class="italic">zig-zag</span> pattern in order to cover the entire square visually and to note bird vocalizations [
    <a rid="pone.0130299.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref013">13</a>]. The duration of the survey was 
    <span class="italic">ca</span> 2 hours for each square. Only birds exhibiting resting or foraging behaviour were included in the analysis. Hence, for example, high flying gulls, geese and corvids were ignored. The survey time ensured that birds were mainly foraging, and flights were rare. In some species, flights occurred between foraging and roosting places, however these occur mainly in the early morning and late afternoon and are thus outside the period devoted to fieldwork.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cover variables were calculated with ImageJ software from detailed maps and aerial photos of the studied squares or directly in the field using a GPS. We used high resolution images, freely available from the National Data Base Geoportal (
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://maps.geoportal.gov.pl/webclient/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://maps.geoportal.gov.pl/webclient/</span>). Basic characteristics of the investigated urban areas are summarised in

   <a rid="pone.0130299.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0130299.g001">Fig 1</a>. For each square the total number (richness) of species, total number of birds (abundance) and Gini-Simpson Index of Diversity [
   <a rid="pone.0130299.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref022">22</a>]) were calculated. The Gini-Simpson index gives the probability that two randomly chosen birds (individuals) from a community are not the same species. Thus, the higher values of this index the more diverse the community is. The index was moderately correlated with species richness (Spearman rs = 0.455, P&lt;0.001, n = 312) but not with number of birds (Spearman rs = -0.072, P = 0.206, n = 312) which justified its use in the analyses.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although detectability of species and of individuals in winter is relatively high [
   <a rid="pone.0130299.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref023">23</a>,

   <a rid="pone.0130299.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref025">25</a>], we also calculated the number of species and number of birds corrected for imperfect detection. The problem of detectability of species in our analyses was solved by using probabilistic methods for correcting species richness known as the Chao1 bias-corrected estimator of species richness [
   <a rid="pone.0130299.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref026">26</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0130299.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref027">27</a>]. Chao’s estimator is commonly used in ecological science and it was derived from the observation that rare species are undetectable because they are represented mostly by single individuals (singletons) or two individuals (doubletons). The formal equation for this index is: E(
   <span class="italic">S</span>) = 
   <span class="italic">S</span>obs+ 
   <span class="italic">n</span>1(
   <span class="italic">n</span>1-1)/ 2(

   <span class="italic">S</span>obs is the observed number of species, 
   <span class="italic">n</span>1 is the number of singleton species, and

   <a rid="pone.0130299.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref026">26</a>]. A simulation study showed the superior performance (lower bias, higher precision and accuracy) of this index over many parametric methods (e.g. rarefaction curves) [
   <a rid="pone.0130299.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref028">28</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The corrected number of species in a square was calculated for each survey month separately in Spade software [
   <a rid="pone.0130299.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref029">29</a>]. Then, to estimate the detectability of species we subtracted the recorded number of species from the estimated number of species for each square. This estimate indicates how many species remained undetected in a square and thus may be used to compare differences in species detectability between environments, months, and observers. The difference between observed and estimated numbers of species was analysed with generalized linear mixed models (see below).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used two methods, proposed by Royle [
   <a rid="pone.0130299.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref030">30</a>] and by Kendall et al. [
   <a rid="pone.0130299.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref031">31</a>] and implemented in the Presence 6.1. software [
   <a rid="pone.0130299.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref032">32</a>], to correct for imperfect detection of individuals. The Royle estimator [
   <a rid="pone.0130299.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref030">30</a>] (contrary to many other methods based on presence-absence data and devoted to calculation of detectability) directly takes the number of individuals into account. However, the method assumes the population is closed, which might not be entirely true in winter. Violation of this assumption causes the estimated detection probability to be always lower than in reality and leads to excessive estimation of abundance, although this should still correctly represent differences between environments. In order to validate the Royle estimator, the unbiased estimator of detectability proposed by Kendall [
   <a rid="pone.0130299.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref031">31</a>] was used. This method relaxes the closure assumption within a season by permitting staggered entry and exit times for the species of interest at each site (square). However, this method requires at least three surveys to estimate confidence intervals but we were only able to perform two surveys (December and January). Thus, we calculated the correlation coefficient between Royle and Kendall estimators which was statistically significant (
   <a rid="pone.0130299.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0130299.s001">S1 Fig</a>). Moreover, we validated the Royle estimator by plotting species-estimates of detectability against their body sizes (= body length). Detectability is usually positively related to body size [
   <a rid="pone.0130299.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0130299.ref033">33</a>] and we found that this was also the case in our study (
   <a rid="pone.0130299.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0130299.s002">S2 Fig</a>). Thus, we used the Royle estimator to correct abundances for imperfect detection in our data.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The detection probabilities of species and individuals were calculated for each environment and survey (December and January) separately. We conducted and present two sets of analyses—with and without corrections for detectability. Although corrected and uncorrected data were significantly correlated (

   <a rid="pone.0130299.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0130299.s004">S4</a> Figs) the results of statistical analyses were different. Therefore, we present only results based on corrected data.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before formal testing of the effects of environmental variables on species richness, abundance and diversity index we had to perform data reduction. Since there were seven habitat composition variables which were correlated with each other (
   <a rid="pone.0130299.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0130299.s007">S2 Table</a>), we used Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to calculate a reduced number of independent variables. We included longitude and latitude as supplementary variables in PCA to obtain ordination scores of environmental variables which were not correlated with geographical coordinates. The first two principal components explained 54% of the variability in habitat cover variables (

The first principal component (PCA1, eigenvalue = 1.952) was associated with a gradient from built up areas to open agricultural habitats. The second principal component (PCA2, eigenvalue = 1.190) described a gradient from semi-natural grasslands to intensively managed amenity grasses (

Two variables: environment type (urban/rural) and month (December/January) and their interaction were fixed categorical factors. Number of bird feeders, human population size, longitude, latitude, PCA1 and PCA2 scores (described above) were covariates. Interaction terms between environment type and covariates were also included in GLMMs to test for a different response of dependent variables to covariates in the two environments.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observer identity, urban area pairing and square identity were random blocking factors in the GLMMs. Square identity was nested in urban-rural area pair.

Interaction terms between the environment type and covariates were also included. Random factors were the same as described above. When analysing these species we encountered right-skewed distributions which are typical for count data with zeros. Thus, for species with excess zero counts we fitted a GLMM with a negative binomial error and logarithmic link function. The choice of Gaussian or negative binomial error variance was determined by examining AICc scores and the model with the lowest AICc was chosen [

We used DCA because most ordination methods suffer from two major problems: the arch effect (caused by unimodal species response curves) and compression of the ends of the environmental gradient. Because of the first problem, the second ordination axis is an artefact and cannot be interpreted. The second problem is that the spacing of species (or samples) along the first axis is not necessarily related to the amount of change along the primary gradient. DCA overcomes these problems by dividing the first axis into segments, and rescales each segment to have mean value of zero on the second axis—this effectively compresses the curve to become flat. It also rescales the axis so that the ends are no longer compressed relative to the middle [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our analyses we performed multiple tests. However, we did not apply corrections for multiple testing. There are two basic reasons for this decision. First, we tested hypotheses on different species and obviously each species has a unique life-history and different biology. Therefore, there is no reason to assume that species responses would behave as random statistical processes. Secondly, the number of species tested was high, thus if the correction for multiple tests had been applied then one would not have been able to effectively test any hypothesis (for example with 50 species tested the Bonferroni corrected critical p value is 0.001 which means that tests are unfeasible and interpretation impossible). This problem has been discussed in many papers and the pitfalls of using such corrections are discussed in a paper by Garcia [

However, we provide information in the text and tables about corrected critical p-values for each set of tested hypotheses after using the Benjamini-Hochberg method for false discovery rates in multiple statistical tests [
