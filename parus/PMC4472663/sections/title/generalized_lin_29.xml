Explanation of variable codes: Month—month of survey (December vs. January), Environment—type of environment (urban vs. rural), Longitude—geographical longitude, Latitude—geographical latitude, PCA1—a first principal component of environmental variables describing the increasing cover of open agricultural habitats, PCA2—a second principal component of environmental variables describing the gradient from natural grasslands (meadows) to intensively managed amenity grassland, Feeders—number of bird feeders in a square plot, CitySize—human population size in the city. The best models are emboldened.
