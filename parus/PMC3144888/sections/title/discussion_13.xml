 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used currently available large-scale datasets of avian COI sequences to compare diversification patterns at a continental scale in different biogeographic regions, an endeavour which extends the use of barcodes beyond species identification and taxonomy.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analysis suggests that avian species are older in the southern Neotropics than in the Nearctic, as evidenced by average genetic distances between pairs of closely related species, the distribution of these distances, and the proportion of very recently diverged pairs of species - a trend shown both by nearest congeneric neighbours and sister species. This result supports the conclusion that Pleistocene glacial cycles had more pronounced effects in the Nearctic (particularly in boreal North America) than in the Neotropics, isolating populations and promoting vicariant speciation

  <a rid="pone.0020744-Hewitt1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Hewitt1">[20]</a>-
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Lovette1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Lovette1">[25]</a>. In turn, this result also supports analyses that indicate that recent speciation rates are lower in the Neotropics than in the Nearctic 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Weir2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Weir2">[23]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Weir3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Weir3">[26]</a>, a pattern opposite to that expected under the prevailing view of higher recent speciation rates at low latitudes 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Mittelbach1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Mittelbach1">[2]</a> and to the predictions of the refuge paradigm. The finding of similar patterns in the Palearctic and the Southern Cone of South America is consistent with a milder effect of Pleistocene glaciations in the Palearctic than in the Nearctic.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Apart from allowing relative comparisons of the age of species among regions, the divergence values of COI between sister species can be used to estimate absolute species ages. However, this requires knowledge of the evolutionary rate of COI and formal calibrations of this gene have not yet been performed. Calibrations of avian mitochondrial DNA have relied mainly on cytochrome 
  <span class="italic">b</span>
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Lovette2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Lovette2">[84]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Weir5" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Weir5">[85]</a>, for which a molecular rate of approximately 2.1% per million years has been shown to be relatively conserved 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Weir5" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Weir5">[85]</a>. COI has been suggested to evolve more slowly than cytochrome 
  <span class="italic">b</span> in birds 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Aliabadian1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Aliabadian1">[86]</a> and there is also evidence for variation in its molecular rate across taxa 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Tavares1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Tavares1">[82]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Pereira1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Pereira1">[87]</a>. We performed a calibration of COI relative to cytochrome 
  <span class="italic">b</span> for the pairs of sister species included in our datasets by downloading cytochrome 
  <span class="italic">b</span> sequences from GenBank. There were sequences for both members of a species pair for 51 of the 71 pairs identified in our study (33 from the Nearctic, 10 from the Palearctic, and 7 from Argentina). Divergence in cytochrome 
  <span class="italic">b</span> was determined between each sister species pair (using the K2P model) and compared to our previous results for COI. This estimation indicated that COI appears to evolve 35% slower than cytochrome 
  <span class="italic">b</span> in this set of sister species, a result almost identical to that of Aliabadian et al. 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Aliabadian1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Aliabadian1">[86]</a> for intrageneric comparisons. If the evolutionary rate of 2.1% per million years of cytochrome 
  <span class="italic">b</span> is considered, this result indicates that COI molecular rate is about 1.4% per million years.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because sequence distance in about 30% of sister species pairs in the dataset from the Nearctic is less than 1%, the application of the molecular clock discussed above implies that speciation events that led to almost one third of avian sister species pairs in this region occurred in the last 700,000 years (mid to late Pleistocene). By contrast, considerably fewer southern Neotropic and Palearctic sister species pairs appear to have diverged so recently (about 15% and 10%, respectively). Only 13 and 11 sister species pairs were considered in the datasets for the Neotropics and the Palearctic, respectively, and likely as a consequence of this the differences between regions were not statistically significant (only the difference between the Palearctic and the Nearctic was marginally significant). However, the comparison of nearest congeneric neighbours, which included many more pairs of species from these regions (89 in the case of the southern Neotropics and 93 in the case of the Palearctic), also showed nearly three times as many species pairs with less than 1% divergence in the Nearctic than in the other two regions and the differences were statistically significant. It should be borne in mind that even though nearest congeneric distances could decrease as the datasets from the southern Neotropics and the Palearctic continue to be populated, this effect is not likely to be very pronounced. This is because some groups or clades in these datasets are fairly well represented while others are missing almost entirely; thus, fewer pairs of species are erroneously considered as nearest neighbours than would be if unsampled species were evenly distributed among groups or clades.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the other extreme, almost half of sister species pairs (22 of 47) diverge by more than 2.8% in the Nearctic, implying that the origin of about half of extant Nearctic sister species could be traced to the Pliocene. In the southern Neotropics, however, almost 70% of sister species appear to have originated in the Pliocene (9 of 13 sister species pairs, including the case of the pair 
  <span class="italic">Tinamotis ingoufi</span> - 
  <span class="italic">T. pentlandii,</span> which diverge by more than 16% and thus probably split before the Pliocene) and more than 90% in the Palearctic (10 of 11 sister species). This shows that not only the percentage of species that have originated very recently is higher in the Nearctic, but that the proportion of species originated throughout the entire Pleistocene appears to be higher in this region.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Levels of intraspecific diversification appear similar in the Nearctic and the southern Neotropics, as reflected both in the average intraspecific distance and the proportion of species with high variation. This result was unexpected because it is commonly assumed that a much higher percentage of species in the Neotropics are variable or possess geographic structuring than in North America. In the Palearctic, average intraspecific variation considering all species was higher than in the New World. However, when the relatively high proportion of highly variable species in this region was excluded, intraspecific variation was similar to that of the Americas. The higher proportion of variable species in the Palearctic could partially reflect its much larger area (about 46 million km
  <span class="sup">2</span>; 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Newton1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Newton1">[3]</a>) compared to that of the Nearctic (18.2 million km
  <span class="sup">2</span>; 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Newton1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Newton1">[3]</a>) and Argentina (about 3 million km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) or the inclusion of a higher proportion of the range of the species of this dataset in comparison with the Americas (particularly in the southern Neotropics, where Argentina represents only a relatively small portion of the distribution range of many species). Nevertheless, the heterogeneous advance of the ice in the Palearctic during the Pleistocene 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Newton1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Newton1">[3]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Hewitt1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Hewitt1">[20]</a>, the variable topography of southern Europe 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Hewitt2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Hewitt2">[24]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Hewitt3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Hewitt3">[88]</a> and the pronounced fragmentation of forests in Eurasia during glacial maxima 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Newton1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Newton1">[3]</a> could also explain the presence of geographic structure in a higher proportion of Palearctic bird species.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The detailed analysis of geographic patterns of lineages in species with high variation showed marked differences in complexity among regions. In the Nearctic, almost all variable species showed eastern and western lineages, a pattern already reported in birds 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Weir2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Weir2">[23]</a> and mammals 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Rowe1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Rowe1">[46]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Wooding1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Wooding1">[89]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Runck1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Runck1">[90]</a> that is consistent with population expansions from glacial refugia in the margins of North America. The eastern and western portions of the Nearctic probably acted as refugia during the early and mid Pleistocene, but were later covered by ice 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Weir2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Weir2">[23]</a>. This is consistent with the fact that the eastern and western lineages within species typically show more than 1.5% divergence at COI. In the Palearctic three patterns were found, all previously reported in birds and other groups of animals, and interpreted at least partially as evidence of range expansion from refugia after the retreat of the ice or permafrost that covered much of the northern portion of Eurasia 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Hewitt2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Hewitt2">[24]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Zink3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Zink3">[48]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Hewitt3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Hewitt3">[88]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Zink4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Zink4">[91]</a>. Finally, in the Neotropics several patterns were found and they appear to reflect various sources of diversification, including the Andes Mountains. These differences once again support the conclusion of a major effect of Pleistocene glaciations in the Nearctic, a less marked and more heterogeneous effect in the Palearctic and an even milder effect in the southern Neotropics, where other diversification processes may have been as relevant in shaping current diversity.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Focusing on the New World, in spite of the more complex geographic patterns of divergent intraspecific lineages in the southern Neotropics versus the Nearctic, both regions showed similar levels of intraspecific variation. Considered jointly, these results suggest that even though diversification processes are more complex in the southern Neotropics, this difference does not generate diversification in a much higher percentage of species. This is not only unexpected because of the aforementioned tendency to assume that there are more variable species in the Neotropics 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Mil1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Mil1">[21]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Lessa1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Lessa1">[22]</a>, but also because of the diversity of factors that appear involved as diversifying agents (including the Andes Mountains 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Weir1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Weir1">[14]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Cracraft2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Cracraft2">[17]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Haffer2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Haffer2">[29]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Sedano1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Sedano1">[35]</a>, large rivers 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Capparella1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Capparella1">[36]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Capparella2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Capparella2">[37]</a> and marine incursions 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Nores1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Nores1">[38]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Nores2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Nores2">[39]</a>), some of which were in fact reflected in the various patterns of geographic distribution of lineages found.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, the comparative analysis of the COI dataset for the birds of Argentina (the first large scale dataset of barcodes of Neotropical vertebrates) with those for the Nearctic and Palearctic has provided information about avian patterns of diversification at a continental scale, including information on the understudied Southern Cone of South America. Once barcoding projects generate large-scale datasets in more tropical areas of the continent it will be possible to evaluate whether the patterns found are representative of the whole Neotropical region. The recent establishment of large-scale barcoding projects in other South American countries (such as Bolivia) will contribute with this objective. In fact, preliminary analysis of the Argentine dataset in combination with recent results from Bolivia detected a higher proportion of bird species with deeply divergent lineages (unpublished data), a pattern that could be related to both the inclusion of more tropical areas and to better coverage of species' ranges. The assessment of this emerging trend will not have to wait for long if barcoding surveys continue at the current pace.</p>
