 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has long been recognized that diversity is richer in tropical biotas than in their temperate, high latitude counterparts 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Hillebrand1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Hillebrand1">[1]</a>. However, the cause of this latitudinal diversity gradient has been the subject of much discussion (for a review see 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Mittelbach1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Mittelbach1">[2]</a>). In the case of birds, this pattern is very clear in the Americas because avian diversity is particularly high in the Neotropics, which is home to 3,370 breeding landbird species (more than one third of the global avifauna), and comparatively low in the Nearctic (732 breeding species) 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Newton1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Newton1">[3]</a>. Traditional explanations centred on the temporal stability of tropical environments, which would result in lower extinction rates and an accumulation of species 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Wallace1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Wallace1">[4]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Fischer1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Fischer1">[5]</a>. However, evidence of Neotropical climate and habitat change during the late Pliocene and the Pleistocene glacial cycles has led to the refuge hypothesis, which posits that the fragmentation of populations into refugia resulted in increased speciation rates during this period and the consequently high Neotropical diversity seen today 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Haffer1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Haffer1">[6]</a>. This theory, which is actually only one of several explanations invoking higher speciation rates in tropical regions 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Mittelbach1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Mittelbach1">[2]</a>, soon became the accepted paradigm for the interpretation of avian diversity patterns, not only in the Neotropics but also in the Nearctic and other biogeographic regions. In contrast to the stability hypothesis, which predicts that species in regions with high biodiversity should be older than those in low diversity regions, the refuge hypothesis (as well as other explanations invoking higher recent speciation rates in the tropics) has the corollary that species should be younger in high diversity regions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Debate on the timing of avian speciation and the role of Pleistocene glacial cycles has gained renewed vigour as molecular analyses have provided data on genetic divergence, enabling estimates of species ages 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Zink1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Zink1">[7]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Rull1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Rull1">[15]</a> (note that criticism of the refuge hypothesis in relation to Neotropical diversification have also stemmed from biogeographical studies 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Cracraft1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Cracraft1">[16]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Cracraft2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Cracraft2">[17]</a> and other disciplines, such as palaeoecology 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Colinvaux1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Colinvaux1">[18]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Bush1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Bush1">[19]</a>). This debate has led to an integrated, continental-scale picture of the diversification processes when patterns were analyzed in relation to latitude 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Newton1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Newton1">[3]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Hewitt1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Hewitt1">[20]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Lovette1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Lovette1">[25]</a>. In the Nearctic, and particularly in northern regions, Pleistocene glacial cycles appear to have been the main force shaping current diversity, reflecting the role of ice sheets in isolating populations and often provoking vicariant speciation 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Newton1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Newton1">[3]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Weir2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Weir2">[23]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Lovette1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Lovette1">[25]</a>. As a consequence, many boreal species (including birds but also other groups such as mammals) show reduced genetic variation and limited phylogeographic structuring due to their recent expansion from glacial refugia 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Hewitt1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Hewitt1">[20]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Lessa1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Lessa1">[22]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Hewitt2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Hewitt2">[24]</a>. By contrast, Pleistocene glacial cycles had lesser impacts in the southern regions of North America and even less so in the low latitude areas of the Neotropics. Although they promoted diversification in these regions, they generated fewer speciation events than in the boreal region of the Nearctic 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Newton1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Newton1">[3]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Avise1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Avise1">[9]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Weir2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Weir2">[23]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Lovette1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Lovette1">[25]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reflecting this situation, it has been recently proposed that speciation rates in New World birds and mammals are lowest near the equator and increase with latitude 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Weir2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Weir2">[23]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Weir3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Weir3">[26]</a>. Consistent with this notion, recent studies have shown that rates of phenotypic evolution (such as avian colour patterns 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Martin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Martin1">[27]</a> and vocalizations 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Weir4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Weir4">[28]</a>) are faster at higher latitudes. According to this hypothesis, the higher biodiversity in the tropics can be explained by an even steeper increase in extinction rates with latitude, which would cause a higher net rate of diversification at lower latitudes 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Weir3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Weir3">[26]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to the effects of glacial cycles, or in some cases in combination with them, other geological factors are thought to have impacted avian diversity in the Neotropics. The Andes Mountains are a barrier to gene flow between populations occurring on alternate sides of the range (or between populations at high and low elevations) and also promote diversification of highland taxa 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Weir1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Weir1">[14]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Cracraft2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Cracraft2">[17]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Haffer2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Haffer2">[29]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Sedano1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Sedano1">[35]</a>. Other factors that are thought to promote diversification include river barriers (especially in the Amazonian region 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Capparella1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Capparella1">[36]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Capparella2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Capparella2">[37]</a>) and marine incursions during interglacial periods in the Pliocene and Pleistocene 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Nores1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Nores1">[38]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Nores2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Nores2">[39]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Current understanding of diversification in the Americas is based mainly on studies of North American taxa and to a lesser extent the tropical and subtropical regions of the Neotropics 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Beheregaray1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Beheregaray1">[40]</a>. Much less is known about species diversification in the Southern Cone of South America (i.e. the area comprised by Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, southern Paraguay, and extreme south-eastern Brazil). This area is of particular interest because it shares certain characteristics with the Nearctic, including climate and greater exposure to glacial cycles 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Heusser1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Heusser1">[41]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-RabasaJ1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-RabasaJ1">[42]</a>, but in other aspects resembles the low latitude portion of the Neotropics, including exposure to diversification agents such as the Andes Mountains and marine incursions and the presence of many lineages of birds that are shared with the whole Neotropical region. Concordantly, recent analyses performed on mammals in this region have shown a similar but more complex pattern than that in North America. High latitude populations tend to exhibit signs of recent expansions following Pleistocene glacial retreats and populations at lower latitudes appear to be more stable 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Himes1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Himes1">[43]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Poljak1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Poljak1">[45]</a>, but in a considerable proportion of Patagonian species high latitude populations show phylogeographic structuring that has originated 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span>
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Lessa2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Lessa2">[44]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Palearctic was also strongly affected by glacial cycles, but with notable differences from the Nearctic. Firstly, the ice advanced south to 40°N in North America, but did not extend past 50°N in Eurasia 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Newton1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Newton1">[3]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Hewitt1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Hewitt1">[20]</a>. Additionally, although there were northern, non-glaciated refuges in both regions, including Beringia 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Newton1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Newton1">[3]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Hewitt2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Hewitt2">[24]</a>, central United States 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Rowe1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Rowe1">[46]</a> and the Carpathians 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Kotlk1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Kotlk1">[47]</a>), the advance of glacial ice sheets was more heterogeneous in the Palearctic, as evidenced by the fact that Europe and western Asia were much more affected than eastern Asia 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Newton1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Newton1">[3]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Hewitt1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Hewitt1">[20]</a>. Finally, fragmentation of forest habitat was far more pronounced in the Palearctic than in the Nearctic and fragments were separated by large expanses of open habitat or by interior seas 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Newton1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Newton1">[3]</a>. This more complex recent history of the Palearctic is consistent with the finding of more variable phylogeographic patterns in Eurasian than in North American birds (e.g. 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Zink3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Zink3">[48]</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since the inception of DNA barcoding 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Hebert1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Hebert1">[49]</a>, several studies have shown its effectiveness for species identification in a broad range of animal taxa, both in vertebrates

  <a rid="pone.0020744-Alcaide1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Alcaide1">[75]</a>. All of these applications of barcoding relate to species identification, but the growing datasets of standardized gene regions that result from barcode surveys, such as the cytochrome 
  <span class="italic">c</span> oxidase I (COI) library for animals, can also be used for other kinds of analyses, including ecological and evolutionary studies 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Craft1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Craft1">[76]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Marussich1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Marussich1">[77]</a>. Notably, DNA barcode libraries can provide useful insights into differences in speciation rates and diversification patterns at a continental scale.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The novelty of this approach lies in the fact that these datasets provide information about a standardized gene fragment spanning thousands of species over broad geographic ranges. In addition, because barcoding surveys aim for comprehensive taxonomic coverage, this approach avoids biases that might arise from the selection of specific species for analysis (which sometimes depends on availability of tissue samples), the revision of the literature, or the reliance on GenBank sequences - sequences published from phylogeographic analyses might be biased towards species with high genetic variation and strong geographic structure. Moreover, because accurate estimation of species ages requires the identification of sister species, large barcoding libraries with relatively comprehensive taxon coverage facilitate the analysis of these patterns.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have recently assembled DNA barcodes for approximately 50% of the Argentine avifauna 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Kerr2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Kerr2">[55]</a>, providing a dataset for the southern Neotropics that can be compared with an almost complete dataset for North American birds 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Kerr1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Kerr1">[54]</a> and with a partial set (approximately 50%) of Palearctic birds 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Kerr3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Kerr3">[56]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Johnsen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Johnsen1">[57]</a>. Here we analyze these COI datasets and compare the patterns of diversification among regions. This comparison contributes to the emerging picture of avian diversification at a global scale and also sheds light on the evolutionary patterns in the Southern Cone of South America.
