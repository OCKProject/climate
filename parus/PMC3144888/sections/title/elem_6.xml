 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The comparison of distances between closely related species suggested that species are older in the southern Neotropics than in the Nearctic. Average distance to the nearest congeneric neighbour was significantly higher in Argentina than in North America (6.1%±3.7% and 4.5%±3.3%, respectively; Scheffé contrast, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.004). As expected, average distance between sister species pairs was lower than that between closest congeners, but the comparison between regions showed a similar pattern to that of the nearest neighbours; distances were higher in the southern Neotropics than in North America (4.6%±4.1% and 3.2%±2.8%, respectively). Although this pattern lacks statistical support (Scheffé contrast, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.36), this is likely due to the small number of sister species in the dataset from the southern Neotropics.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The distribution of distances between nearest congeneric neighbours and between sister species can complement the overview obtained with average values. The comparison of this distribution for the nearest congeneric neighbours showed a significant difference between the southern Neotropics and the Nearctic (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020744-g001" href="#pone-0020744-g001">Figures 1A and 1B</a>, respectively; Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Z = 1.55, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.02). Distances tended to be lower in the Nearctic and the incidence of species pairs with very low divergence was significantly higher; only 6.7% of the nearest congeneric neighbours diverge by less than 1% sequence distance in Argentina, but this figure rises to 18.5% in North America (χ
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 6.39, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.01). When sister species were compared, the same pattern was obtained (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020744-g002" href="#pone-0020744-g002">Figures 2A and 2B</a>); distances were lower in the Nearctic, which in particular doubled the southern Neotropics in the proportion of species with divergences lower than 1% (15.4% in the Neotropics vs. 29.8% in the Nearctic). Although neither difference was statistically significant (difference in the distribution, Z = 0.825, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.50; proportion of species with less than 1% divergence, χ
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 1.06 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.30), this is likely due to the small number of sister species in the Argentine dataset. It should be mentioned that the higher proportion of species with very low divergence in the Nearctic could partially reflect the more intense taxonomic scrutiny of birds in this region than in the Neotropics. This could lead to more cases of narrowly divergent taxa being elevated to full species in the Nearctic. However, because the distribution of distances as a whole was significantly different between these regions, with a clear tendency of Nearctic species pairs to be less diverged (see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020744-g001" href="#pone-0020744-g001">Figures 1A, 1B</a>, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0020744-g002" href="#pone-0020744-g002">2A and 2B</a>), this taxonomic bias appears not to be the reason for this pattern.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The difference in the patterns of divergence between pairs of closely related species reinforces the conclusion that Neotropical species are older than their Nearctic counterparts. This difference also explains why DNA barcodes had higher success in species identification in the southern Neotropics than in the Nearctic (98% and 94%, respectively), because all pairs or groups of species that could not be separated through COI in North America diverged by less than 1%. Critics of DNA barcoding argued that the Neotropics would pose a challenge because of high species richness and high intraspecific divergence 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Moritz2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Moritz2">[83]</a>. Our results suggest that this is not the case. In fact, unless interspecific divergence was lower in the Neotropics there would be no reason for barcoding to fail more than in other regions. Higher intraspecific variation would lead to an increase of species flagged by barcoding as interesting for deeper analysis and hence augment its usefulness as a tool for species discovery, but would not compromise its efficiency for species identification.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Average intraspecific distances were 0.24%±0.41% in the southern Neotropics and 0.28%±0.46% in the Nearctic (Scheffé contrast, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.43), suggesting that the avifaunas in these two regions have similar (and highly variable) levels of intraspecific variation. Apart from comparing these averages, the analysis of species with high variation in each region could advance the understanding of the processes that generate diversification in the Americas. In our study of Argentina, we analyzed in detail those species that showed two or more deeply divergent haplogroups in the neighbour joining tree (diverging by at least 1.5% sequence distance and having a bootstrap support higher than 98% in all cases). In total, 5.4% of the species that were represented by multiple individuals fell on this category (21 out of 389, see 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0020744-t001" href="#pone-0020744-t001">table 1</a>). In the Nearctic dataset, 4.0% of the species were included in this group of highly variable taxa (21 out of 528, see 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0020744-t002" href="#pone-0020744-t002">Table 2</a>). This shows that the proportion of species with geographic structure and deeply divergent intraspecific lineages is similar in the two regions (the difference is not significant, χ
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 1.04, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.31).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, the patterns of diversification observed were very different in the two regions. In North America, most cases of deep intraspecific variation involved allopatric divergence between eastern and western populations, a pattern suggesting divergence in glacial refugia along the margins of the continent. The patterns in Argentina were more complex. Species with allopatric, parapatric and sympatric lineages were found and geographic patterns were diverse, including cases of eastern and western lineage differentiation, northern and southern divergence and even apparent isolation among populations at varying elevations in the Andes Mountains.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We expect that many of these divergent lineages actually constitute different species. Splits had been recommended for some of these species based on sequence analysis at other gene loci, morphology or behaviour before barcoding studies were performed, but they were treated as conspecific due to a lack of consensus on their elevation to full species (these cases and the corresponding citations are mentioned in the original articles; 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Kerr1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Kerr1">[54]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Kerr2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Kerr2">[55]</a>). In other cases, subsequent studies confirmed that divergent lineages warrant species status (e.g. 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Sann1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Sann1">[78]</a>). In this sense, the diversification patterns described above might in some cases include closely related species (usually sister species) and not intraspecific lineages, a problematic distinction often faced by studies analyzing recent speciation events 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Avise1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Avise1">[9]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Zink2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Zink2">[13]</a>. Although this complexity does not alter conclusions about diversification patterns or processes in each region, it might be more appropriate to compare average intraspecific variation without considering these highly variable taxa. In addition, both the average intraspecific distance and its variance increase considerably when this relatively small percentage of variable species is included in the calculation and might not represent the level of intraspecific variation present in most of the species of each region. These recalculations showed that when highly variable species are excluded, intraspecific distance is still slightly higher in the Nearctic (0.21%±0.23%) than in the southern Neotropics (0.16%±0.19%), but in this case the difference is significant (Scheffé contrast,
