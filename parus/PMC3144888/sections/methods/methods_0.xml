 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analyses were based on a comparison of the currently available large-scale datasets of avian DNA barcodes (COI sequences), all publicly available at the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD, 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.boldsystems.org" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.boldsystems.org</span>). These datasets correspond to the birds of: a) Argentina 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Kerr2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Kerr2">[55]</a>, available in the project “Birds of Argentina - Phase I” (project code: BARG, 1594 specimens, 500 species, 50% of the avifauna of Argentina, GenBank accession numbers: FJ027014 - FJ028607); b) North America 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Kerr1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Kerr1">[54]</a>, available in the project “Birds of North America - Phase II” (project codes: TZBNA, BNACA, BNABS and BNAUS, 2574 specimens, 643 species, 93% of the breeding and pelagic birds from the USA and Canada, GenBank accession numbers: AY666171 - AY666596, DQ432694 - DQ433261, DQ433274 - DQ433846 and DQ434243 - DQ434805), c) Eastern Palearctic 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Kerr3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Kerr3">[56]</a>, available in the project “Birds of the eastern Palearctic” (project code: BEPAL, 1674 specimens, 398 species, 42% of the Palearctic breeding landbird species, GenBank accession numbers: GQ481247 - GQ482920), and d) Scandinavia 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Johnsen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Johnsen1">[57]</a>, available in the project “Birds of Scandinavia” (project codes: NORBI and SWEBI, 957 specimens, 296 species, 32% of the Palearctic breeding landbird species, GenBank accession numbers: GU571207 - GU572163). The two latter projects were merged to obtain a single dataset for the Palearctic including 2636 specimens and 488 species (52% of the breeding landbird species of the Palearctic). We therefore used three sets of COI records, which were re-analyzed to calculate standardized measurements that facilitated direct comparisons.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some taxa that were considered single species when the aforementioned projects were originally published are now recognized as two or more species (e.g. 
  <span class="italic">Cinclodes fuscus</span>
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Sann1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Sann1">[78]</a>), but we have maintained the original classification used in the datasets without splitting (or lumping) species.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For all sequence comparisons, we used the Kimura 2-parameter (K2P) model 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Kimura1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Kimura1">[79]</a> because it is considered to be the best metric to compare closely related taxa 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Nei1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Nei1">[80]</a>. Neighbour-joining trees were generated using the “Taxon ID Tree” tool on BOLD.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Average intraspecific distance was calculated using all of the species in each region that were represented by at least two specimens: 389 species from Argentina (78% of the species present in the dataset), 528 species from North America (82%) and 433 species from the Palearctic (89%). The mean distance was used in each species, irrespective of the number of specimens by which it was represented. For this calculation a few low quality sequences from the North American dataset were excluded (i.e. those with more than 1% ambiguous sites) to avoid inflating distance calculations (the other two datasets did not include low quality sequences that could have this effect). We also calculated the average intraspecific distance without considering species that showed two or more lineages with high divergence (see below) because: a) some of these lineages might actually represent different species and b) a small percentage of highly variable species increases the average distance considerably and as a consequence the value obtained might not be representative of the level of variation present in most of the species of the region. ANOVAs were employed to assess whether average intraspecific distances (with and without highly variable species) differed among the three regions. In case they differed, pairs of regions were compared using post hoc Scheffé contrasts.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Species that showed two or more haplogroups in the neighbour-joining tree with a maximum intraspecific distance greater than 1.5% were considered as highly variable (this distance was chosen because all intraspecific haplogroups with bootstrap support higher than 98% were separated by at least 1.5% sequence distance in the dataset from Argentina; 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Kerr2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Kerr2">[55]</a>). The proportion of highly variable species was compared among regions through a Chi-Square test, and the geographic patterns of intraspecific lineages were also analyzed and categorized as allopatric, parapatric or sympatric (in the case of the Palearctic this categorization was not possible because in the original studies 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Kerr3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Kerr3">[56]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Johnsen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Johnsen1">[57]</a> museum samples were chosen for analysis with the goal of covering as much as possible of the distribution of each species, and therefore typically only one or two samples were included from each locality).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used two complementary estimates for the divergence between closely related species in each region: the distance between nearest congeneric neighbours and the distance between sister species pairs. Several of the pairs of nearest congeneric neighbours in each dataset are not sister species because: a) one or both species of a pair of closest neighbours might actually be more closely related to species that are not present in the region being analyzed, and b) taxonomic coverage is not complete in two of the three datasets. As a consequence distance between nearest neighbours is expected to be higher than that between sister species (and particularly in the case of the partial datasets). Because of this, using species pairs that have been previously identified as sister species is more appropriate to compare the timing of speciation events that gave rise to extant species. Unfortunately, the datasets of the Palearctic and the southern Neotropics currently include relatively few known sister species pairs (due partly to sampling density and partly to limited phylogenetic knowledge of these avifaunas as compared to that of North American birds), thus complicating statistical analyses of resultant patterns. In addition, distances to the nearest congeneric neighbour are based solely on the result of these COI analyses, whereas the delimitation of pairs of sister species depends on previous phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies and this can bias the analysis (mainly because of the aforementioned difference in the depth in which these regions have been studied, see 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Tobias1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Tobias1">[81]</a>). Because of these reasons, we consider that these analytical approaches complement each other and incorporated both of them to determine if they show similar trends.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine the distance between nearest congeneric neighbours, we only considered pairs of congeneric species that appeared as closest taxa in the neighbour-joining tree of each dataset (89 species pairs from Argentina, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020744.s001" href="#pone.0020744.s001">Table S1</a>; 151 species pairs from North America, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020744.s002" href="#pone.0020744.s002">Table S2</a>; and 93 species pairs from the Palearctic, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020744.s003" href="#pone.0020744.s003">Table S3</a>). This procedure avoids the inclusion of any species more than once during the calculation and thus excludes non-independent comparisons, a problem faced if the distance between every species and its nearest congener is considered irrespective of their position in the tree. Species flagged as highly variable by their barcodes (see above) were excluded from the list of nearest congeneric neighbours because in some cases they might actually include two or more overlooked species.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We reviewed each pair of nearest congeners to determine whether they should be treated as sister species and only considered those that were either regarded as sister species in previous studies 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Johnson1">[12]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Weir3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Weir3">[26]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0020744-Tavares1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0020744-Tavares1">[82]</a> or were demonstrated as such in phylogenetic or phylogeographic analyses that included all members of the genus. With this procedure we identified 13 sister species pairs from the southern Neotropics, 47 pairs from the Nearctic and 11 pairs from the Palearctic (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020744.s001" href="#pone.0020744.s001">Tables S1</a>, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020744.s002" href="#pone.0020744.s002">S2</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0020744.s003" href="#pone.0020744.s003">S3</a>, respectively).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The average distances between closest congeners and between sister species were compared among regions through ANOVAs. Upon significance, pairs of regions were compared using post hoc Scheffé contrasts. The distributions of distances between nearest congeneric neighbours and between sister species pairs were compared among regions using a Kolmogorov Smirnov's two-sample Z statistic and the incidence of very recently diverged species (less than 1% sequence distance) was analyzed in each region and compared among them using a Chi-Square test.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 15.0.1 and tests were two-tailed. Averages are reported with their standard deviations.</p>
