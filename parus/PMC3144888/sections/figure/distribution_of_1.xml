  <div class="title">Distribution of sister species distances in COI for bird species in three biogeographic regions.</div>
  <p>Distances (calculated using the K2P model) appear to be higher in the southern Neotropics than in North America and in the later the proportion of species pairs with very low divergence (less than 1% sequence distance) is much higher. The pattern in the Palearctic is closer to that of the Neotropics than to that of the Nearctic.</p>
