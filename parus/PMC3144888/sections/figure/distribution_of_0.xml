  <div class="title">Distribution of nearest congeneric neighbour distances in COI for bird species in three biogeographic regions.</div>
  <p>Distances (calculated using the K2P model) tend to be higher in the southern Neotropics than in North America and the incidence of species pairs with very low divergence (less than 1% sequence distance) is much higher in the latter. Divergence values in the Palearctic are closer to those of the Neotropics than to those in the Nearctic.</p>
