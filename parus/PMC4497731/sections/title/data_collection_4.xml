 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Long-term (15–150 years) annual wild boar hunting bag data were acquired for 69 regions from 12 European countries. The relative change in the hunting bag from one year to another (λ = bag
  <sub>t</sub>/bag
  <sub>t-1</sub>) was calculated after excluding hunting bags smaller than 0.01 animals shot/km² (799 data points), as such small values cause large uncertainty in estimating λ. This procedure yielded a data set in which most data points prior to 1950 were excluded, allowing us to focus mainly on the period showing exponential wild boar population growth (see 
  <a rid="pone.0132178.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0132178.g001">Fig 1b</a> for some examples). Further, 87 data points were excluded that could have been affected by the political situation at that time (World War 2, Balkan War, split of Czechoslovakia). The final data set included 64 regions out of 12 European countries (

  <a rid="pone.0132178.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0132178.s004">S1 Table</a>). In sum we analysed a total of 2075 annual hunting bags (mean: 32.5 years per region).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Monthly precipitation sums and mean temperatures were acquired for the respective regions and periods (
  <a rid="pone.0132178.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0132178.s005">S2 Table</a>). Seasonal (3 months) precipitation sums and temperature means (weighted by the number of days per month) were calculated from the monthly data for spring (March–May), summer (June–August), autumn (September–November), and winter (December–February). Spatial autocorrelation analysis of the climatic data revealed that in none of the climatic variables the difference between climate stations increased below a distance of 300 to 400 km (
  <a rid="pone.0132178.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0132178.s001">S1 Fig</a>). However, climate stations used were not separated by more than 268 km to the next climate station in the data set. Thus, climate data can be considered representative even for the largest regions in our data set.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Effects of food availability on population dynamics were investigated using the Austrian subsample (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 135 years, 6 regions (
  <a rid="pone.0132178.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0132178.s004">S1 Table</a>), mean: 22.5 years per region). Rank data on beech mast intensity (0 = &lt; 30% pollination, mast failure; 1 = 30–50% pollination; 2 = 50–70% pollination; 3 = 70–85% pollination; 4 = 85–100% pollination, full mast) were obtained from the Austrian Federal Office and Research Centre for Forests (BFW, bfw.ac.at/rz/pollen.main) for 1976–2013. In years where multiple measurements were available per region the rank data were averaged in order to obtain a more accurate measurement for the whole region. Data on areas under cultivation of corn (
  <span class="italic">Zea mays</span> L.) and potatoes (
  <span class="italic">Solanum tuberosum</span> L.) were acquired from Statistics Austria (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.statistik.at" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.statistik.at</span>) and were available from 1960 to 2011 and from 1966 to 2011, respectively.

  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref031">31</a>]. Consequently, in order to include only data for comparable periods, data published before 1970 were excluded from the analysis of body mass. If only dressed body mass was available, live body mass was estimated by multiplying dressed mass by 1.25 (for Central European data) and 1.15 (for Eastern European data), respectively, to account for different ways of dressing in these areas [
