 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We observed strong correlations between hunting bags and the number of traffic accidents involving wild boar (corrected for the number of cars registered) in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland (Austria (AT): 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.96, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001; Germany (DE): 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.99, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001; Switzerland (CH): 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.84,

  <a rid="pone.0132178.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0132178.s002">S2a–S2c Fig</a>). Further, we found similarly strong correlations between the λ calculated from hunting bags and year-to-year change in car accidents involving wild boars in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland (AT: 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.73, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001; DE: 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.99, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001; CH: 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.90,

  <a rid="pone.0132178.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0132178.s002">S2d–S2f Fig</a>). These strong correlations indicate that hunting bags are a reliable proxy for changes in population size, as car accidents represent a random sample [
