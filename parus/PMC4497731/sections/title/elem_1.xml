 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite an increasing understanding of the impact of global climate change on a broad range of ecosystems [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref001">1</a>] there is a lack of long-term and large-scale biological data-sets necessary to gain a more complete understanding of how ecosystems are affected by climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref002">2</a>]. Additionally, most studies dealing with the impact of climate change on animals are distributional studies [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref003">3</a>], showing that many species respond to increasing ambient temperatures with range shifts [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref002">2</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref004">4</a>]. Some studies, however, also found that local populations of non-migratory species of birds and fishes differ in their thermal tolerance and their response to temperature changes [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref005">5</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref006">6</a>]. Such differences between different populations might be due to physiological differences caused by local adaptation or phenotypic plasticity. In fact, it is known that body mass is affected by the general climatic conditions with individuals living in cold climates being larger [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref007">7</a>]. Some studies on bird species even reported changes in body mass in response to climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref008">8</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref009">9</a>]. However, very little is known on how large mammals with a wide distribution range respond to climate change and whether those responses differ between populations [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref010">10</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref011">11</a>]. Thus, it is unclear whether results of studies on the impact of climate on single populations can be generalized throughout a species’ distribution range.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The wild boar is an excellent model to investigate this topic. First, it is one of the most widely distributed mammals in the world [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref012">12</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref013">13</a>], with recent significant growth documented for many populations [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref014">14</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref015">15</a>]. As wild boars occupy a broad range of habitat types and climatic zones with a number of genetically distinct ecotypes [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref016">16</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref017">17</a>], there is a high potential for region-specific responses to climate change in this species. Second, the wild boar has an enormous reproductive capacity, and thus the potential for remarkable population growth when environmental conditions become more favourable, e.g. [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref018">18</a>]. Given an average litter size in Europe of ~ 5 juveniles [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref019">19</a>], reproductive output in the wild boar is much larger than in other ungulates of similar size [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref020">20</a>]. Furthermore, if food availability is high, female boar can reach sexual maturity yet in their year of birth [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref021">21</a>], and maximum life-span is high, i.e. up to 12 years in natural habitats [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref012">12</a>]. Third, climatic conditions are known to affect reproduction [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref021">21</a>], as well as survival [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref022">22</a>] of wild boar.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change, however, could affect wild boar populations not only directly through changes in temperature and precipitation, but also indirectly by affecting important biotic factors such as food availability. Such ecological impacts of climate change at the community level have received less attention than direct responses to abiotic changes but are important for a holistic understanding of how climate change affects both, species and communities [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref002">2</a>]. Although an omnivorous species, the wild boar strongly relies on tree seeds like beech nuts, 
  <span class="italic">Fagus sylvatica</span> L., or acorns, 
  <span class="italic">Quercus spec</span>. L. in large parts of its distribution range in Europe [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref023">23</a>]. Fructification in these trees is highly pulsed (seed masting), but the frequency of masting events has significantly increased over the past decades in parts of Europe (e.g. Austria, see below), probably as a consequence of climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref024">24</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we investigated the effect of seasonal mean temperatures and seasonal precipitation sums on the relative change in annual wild boar population size (i.e., rate of growth, λ) using long-term data on wild boar hunting bags from a major part of the wild boars’ European distribution range (
  <a rid="pone.0132178.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0132178.g001">Fig 1a</a>; details in 
  <a rid="pone.0132178.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0132178.s004">S1 Table</a>). We further tested the effect of food availability on λ in a subsample of our data for which information on beech masting and areas under cultivation of corn and potatoes was available. We focussed on these fruits because they are known to play a major role in the food composition of wild boar [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We hypothesized that (1) major increases in the size of wild boar populations are linked to milder winter temperatures and changes in precipitation. If wild boar population dynamics are indeed affected by climate, particularly temperature, we envisioned two alternative scenarios: (i) There is a single critical species-specific winter temperature threshold for population growth for all European wild boar populations. (ii) Physiological trade-offs generate locally differing responses to ambient temperatures leading to population-specific winter temperature thresholds for population growth. (2) We further hypothesized that, in addition to direct climatic effects, increased abundance of food accelerates wild boar population growth by compensating the negative effects of severe winters.</p>
