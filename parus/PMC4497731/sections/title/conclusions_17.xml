 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has been shown recently that, even for closely related species with similar ecological niches, responses to climate change cannot be extrapolated easily from one species to another [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref066" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref066">66</a>]. Our results show for the first time that this holds even for separate populations within a species and therefore questions any predictions of the consequences of climate change for population dynamics if they are based on responses to environmental factors, such as ambient temperature, in a single or just a few local populations. Our results further underline the need to take indirect ecological effects into account, such as increasing food availability (e.g. accelerated tree-masting frequency), when studying the impact of climate change on species or ecosystems.
