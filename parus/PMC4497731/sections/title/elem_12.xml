 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effect of beech masting events and other food sources was explored in the Austrian subset of our data. We found that moderate or full mast in the previous autumn, i.e., high food availability during winter, completely outweighed the negative effects of cold winter conditions on population growth (

  <a rid="pone.0132178.g004" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0132178.g004">Fig 4a</a>). There was no significant interaction between beech mast and population density or beech mast and long-term winter temperature (
  <a rid="pone.0132178.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0132178.t001">Table 1b</a>). Further, we did not find any effects of areas under cultivation of corn and potatoes on population growth (
