 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has been shown in previous studies that ungulate traffic collisions in Europe accurately reflect the population size and therefore can be regarded as random sampling [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref043">43</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref044">44</a>]. The strong correlations between the relative year-to-year changes in the number of traffic accidents and the λ calculated from hunting bags in all regions investigated (
  <a rid="pone.0132178.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0132178.s002">S2d–S2f Fig</a>) show that fluctuations in hunting bags largely reflect those in population size and, consequently, are a good proxy for relative changes in wild boar population size, at least at the coarse scales considered here.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analysis shows that wild boars are apparently highly susceptible to cold winter conditions (
  <a rid="pone.0132178.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0132178.g002">Fig 2</a>), as those were consistently followed by population declines. Cool autumns also had a negative impact on population growth, which may simply reflect an early onset of winter. It is known that cold winters lead to increased juvenile mortality [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref043">43</a>], which is a major driver of wild boar population dynamics [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref018">18</a>]. Susceptibility to low winter temperatures can also explain why wild boars occur at higher densities in warmer regions [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref045">45</a>]. Of course, we cannot exclude that other factors such as changes in agricultural practices or changes in hunting pressure [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref021">21</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref046">46</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref047">47</a>] also influence growth of wild boar populations. However, although it was reported that hunting pressure affects life-history traits and demography in the wild boar [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref021">21</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref046">46</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref047">47</a>], no study so far has actually shown that population growth rate in wild boar is significantly affected by hunting pressure. Moreover, a recent study underlines that recreational hunting has no influence on wild boar population growth [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref015">15</a>]. Wild boar populations across Europe have been growing irrespective of whether the number of hunters have increased, decreased or remained stable [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref015">15</a>]. Furthermore, even though such factors may well have contributed to the considerable noise in λ, they were not strong enough to mask the dominant effect of winter temperature. Increasingly milder winters as a result of climate change (
  <a rid="pone.0132178.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0132178.g001">Fig 1c</a>; see also [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref048">48</a>]) must therefore be considered as a major reason for the European-wide massive increase of wild boar during the last decades (
  <a rid="pone.0132178.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0132178.g001">Fig 1b</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Flexible and generalist species like the wild boar are generally more likely to cope with or even benefit from climate change compared to specialist and less flexible species [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref002">2</a>]. The positive effect of warming climate on wild boar population growth identified here, together with results from previous studies on other ungulates [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref010">10</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref049">49</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref050">50</a>], is in line with this. Population size is positively associated with milder winters and an early onset of spring in red deer (
  <span class="italic">Cervus elaphus</span> L.) [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref049">49</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref050">50</a>], an ungulate species with flexible birth dates [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref051">51</a>]. In contrast, in roe deer (
  <span class="italic">Capreolus capreolus</span> L.), where females have inflexible birth dates, an earlier onset of spring has a negative impact on population growth [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref010">10</a>]. The latter is apparently caused by an increasing phenological mismatch between onset of vegetation growth and birth [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref010">10</a>]. Furthermore, being an income breeder [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref052">52</a>], the roe deer can be expected to be more severely affected by such a phenological mismatch than wild boar or red deer.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Surprisingly, climate change associated wild boar population increases were not restricted to the coldest regions. In fact, we show for the first time that a positive relation between winter temperature and wild boar population growth exists over a large climatic range, but the effect is weaker in warmer regions. Further, in warmer areas there was a higher threshold-temperature for the onset of population growth (
  <a rid="pone.0132178.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0132178.g002">Fig 2</a>). Therefore, population-specific temperature thresholds can explain why changes in average winter temperature have led to almost concurrent increases in wild boar population sizes all over Europe (
  <a rid="pone.0132178.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0132178.g001">Fig 1a and 1b</a>; [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref014">14</a>]), despite differences in local climates.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The lack of a common threshold winter temperature initiating population growth could be either due to local adaptation, phenotypic plasticity, or to a density-climate interaction, as population densities in cooler regions are generally lower [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref045">45</a>]. Density-dependent mechanisms have been shown to affect life-history traits and consequently population growth in several other ungulate species [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref050">50</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref053">53</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref057">57</a>]. However, the effect of density in the present analysis was relatively small compared with the impact of long-term winter temperature (
  <a rid="pone.0132178.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0132178.t001">Table 1a</a>). Additionally, our results gave no evidence for a significant interaction of density with annual winter temperature (
  <a rid="pone.0132178.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0132178.t001">Table 1a</a>), which might have been expected because environmental fluctuations are likely to affect animals more strongly at higher population densities [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref055">55</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref057">57</a>]. Further, as yet there is no flattening of the exponential population growth curves (see 
  <a rid="pone.0132178.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0132178.g001">Fig 1b</a> for some examples), and a previous study indicates that density dependence in general plays a minor role in wild boar population dynamics [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref058" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref058">58</a>]. Overall, this suggests that the locally differing temperature-thresholds for the onset of population growth identified here are probably not caused by a density-climate interaction but are rather due to phenotypic plasticity or local adaptation. With our data, we cannot differentiate between these two mutually not exclusive alternatives. However, wild boar populations in Europe have been shown to be genetically distinct [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref017">17</a>], rendering at least some degree of genetic adaptation likely. Such genetic differentiation of populations and adaptation to local climatic conditions has been shown in several fish species, e.g. [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref005">5</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref059" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref059">59</a>], whereas changes in body size of red-billed gulls (
  <span class="italic">Chroicocephalus scopulinus</span> F.) and great tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span> L.) in response to climate change seemed to be due to phenotypic plasticity [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref008">8</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref009">9</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If differences in the local responses to climate in wild boar are due to local adaptation or phenotypic plasticity, one would expect regional clines in morphological or physiological characteristics. One important trait to consider in this context is body size. Body size is known to be a major factor affecting thermoregulation, energy requirements, and ultimately survival in different climates by changing the surface to volume ratio and thus relative heat loss (Bergmann’s rule [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref007">7</a>]). Our results confirm previous indications for the applicability of Bergmann’s rule to the wild boar, e.g. [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref060" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref060">60</a>], as animals of this species in colder regions are indeed heavier (
  <a rid="pone.0132178.g005" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0132178.g005">Fig 5</a>). While larger body size in cool climates reduces the relative heat loss, small body size in warmer regions, on the other hand, leads to lower total metabolic rates and higher rates of heat loss. Hence, smaller body size may help wild boar to withstand high summer temperatures despite its limited ability to use evaporative cooling, and potentially serve to reduce reproductive constraints due to the limits of heat dissipation during lactation [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref061" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref061">61</a>]. However, smaller body size does not seem to entirely offset adverse effects of heat, as underlined by our finding that wild boar population growth generally decreased, though only slightly, with higher summer temperatures. Consequently, it seems plausible that regionally differing body mass of wild boars, no matter whether it is due to local adaptation or a common reaction norm, evolved because of trade-offs between the benefits of large size in winter and of small size in summer. These locally different phenotypes in turn could have caused the region-specific temperature thresholds observed here.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several studies on birds, e.g. [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref008">8</a>], and mammals, e.g. [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref062" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref062">62</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref063" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref063">63</a>], showed that the average body size in populations often changes in response to climate change. So far it is not known whether this is also the case in the wild boar and how this might affect the impact of rising temperatures on wild boar populations. This question needs to be targeted in further studies.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The negative effect of summer temperature on wild boar population growth, however, was very small in the European-wide data set (
  <a rid="pone.0132178.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0132178.t001">Table 1a</a>) and even absent in the Austrian subset (
  <a rid="pone.0132178.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0132178.t001">Table 1b</a>). Therefore, higher than average summer temperatures probably play an important role only in specific habitats, whereas warm and rainy summers may even have a positive effect on reproduction in certain populations [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref021">21</a>]. It remains unclear however, which habitats that might be as the effect of summer temperature, in contrast to winter temperature, was apparently independent of the local long-term climate (
  <a rid="pone.0132178.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0132178.t001">Table 1a</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to these direct abiotic effects of climate change on wild boar populations we also identified indirect effects via food availability. Beech nuts and acorns are the most important food resource for wild boar [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref025">25</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref064" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref064">64</a>] but seed production in these species is highly variable and can cease entirely over large areas. This mechanism is commonly viewed as a strategy of trees to swamp seed-predators at unpredictable intervals [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref065" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref065">65</a>]. Our analysis showed that the frequency of beech masting years has increased over the last decades (
  <a rid="pone.0132178.g004" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0132178.g004">Fig 4b</a>), presumably due to climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref024">24</a>]. This finding, together with the fact that cold winters had no negative effect on population growth when food resources were abundant, shows that the effect of climate change on population growth of wild boar is two-fold: Cold winters have become rarer and, on top of this, the remaining severe winters became increasingly ineffective in diminishing wild boar populations because of the increasing frequency of masting years. In such years, beech or oak trees produce vast amounts of energy rich seeds that are available from autumn until spring in the following year [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref018">18</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref023">23</a>]. If abundant, this food source likely enables juveniles to cope even with high thermoregulatory costs in a severe winter, and adults to accumulate high amounts of body energy reserves for reproduction in the following year. This result also indicates that low survival in cold winters is apparently not caused by a limited thermogenic capacity. Instead, increased winter mortality seems to be caused by a negative energy balance, i.e., when high thermoregulatory costs, due to severe cold, cannot be matched by the available food, especially when high caloric seeds are absent.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to tree seeds, increased crop availability in a human-shaped landscape has previously been assumed to provide an important source of energy for wild boars [
  <a rid="pone.0132178.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132178.ref023">23</a>]. However, the lack of significant effects of areas under cultivation of corn and potatoes on wild boar population dynamics indicates that this is apparently not the case, presumably because significant quantities of these crops are available only during a short period prior to harvesting.
