 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All field procedures, including capture, handling and blood sampling were carried out according to standard procedures in this kind of study by expert scientists. Upon capture, swallows were kept in cloth bags in a safe position, as is standard practice in bird ringing studies. Blood samples were collected by puncturing the brachial vein and the puncturing site was disinfected. Individuals were kept overnight in a safe place and released at sunrise the next morning. The study was carried out under invitation by the local authority (Cross River State, Nigeria, TB #1/20/2012).</p>
