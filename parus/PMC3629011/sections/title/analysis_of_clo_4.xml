 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Total genomic DNA was extracted by alkaline lysis from blood samples collected in heparinized capillary tubes after puncturing the brachial vein (see 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-11" href="#ref-11">Caprioli et al., 2012</a> for details). Species-specific primers for genotyping purposes were designed initially using the primers reported in 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-34" href="#ref-34">Johnsen et al. (2007)</a>. The amplified PCR fragments were then sequenced (BMR genomics, Padua, Italy) and a new set of primers were designed on barn swallow genomic sequence. Genomic DNA samples were screened for length polymorphism in the 
  <span class="italic">Clk</span>polyQcds by PCR amplification followed by resolution and detection on a conventional DNA sequencing machine using a commercial GeneScan service for genotyping (Macrogen Inc., Seoul, Korea) (see 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-11" href="#ref-11">Caprioli et al., 2012</a>). We used PCR forward primer (5′-labelled with 6-FAM dye) 5′-[6FAM]GGGACAGGTGGTGACAGCTTATC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CTGCTGATGGTCCTGCTGACT-3′ (Sigma-Aldrich). Two internal size standards were used in PCR (see 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-11" href="#ref-11">Caprioli et al., 2012</a>). The reliability of molecular data were confirmed by randomly picking 80 samples and repeating the GeneScan analysis independently. Moreover each heterozygous genotype was double checked by repeating the PCR amplification reaction and sequencing. The alleles were named according to the number of glutamine residues predicted in the mature protein, as

  <sub>8</sub> (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-18" href="#ref-18">Dor et al., 2012</a>). Statistical tests were conducted using genotype classes, i.e. considering 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>

  <sub>7</sub>, 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>

  <sub>7</sub> and 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>7</sub>/
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>8</sub> as distinct groups.
