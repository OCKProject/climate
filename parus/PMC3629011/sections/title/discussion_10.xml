 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our major finding was that rare 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>7</sub>/
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>8</sub> heterozygous barn swallows at the 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene delayed molt relative to the other genotypes. This result emerged despite very small size of the sample of 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>7</sub>/
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>8</sub> that was obtained from an otherwise large sample of birds.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a companion study we showed that timing of molt as measured at four plumage regions did not differ between males and females (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-57" href="#ref-57">Saino et al., 2013</a>) and this finding was confirmed in the present analyses where we focused on primary wing feathers only and that were based on a slightly different sample. We carefully considered potential sources of bias arising from the conditions under which sampling was conducted. Several arguments against potential confounding effects arising from sex-related, pre-migratory movements that might have occurred by mid-February, well before the start of migration, are presented in the Methods as well as in 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-57" href="#ref-57">Saino et al. (2013)</a>. As far as the evidence of delayed molt by 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>7</sub>/
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>8</sub> is specifically concerned, a bias could have arisen from sampling effects only if all of the following conditions were simultaneously met: (1) 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>7</sub>/
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>8</sub> individuals had markedly bimodal timing of molt whereby some (a sample of which we could capture) delay molt while others complete molt very early, so that mean molt schedules is similar to that of the other genotypes, and no 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>7</sub>/
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>8</sub> individuals with intermediate molt phenotype occur; (2) pre-migratory movements occur already by mid-February and result in a non-negligible proportion of birds leaving the roost (but see above); and (3) 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>7</sub>/
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>8</sub> individuals were more likely to leave the roost than the other genotypes. Condition (1) and (3) are obviously very unlikely as it is difficult to imagine how such a sharply bimodal frequency distribution of molt phenotypes could arise and be associated with 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> genotype and why such a differential proneness to leave that particular roost should exist among 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> genotypes. Condition (2) is also unlikely to be met according to the arguments we presented in the Methods (see also 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-57" href="#ref-57">Saino et al., 2013</a>). Hence, we are convinced that sampling effects did not confound the present results.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although photoperiod is deemed the major extrinsic factor ultimately controlling seasonal activities of birds, including molt (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-25" href="#ref-25">Gwinner, 1986</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-16" href="#ref-16">Dawson et al., 2001</a>), no previous study had investigated variation in molt schedules in relation to polymorphism at genes for photoperiodic response. In barn swallows, the single annual molt of wing and tail feathers normally occurs in sub-Saharan Africa, at tropical latitudes (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-13" href="#ref-13">Cramp, 1998</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-64" href="#ref-64">van den Brink, Bijlsma &amp; van der Have, 2000</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-1" href="#ref-1">Altwegg et al., 2012</a>). Although the role of photoperiod in controlling molt in the tropics may be questioned, birds at the tropics have been shown to respond physiologically to even minor changes in photoperiod (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-29" href="#ref-29">Hau, Wikelski &amp; Wingfield, 1998</a>), and direct evidence for a control of molt and gonadal rhythms by daytime length at low latitudes has been already provided (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-27" href="#ref-27">Gwinner &amp; Scheuerlein, 1998</a>). In addition, it has been recently shown that synchronization of circannual rhythms at the tropics can be achieved by change in time of sunrise and sunset (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-23" href="#ref-23">Goymann et al., 2012</a>). Thus, molt may also be regulated by response to photoperiod and/or daylight intensity variation in barn swallows wintering at the tropics (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-26" href="#ref-26">Gwinner, 2003</a>). Present findings may thus hint at an involvement of 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> genes in decoding photoperiodic/daylight intensity information 
  <span class="italic">at the time of molt</span> and thus in giving a cadence to its progress. A potentially concomitant mechanism is that 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> affects timing of other photoperiodic activities that occur earlier at higher latitudes, such as reproduction and initiation of autumn migration. Because of time constraints, these effects may then carry-over on timing of arrival to the wintering grounds and winter molt.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Remarkably, 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>7</sub>/
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>8</sub> individuals not only molted later but were also found to delay breeding in a previous study of an Italian population (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-11" href="#ref-11">Caprioli et al., 2012</a>). In fact, delay in breeding was observed only among females, as expected because in birds females have ample control over timing of breeding (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-4" href="#ref-4">Ball &amp; Ketterson, 2008</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-40" href="#ref-40">Liedvogel et al., 2009</a>). The delay in molt by 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>7</sub>/
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>8</sub> individuals that could be estimated here based on ptilochronological information on P7 (ca. 8–9 days) is similar in magnitude to the delay that was observed in breeding date of 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>7</sub>/
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>8</sub> females compared to the other genotypes (ca. 13 days).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hence, 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>7</sub>/
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>8</sub> is apparently associated with a behavioural syndrome that entails delay in both breeding and molt. The cascade of causation between 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span>, and breeding and molt phenology, however, is uncertain: owing to tight annual routines, delayed breeding may cause molt retardation or, conversely, delayed molt may cause late migration and thus breeding. Finally, 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> genotype may have an independent effect on both timing of breeding and molt.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In theory, the association between 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> and molt could be due to a second gene linked to 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span>. However, the large body of evidence showing 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> involvement in photoperiodic responses in several, phylogenetically distant organisms (see above) which are unlikely to share syntenic chromosomes makes this hypothesis unlikely. A partly alternative interpretation of the present findings is that 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> has an indirect role in controlling molt by determining circadian activity rhythms, including for example foraging behaviour.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Barn swallows from diverse western and central European regions converge to winter in Nigeria, and in the Boje area in particular, as shown by analysis of ring recoveries (P Micheloni, unpublished data). Hypothetically, a spurious association between molt scores and 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> genotype could result from latitudinal variation in both 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> allele frequencies and molt schedules. This interpretation, however, is very unlikely to be correct given the lack of geographical variation in 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene frequencies that emerges from two studies of six distant geographic populations and from unpublished information on an additional northern European population (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-19" href="#ref-19">Dor et al., 2011</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-11" href="#ref-11">Caprioli et al., 2012</a>; N Saino, M Caprioli &amp; AP Møller, unpublished data).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, a different interpretation is that our results are driven by selection against 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>7</sub>/
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>8</sub>. In a previous study it has been demonstrated that the frequency of 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>7</sub>/
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>8</sub> is larger among yearlings than older individuals (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-11" href="#ref-11">Caprioli et al., 2012</a>). Because yearlings molt later, it is possible that delayed molt of 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>7</sub>/
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>8</sub> results from a larger frequency of 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>7</sub>/
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>8</sub> in the yearlings fraction of the population. In this perspective, the present findings suggest that delayed molt may concur in determining reduced viability of rare 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>7</sub>/
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>8</sub> individuals. This interpretation is also unlikely to be correct, however, because we observed the same pattern of differences in molt scores among genotypes when we considered the subsample of individuals that were still actively molting their wing feathers, which was likely formed mainly by yearlings (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-46" href="#ref-46">Møller et al., 2011</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Admittedly, the present results have little specific bearing for the study of molt phenology of barn swallow populations, because 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>8</sub> has been found to be very rare in all populations studied so far. Conversely, the present findings have a potentially major relevance for studies of genetic control of molt and, more generally, for studies of photoperiodism and regulation of seasonality in birds, including the studies on phenotypically plastic/microevolutionary phenological responses to current climate change (see 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-36" href="#ref-36">Knudsen et al., 2011</a> for a review). While low frequency of 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>8</sub> in our model population may be maintained by selection (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-11" href="#ref-11">Caprioli et al., 2012</a>), higher polymorphism at 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> in other species (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-34" href="#ref-34">Johnsen et al., 2007</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-39" href="#ref-39">Liedvogel &amp; Sheldon, 2010</a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-18" href="#ref-18">Dor et al., 2012</a>) may be maintained by selection for variation in photoperiodic response strategies due to e.g. spatial or temporal variation in selection pressures, therefore affording ample opportunity to study the effect of 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> on timing of molt.
