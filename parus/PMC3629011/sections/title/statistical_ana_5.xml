 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We mainly relied on non-parametric tests because of right-truncation and heteroskedasticity of the distribution of molt scores within sexes or genotypes. TMS values were compared between sexes or genotypes using the Mann-Whitney U test. Exact, rather than asymptotic probabilities were always calculated, as these are more appropriate particularly under highly unbalanced designs as in the comparisons of molt scores among genotypes. Tests were performed on the whole sample of sexed or genotyped individuals and then repeated on the sample of individuals that were still actively molting their primaries (i.e. that had TMS ≤ 44; hereafter “molting individuals”) to test for any potential confounding effect of selection of the sampled individuals based on the 3/4–1/4 rule illustrated above. However, the two sets of analyses invariably led to strictly similar results. In significance tests, the α-value was always set at
