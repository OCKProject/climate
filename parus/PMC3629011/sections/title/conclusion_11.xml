 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using molecular techniques to identify sex, this study of barn swallows achieved a novel finding of potentially general relevance for the study of the evolution and the control of molt and migration strategies in birds, and potentially in other organisms where the 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> genetic machinery of control of photoperiodic responses is conserved. We uncovered an association between timing of molt and 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> genotype and found that rare 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>7</sub>/
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>8</sub> individuals, which are known to delay breeding, also show delayed annual molt in winter. The pleiotropic temporal shift that 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>7</sub>/
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>8</sub> may cause in fundamental life-history components has obvious general implications for the understanding of regulation of seasonality and annual routines particularly in long-distance migratory species with complex annual cycles, and might disclose research avenues particularly in species exhibiting larger polymorphism at 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> genes.
