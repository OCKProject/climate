 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since we expected that a bird's energetic requirements would affect its intake of toxic prey, we took measures of their body condition (body mass, dietary intake and fat reserves) as well as their activity as temperature decreased from 20 °C to 6 °C. Birds were weighed at 0900 hours to reduce any effects of temporal fluctuations in body mass (
  <a rid="bib22 bib12" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib22 bib12">Cresswell 1998; Broggi et al. 2004</a>). We took two measurements at 20 °C, and single measurements at 10 °C, 8 °C and 6 °C (see 
  <a rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec" href="#appsec1">Appendix</a> for further details). We also recorded tarsus length and used this to calculate an index of body condition (body mass/tarsus length). We measured birds' dietary intake by weighing the amount of food (poultry diet and apple) that we gave to birds immediately following an experimental session and then reweighing the bowl and any remnants in the cage when we removed the bowl at the start of the food deprivation period for the following session on the next day. Since this was a noninvasive measure, we did this on a daily basis (see 
  <a rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec" href="#appsec1">Appendix</a> for further details). The subcutaneous fat reserves were estimated at 20 °C and at 6 °C using the BWG scale by an experienced ringer who was blind to the experimental manipulations (

  <a rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec" href="#appsec1">Appendix</a> for further details). Finally, we measured activity by analysing 2 min of video taken randomly from eight sessions selected at 20 °C and 6 °C and counting the jumps from the perches to the ground that occurred during that period.
