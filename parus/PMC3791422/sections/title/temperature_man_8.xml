 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From day 10, birds continued to receive the same daily presentations of prey as in the learning sessions, but now we manipulated the temperature. We began the temperature manipulation phase with an additional day at 20 °C before decreasing the temperature from 20 °C to 6 °C by 2 °C every 2 days (15 days in total). We then increased the temperature to ensure that any change in behaviour was due to the change in temperature. We increased the temperature by 3 °C every day except for the last day, when the temperature was increased by 2 °C in order to reach the initial temperature of 20 °C (5 days in total; see 
  <a rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" href="#tbl1">Table 1</a> for details). Therefore, we ran different numbers of sessions at each temperature (one at 9 °C and 15 °C; two at 6 °C, 8 °C, 10 °C, 14 °C, 16 °C and 20 °C; and three at 12 °C and 18 °C). We chose this temperature range for two reasons: (1) it is below the TNZ of starlings and birds should be increasing their metabolic rate with decreasing temperature (

  <a rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib4">Asher &amp; Bateson 2008</a>), although we do not know what the impact of these different regimes is. Therefore, for welfare purposes (and following discussion with a Home Office Inspector), we monitored their daily intake of food and weighed the birds at each temperature below 12 °C. This would allow us to detect any sudden changes in the birds' energetic states and ability to cope with the decreasing temperature that would be a welfare concern.
