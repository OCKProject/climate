 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Birds were food deprived 1.5 h before the start of each session. Forty-five minutes before the start of a session, a sheet of opaque material was erected in front of the cages to prevent the test birds seeing conspecifics and the experimenter. The birds' behaviour was observed via video cameras connected to monitors. Each individual was given one session per day, during which a sequence of 16 single mealworms was presented. Each mealworm was presented in a petri dish through the flap on the front of the bird's cage. A single mealworm was presented in this manner every 3 min. The bird was given 1 min to eat it after which time the petri dish was removed. If the mealworm was attacked and eaten within 1 min, the petri dish was removed immediately. The experiment was divided into three consecutive phases: training (days 1–2), learning (days 3–9) and temperature manipulation (days 10–27).</p>
