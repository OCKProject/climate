 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The birds received seven learning sessions, one per day for 7 consecutive days (days 3â€“9). In each session, eight undefended and eight defended prey were presented in a sequence in which two undefended and two defended prey were randomly delivered in every four presentations (this ensured that prey were equally distributed across the daily session). Undefended and defended prey were made visually distinct by placing a green or purple disc of paper under the mealworm in the petri dish. Colours were counterbalanced to control for any potential colour biases. Unique prey sequences were produced for each session for each bird to prevent birds using temporal cues to determine the palatability of prey. We recorded the numbers of undefended and defended prey eaten in each session. By the end of day 9, all birds had learned to discriminate between the two prey types (see
