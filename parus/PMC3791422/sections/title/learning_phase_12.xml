 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Birds learned to discriminate between defended and undefended prey during training: birds ate undefended and defended prey equally in the first session (Wilcoxon signed-ranks test: 
  <span class="italic">Z</span> = 0.38, 
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 8, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.71), but ate significantly fewer defended than undefended prey in session 7 (
  <span class="italic">Z</span> = −2.34, 
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 8, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.02; 
  <a rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>). There was no significant difference in the numbers of defended prey eaten in sessions 5–7 (ANOVA: 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>2,14</sub> = 0.10, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.90). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the birds learned to discriminate between undefended and defended prey and were at asymptotic performance by the end of the learning phase (see 
  <a rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>). The number of defended prey that a bird ate at asymptote did not appear to be related to its body condition or need for nutrients. There was no significant relationship between the mean number of defended prey eaten at asymptote on days 5–7 and either body mass (Pearson correlation: 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = −0.48, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.23), body condition (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = −0.56, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.15), fat score (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = −0.355, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.39) or dietary intake (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = −0.25, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.55).
