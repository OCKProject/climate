 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since measuring the birds' masses could disrupt their behaviour, we took measures during the learning phase at 20 °C (days 2 and 5), and three in the temperature manipulation phase on experimental days 17 (10 °C), 20 (8 °C) and 21 (6 °C). These latter measurements also ensured that our birds were not rapidly losing weight in response to decreasing temperature. The data from all days are presented in Fig. A1. To compare whether birds' masses differed between 20 °C and 6 °C, we compared the data between day 5 (the last measure at 20 °C prior to the temperature manipulation) and day 21 (the only measure at 6 °C).</p>
