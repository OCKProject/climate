 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We took daily measures of the total mass of food eaten by birds during the learning phase at 20 °C and the temperature manipulation phase as the temperature was reduced from 20 °C to 6 °C (days 1–22). The data from all days are presented in Fig. A2. To compare whether birds' intake differed between 20 °C and 6 °C, we compared the data between day 8 (the last measure at 20 °C prior to the temperature manipulation) and day 22 (the last measure at 6 °C).</p>
