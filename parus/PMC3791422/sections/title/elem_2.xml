  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A group of 50 European starlings were caught in the nonbreeding season (September/October 2011) in Northumberland under licence (Natural England 20113759) using a baited whoosh net. The birds (juveniles and adults) were immediately transported to the laboratory by car (a 30 min drive) and kept in two indoor aviaries (215 × 340 cm and 220 cm high) at Newcastle University. Each aviary had bark chippings on the floor, and ropes, boxes and branches for perches and cover. Birds were fed ad libitum poultry diet, mixed fruit and mealworms (mealworms were scattered into the bark chippings to promote natural foraging behaviour). Birds had constant access to drinking water and were provided with bathing water daily. The temperature of the aviary ranged between 15 °C and 18 °C, and was kept under a 14:10 h light cycle under high flicker rate (100 Hz) fluorescent lighting. Birds were individually marked using plastic colour rings, and were weighed each week and visually inspected daily by a trained technician during their time in captivity to ensure that they remained in good health.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nine days before the start of the experiment, eight birds (four female and four male) were selected at random as experimental subjects and transferred to a climate-controlled chamber at 20 °C. Birds were individually housed in cages measuring 75 × 45 cm and 45 cm high with a flap facing the front through which prey could be presented. Although housed individually, birds were not visually or acoustically isolated from the other birds in the room, except during test sessions (see below). The cages were enriched with a bowl of water used for bathing, a litter tray containing wood chips for foraging and branches as perches. Birds were maintained on a 14:10 h light:dark photoperiod under high flicker rate (100 Hz) fluorescent lighting. Enriched vitamin water and a poultry maintenance diet were provided ad libitum except during experimental periods (see below). A piece of apple was also given at the end of each daily session. At the end of the experiment (April 2012), birds were returned to free-flight aviaries before being health checked by a vet, BTO ringed and released back to the wild at their site of capture. Although we were unable to monitor the birds following their release and subsequent dispersal, we have seen and recaught birds that we have previously released, demonstrating their ability to survive in the wild. The experiments were conducted under local ethical approval from Newcastle University (ERC Project ID No. 266).</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Preparation of Artificial Prey</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Standard mealworms of a similar mass (19–21 mg) were injected with different solutions to make them either defended or undefended. Undefended prey were injected with 0.04 ml of water and defended prey were injected with 0.04 ml of 2% quinine sulphate solution (Quinine Sulfate, Sigma-Aldrich Q0132). Prey were injected with the same amount of solution to ensure that they were visually identical. The solutions were injected through the mouthparts of the mealworm using a hypodermic needle. Quinine is aversive to birds and is commonly used at low concentrations as a repellent in learning experiments with a range of different avian species (e.g. black-capped chickadees,

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">General Procedure</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Birds were food deprived 1.5 h before the start of each session. Forty-five minutes before the start of a session, a sheet of opaque material was erected in front of the cages to prevent the test birds seeing conspecifics and the experimenter. The birds' behaviour was observed via video cameras connected to monitors. Each individual was given one session per day, during which a sequence of 16 single mealworms was presented. Each mealworm was presented in a petri dish through the flap on the front of the bird's cage. A single mealworm was presented in this manner every 3 min. The bird was given 1 min to eat it after which time the petri dish was removed. If the mealworm was attacked and eaten within 1 min, the petri dish was removed immediately. The experiment was divided into three consecutive phases: training (days 1–2), learning (days 3–9) and temperature manipulation (days 10–27).</p>

 <sec id="sec1.4" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Training Phase</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All birds were initially trained to eat unmanipulated mealworms that had not been injected with any solution. Birds received two sessions on consecutive days and the number of mealworms eaten was recorded. All birds were eating 15–16 mealworms per session by the end of day 2, and proceeded to the learning phase.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec id="sec1.5" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Learning Phase</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The birds received seven learning sessions, one per day for 7 consecutive days (days 3–9). In each session, eight undefended and eight defended prey were presented in a sequence in which two undefended and two defended prey were randomly delivered in every four presentations (this ensured that prey were equally distributed across the daily session). Undefended and defended prey were made visually distinct by placing a green or purple disc of paper under the mealworm in the petri dish. Colours were counterbalanced to control for any potential colour biases. Unique prey sequences were produced for each session for each bird to prevent birds using temporal cues to determine the palatability of prey. We recorded the numbers of undefended and defended prey eaten in each session. By the end of day 9, all birds had learned to discriminate between the two prey types (see 
   <a rid="sec2" ref-type="sec" href="#sec2">Results</a>) and the temperature manipulation phase began.
  </p>

 <sec id="sec1.6" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temperature Manipulation Phase</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From day 10, birds continued to receive the same daily presentations of prey as in the learning sessions, but now we manipulated the temperature. We began the temperature manipulation phase with an additional day at 20 °C before decreasing the temperature from 20 °C to 6 °C by 2 °C every 2 days (15 days in total). We then increased the temperature to ensure that any change in behaviour was due to the change in temperature. We increased the temperature by 3 °C every day except for the last day, when the temperature was increased by 2 °C in order to reach the initial temperature of 20 °C (5 days in total; see 
   <a rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" href="#tbl1">Table 1</a> for details). Therefore, we ran different numbers of sessions at each temperature (one at 9 °C and 15 °C; two at 6 °C, 8 °C, 10 °C, 14 °C, 16 °C and 20 °C; and three at 12 °C and 18 °C). We chose this temperature range for two reasons: (1) it is below the TNZ of starlings and birds should be increasing their metabolic rate with decreasing temperature (
   <a rid="bib11 bib24" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib11 bib24">Brenner 1965; Dmi'el &amp; Tel-Tzur 1985</a>); (2) it reflects the annual range of the mean daily maximum temperature at a local weather station, 25 km from Newcastle (

   <a rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib4">Asher &amp; Bateson 2008</a>), although we do not know what the impact of these different regimes is. Therefore, for welfare purposes (and following discussion with a Home Office Inspector), we monitored their daily intake of food and weighed the birds at each temperature below 12 °C. This would allow us to detect any sudden changes in the birds' energetic states and ability to cope with the decreasing temperature that would be a welfare concern.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Measurements of Energetic State</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since we expected that a bird's energetic requirements would affect its intake of toxic prey, we took measures of their body condition (body mass, dietary intake and fat reserves) as well as their activity as temperature decreased from 20 °C to 6 °C. Birds were weighed at 0900 hours to reduce any effects of temporal fluctuations in body mass (
   <a rid="bib22 bib12" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib22 bib12">Cresswell 1998; Broggi et al. 2004</a>). We took two measurements at 20 °C, and single measurements at 10 °C, 8 °C and 6 °C (see 
   <a rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec" href="#appsec1">Appendix</a> for further details). We also recorded tarsus length and used this to calculate an index of body condition (body mass/tarsus length). We measured birds' dietary intake by weighing the amount of food (poultry diet and apple) that we gave to birds immediately following an experimental session and then reweighing the bowl and any remnants in the cage when we removed the bowl at the start of the food deprivation period for the following session on the next day. Since this was a noninvasive measure, we did this on a daily basis (see 
   <a rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec" href="#appsec1">Appendix</a> for further details). The subcutaneous fat reserves were estimated at 20 °C and at 6 °C using the BWG scale by an experienced ringer who was blind to the experimental manipulations (
   <a rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib47">Redfern &amp; Clark 2001</a>). Fat reserves were scored between 1500 and 1600 hours to detect differences in mass gain during the day (see 
   <a rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec" href="#appsec1">Appendix</a> for further details). Finally, we measured activity by analysing 2 min of video taken randomly from eight sessions selected at 20 °C and 6 °C and counting the jumps from the perches to the ground that occurred during that period.
