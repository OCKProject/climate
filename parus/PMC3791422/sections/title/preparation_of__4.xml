 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Standard mealworms of a similar mass (19–21 mg) were injected with different solutions to make them either defended or undefended. Undefended prey were injected with 0.04 ml of water and defended prey were injected with 0.04 ml of 2% quinine sulphate solution (Quinine Sulfate, Sigma-Aldrich Q0132). Prey were injected with the same amount of solution to ensure that they were visually identical. The solutions were injected through the mouthparts of the mealworm using a hypodermic needle. Quinine is aversive to birds and is commonly used at low concentrations as a repellent in learning experiments with a range of different avian species (e.g. black-capped chickadees,
