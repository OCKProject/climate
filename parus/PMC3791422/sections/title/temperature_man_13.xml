 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To investigate the effect of temperature on the ingestion of defended prey, we initially pooled the data from across the temperature manipulation phase and calculated the mean number of defended prey eaten at each temperature for each bird. We used this as our dependent variable and ran a general linear model with temperature as a covariate and bird as a random factor (
  <a rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib6">Barnett et al. 2012</a>). We found that as temperature decreased, the number of defended prey eaten increased (

  <sub>1,71</sub> = 12.76, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.001; 
  <a rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>), although birds also differed in their responses to changing temperature (
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>7,71</sub> = 45.21, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001; 
  <a rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>). The effect of temperature was also seen when we split the data set into a ‘temperature decreasing’ (days 8–21; see 
  <a rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>) and a ‘temperature increasing’ (days 22–27) phase (temperature decreasing: 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>1,55</sub> = 7.99, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.007; temperature increasing: 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>1,39</sub> = 5.25, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.027).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since birds varied in their sensitivity to changing temperature, that is, the degree to which they altered their ingestion of defended prey in response to decreasing temperature (
  <a rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>), we investigated whether predator energetic state could explain this variation. For each bird, we performed a linear regression between temperature and the number of defended prey eaten in each session to obtain a coefficient for the relationship for each bird (individual regression lines for each bird are shown in 
  <a rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>). We then correlated the regression coefficients with our initial measures of body condition for each bird taken at 20 °C prior to the start of the temperature manipulation phase. We found a significant negative correlation between the regression coefficient and body mass (Pearson correlation: 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = −0.77, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.03; 
  <a rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#fig4">Fig. 4</a>), meaning that heavier birds increased their ingestion of defended prey more as temperature declined, that is, they were more sensitive to temperature change. We also found a near-significant negative correlation between temperature sensitivity and body condition (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = −0.69, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.06), but no correlation with either fat score (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = −0.54, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.17) or dietary intake (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.26, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.54). Taken together, these results suggest that initial body mass (and possibly also condition) affected the degree to which birds increased their intake of defended prey in response to changes in temperature. This could have been the result of heavier birds carrying less fat reserves or needing to eat more food for basic metabolic processes. However, we found no relationship between initial body mass and either dietary intake (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.03, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.71) or fat scores (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.11, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.43) at 20 °C before the temperature was reduced.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also investigated whether or not our measures of state differed between 20 °C and 6 °C (see 
  <a rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec" href="#appsec1">Appendix</a> for full details of the data collected and used for these analyses). We found no effect of temperature on the birds' masses (mean ± SE = 72.1 ± 1.53 g at 20 °C and 72.6 ± 1.24 g at 6 °C; paired 
  <span class="italic">t</span> test: 
  <span class="italic">t</span>
  <sub>7</sub> = −0.0.88, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.41), fat scores (mean ± SE = 2.38 ± 0.18 at 20 °C and 2.31 ± 0.16 at 6 °C; Wilcoxon signed-ranks test: 
  <span class="italic">Z</span> = −0.58, 
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 8, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.56) or dietary intake (mean ± SE = 37.7 ± 1.44 g at 20 °C and 34.9 ± 1.86 g at 6 °C; paired 
  <span class="italic">t</span> test: 
  <span class="italic">t</span>
  <sub>7</sub> = 1.75, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.12). However, we did find that birds jumped in their cages less and were less active at 6 °C compared to 20 °C (independent samples 
  <span class="italic">t</span> test: 
  <span class="italic">t</span>
  <sub>14</sub> = 2.85, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.01; 
  <a rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#fig5">Fig. 5</a>). Therefore, lowering the temperature appeared to reduce birds' movement rather than increasing their dietary intake, mass or fat stores.
