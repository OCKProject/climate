  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> spp. and 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> spp. across altitudes. The parasite prevalence in high‐altitude Himalayan sites is mainly driven by migrant hosts which move between altitudes or to the plains, and thereby encounter more diverse parasite and vector faunas compared with the resident counterparts occurring at high altitude which do not migrate to low altitudes. Avian haemosporidian parasites represent a complex, spatially heterogeneous host–parasite system, and their occurrence is strongly influenced and limited by environmental factors that affect vector prevalence and distribution. Seasonal movement of birds between altitudes or to the plains certainly adds to the complexity of the host–parasite associations, which warrants further investigation by longitudinal study across Himalayan sites.
