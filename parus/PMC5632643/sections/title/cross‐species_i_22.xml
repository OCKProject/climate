 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many lineages observed in the 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> tree were host specific at a family level, which appears to be a trait in 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> species where the host ranges are often restricted to a limited number of closely related host species (Atkinson &amp; van Riper, 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0003">1991</a>; Bennett &amp; Peirce, 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0009">1988</a>; Perez‐Tris et al., 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0043">2007</a>; Savage &amp; Greiner, 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0052">2004</a>). Among resident species sampled, 
  <span class="italic">Zosterops palpebrosus</span> (Oriental white‐eye) was the most infected species with an assemblage of 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> lineages which appears to have diversified within the Zosteropidae family. Among migrants, 
  <span class="italic">Acrocephalus dumetorum</span> was the most infected species with a diverse assemblage of 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus belopolskyi</span>, which have a relatively low genetic distance from prevalent and widespread parasites of migrant Acrocephalids and Sylvids in Europe and African (Ishtiaq, 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0027">2017</a>). This appears to be polymorphism within 
  <span class="italic">H. belopolyskyi</span> clade. The 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> lineage ACDUM1 was shared with a pink‐browed rosefinch 
  <span class="italic">Carpodacus rodochroa,</span> a high‐altitude species which points toward potential cross‐species transmission; however, as our study utilized only PCR, and not microscopy technique, there are several caveats associated with this methodology that could bias our lineage sharing results. First, the development of haemosporidians can be abortive in resistant or partly resistant hosts, resulting in no development of gametocytes (Cannell et al., 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0014">2013</a>; Valkinũas, Ashford, Bensch, Killick‐Kendrick, &amp; Perkins, 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0058">2011</a>). Second, the low‐frequency infection could be spillover infections in resistant hosts leading to a dead end for parasite transmission, and indeed, this was confirmed with microscopy by the absence of gametocytes. Nonetheless, there was no sharing of parasite lineages between foothills and high‐altitude sites, which suggests demarcation of parasite transmission zones with a varying vector and thermal gradient. In 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> tree, many lineages were generalists that infected multiple host species across multiple families.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, this is the first molecular study of a tropical Himalayan bird community that reveals a high diversity of 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> lineages. While there was no seasonal variation in the prevalence of either 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> or 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span>, thus the lack of thermal constraints appears to facilitate year‐round transmission of these parasites. Many 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> lineages were host specific and have not been reported previously. These new data contribute to our understanding of seasonal dynamics of temperature, mosquito abundance, and thermal constraints in parasite transmission in the tropics. They also provide a basis for furthering our understanding on the ecology and epidemiology of avian malaria and the spread of disease across Himalayan bird communities, which may not generally be exposed to vector and parasites throughout the year. This can have important potential implications for the risk and susceptibility to infection for naïve resident birds at higher altitudes.
