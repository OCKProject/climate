 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also used GLMMs to assess whether infection prevalence in each host species was influenced by species‐specific traits, including avian abundance, mean species body mass (g), and migratory status as fixed effect and avian families with ≥5 individuals with bird taxonomy (species nested in genus and genus nested in family). We derived abundance estimates for each species by a single experienced observer (CB) recording the maximum number of birds seen on a given fixed circuit on dates within each week. We ensured that for any given week, at least one circuit of the nature trail within the WII campus was completed, but in some weeks, it may have been as many as 3–4 times. For any species known to be migratory or simply scarce, the exact date was noted, but for the remainder, simply the maximum figure seen during the week was noted. This may sound obvious, but by doing this, on a weekly (or even monthly) basis, it not only flags up when migrants are arriving, but in some cases, it identifies species that are not generally known to be migrants, but clearly do undergo at least localized movements. This presence/absence information can be a first step to detecting such localized seasonal movements. The averaged weekly maximum count for two visits per month was used as an index of abundance of each species. Abundance estimates (which are effectively an index for many of the more cryptic species) represent the predicted number of individuals of a given species detected in ~2.5 hr of surveying.</p>
