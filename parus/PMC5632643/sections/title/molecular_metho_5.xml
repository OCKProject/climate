 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">DNA extractions were performed using phenol chloroform extraction method (Sambrook, Fritsch, &amp; Maniatis, 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0050">1987</a>) or ammonium acetate protocol (Nicholls, Double, Rowell, &amp; Magrath, 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0039">2000</a>). We screened all bird samples for the combined presence of parasites of the genera 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol designed to amplify a 160‐bp fragment of mitochondrial ribosomal RNA gene (rRNA) of avian haemosporidians (213F/372R; Beadell &amp; Fleischer, 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0006">2005</a>) followed by a restriction enzyme‐based assay.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For samples that screened positive for the 16S rRNA gene fragment of the parasites, we amplified the cytochrome 
  <span class="italic">b</span> (cyt‐
  <span class="italic">b</span>) gene fragments ranging from 533, 477, or 351 bp following Beadell et al. (
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0007">2004</a>), Hellgren, Waldenström, and Bensch (
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0026">2004</a>), and Ishtiaq et al. (
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0028">2006</a>), respectively. Each plate accompanied a parasite positive control and also a negative control to examine for any potential contamination. We screened all parasite‐negative samples for bird DNA (for cyt‐
  <span class="italic">b</span> gene) following Dumbacher, Pratt, and Fleischer (
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0023">2003</a>). The resulting PCR products were then sequenced in both directions. Sequences were assembled, aligned, and edited using SEQUENCHER version 5.2. We then identified sequences to genus using their closest sequence matches in GenBank or MalAvi database (Bensch, Hellgren, &amp; Pérez‐Tris, 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0010">2009</a>). Novel lineages were defined as lineages that differed by one or more nucleotides from any lineage deposited in GenBank prior to this study. All sequences are deposited in GenBank accession numbers: MF565807‐MF565836 (Table
