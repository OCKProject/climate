  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At each location, we set up 10–12 mist nets in high bird activity locations, often along forest edges, footpaths, or off‐road nature trails. Mist nets were 38‐mm gauge, 2.6 m tall, and 6, 9, or 12 m long. Birds were sampled between 0540 and 1230, and nets were checked every 5–10 min. Birds were identified to species according to Rasmussen and Anderton (
   <a rid="ece33319-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0047">2005</a>) and ringed. Wing length was measured (maximum wing‐cord) with a steel rule (±1 mm) and body mass recorded with an electronic balance (±0.1 g). All birds were measured by F.I. Captured individuals were released at the site immediately after processing. We sampled 20–40 μl of bird blood from the sub‐brachial wing vein (never exceeding 1% of the individual's body weight). All samples were stored in SET Buffer (20–40 μl in 500 μl buffer 0.15 mol/L NaCl, 0.05 mol/L Tris, 0.001 mol/L EDTA, pH 8.0) at room temperature and subsequently transferred to −20°C.

For all sampling, the traps were suspended within the forest canopy, no more than 2 m from the ground on trees (DiMenna et al.,

Traps were operated overnight starting at 1,800 hr and picked up next morning at 0700 hr. Mosquitoes were collected from traps in the morning and stored at –20°C before identification. The species and sex of all mosquito samples were determined using a morphological mosquito‐identification key (Barraud,

   <a rid="ece33319-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0031">2007</a>). As only female mosquitoes are responsible for parasite transmission, we provide estimates of abundance for female mosquitoes. Daily temperature records were obtained from the on‐site WII weather station in Dehradun.

Four million generations were discarded as burn‐in from each run, leaving a posterior distribution of 32,000 trees.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also used GLMMs to assess whether infection prevalence in each host species was influenced by species‐specific traits, including avian abundance, mean species body mass (g), and migratory status as fixed effect and avian families with ≥5 individuals with bird taxonomy (species nested in genus and genus nested in family). We derived abundance estimates for each species by a single experienced observer (CB) recording the maximum number of birds seen on a given fixed circuit on dates within each week. We ensured that for any given week, at least one circuit of the nature trail within the WII campus was completed, but in some weeks, it may have been as many as 3–4 times. For any species known to be migratory or simply scarce, the exact date was noted, but for the remainder, simply the maximum figure seen during the week was noted. This may sound obvious, but by doing this, on a weekly (or even monthly) basis, it not only flags up when migrants are arriving, but in some cases, it identifies species that are not generally known to be migrants, but clearly do undergo at least localized movements. This presence/absence information can be a first step to detecting such localized seasonal movements. The averaged weekly maximum count for two visits per month was used as an index of abundance of each species. Abundance estimates (which are effectively an index for many of the more cryptic species) represent the predicted number of individuals of a given species detected in ~2.5 hr of surveying.</p>

We used GLMMs to assess whether individual infection was influenced by season, mosquito abundance, or average monthly temperature as fixed effects, and bird taxonomy (species nested in genus and genus nested in family) as a random effect. Mosquito abundance was the mean number of mosquitoes caught, and this was calculated to provide comparability with months where mosquitoes were trapped less than four nights in a month. Pearson's product–moment correlations (
   <span class="italic">r</span>) were run between mosquito abundance and temperature. To explore variation in parasite prevalence, we plotted correlation between prevalence in winter against prevalence in spring–summer, including the bird species for which at least four individuals were sampled in both seasons.
