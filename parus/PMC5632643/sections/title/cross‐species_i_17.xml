 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using PCR‐based detection methods, 37 cyt‐
  <span class="italic">b</span> sequences of parasite lineages were isolated, with a high proportion of infections of 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> spp.
  <span class="italic">,</span> representing 27 lineages whereas 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> spp. had just 10 lineages (GenBank accession numbers are listed in Table 
  <a rid="ece33319-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece33319-sup-0001">S1</a>). 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> mitochondrial lineage relationships are presented independently in Figures 
  <a rid="ece33319-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33319-fig-0007">7</a> and 
  <a rid="ece33319-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33319-fig-0008">8</a>, respectively. Most of the lineages found in the resident foothill birds were locally transmitted based on their presence in young birds hatched on‐site as well as the presence of lineages in the birds throughout the year. 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> lineages found in the resident birds have been recorded earlier in host species with varying taxonomic affiliations whereas most of the 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> lineages recorded showed no overlap with parasite communities sampled elsewhere and shared within a host family. In particular, one 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> lineage (ACDUM1) sampled in Palearctic migrant warbler (
  <span class="italic">Acrocephalus dumetorum</span>) showed cross‐species infection with resident Himalayan species sampled at a high‐altitude site.
