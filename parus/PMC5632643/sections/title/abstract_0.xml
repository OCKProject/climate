 <p>We examined seasonal prevalence in avian haemosporidians (
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span>) in migrant and resident birds in western Himalaya, India. We investigated how infection with haemosporidians in avian hosts is associated with temporal changes in temperature and mosquito abundance along with host abundance and life‐history traits (body mass). Using molecular methods for parasite detection and sequencing partial cytochrome 
  <span class="italic">b</span> gene, 12 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> and 27 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> lineages were isolated. Our 1‐year study from December 2008 to December 2009 in tropical Himalayan foothills revealed a lack of seasonal variation in 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> spp. prevalence in birds despite a strong correlation between mosquito abundance and temperature. The probability of infection with 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> decreased with increase in temperature. Total parasite prevalence and specifically 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> prevalence showed an increase with average avian body mass. In addition, total prevalence exhibited a U‐shaped relationship with avian host abundance. There was no difference in prevalence of 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> spp. or 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> spp. across altitudes; parasite prevalence in high‐altitude locations was mainly driven by the seasonal migrants. One 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> lineage showed cross‐species infections between migrant and resident birds. This is the first molecular study in the tropical Himalayan bird community that emphasizes the importance of studying seasonal variation in parasite prevalence. Our study provides a basis for further evolutionary study on the epidemiology of avian malaria and spread of disease across Himalayan bird communities, which may not have been exposed to vectors and parasites throughout the year, with consequential implications to the risk of infection to naïve resident birds in high altitude.
