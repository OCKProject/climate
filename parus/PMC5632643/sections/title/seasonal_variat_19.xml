 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seasonal variation in parasite prevalence</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our year‐round study shows the lack of seasonal variation in parasite prevalence and its association with tropical climate which allows for the presence of mosquitoes and other hematophagous arthropod vectors and therefore facilitates avian malaria transmission throughout the year. Human malaria, however, shows a seasonal pattern in the Himalayan foothills with peak transmission from July–October (Dhiman, Chavan, Pant, &amp; Pahwa, 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0019">2011</a>). We did not find any peak in prevalence in spring due to a relapse of the previous year's infections (Beaudoin et al., 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0008">1971</a>), which coincides with a peak in vector abundance (Atkinson &amp; van Riper, 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0003">1991</a>). In temperate regions, most 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> spp. show peak prevalence in the spring months when vectors (e.g., 
  <span class="italic">Culicoides</span> spp.) become abundant or in the summer with acute infections in newly recruited immunologically naive juveniles (Cranston et al., 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0018">1987</a>; Klei &amp; DeGiusti, 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0030">1975</a>; Marshall, 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0036">1938</a>). It is very difficult to differentiate recrudescence and relapse in parasitemia in the tropics as the optimal conditions without any thermal constraints facilitate parasite transmission throughout the year. Furthermore, our use of sensitive PCR‐based screening methods provides a better estimate of parasite prevalence (Ishtiaq et al., 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0029">2017</a>) and suggests that 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> spp. and 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> spp. were indeed present in the blood throughout the year without undergoing a latent (dormant) phase where parasitemia survive in the tissues of avian hosts (Atkinson &amp; van Riper, 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0003">1991</a>). In temperate regions, dormancy is thought to minimize clearance from the host and to seasonally reduce virulence, thereby enhancing overwinter survival of the parasite (Worms, 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0062">1972</a>). Re‐emergence of the parasite coincides with a peak in vector abundance. As our study is PCR‐based, we appreciate that parasite intensity data can shed more light on the dynamics of haemosporidian emergence with season providing insights into relapse of parasitemia by the presence of infective stages (gametocytes). The lack of temporal variation in parasite lineages across bird species suggests time‐independent species‐specific prevalence levels despite the change in temperature and mosquito species composition and abundance around the year.
