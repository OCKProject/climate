 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mosquito sampling was conducted during January–December 2009 four times in each month using standard Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) miniature black light (UV) traps without dry ice baits. For all sampling, the traps were suspended within the forest canopy, no more than 2 m from the ground on trees (DiMenna et al.,

  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0040">2013</a>) around avian blood sampling (mist‐netting) sites. Traps were operated overnight starting at 1,800 hr and picked up next morning at 0700 hr. Mosquitoes were collected from traps in the morning and stored at –20°C before identification. The species and sex of all mosquito samples were determined using a morphological mosquito‐identification key (Barraud,

  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0016">1933</a>), and sorted by species and date followed by DNA barcoding technique (Kumar, Rajavel, Natarajan, &amp; Jambulingam, 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0031">2007</a>). As only female mosquitoes are responsible for parasite transmission, we provide estimates of abundance for female mosquitoes. Daily temperature records were obtained from the on‐site WII weather station in Dehradun.
