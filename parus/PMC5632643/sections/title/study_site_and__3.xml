 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From December 2008 to December 2009, we conducted bird blood sampling in Dehradun [DUN: 30.17409°N, 77.582535°E; 640 m above sea level (a.s.l.) inside the campus of Wildlife Institute of India, 
  <span class="italic">n </span>=
  <span class="italic"> </span>413]. The Wildlife Institute of India (WII) campus is nearly 200 acres of mixed habitat in the southern valley of Dehradun (Uttarakhand). To compare the patterns in parasite prevalence with high‐altitude breeding birds with foothills in April‐May 2009, in addition to DUN (
  <span class="italic">n </span>=
  <span class="italic"> </span>38), we conducted sampling across three additional sites in forested habitat ranging between 1,800 and 3,200 m altitudes within Uttarakhand state, 2) Magra [MAG: N30.45587°E78.16158°; 1,800 m a.s.l.;

  <span class="italic"> </span>12], and 4) Shokharakh (SHOK: N30.47860°E79.217980°; 3,100 m a.s.l.;

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At each location, we set up 10–12 mist nets in high bird activity locations, often along forest edges, footpaths, or off‐road nature trails. Mist nets were 38‐mm gauge, 2.6 m tall, and 6, 9, or 12 m long. Birds were sampled between 0540 and 1230, and nets were checked every 5–10 min. Birds were identified to species according to Rasmussen and Anderton (
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0047">2005</a>) and ringed. Wing length was measured (maximum wing‐cord) with a steel rule (±1 mm) and body mass recorded with an electronic balance (±0.1 g). All birds were measured by F.I. Captured individuals were released at the site immediately after processing. We sampled 20–40 μl of bird blood from the sub‐brachial wing vein (never exceeding 1% of the individual's body weight). All samples were stored in SET Buffer (20–40 μl in 500 μl buffer 0.15 mol/L NaCl, 0.05 mol/L Tris, 0.001 mol/L EDTA, pH 8.0) at room temperature and subsequently transferred to −20°C.
