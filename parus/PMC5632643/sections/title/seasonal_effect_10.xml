 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Samples were ordered by the season collected (spring, summer, monsoon, autumn, and winter). We used GLMMs to assess whether individual infection was influenced by season, mosquito abundance, or average monthly temperature as fixed effects, and bird taxonomy (species nested in genus and genus nested in family) as a random effect. Mosquito abundance was the mean number of mosquitoes caught, and this was calculated to provide comparability with months where mosquitoes were trapped less than four nights in a month. Pearson's product–moment correlations (
  <span class="italic">r</span>) were run between mosquito abundance and temperature. To explore variation in parasite prevalence, we plotted correlation between prevalence in winter against prevalence in spring–summer, including the bird species for which at least four individuals were sampled in both seasons.
