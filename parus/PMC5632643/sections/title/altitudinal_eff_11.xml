 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used GLMMs to assess whether individual infection was influenced by altitude and migratory status (resident, seasonal migrant, and long‐distance migrant) as fixed effects, and bird taxonomy (species nested in genus and genus nested in family) as a random effect.</p>
