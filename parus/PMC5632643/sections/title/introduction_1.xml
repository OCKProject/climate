 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Parasite prevalence is a fundamental measure required to understand the temporal and spatial variations and epidemiology of infectious diseases (Ishtiaq, Rao, Huang, &amp; Bensch,

  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0061">2007</a>). The degree to which parasite prevalence varies depends on a suite of underlying mechanisms such as demographical (age, density, sex; Isaksson et al.

  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0604" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0604">2013</a>). The seasonal dynamics and geographic distributions of vectorborne parasites are strongly governed by seasonal changes in vector abundance (Chavasse et al., 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0015">1999</a>; Emerson, Bailey, Mahdi, Walraven, &amp; Lindsay,

  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0056">2001</a>). For example, seasonal variation in mosquito abundance in response to annual variation in temperature and rainfall can cause strong seasonal patterns of disease incidence in malaria‐epidemic regions, such as the Kenyan highlands (Hay et al. 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0025">2002</a>). However, the role of temperature and vectors in explaining seasonal patterns in avian haemosporidian prevalence has been relatively under studied (see LaPointe et al. 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0602" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0602">2005</a>; Medeiros et al.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Avian haemosporidians in the genera 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> (Phylum Apicomplexa, Order Haemosporida) are globally distributed vector‐mediated parasites found in a broad range of birds (Valkinũas, 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0059">2005</a>). 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> parasites reproduce sexually in dipteran vectors—culicid mosquitoes and ceratopogonid midges, respectively (Valkinũas, 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0059">2005</a>)—and use birds as intermediate hosts in which they undergo asexual reproduction. Parasites in both genera have been shown to be pathogenic to their avian hosts (Atkinson &amp; van Riper, 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0003">1991</a>; Bennett et al. 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0500" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0500">1993</a>; Warner 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0700" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0700">1968</a>) with deleterious effects on health and reproductive success (e.g., Marzal, De Lope, Navarro, &amp; Møller, 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0037">2005</a>) and body condition (Valkinũas, Zickus, Shapoval, &amp; Iezhova, 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0060">2006</a>), and possibly lead to extinction in immunologically naive hosts (Atkinson, Dusek, Woods, &amp; Iko, 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0001">2000</a>; Samuel et al., 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0051">2011</a>). Thus, these parasites play a significant selective factor in bird populations and exert strong selection pressure on host life‐history traits.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The incubation period of malaria parasites within mosquitoes is exquisitely temperature sensitive (Paaijmans, Read, &amp; Thomas, 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0042">2009</a>); therefore, temperature is a major determinant of malaria transmission and persistence in host populations (LaPointe et al. 2005). Low ambient temperatures prevent sporogonic development of malaria parasites within vectors, influencing their altitudinal distributions (LaPointe, Goff, &amp; Atkinson, 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0033">2010</a>). Similarly, change in habitat composition from wet to dry due to climatic shift may alter both the geographic range and local abundance of malaria pathogens because their vectors (mosquitoes, Ceratopogonid midges, and Simuliid flies) require wet habitat to complete their life cycle (Valkinũas, 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0059">2005</a>). Furthermore, owing to this vector dependency, both human (Hay et al., 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0025">2002</a>) and avian (Cosgrove, Wood, &amp; Sheldon, 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0017">2008</a>) 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> show a marked seasonality in transmission which appear to result in skewed prevalence estimates in winters. However, such stark variation in seasonal patterns ought to be more prominent in temperate regions where a peak in malaria prevalence occurs in late summer and autumn when the proportion of juveniles coincides with a rise in vector populations (see Beaudoin, Applegate, David, &amp; McLean, 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0008">1971</a>; Cranston, Ramsdale, Snow, &amp; White, 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0018">1987</a>; Marshall, 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0036">1938</a>). In tropical and subtropical climates, malaria parasites transmission can occur year‐round (Valkinũas, 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0059">2005</a>). In Hawaii, for example, malaria transmission occurs after the breeding season as chronically infected native birds serve as year‐round reservoir of disease (LaPointe, Atkinson, &amp; Samuel, 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0032">2012</a>). However, within tropical and subtropical areas, transmission will not occur at very high altitudes or during the cold season. There is a lack of quantitative studies which limits our capacity to understand and predict such changes in other threatened ecosystems and has largely remained unexplored in the tropics and in particular in the Indian subcontinent, despite it being the major staging and wintering ground of the Central Asian Flyway populations.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Himalayan mountain range is one of the most species‐rich areas in the world, harboring about 8% of the world's bird species (Price et al. 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0703" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0703">2003</a>). The high species diversity is due to species turnover associated with altitudinal variation in habitat, as well as variation in species composition along the range (Martens &amp; Eck 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0606" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0606">1995</a>; Price et al. 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0703" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0703">2003</a>) and the possibility that such regions are buffered from climatic extremes, for example, because habitats and species can shift altitudinally in response to climate change (Fjeldså 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0506" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0506">1995</a>; Fjeldså &amp; Rahbek 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0507" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0507">2006</a>). The Indian western Himalaya is species rich but remains a relatively understudied biogeographic region with only a handful of studies on birds (e.g., Price 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0702" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0702">1991</a>), plants (Oommen and Shankar 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0701" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0701">2005</a>), and mosquitoes (Devi and Jauhari 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0501" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0501">2004</a>), with no previous studies on the dynamics of avian diseases and their vectors. Given the effect of climate and host demography which play a crucial role in determining parasite prevalence, as well as the dynamics of parasite transmission and host migration patterns both of which can increase the risk of infection. Many migrants move between altitudes or to the plains, and thereby encounter diverse parasite and vector faunas compared with the resident counterparts which remain at high altitudes throughout. Given that suitable vectors are present to transmit and maintain the infection, migrants can form an effective bridge for parasites between wintering and breeding grounds, hence increasing the risk of infection to naïve resident birds at the higher altitudes.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this first molecular study on 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> prevalence across resident and migrant birds, we aimed to explore the seasonal dynamics in parasite prevalence and its association with seasonal environmental drivers and host life‐history traits. Specifically, we examine (1) how mosquito abundance and temperature relate with 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> spp. prevalence in foothills birds; (2) the effect of altitude on haemosporidian prevalence and diversity; and (3) the extent of cross‐species infections between resident and migrant birds.
