 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study is the first seasonal study in the tropics which captures the absence of seasonal pattern in prevalence of avian 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> spp. These findings are in contrast with the Beaudoin et al. (
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0008">1971</a>) model for temperate areas that predicts a within‐year bimodal pattern of spring and autumn peaks with absence of infection in winter. Our 1‐year molecular study in tropical Himalayan foothills revealed a strong correlation between mosquito abundance and temperature; however, there was a lack of seasonal variation in 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> spp. prevalence. There was no effect of body condition on parasite prevalence; however, log avian abundance contributed to variation in total haemosporidian prevalence. 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> spp. prevalence showed no variation across seasons and life‐history traits. Migrant birds were slightly more infected than resident species across altitudes.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our year‐round study shows the lack of seasonal variation in parasite prevalence and its association with tropical climate which allows for the presence of mosquitoes and other hematophagous arthropod vectors and therefore facilitates avian malaria transmission throughout the year. Human malaria, however, shows a seasonal pattern in the Himalayan foothills with peak transmission from July–October (Dhiman, Chavan, Pant, &amp; Pahwa, 
   <a rid="ece33319-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0019">2011</a>). We did not find any peak in prevalence in spring due to a relapse of the previous year's infections (Beaudoin et al., 
   <a rid="ece33319-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0008">1971</a>), which coincides with a peak in vector abundance (Atkinson &amp; van Riper, 
   <a rid="ece33319-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0003">1991</a>). In temperate regions, most 
   <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> spp. show peak prevalence in the spring months when vectors (e.g., 
   <span class="italic">Culicoides</span> spp.) become abundant or in the summer with acute infections in newly recruited immunologically naive juveniles (Cranston et al., 
   <a rid="ece33319-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0018">1987</a>; Klei &amp; DeGiusti, 
   <a rid="ece33319-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0030">1975</a>; Marshall, 
   <a rid="ece33319-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0036">1938</a>). It is very difficult to differentiate recrudescence and relapse in parasitemia in the tropics as the optimal conditions without any thermal constraints facilitate parasite transmission throughout the year. Furthermore, our use of sensitive PCR‐based screening methods provides a better estimate of parasite prevalence (Ishtiaq et al., 
   <a rid="ece33319-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0029">2017</a>) and suggests that 
   <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> spp. and 
   <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> spp. were indeed present in the blood throughout the year without undergoing a latent (dormant) phase where parasitemia survive in the tissues of avian hosts (Atkinson &amp; van Riper, 
   <a rid="ece33319-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0003">1991</a>). In temperate regions, dormancy is thought to minimize clearance from the host and to seasonally reduce virulence, thereby enhancing overwinter survival of the parasite (Worms, 
   <a rid="ece33319-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0062">1972</a>). Re‐emergence of the parasite coincides with a peak in vector abundance. As our study is PCR‐based, we appreciate that parasite intensity data can shed more light on the dynamics of haemosporidian emergence with season providing insights into relapse of parasitemia by the presence of infective stages (gametocytes). The lack of temporal variation in parasite lineages across bird species suggests time‐independent species‐specific prevalence levels despite the change in temperature and mosquito species composition and abundance around the year.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Effect of host life‐history traits and environmental drivers on parasite prevalence</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prevalence of parasites varied significantly across host species and families. Of the three species‐level traits, we found no significant relationship between host body condition and infection status. However, both host abundance and mean body mass influenced the parasite prevalence in the foothills Himalayan bird community. These findings are similar to patterns in prevalence observed in temperate regions where species with the large body mass and at greater abundance are known to facilitate transmission and increase parasite prevalence (Matthews, Ellis, Roberts, Ricklefs, &amp; Collins, 2015; Scheuerlein &amp; Ricklefs, 
   <a rid="ece33319-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0053">2004</a>). Large birds’ surface area provides more biting opportunities (Atkinson &amp; van Riper, 
   <a rid="ece33319-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0003">1991</a>) and emits more carbon dioxide which attracts host‐seeking vectors (Scheuerlein &amp; Ricklefs, 
   <a rid="ece33319-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0053">2004</a>). Epidemiological theory predicts that host density plays a central role in transmission of directly transmitted parasites (Anderson and May 
   <a rid="ece33319-bib-0503" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0503">1978</a>). The positive relationship between host abundance and parasite prevalence is consistent with results from Dobson (
   <a rid="ece33319-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0021">2004</a>) and Brown et al. (
   <a rid="ece33319-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0013">2001</a>). In particular, the U‐shaped relationship between host abundance and parasite prevalence was similar to the temperate study by Ricklefs et al. (
   <a rid="ece33319-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0048">2005</a>) where the most abundant host species had the highest infection prevalence followed by the least abundant host species. The high prevalence in our study was primarily driven by 
   <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> spp. in highly abundant hosts: Zosteropidae, Acrocephalidae, Timaliidae, Cisticolidae families, whereas the least common host were migrant 
   <span class="italic">Sylvid</span> warblers. High prevalence of 
   <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> in hosts with high abundance can be explained by two underlying mechanisms: (1) high host‐to‐vector transmission rates in a densely populated community (Brown et al., 
   <a rid="ece33319-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0013">2001</a>); (2) large numbers of susceptible hosts within a community will increase parasite transmission (Keesing et al. 
   <a rid="ece33319-bib-0601" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0601">2006</a>). In our study, the high infection prevalence was a result of host‐specific 
   <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> lineages which were shared within phylogenetically closely related species (see Ishtiaq, 
   <a rid="ece33319-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0027">2017</a>). In contrast, Medeiros et al. (
   <a rid="ece33319-bib-0609" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0609">2015</a>) found abundant hosts were more often bitten by mosquito vectors and were also more likely to be infected by 
   <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> parasites compared with less abundant hosts. In the Himalayan bird community, the vector–host encounter rates contribute to the positive relationships between host abundance and parasite prevalence; however, the temperature and mosquito abundance showed a negative effect on the 
   <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> spp. prevalence. The seasonal dynamics in parasite prevalence are a function of vector–host interactions leading to the transmission of parasites and vector abundance, host specificity, and ecological requirements of the vectors (van Riper et al. 
   <a rid="ece33319-bib-0607" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0607">1986</a>). Temperature drives the transmission probability of parasites, which might be optimal in temperate regions only in summer, facilitating an increase in 
   <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> prevalence (e.g., Mederios et al. 2015). However, even in our tropical site, suboptimal conditions including the temperature threshold above which parasite cannot develop to infective stage within mosquito for a long period (e.g., 30°C for 
   <span class="italic">P. relictum</span>; LaPointe et al., 
   <a rid="ece33319-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0033">2010</a>), could result in a decrease in parasite prevalence. Temperature is an important determinant in malaria transmission, influencing both mosquito and parasite biology not only through variation in average temperature, but also by the extent of fluctuation in the daily temperature throughout the day (Blanford et al., 
   <a rid="ece33319-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0011">2013</a>; Paaijmans et al., 
   <a rid="ece33319-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0041">2010</a>) and noting that warmer temperatures reduces vectorial capacity of mosquitoes (Paaijmans et al., 
   <a rid="ece33319-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0042">2009</a>). Given that incubation period of 
   <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> spp. within the mosquito is highly sensitive to a temperature threshold with development completely blocked under 15°C and over 30°C, thus potential of 
   <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> spp. transmission declines with increased temperature, despite a strong correlation between mosquito abundance and temperature.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Effect of altitude and seasonal migration on parasite prevalence</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to studies in wet tropics and temperate regions (Atkinson et al.,

   <a rid="ece33319-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0063">2012</a>) on altitudinal variation in haemosporidian distribution in bird community to single species model, we found no change in prevalence of 
   <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> spp. and 
   <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> spp. across altitudes. The parasite prevalence in high‐altitude Himalayan sites is mainly driven by migrant hosts which move between altitudes or to the plains, and thereby encounter more diverse parasite and vector faunas compared with the resident counterparts occurring at high altitude which do not migrate to low altitudes. Avian haemosporidian parasites represent a complex, spatially heterogeneous host–parasite system, and their occurrence is strongly influenced and limited by environmental factors that affect vector prevalence and distribution. Seasonal movement of birds between altitudes or to the plains certainly adds to the complexity of the host–parasite associations, which warrants further investigation by longitudinal study across Himalayan sites.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many lineages observed in the 
   <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> tree were host specific at a family level, which appears to be a trait in 
   <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> species where the host ranges are often restricted to a limited number of closely related host species (Atkinson &amp; van Riper, 
   <a rid="ece33319-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0003">1991</a>; Bennett &amp; Peirce,

   <a rid="ece33319-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0052">2004</a>). Among resident species sampled, 
   <span class="italic">Zosterops palpebrosus</span> (Oriental white‐eye) was the most infected species with an assemblage of 
   <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> lineages which appears to have diversified within the Zosteropidae family. Among migrants, 
   <span class="italic">Acrocephalus dumetorum</span> was the most infected species with a diverse assemblage of 
   <span class="italic">Haemoproteus belopolskyi</span>, which have a relatively low genetic distance from prevalent and widespread parasites of migrant Acrocephalids and Sylvids in Europe and African (Ishtiaq, 
   <a rid="ece33319-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0027">2017</a>). This appears to be polymorphism within 
   <span class="italic">H. belopolyskyi</span> clade. The 
   <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> lineage ACDUM1 was shared with a pink‐browed rosefinch 
   <span class="italic">Carpodacus rodochroa,</span> a high‐altitude species which points toward potential cross‐species transmission; however, as our study utilized only PCR, and not microscopy technique, there are several caveats associated with this methodology that could bias our lineage sharing results. First, the development of haemosporidians can be abortive in resistant or partly resistant hosts, resulting in no development of gametocytes (Cannell et al., 
   <a rid="ece33319-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0014">2013</a>; Valkinũas, Ashford, Bensch, Killick‐Kendrick, &amp; Perkins, 
   <a rid="ece33319-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0058">2011</a>). Second, the low‐frequency infection could be spillover infections in resistant hosts leading to a dead end for parasite transmission, and indeed, this was confirmed with microscopy by the absence of gametocytes. Nonetheless, there was no sharing of parasite lineages between foothills and high‐altitude sites, which suggests demarcation of parasite transmission zones with a varying vector and thermal gradient. In 
   <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> tree, many lineages were generalists that infected multiple host species across multiple families.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, this is the first molecular study of a tropical Himalayan bird community that reveals a high diversity of 
   <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> lineages. While there was no seasonal variation in the prevalence of either 
   <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> or 
   <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span>, thus the lack of thermal constraints appears to facilitate year‐round transmission of these parasites. Many 
   <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> lineages were host specific and have not been reported previously. These new data contribute to our understanding of seasonal dynamics of temperature, mosquito abundance, and thermal constraints in parasite transmission in the tropics. They also provide a basis for furthering our understanding on the ecology and epidemiology of avian malaria and the spread of disease across Himalayan bird communities, which may not generally be exposed to vector and parasites throughout the year. This can have important potential implications for the risk and susceptibility to infection for naïve resident birds at higher altitudes.
