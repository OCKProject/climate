 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Effect of host life‐history traits and environmental drivers on parasite prevalence</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prevalence of parasites varied significantly across host species and families. Of the three species‐level traits, we found no significant relationship between host body condition and infection status. However, both host abundance and mean body mass influenced the parasite prevalence in the foothills Himalayan bird community. These findings are similar to patterns in prevalence observed in temperate regions where species with the large body mass and at greater abundance are known to facilitate transmission and increase parasite prevalence (Matthews, Ellis, Roberts, Ricklefs, &amp; Collins, 2015; Scheuerlein &amp; Ricklefs, 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0053">2004</a>). Large birds’ surface area provides more biting opportunities (Atkinson &amp; van Riper, 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0003">1991</a>) and emits more carbon dioxide which attracts host‐seeking vectors (Scheuerlein &amp; Ricklefs, 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0053">2004</a>). Epidemiological theory predicts that host density plays a central role in transmission of directly transmitted parasites (Anderson and May 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0503" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0503">1978</a>). The positive relationship between host abundance and parasite prevalence is consistent with results from Dobson (
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0021">2004</a>) and Brown et al. (
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0013">2001</a>). In particular, the U‐shaped relationship between host abundance and parasite prevalence was similar to the temperate study by Ricklefs et al. (
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0048">2005</a>) where the most abundant host species had the highest infection prevalence followed by the least abundant host species. The high prevalence in our study was primarily driven by 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> spp. in highly abundant hosts: Zosteropidae, Acrocephalidae, Timaliidae, Cisticolidae families, whereas the least common host were migrant 
  <span class="italic">Sylvid</span> warblers. High prevalence of 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> in hosts with high abundance can be explained by two underlying mechanisms: (1) high host‐to‐vector transmission rates in a densely populated community (Brown et al., 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0013">2001</a>); (2) large numbers of susceptible hosts within a community will increase parasite transmission (Keesing et al. 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0601" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0601">2006</a>). In our study, the high infection prevalence was a result of host‐specific 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> lineages which were shared within phylogenetically closely related species (see Ishtiaq, 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0027">2017</a>). In contrast, Medeiros et al. (
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0609" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0609">2015</a>) found abundant hosts were more often bitten by mosquito vectors and were also more likely to be infected by 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> parasites compared with less abundant hosts. In the Himalayan bird community, the vector–host encounter rates contribute to the positive relationships between host abundance and parasite prevalence; however, the temperature and mosquito abundance showed a negative effect on the 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> spp. prevalence. The seasonal dynamics in parasite prevalence are a function of vector–host interactions leading to the transmission of parasites and vector abundance, host specificity, and ecological requirements of the vectors (van Riper et al. 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0607" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0607">1986</a>). Temperature drives the transmission probability of parasites, which might be optimal in temperate regions only in summer, facilitating an increase in 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> prevalence (e.g., Mederios et al. 2015). However, even in our tropical site, suboptimal conditions including the temperature threshold above which parasite cannot develop to infective stage within mosquito for a long period (e.g., 30°C for 
  <span class="italic">P. relictum</span>; LaPointe et al., 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0033">2010</a>), could result in a decrease in parasite prevalence. Temperature is an important determinant in malaria transmission, influencing both mosquito and parasite biology not only through variation in average temperature, but also by the extent of fluctuation in the daily temperature throughout the day (Blanford et al., 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0011">2013</a>; Paaijmans et al., 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0041">2010</a>) and noting that warmer temperatures reduces vectorial capacity of mosquitoes (Paaijmans et al., 
  <a rid="ece33319-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33319-bib-0042">2009</a>). Given that incubation period of 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> spp. within the mosquito is highly sensitive to a temperature threshold with development completely blocked under 15°C and over 30°C, thus potential of 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> spp. transmission declines with increased temperature, despite a strong correlation between mosquito abundance and temperature.
