 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The domesticated breeds analysed for SNP and CNV variability were Broilers (BRL; n = 24), and three heritage breeds from different regions of Sweden, namely Kindahöna (KIN; n = 19), Hedemorahöna (HED; n = 20) and Gotlandshöna (GOT; n = 20). All three heritage breeds were created before specialized layer breeds, such as White leghorn, entered Sweden in the later part of the nineteenth century. They have traditionally been used both for egg and meat production and exhibit a large variation in plumage colours. KIN originates from the Östergötland County and exhibits variations in plumage colors, in the number of toes, and in a comb shape. HED originates from the Dalarna County and has a dense plumage suit, which makes individuals well adapted to a cold climate. GOT originates from the small Fårö island, which is close to the Gotland island in the Baltic sea, and is the largest of the three Swedish heritage breeds included in this study. Ross 308 broiler breeder were obtained from a commercial farm. RJF individuals (n = 24 for genotyping; n = 20 for sperm DNA methylation) were from a population maintained in-house for several generations.</p>
