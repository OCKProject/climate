 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Genotype by Sequencing was used for the assessment of genetic variability observed between RJF and the domesticated breeds. We have previously optimized SNP detection through genotype by sequencing using the 
  <span class="italic">PstI</span> enzyme [
  <a rid="CIT0038" href="#CIT0038">38</a>]. For this genotyping, DNA was collected from animals from different breeds, reduced with 
  <span class="italic">PstI</span> digestion, barcoded (to individualize the fragmented DNA), pooled among individuals from the same breeds, and then sequenced in Illumina platform (SciLife Lab, Uppsala, Sweden), following our previously described protocol [
  <a rid="CIT0038" href="#CIT0038">38</a>]. Genetic variability in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variations (CNVs) were assessed between the RJF and the domesticated breeds.
