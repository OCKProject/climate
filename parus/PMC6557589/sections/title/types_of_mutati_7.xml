 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We investigated which point mutations emerged from SNPs occurring in C positions in general (C-SNPs) or in Cs neighbouring Gs (i.e., CpG sites). In each case we considered whether in RJF the C position involved a reference allele (i.e., when C is exclusive or majority in a specific position compared to other bases), represented by C/N, or an alternate allele (i.e., when C is minority in a specific position compared to other bases), represented by D/C. The nomenclature D/C was chosen instead of N to highlight that it represents a degenerate base with a minority presence Cs. Choosing N would have included the case when C is degenerate and majority. The nomenclature C/N, in turn, include Cs fixed as well as Cs present in majority. Remarkably, in all scenarios tested progressive changes in mutation patterns were observed that are concordant with the genetic relatedness of each breed to RJF. Mutation patterns are different depending on whether the mutation originated from C/N or D/C. When SNPs originate from C/N only C/T increases progressively with reduced genetic relatedness to RJF, while T/C, and fixed Cs and Gs decrease progressively (
  <a rid="F0003" href="#F0003">Figure 3(a</a>)). However, when SNPs originate from alternate Cs, both C/T and T/C increase progressively with reduced genetic relatedness to RJF, mainly at the expense of fixed Cs and Gs (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The same analysis was performed considering SNPs related to true CpGs (CpG-SNPs) or to D/CpGs (D/CpG-SNPs). This was based on the expectation that methylation-prone Cs (i.e., in CpG sites) would have different mutation patterns than Cs that are not prone to be methylated. Marked differences were observed in the mutation patterns between CpG- and D/CpG-SNPs. In true CpG-SNPs C/T increases substantially as genetic relatedness to RJF decreases, which occurs at the expense of fixed Cs and Ts (
  <a rid="F0003" href="#F0003">Figure 3(c</a>)). A completely different pattern is observed in D/CpG-SNPs, which are progressively substituted by A/G (mainly) and C/T (to a lesser extent) as genetic relatedness to RJF decreases, which occurs at the detriment of all the fixed bases (
  <a rid="F0003" href="#F0003">Figure 3(d</a>)). Our results show it is not only important in genomic dynamics whether Cs are within CpG sites but also their status as alternate or reference base, since the mutation patterns differ considerably between these two statuses.
