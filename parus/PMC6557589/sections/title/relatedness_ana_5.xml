 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine if RJF indeed locates in a position of ancestry in relation to the other domesticated breeds analysed, a relatedness cladogram was generated using the Japanese quail as the out group. Neighbour-joining clustering was performed on 34,219 common SNPs identified between the Japanese quail and the chicken breeds analysed.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As expected, the results indicate that the current RJF is the closest relative to quails, in a position of ancestry in relation to all other domesticated breeds included (
  <a rid="F0001" href="#F0001">Figure 1(c</a>)). Moreover, also expectedly, BRL appears as the most derived breed. The analysis correctly clustered each individual within the corresponding clade, which indicates the appropriateness of using GBS-generated sequencing data for inferring phylogenetic correlations. Our analysis also shows that among the Swedish breeds evaluated, KIN is the closest related to RJF, while GOT is the most distant (
  <a rid="F0001" href="#F0001">Figure 1(c))</a>. Inbreeding coefficients, F
  <sub>st</sub>, were estimated in the same subset of SNPs (common between the chickens and the Japanese quail) to identify genes that exhibit adaptive divergence in their allelic frequency, which is indicative of natural selection among sub-structured populations [
  <a rid="CIT0040" href="#CIT0040">40</a>]. The F
  <sub>st</sub> coefficients obtained show that almost all SNPs detected between the derived breeds and RJF emerged under neutral evolution (97.5%), while only 2% evolved under balancing selection and 0.6% due to positive selection (
