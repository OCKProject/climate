 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For genotyping DNA was obtained from different sources. In RJF and BRL animals, DNA was collected from whole blood. In animals from the HED and GOT pure line breeds DNA was obtained from blood. In animals from KIN, however, DNA was obtained mostly from bulb tips of archived feathers, and in two samples DNA was obtained from blood.</p>
