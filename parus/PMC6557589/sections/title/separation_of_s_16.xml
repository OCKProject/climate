 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The methylation status in the sperm of RJF was measured in a number of animals (n = 20) in order to determine DNA methylation levels and inter-individual variability in CpGs across the genome. This was further compared to SNPs and CNVs identified between domesticated breeds and RJF. In order to measure DNA methylation in the sperm of RJF, ejaculates were collected from live specimens after cloacal massaging. Sperm samples were then frozen at −20°C until further processing. Sperm cells were then purified. For this, sperm samples were re-suspended in 100 µL PBS and 100 µl of collagenase (850u/mL) and incubated at 37°C for 1 h under rotation. After incubation, the samples were added 1 mL PBS and then sonicated for 5 s at 60% amplitude (Fisher ultra-sonicator attached to a cooling chamber, cup horn, with capacity for eight microfuge tubes). Samples were the subjected to three series of vortexing (30 s), centrifugation (3 min; 4000 g; RT), discarding of the supernatant, and re-suspension in 1 mL PBS. The last re-suspension, however, was in 820 µL of digestion buffer (prepared by mixing 5 mL of 1 M Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 2 mL of 0.5 M EDTA, 5 mL of 10% SDS and 88 mL of DNAse free water). DTT was then added (80 µL; 0.1 M) and the mixture was incubated at 65°C for 15.</p>
