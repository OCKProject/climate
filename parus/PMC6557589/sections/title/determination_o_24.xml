 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A cladogram was elaborated to determine relatedness between the domesticated breeds and RJF, using the Japanese quail (
  <span class="italic">Coturnix japonica</span>) as the outgroup. The sequencing reads from the Japanese quail were retrieved from a previous study [
  <a rid="CIT0078" href="#CIT0078">78</a>]. The Japanese quail sequencing reads were processed in a similar way as for the chicken breeds in regard to the cleaning and filtering criteria. The only difference was that the SNP call was performed using the Samtools v.0.1.19 [
  <a rid="CIT0075" href="#CIT0075">75</a>] program with default parameters. After this, the SNPs were merged with those from the chickens. A relatedness cladogram was then generated using the neighbour joining clustering method [
  <a rid="CIT0079" href="#CIT0079">79</a>] using bootstrap = 100 to determine relatedness between the domesticated chicken breed and RJF. The Japanese quail (
  <span class="italic">Coturnix japonica</span>) was used as the outgroup. The results were then plotted using the ‘ape’ package from the R repository. Additionally, we performed a Fixed Index (F
  <sub>st</sub>) analysis using the LOSITAN [
  <a rid="CIT0080" href="#CIT0080">80</a>] package (with default parameters) to identify SNPs evolving either under neutrality or balancing or positive selection. The F
  <sub>st</sub> analysis was based on 34,218 SNPs that were common among our four domesticated breeds, RJF and the Japanese quail.
