 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using R, we made tables with the positions of all the SNPs by breeds according to our reference or alternative alleles. We merged the SNPs of each breed with the CpGs coverage and dispersion states table. For the CNVs, we took the individual positions of each CNV range within each breed and merged these positions with the CpG table. From these merged files we were able to make all comparisons described in this manuscript in order to determine differences between the observations and expected values.</p>
