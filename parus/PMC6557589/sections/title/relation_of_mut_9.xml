 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We performed Repeat Masker analyses on the SNPs, CpG-SNPs, CNVs and CpG-CNVs found, in order to identify overlaps with categories of repetitive elements. In general, we found a slightly higher representation of repetitive elements in relation to CNVs than to SNPs (
  <a rid="F0005" href="#F0005">Figure 5(a</a>)). In the particular case of breed-common mutations, this over-representation is nearly twofold in CNVs compared to SNPs. In contrast, when focusing only on CpG-related mutations, a higher representation of repetitive elements in breed-specific CpG-SNPs is found compared to breed-specific CpG-CNVs (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When analysing the detailed composition of repetitive elements overlapping with the SNPs obtained, we observed an overall decrease of LINE/CR1 in CpG-SNPs compared to SNPs. Also, an increased representation of some LTR elements (ERV1 and ERVK) is evidenced in CpG-SNPs compared to all SNPs. An increase in low complexity repeats is also observed in breed-specific SNPs compared to all SNPs and breed-common SNPs. When focusing only on CpG-SNPs, an increase in simple repeats in breed-specific CpGs-SNPs is observed compared to all CpGs and breed-common CpGs (
  <a rid="F0005" href="#F0005">Figure 5(b</a>)). It is also important to highlight that the LTR elements ERV1 and ERVK that are present in SNPs are absent in CNVs. One striking difference observed is the much higher presence of breed-specific CpG-SNPs in satellite elements in the W chromosome, compared to all SNPs and to CpG-SNPs.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By looking at the detailed composition of repetitive elements of the CNVs obtained, one noticeable observation is that LINE/CR1 are generally overrepresented in CpG-CNVs (particularly in breed-specific), which occurs at the expense of simple repeats. Also, an increase of LTR/ERVL in CpG-CNVs (particularly in breed-specific) is observed compared to all CNVs (
