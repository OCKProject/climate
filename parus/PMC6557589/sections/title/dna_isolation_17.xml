 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Proteinase K was added to each sample (80 mL; 20 mg/mL) and incubation was performed under rotation for 1 h at 55°C. After incubation, 300 µL of protein precipitation solution (Promega) was added and samples were incubated for 15 min on ice. Samples were centrifuged at max speed for 30 min at 4°C and then 1 mL of the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Isopropanol (1 mL) and glycogen (3 µL; 5mg/mL) were then added. The samples were incubated at 4°C under rotation for 30 min and then centrifuged at max speed for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant was then discarded and 500 µL of 70% ethanol was added. Centrifugation was performed again for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded, the samples were dried at the bench for at least 20 min, and then re-suspended with 150 µL of DNAse free water. The DNA concentration was measured with nanodrop (Thermofisher).</p>
