  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To identify SNPs and CNVs emerging between the domesticated chicken breeds and RJF we used Genotype-by-Sequencing, which we have recently described in chickens [
   <a rid="CIT0038" href="#CIT0038">38</a>]. This is an approach that enzymatically reduces the genome (with 
   <span class="italic">PstI</span>) and is unbiased for CpG density. 
   <span class="italic">PstI</span> digestion reduced the genome to a sequenced fraction of ~2.2%. Approximately 112 million reads were retained per library (3 libraries) after quality trimming by SeqyClean [
   <a rid="CIT0039" href="#CIT0039">39</a>]. Approximately 106 million reads were retained after application of the Tassel filter (reads &gt;64 bp and properly identified with barcodes). The number of unique sequence tags that aligned against the chicken reference genome (Gallus gallus 4.0, NCBI) was ~1.1 million and 91.2% of them could be mapped (detailed coverage per breed is shown in 
   <a rid="T0001" href="#T0001">Table 1</a>). We identified SNPs and CNVs common to all breeds (thus, unrelated to divergence), as well as breed-specific SNPs and CNVs that could be relevant for the diversification of the chicken breeds studied here. A total of 150,348 SNPs was identified when comparing the 
   <span class="italic">PstI</span>-reduced genomes of individuals from the domesticated breeds to the same fraction in RJF (used as reference). Among these SNPs, 30.29% were breed specific. 
   <a rid="F0001" href="#F0001">Figure 1(a</a>) shows a Venn-diagram with the number of SNPs detected in each domesticated breed in relation to RJF. Additionally, CNVs were identified in the 
   <span class="italic">PstI-</span>reduced genomes of individuals from the domesticated breeds compared to the same fraction in RJF (used as reference). These are presented as base pairs covered by CNVs emerging between RJF and the domesticated breeds, which allowed us to compare CNV regions to CpG locations. A total of 161,686,613 bp was identified in regions of CNVs, with 32.9% of these base pairs being breed specific.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine if RJF indeed locates in a position of ancestry in relation to the other domesticated breeds analysed, a relatedness cladogram was generated using the Japanese quail as the out group. Neighbour-joining clustering was performed on 34,219 common SNPs identified between the Japanese quail and the chicken breeds analysed.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As expected, the results indicate that the current RJF is the closest relative to quails, in a position of ancestry in relation to all other domesticated breeds included (
   <a rid="F0001" href="#F0001">Figure 1(c</a>)). Moreover, also expectedly, BRL appears as the most derived breed. The analysis correctly clustered each individual within the corresponding clade, which indicates the appropriateness of using GBS-generated sequencing data for inferring phylogenetic correlations. Our analysis also shows that among the Swedish breeds evaluated, KIN is the closest related to RJF, while GOT is the most distant (
   <a rid="F0001" href="#F0001">Figure 1(c))</a>. Inbreeding coefficients, F
   <sub>st</sub>, were estimated in the same subset of SNPs (common between the chickens and the Japanese quail) to identify genes that exhibit adaptive divergence in their allelic frequency, which is indicative of natural selection among sub-structured populations [
   <a rid="CIT0040" href="#CIT0040">40</a>]. The F
   <sub>st</sub> coefficients obtained show that almost all SNPs detected between the derived breeds and RJF emerged under neutral evolution (97.5%), while only 2% evolved under balancing selection and 0.6% due to positive selection (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We then identified the SNPs and CNVs that occurred specifically in overlapping positions to CpGs observed in the sequenced 
   <span class="italic">PstI</span>-reduced RJF genome and created the subgroups CpG-SNPs and CpG-CNVs, respectively. A total of 14,298 CpG-SNPs was found, representing 1.71% of all the CpGs analysed (835,182 CpGs). 9.51% of all SNPs are related to CpGs, which is 52.16% above the expected value (P &lt; 0.001, Chi-Square; Suppl Table S1). We defined the expected value (1/16) as the probability that CpG dinucleotides would contribute the same as other dinucleotides to SNP formation (i.e., 1 out of all 16 possible dinucleotide combinations). Thus, our results show CG dinucleotides disproportionally influence SNP formation. Interestingly, the more genetically distant the breed is from RJF, the more CpG-SNPs are present above expectancy. In BRL, CpG-SNPs presence is as high as 100.7% above expectancy (P &lt; 0.001, Chi-Square; 
   <a rid="F0002" href="#F0002">Figure 2(a))</a>. This suggests CpGs, in addition to being hotspots of mutations [
   <a rid="CIT0015" href="#CIT0015">15</a>–
   <a rid="CIT0019" href="#CIT0019">19</a>], are hotspots of SNPs that are relevant for genomic speciation. While 31.3% of CpG-SNPs are breed-specific, the fractions of breed-specific CpG-SNPs in relation to all CpG-SNPs are 8.05% in KIN, 9.2% in HED, 9.4% in GOT and 12.54% in BRL (Suppl Table S1).

This represents 34.1% of all the CpGs analysed (835,182 CpGs). Thus, we identified nearly 20 times more CpG-CNVs than CpG-SNPs. In contrast to the pattern observed for CpG-SNPs, CpGs are highly under-represented in CNVs in relation to expected values (approximately 98% decrease; Suppl Table S2), and the percentage of decrease in CpG-CNVs expectancy per breed is independent of genetic relatedness to RJF (Suppl Table S2).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Types of mutations emerging in domesticated breeds</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We investigated which point mutations emerged from SNPs occurring in C positions in general (C-SNPs) or in Cs neighbouring Gs (i.e., CpG sites). In each case we considered whether in RJF the C position involved a reference allele (i.e., when C is exclusive or majority in a specific position compared to other bases), represented by C/N, or an alternate allele (i.e., when C is minority in a specific position compared to other bases), represented by D/C. The nomenclature D/C was chosen instead of N to highlight that it represents a degenerate base with a minority presence Cs. Choosing N would have included the case when C is degenerate and majority. The nomenclature C/N, in turn, include Cs fixed as well as Cs present in majority. Remarkably, in all scenarios tested progressive changes in mutation patterns were observed that are concordant with the genetic relatedness of each breed to RJF. Mutation patterns are different depending on whether the mutation originated from C/N or D/C. When SNPs originate from C/N only C/T increases progressively with reduced genetic relatedness to RJF, while T/C, and fixed Cs and Gs decrease progressively (
   <a rid="F0003" href="#F0003">Figure 3(a</a>)). However, when SNPs originate from alternate Cs, both C/T and T/C increase progressively with reduced genetic relatedness to RJF, mainly at the expense of fixed Cs and Gs (
   <a rid="F0003" href="#F0003">Figure 3(b</a>)). Thus, our results demonstrate mutations in alternate Cs generate a different outcome than mutations in reference Cs.

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The same analysis was performed considering SNPs related to true CpGs (CpG-SNPs) or to D/CpGs (D/CpG-SNPs). This was based on the expectation that methylation-prone Cs (i.e., in CpG sites) would have different mutation patterns than Cs that are not prone to be methylated. Marked differences were observed in the mutation patterns between CpG- and D/CpG-SNPs. In true CpG-SNPs C/T increases substantially as genetic relatedness to RJF decreases, which occurs at the expense of fixed Cs and Ts (
   <a rid="F0003" href="#F0003">Figure 3(c</a>)). A completely different pattern is observed in D/CpG-SNPs, which are progressively substituted by A/G (mainly) and C/T (to a lesser extent) as genetic relatedness to RJF decreases, which occurs at the detriment of all the fixed bases (
   <a rid="F0003" href="#F0003">Figure 3(d</a>)). Our results show it is not only important in genomic dynamics whether Cs are within CpG sites but also their status as alternate or reference base, since the mutation patterns differ considerably between these two statuses.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Functional annotation of mutations</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We performed functional genomic annotation of the SNPs, CpG-SNPs, CNVs and CpG-CNVs found, to determine which genomic regions are affected in each case. For this analysis, we created more subgroups in order to identify potential differences between mutations that are (i) common to all breeds (named breed-common SNPs, CpG-SNPs, CNVs or CpG-CNVs) or (ii) specific to each breed (named breed-specific SNPs, CpG-SNPs, CNVs or CpG-CNVs). A general observation that holds for both SNPs and CNVs is that the vast majority of them relate to intergenic regions, followed by intronic regions (
   <a rid="F0004" href="#F0004">Figure 4(a</a> and 
   <a rid="F0004" href="#F0004">b))</a>. However, the regions that contribute the most to the Chi-square significance differ substantially across groups (
   <a rid="T0002" href="#T0002">Table 2</a>). Association with coding regions increases for CpG-SNPs, particularly for breed-specific SNPs, compared to all SNPs (

   <a rid="T0002" href="#T0002">Table 2</a>). As for CNVs, alterations in coding regions share importance with alterations in promoters. A large increase in the association with coding regions is observed for CpG-CNVs, particularly for breed common CpG-CNVs, compared to all CNVs (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We performed Repeat Masker analyses on the SNPs, CpG-SNPs, CNVs and CpG-CNVs found, in order to identify overlaps with categories of repetitive elements. In general, we found a slightly higher representation of repetitive elements in relation to CNVs than to SNPs (
   <a rid="F0005" href="#F0005">Figure 5(a</a>)). In the particular case of breed-common mutations, this over-representation is nearly twofold in CNVs compared to SNPs. In contrast, when focusing only on CpG-related mutations, a higher representation of repetitive elements in breed-specific CpG-SNPs is found compared to breed-specific CpG-CNVs (

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When analysing the detailed composition of repetitive elements overlapping with the SNPs obtained, we observed an overall decrease of LINE/CR1 in CpG-SNPs compared to SNPs. Also, an increased representation of some LTR elements (ERV1 and ERVK) is evidenced in CpG-SNPs compared to all SNPs. An increase in low complexity repeats is also observed in breed-specific SNPs compared to all SNPs and breed-common SNPs. When focusing only on CpG-SNPs, an increase in simple repeats in breed-specific CpGs-SNPs is observed compared to all CpGs and breed-common CpGs (
   <a rid="F0005" href="#F0005">Figure 5(b</a>)). It is also important to highlight that the LTR elements ERV1 and ERVK that are present in SNPs are absent in CNVs. One striking difference observed is the much higher presence of breed-specific CpG-SNPs in satellite elements in the W chromosome, compared to all SNPs and to CpG-SNPs.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By looking at the detailed composition of repetitive elements of the CNVs obtained, one noticeable observation is that LINE/CR1 are generally overrepresented in CpG-CNVs (particularly in breed-specific), which occurs at the expense of simple repeats. Also, an increase of LTR/ERVL in CpG-CNVs (particularly in breed-specific) is observed compared to all CNVs (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Relation of CpG-related mutations to DNA methylation in RJF sperm</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the observations that mutation dynamics differ between Cs in or outside CpGs, we inquired into potential correlations between DNA methylation levels in the sperm of our RJF population (from ejaculates) and CpG-related mutations. For the DNA methylation analysis, we used a novel combination of methods (Genotyping-by-Sequencing and Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation) that we developed previously [
   <a rid="CIT0041" href="#CIT0041">41</a>]. RJF sperm DNA methylation was also measured in the 
   <span class="italic">PstI</span>-reduced genome, thus we compared them to mutations in the same genomic fraction. Although we cannot assert that DNA methylation in RJF sperm has directly influenced CpG mutation rates in the domesticated breeds evaluated here, we rationalized that the analysis of DNA methylation from sperm from our RJF population could give a good approximation of ancestral sperm DNA methylation patterns. We investigated whether two variables in RJF sperm DNA methylation, namely i) DNA methylation levels, and ii) associated inter-individual variability, correlated to the SNPs or CNVs observed between RJF and the domesticated breeds. The methylated fraction of the 
   <span class="italic">PstI</span>-reduced sperm RJF genome was captured by Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (
   <span class="italic">PstI</span>-MeDIP), as previously described [
   <a rid="CIT0041" href="#CIT0041">41</a>]. Sequencing of this 
   <span class="italic">PstI</span>-MeDIP fraction resulted in an average of 1.4 million thousand reads per individual (N = 20) aligned against the chicken reference genome (
   <span class="italic">Gallus_gallus</span> 4.0, NCBI). This corresponds to 80.7% of the sequenced reads. In average, 227 million bps were sequenced, spanning 7 million unique genomic positions covered at 22.3 ± 11.3 X per individual. This corresponds to 0.6% of the total chicken genome per individual. To identify CpG sites to be analyzed, we merged the data from 20 RJF individuals. This merging resulted in 2.9 billion bps being analyzed, spanning 35 million unique genomic positions covered at 81.8X in average. This corresponds to 3.34% of the total chicken genome. The merging allowed to identify 835.182 CpGs, which corresponds to 7.8% of all CpGs within the chicken genome. Of these, 572,066 CpGs (68.5%) presented some degree of methylation in at least one individual and were therefore selected for further analyses.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The measured sperm DNA methylation was categorized according to i) the level of DNA methylation, and ii) the variation in DNA methylation across the individuals studied (inter-individual variation). 
   <a rid="F0006" href="#F0006">Figure 6(a</a>) shows the level of DNA methylation (represented by the normalized number of reads by which each CpG is covered) versus the inter-individual variation in DNA methylation in these CpGs.

   </div>
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nine categories were defined for these CpGs based on their DNA methylation levels and inter-individual variation: Low Methylation-Low Variation (LM-LV); Low Methylation-Medium Variation (LM-MV); Low Methylation-High Variation (LM-HV); Medium Methylation-Low Variation (MM-LV); Medium Methylation-Medium Variation (MM-MV); Medium Methylation-High Variation (MM-HV); High Methylation-Low Variation (HM-LV); High Methylation-Medium Variation (HM-MV); High Methylation-High Variation (HM-HV). The criteria for the definition of the limits of these categories are described in detail in the Materials and Methods section. CpG proportions across DNA methylation categories in RJF sperm are shown in 
   <a rid="F0006" href="#F0006">Figure 6(b</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The majority of CpGs detected in the methylated fraction of the 
   <span class="italic">PstI</span>-reduced fraction of the sperm genome are LM-MV (50.12%), followed by MM-MV (16.03%), and LM-LV (14%). We then investigated if DNA methylation status in the male germ line of RJF would associate to the mutations (SNPs and CNVs) observed between RJF and the domesticated breeds. To determine this, we selected CpG sites that were in the same genomic locations where SNPs (i.e., CpG-SNPs) or CNVs (i.e., CpG-CNVs) emerged between RJF and the domesticated breed. The number of CpGs in which DNA methylation was evaluated in the sperm of RJF, and the number of CpG-SNPs and CpG-CNVs obtained in each breed are shown in 
   <a rid="F0006" href="#F0006">Figure 6(c</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We hypothesized that if no correlation between RJF sperm DNA methylation and SNPs or CNVs exists, then the distribution of CpGs across the nine DNA methylation categories in the RJF sperm (all sperm CpGs measured; reference pattern) is expected to be the same as in the CpG-SNPs or CpG-CNVs subgroups (in each domesticated breed). Interestingly, our results show major differences in the distribution of CpGs across the nine DNA methylation categories between the reference pattern (
   <a rid="F0006" href="#F0006">Figure 6(a</a>); all CpGs measured in RJF sperm) and the CpG-SNPs subgroups (
   <a rid="F0006" href="#F0006">Figure 6(d</a>), top panel). For instance, when considering all CpGs in RJF sperm, the largest category of CpG methylation is LM-LV, while in the subgroups of CpG-SNPs in the domesticated breeds the largest category is MM-HV. Furthermore, the distribution is altered in relation to the reference value in a consistent manner in all domesticated breeds, which represent independent replicates. In contrast, in the CpG-CNVs subgroups, the distribution of CpGs across methylation categories in the domesticated breeds is similar to the reference value (
   <a rid="F0006" href="#F0006">Figure 6(d</a>), lower panel). Thus, patterns of CpG methylation differ considerably between the CpG-SNPs and CpG-CNVs subgroups, with the latter being similar to the reference value.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We then tested which of the DNA methylation variables studied (i.e., DNA methylation levels or inter-individual variation) were altered the most between all RJF sperm CpGs (reference pattern) and the subgroups of CpGs related to mutations (SNPs or CNVS). For this, we compared the amount of CpGs in each DNA methylation category within the CpG-SNPs or CpG-CNVs subgroups against the reference value in RJF sperm (
   <a rid="F0006" href="#F0006">Figure 6(e))</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found that CpGs in RJF sperm with medium levels of DNA methylation together with medium (P &lt; 0.001) to high levels (P &lt; 0.001) of inter-individual variation are substantially overrepresented in the CpG-SNPs subgroups, as well as CpGs with high levels of DNA methylation and medium variation (P &lt; 0.001) (
   <a rid="F0006" href="#F0006">Figure 6(e))</a>. Conversely, CpGs in RJF sperm with high levels of DNA methylation and low (P &lt; 0.05) to medium (P &lt; 0.05) variation are overrepresented in the CpG-CNVs subgroups, as well as CpGs with medium levels of DNA methylation and low variation (P &lt; 0.005) (
   <a rid="F0006" href="#F0006">Figure 6(e</a>)). Interestingly, the combination of high methylation with medium variation is overrepresented in both subgroups. For both CpG-SNPs and CpG-CNVs the significant increases in some categories are compensated by decreases in other categories. In summary, the majority of CpG-SNPs associate with medium levels of methylation and medium/high variation in RJF sperm, while the majority of CpG-CNVs associate with high levels of methylation and low/medium variability in RJF sperm.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on these associations between DNA methylation features in RJF sperm and mutations emerging in specific breeds, we inquired about the mutation probabilities of CpGs within each DNA methylation category. We implemented Bayesian inference and calculated posterior distributions of mutation probabilities (separately for SNPs and CNVs) for the RJF sperm CpGs methylation categories, and observed substantial differences among them, both in relation to SNPs (
   <a rid="F0007" href="#F0007">Figure 7(a</a>)) and CNVs (
   <a rid="F0007" href="#F0007">Figure 7(b))</a>. Additionally, the patterns of these mutation probabilities are different when related to SNPs or CNVs. A very interesting finding is that in two of the methylation categories, MM-HV and MM-MV, the CpG to SNP mutation rate increases as genetic relatedness to RJF decreases (
   <a rid="F0007" href="#F0007">Figure 7(a))</a>, while none of the categories exhibit this pattern in CpGs related to CNVs (
   <a rid="F0007" href="#F0007">Figure 7(b))</a>.
