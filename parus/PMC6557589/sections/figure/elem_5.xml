  <p>Association of CpG-related mutations in domesticated breeds with DNA methylation in RJF sperm. (a) Inter-individual DNA methylation variation plotted against the level of DNA methylation, measured per window, and grid representation of the division of CpGs in nine DNA methylation categories. (b) Pie representation of the number of CpGs within each DNA methylation category in sperm RJF. (c) Representation of the subgroups of CpGs that relate to mutations (CpGs or CNVs) in each domesticated breed. (d) Pie representations of DNA methylation categories of the subgroups of CpGs measured for DNA methylation in sperm RJF that relate to SNPs (CpG-SNPs) or to CNVs (CpG-CNVs) in the domesticated breeds. (e) Bar plots summarizing how levels and inter-individual variation of DNA methylation in RJF sperm associate with mutations (SNPs or CNVs) in the domesticated breeds.</p>
