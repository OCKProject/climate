  <p>Categorization of SNPs and CNVs found among domesticated breeds of chickens and RJF. (a) Venn diagram showing SNPs emerging between the domesticated breeds analysed and RJF. (b) Venn diagram showing base pairs covered by CNVs emerging between the domesticated breeds analysed and RJF. (c) SNP based phylogenetic tree of the chicken breeds studied here, constructed with neighbour joining and using the Japanese quail as the outgroup. (d) Schematic representation of the F
   <sub>st</sub> analysis against heterozygosity performed among the breeds studied here; dots with different colours represent SNPs evolving under balancing selection (yellow), neutral evolution (light blue), or positive selection (red).
