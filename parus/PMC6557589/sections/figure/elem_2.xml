  <p>Types of mutations emerging in domesticated breeds in relation to RJF. (a) SNPs emerging from Cs as reference base (i.e., C/N) in RJF. (b) SNPs emerging from Cs as an alternate base (i.e., D/C) in RJF. (c) SNPs emerging from CpGs with C as reference base (i.e., C/N) in RJF. (d) SNPs emerging from CpGs with C as an alternate base (i.e., D/C) in RJF.</p>
