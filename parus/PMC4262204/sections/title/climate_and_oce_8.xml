 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To investigate how sex ratio may be influenced by climatic conditions, we used indicators of processes acting both at local and global scales 
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Stenseth1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Stenseth1">[50]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Stenseth2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Stenseth2">[51]</a>. A large-scale climatic index, the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI; calculated on a monthly basis as the fluctuation in the air pressure difference between Tahiti and Darwin) was obtained from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. Prolonged periods of negative SOI values are usually associated with warm ocean temperatures in our study area, typical of El Niño events 
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Deser1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Deser1">[52]</a>. We used Sea Surface Temperature (SST, in °C), as a local proxy of prey abundance and distribution, a good indicator for marine predators such as king penguins

  <a rid="pone.0114052-LeBohec3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-LeBohec3">[53]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Pron1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Pron1">[55]</a>. Indeed, by affecting primary production, SST has strong consequences on prey abundance 
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Gregg1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Gregg1">[56]</a>. Monthly SST values were obtained from the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration of the USA and averaged for the feeding areas (46–60°S, 46–56°E) of king penguins during the summer (Polar Front, PF) and the winter (Marginal Ice Zone, MIZ) 
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Charrassin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Charrassin1">[57]</a>. We previously found that breeding success in our study colony was mostly affected by the SOI and SST conditions of the same year 
  <a rid="pone.0114052-LeBohec3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-LeBohec3">[53]</a>. However, we tested for SOI and SST effects over four different periods: 6- and 12-mo time-lag prior to laying (prior to the mean annual laying date of early breeders, May–Oct. or Nov.–Oct.), 6-mo time-lag after laying (after the mean annual laying date of early breeders, Nov.–Apr.), and over the entire breeding cycle (from laying to fledging, Nov.–Oct.). The different time-periods yielded similar results, so that results are given only over one period: the summer season, i.e. the 6-mo period following the onset of reproduction (the mean annual laying date of early breeders). Finally, we recorded the mean annual laying date of early breeders from 2004 to 2009 as a proxy of environmental conditions before breeding onset, and calculated the mean annual breeding success of the colony from 2000 to 2009 (Le Bohec et al., 
  <span class="italic">unpublished data</span>) as a proxy of the annual environmental conditions endured during reproduction. Early years and/or years of high breeding success could be viewed as more favourable years of high resource availability.
