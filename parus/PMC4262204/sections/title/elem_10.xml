  <a rid="pone.0114052-R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-R1">[58]</a>. Because chicks were randomly sampled in the absence of their parents, we could not know whether sampled chicks may come from the same breeding pairs from year to year. This prevented us from looking for pseudo-replication in our data and using Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) that would take adult identity into account. Yet, it should be noted that no more than 500–600 chicks were marked per year in a part of the colony retaining 
  <span class="italic">ca.</span> 8,000 breeding pairs, so that the probability of pseudo-replication should be low. Therefore, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs; maximum likelihood approach) fitted to a binomial distribution were used to evaluate sex ratio with environmental factors or laying period. As all independent variables (
  <span class="italic">e.g.</span> laying period) were not available for all individuals, we could not run a single general model and use an information theoretical approach to select variables. Instead, we had to compute separate models for different independent variables. Still, in the case of climatic variables, we ran a single global model with SST and SOI as independent variables. The most appropriate models were selected using Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC). Adjusted R
  <span class="sup">2</span> values are indicated along with p-values. Data were checked for normality and for between-group homoscedasticity and between-year comparisons were performed using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Sex-ratio comparisons across life-history stages were performed using a binomial proportion test ('prop.test' package in R). Variables were considered significant for 
  <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;0.05. Bonferroni corrections were considered for multiple testing in three occasions, i.e. comparisons of sex ratio between life-history stages

  </div>. In the first 2 cases, results were similar regardless of whether the Bonferroni adjustment was applied or not, indicating their robustness. In the last case (pairwise comparison of annual sex ratios), differences appeared. As Bonferroni adjustments are often criticized for being too conservative preventing from detecting significant differences, we decided to present the results without this adjustment on

   <p>Sex ratio is presented as male proportion (%). Dotted lines represent the 95% confidence interval. The grey area of the figure (fledging males &lt;50%) corresponds to female-biased sex ratios, while the white area corresponds to male-biased sex ratios.
