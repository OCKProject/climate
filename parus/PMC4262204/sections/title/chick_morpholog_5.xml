 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Standardised measurements of flipper length, beak length (±1 mm) and body mass were collected on all but 3 chicks upon capture right before fledging (N = 4101). Flipper and beak lengths are highly repeatable measurements 
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Fahlman1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Fahlman1">[44]</a> and provide good descriptors of structural size. However, because those measurements are correlated (Spearman’s rank correlation; 
  <span class="italic">p</span>&lt;0.001, 
  <span class="italic">rho</span> = 0.32, 
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 4101), we established a Structural Size Index (SSI) using principal component analysis as previously described in 
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Saraux1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Saraux1">[35]</a>. The first principal component of the analyses explained 79% of the variation in bill and flipper length and was retained as the SSI

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because body mass is highly variable in king penguins and perhaps associated with differences in nutritional status as well as structural size, OLS-regression residuals of body mass on structural size are likely to provide a better reflection of the actual energy stores of the animal 
  <a rid="pone.0114052-SchulteHostedde1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-SchulteHostedde1">[45]</a>. Thus, we calculated body condition as the residuals of an OLS-regression of chicks’ body mass on SSI

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine if the sexual size dimorphism occurred at hatching or fledging, we also calculated body condition from an OLS regression of body mass on structural size at hatching over 173 early and 197 late-hatched king penguin chicks in 2010
