 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because colony density of king penguins varies to a large extent over the course of a breeding season and may affect the physiological status of breeding parents 
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Viblanc1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Viblanc1">[32]</a>, we considered whether colony density might affect chick sex ratio. Each year, starting in 2004, we calculated yearly colony density indices in the ANTAVIA sub-colony by counting breeding individuals on pictures taken in December (peak density of the breeding season). We further calculated a second annual density index as the proportion of transponder-tagged birds monitored as breeding in a given year among tagged birds alive and of breeding age.
