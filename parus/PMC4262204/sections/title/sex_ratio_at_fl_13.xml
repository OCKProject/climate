 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over the 10-year study period, fledging sex ratio was slightly biased towards males (1941 females 
  <span class="italic">vs.</span> 2071 males), implying that an overall greater proportion of male offspring successfully fledged from 2000 to 2009, 
  <span class="italic">i.e.</span> 51.62% of male (GLM; 
  <span class="italic">z</span> = 2.05, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.04, 
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 4012; upper-right panel, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114052-g001" href="#pone-0114052-g001">Fig. 1</a>). However, fledging sex ratio varied significantly between years (Pairwise tests given in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114052-g001" href="#pone-0114052-g001">Fig. 1</a>) and significant male-bias was observed in only 2 of the study years (GLM; 
  <span class="italic">z</span> = 2.90, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.004, 
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 383 and 
  <span class="italic">z</span> = 2.84, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.004, 
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 295 for 2001 and 2002, respectively; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114052-g001" href="#pone-0114052-g001">Fig. 1</a>). Because the data were limited to 10 points, we could not perform breakpoint analyses, but from a visual inspection (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114052-g001" href="#pone-0114052-g001">Fig. 1</a>) it seems that the proportion of fledged males increased from 2000 to 2002 (44.37% to 58.31%, 
  <span class="italic">z</span> = 2.39, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.02, 
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 820), before decreasing continuously over 2002–2007, from 58.31% to 47.45% (
  <span class="italic">z</span> = −3.39, 
  <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;0.001, 
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 2392). Finally, sex ratio at fledging was stable over the last 3 years (2007–2009) of the study (
  <span class="italic">z</span> = 0.70, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.48, 
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 1546).
