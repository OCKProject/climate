 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Once implanted with a transponder tag, chicks are automatically identified throughout their lifetime in the ANTAVIA sub-colony by RFID antennas. Those antennas are buried underground at unique transit pathways in and out of the sub-colony and allow continuous monitoring of bird movements and presence within the colony

  <span class="italic">unpublished data</span>). Thus, monitoring individuals tagged from fledging allows assessment of changes in sex ratio throughout different life-history stages. This information was used to investigate changes in sex ratio between fledging, first return to the colony, and first reproductive attempt. For this analysis, only the first 4 cohorts of tagged chicks were used, as most of the birds from latter cohorts had not yet started to breed.
