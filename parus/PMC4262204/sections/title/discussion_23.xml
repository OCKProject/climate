 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over a 10-year period, fledgling sex ratio in our king penguin population was slightly male-biased. This finding is in line with previous data on male-biased ASR both in the present 
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Bried1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Bried1">[18]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0114052-LeBohec2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-LeBohec2">[48]</a> and other king penguin colonies (on Kerguelen 
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Pincemy1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Pincemy1">[19]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Pincemy2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Pincemy2">[20]</a> and South Georgia 
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Olsson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Olsson1">[21]</a> archipelagos). Interestingly, biased ASR in birds appears to mainly result from adult sex-specific mortality, rather than biased offspring sex ratios. Indeed, in a review of 140 estimates of offspring sex ratio, only few (17%) differed significantly from 1∶1 (9.3% female biased and 7.8% male biased) 
  <a rid="pone.0114052-DonaldP1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-DonaldP1">[59]</a>. Yet, despite slightly higher annual survival on average for males 
  <span class="italic">vs.</span> females (94.2% 
  <span class="italic">vs.</span> 90.7%), this difference is not significant (
  <a rid="pone.0114052-LeBohec2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-LeBohec2">[48]</a> and unpublished results over 1999–2010). Our result on biased sex ratio at fledging is thus relatively unusual for birds. Yet, it should be noted that despite a high sample size, the bias was only barely significant, indicating that fledgling sex ratio was mainly maintained close to the Fisher equilibrium of 1∶1. In agreement with previous studies in adults 
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Barrat1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Barrat1">[25]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Fahlman1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Fahlman1">[44]</a>, we found that king penguin fledglings also exhibited slight sexual dimorphism in favour of males, probably a result of differential growth, as no sexual dimorphism was observed at hatching for king penguin chicks (though size at hatching was available only for one cohort). Higher costs of raising males might therefore be expected. Given the equalization of fitness of male and female offspring at the termination of parental care, theory would then predict an even or slightly female-biased sex ratio at fledging 
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Fisher1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Fisher1">[3]</a>. Of course, for this to be true, costs of raising male and female offspring actually need to differ and remain to be accurately measured (
  <span class="italic">e.g.</span> in terms of energy allocation). Nonetheless, our results might thus appear in this regard to contradict Fisher’s theory because a significant male-bias occurred 
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Fisher1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Fisher1">[3]</a>. However, this is perhaps not surprising given that life histories of birds clearly violate several assumptions of the standard sex allocation models (
  <span class="italic">e.g.</span> extended biparental care, overlapping generations, see 
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Komdeur1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Komdeur1">[60]</a> for a review).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to the overall limited sex-ratio bias, we observed high interannual variability in fledging sex ratio ranging from 44% to 58% of males. Such fluctuation at fledging may result from yearly fluctuations in primary sex ratio and/or from differential chick survival between hatching and fledging. Unfortunately, we only had one year of data on hatching sex ratio, so that our findings have to be considered preliminary. Nonetheless, they suggest that sex ratio could be biased as soon as hatching, but also that sex-biased chick mortality may occur between hatching and fledging. Finally, we found that biased sex ratios at fledging were associated with biased body conditions in male and female fledglings. When sex ratio was male-biased, males presented a higher body condition than females, and reciprocally. Because fledgling body condition affects post-fledging return rates and may be viewed as an index of chick quality 
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Saraux1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Saraux1">[35]</a>, this may suggest that parents adopt sex-specific production strategies depending on yearly environmental conditions. For instance, larger males may be more vulnerable than females to food shortage 
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Nager2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Nager2">[61]</a> in specific years, making it a better option to produce females under harsh environmental conditions 
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Trivers1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Trivers1">[7]</a>. Also, parents in poor condition (e.g. nutritional stress or lack of experience) may favour the less costly sex either to avoid impairing future fitness or because reproduction is likely to fail, 
  <span class="italic">i.e.</span> the ‘cost of reproduction hypothesis’ 
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Williams1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Williams1">[62]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Velando1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Velando1">[65]</a>. Alternatively, females may survive better than males in poor years, even under equal investment, because of lesser energy requirements during the growth period.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our study, the proportion of hatching males tended to be higher early in the season (58 
  <span class="italic">vs.</span> 49% late in the season), although our small sample size of late fledglings prevents us from definite conclusions. Such seasonal variability in sex ratio has been previously reported in the painted turtle (
  <span class="italic">Chrysemys picta</span>) 
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Bowden1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Bowden1">[66]</a>, and may result from poor foraging and nutritional conditions, because of mismatch with peak resource productivity (
  <span class="italic">e.g.</span>
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Moreno1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Moreno1">[67]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Durant1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Durant1">[68]</a>). In king penguins, late breeding birds spend longer foraging trips at sea during chick-rearing and build up larger fuel reserves than early birds, reflecting the well-known trade-off between adult maintenance and offspring care/survival in long-lived birds 
  <a rid="pone.0114052-GauthierClerc1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-GauthierClerc1">[31]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Williams1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Williams1">[62]</a>. If male chicks indeed require larger amounts of food than females, a change in parental provisioning late in the season may affect male mortality, thus explaining the observed female bias in sex ratio.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fledging sex ratio was relatively insensitive to environmental descriptors measured in this study. Yearly population (colony) density did not affect fledging sex ratio. Although effects of population density on sex ratio have been reported in mammals 
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Kruuk1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Kruuk1">[10]</a>, those effects were mediated by maternal condition affected by high competition on nutritional resources 
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Kruuk1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Kruuk1">[10]</a>. However, intra-specific competition may be less of a problem for king penguins, for which foraging success appears to be more influenced by local oceanic characteristics of food patches than by density-dependent processes (see 
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Ptz1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Ptz1">[69]</a> for a discussion). Similarly, global climatic conditions (SOI) did not appear to have an effect on fledging sex ratio. However, whether this is a result of sex ratio truly being insensitive to global oceanographic conditions or because only relatively mild La Niña/El-Niño events occurred over the 10-year monitoring period (low amplitude in annual SOI variation, see 
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Vargas1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Vargas1">[70]</a>) remains to be examined. Finally, no effect of yearly local environmental conditions (SST) on fledging sex ratio was highlighted in this study. Although we did record a significant bias in fledging sex-ratio variability with increasing SST (cold years were associated with sex ratios close to 1∶1, whereas warm years resulted in highly biased sex ratios), this bias was not consistently in favour of either sex, and our large sample sizes suggest that yearly changes in sex ratio were likely just related to stochasticity in environmental parameters (including SST) affecting chick mortality.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, if understanding which parental/environmental variables influence offspring sex ratio is fundamental to the breeding and evolutionary biology of king penguins, one should bear in mind that it is actually the ASR that is a key parameter to population dynamics. In our study colony, although the sex-ratio bias was 2 percentage points lower at recruitment (
  <span class="italic">i.e.</span> first breeding attempt) than at fledging (suggesting a return towards equilibrium at recruitment), this decrease was not statistically significant.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To conclude, our results over a 10-year period hint to potential effects of oceanographic conditions on fledging sex ratio. With a predicted increase in warm climate episodes (IPCC 2013, 
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Climate1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Climate1">[71]</a>), investigating king penguin sex ratio over later life-history stages appears the next step to assess its importance in modulating population trajectories and population persistence over time 
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Veran1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Veran1">[72]</a>. From results to date, it appears that an expectation of considerable fluctuations in fledging sex ratio might accompany further ocean warming.
