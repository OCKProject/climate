 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From 2004 to 2009, sex ratio at fledging was not related to colony density (global colony-counts of individual penguins; GLM; z = 0.76, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.44). Colony density as estimated only by counting tagged birds reproducing in the colony from 2007 to 2009, yielded similar results (GLM;

  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.35).
