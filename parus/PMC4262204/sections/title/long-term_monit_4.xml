 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study was conducted in the king penguin colony of ‘La Baie du Marin’, on Possession Island, Crozet Archipelago (46°25′S, 51°45′E). From 2000 to 2009, we marked 3787 king penguin chicks that we later monitored using an automatic system (ANTAVIA), based on radio-frequency identification (RFID) of individuals born in a subpart of the colony 
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Gendner1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Gendner1">[38]</a>. Around the peak of fledging, chicks in advanced moult were captured on the edge of the colony and implanted with passive transponder tags under the skin of their leg, without any other external mark. Upon capture, the chick’s head was covered with a hood to keep it calm. A 1-mL blood sample was collected from its marginal flipper and used for sex determination based on genomic DNA (see below). Because those chicks were initially captured right before fledging, we did not know whether they were issued from an early (laying prior to Jan. 1
  <span class="sup">st</span>) or late reproduction

  <a rid="pone.0114052-Weimerskirch1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Weimerskirch1">[26]</a>. Thus, we captured and marked 200 early and 200 late chicks per year from 2007 to 2009 (∼3–4 week old). Those chicks were temporarily tagged with a small external plastic pin (Fishtag, Floytag). Of those, 225 chicks (198 early chicks and 27 late chicks) survived to fledging and were re-captured, transponder-tagged and blood-sampled at that time. Finally, as part of a separate study, 20 early and 20 late chicks were captured in 2009, and 173 early and 197 late chicks were captured in 2010, right after hatching (∼1 week old). Those were marked with a fishtag, blood sampled (∼100 µL), and used to investigate the changes in sex ratio between hatching and fledging.

  <a rid="pone.0114052-Sambrook1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Sambrook1">[39]</a>. Sex determination relied on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of two parts of the sex chromosome CHD1 gene, which in birds differs in size between the Z and W chromosomes

  <a rid="pone.0114052-Ellegren1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Ellegren1">[41]</a>. Females were characterized by displaying both a W-specific fragment and a Z-specific fragment, while males showed only the shorter Z-fragment. All individuals were tested with primers F1/R1 
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Kahn1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Kahn1">[42]</a>, and in each year, ca. 10% of them were controlled at random using another pair of primers P2/P8 
  <a rid="pone.0114052-Griffiths2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0114052-Griffiths2">[43]</a> to confirm sex determinations. Sex ratio was calculated as the proportion of males in the population (given as a %).
