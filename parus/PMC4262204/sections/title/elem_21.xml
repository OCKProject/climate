 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to the structural size index, no dimorphism was observed at hatching neither for the 2010 early-hatched king penguin chicks (Wilcoxon; 
  <span class="italic">W</span> = 4378, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.86, 
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 173), nor for the 2010 late-hatched chicks (Wilcoxon; 
  <span class="italic">W</span> = 4378, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.24, 
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 197).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At fledging, however, chicks exhibited sexual size dimorphism, males being larger than females according to the structural size index (3.36±0.26 
  <span class="italic">vs.</span> −3.59±0.25, Wilcoxon; 
  <span class="italic">W</span> = 1372092, 
  <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;0.001, 
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 4101). However, when looking at body condition at fledging, the difference between males and females was not constantly in favour of males (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114052-g004" href="#pone-0114052-g004">Fig. 4A</a>). Males had a higher body condition than females only in 2004 (Wilcoxon;

  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.003,

   <div class="title">Yearly changes in male and female fledging body condition (BC; panel A) and yearly sex ratio at fledging according to fledging BC difference between males and females (panel B) in king penguins.</div>
   <p>Panel A: male and female body conditions are given as solid line, open circles and dotted line, full circles, respectively. Letters in superscript indicate differences between years in the average (male and female) body condition. Average values not sharing a common superscript are different for 
    <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;0.05. Panel B: the grey area corresponds to the years in which male body condition is higher than female body condition, while the white area presents the opposite. Note that the horizontal solid line indicates the balanced sex ratio at fledging. Every point situated above corresponds to a higher proportion of males, while below corresponds to a higher proportion of females.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The yearly difference in body condition between males and females was correlated with sex ratio at fledging (

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114052-g004" href="#pone-0114052-g004">Fig. 4B</a>). Higher male proportions were associated with a higher male body condition when compared to females.
