  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over the 10-year study period, fledging sex ratio was slightly biased towards males (1941 females 
   <span class="italic">vs.</span> 2071 males), implying that an overall greater proportion of male offspring successfully fledged from 2000 to 2009, 
   <span class="italic">i.e.</span> 51.62% of male (GLM; 
   <span class="italic">z</span> = 2.05,

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114052-g001" href="#pone-0114052-g001">Fig. 1</a>). However, fledging sex ratio varied significantly between years (Pairwise tests given in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114052-g001" href="#pone-0114052-g001">Fig. 1</a>) and significant male-bias was observed in only 2 of the study years (GLM; 
   <span class="italic">z</span> = 2.90,

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114052-g001" href="#pone-0114052-g001">Fig. 1</a>). Because the data were limited to 10 points, we could not perform breakpoint analyses, but from a visual inspection (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114052-g001" href="#pone-0114052-g001">Fig. 1</a>) it seems that the proportion of fledged males increased from 2000 to 2002 (44.37% to 58.31%, 
   <span class="italic">z</span> = 2.39, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.02, 
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 820), before decreasing continuously over 2002–2007, from 58.31% to 47.45% (
   <span class="italic">z</span> = −3.39, 
   <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;0.001, 
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 2392). Finally, sex ratio at fledging was stable over the last 3 years (2007–2009) of the study (

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over the 10-year study (2000–2009) and 4012 individuals, the most appropriate models, selected by AIC, did not show any effect of SOI or SST on fledgling sex ratio. Indeed, the null model was retained regardless of the tested period (before breeding, summer after laying, and entire breeding cycle).</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, it is interesting to note that the period of decreasing male proportion at fledging (2002–2007, except in 2006) coincided with negative values of SOI during the period of incubation and chick-brooding. Also, variability in fledging sex ratio tended to increase with SST (
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114052-g003" href="#pone-0114052-g003">Fig. 3</a>), i.e. warmer years produced very unbalanced sex ratios (whether in favour of males or females) compared to colder years during which the sex ratio was close to 1∶1.
