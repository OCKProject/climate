  <p>Climatic and non-climatic predictors of brood size in Canada jays. The frequency of freezeâ€“thaw events (
   <span class="italic">a</span>), mean pre-breeding temperature (
   <span class="italic">b</span>) and lay date (
   <span class="italic">c</span>) were all negatively correlated with brood size. Female age was positively correlated with brood size (
   <span class="italic">d</span>). The shaded area on each graph represents a 95% confidence interval. Each line is taken from the top model as determined through model selection using AICc.
