  <p>Climatic and non-climatic predictors of nestling condition in Canada jays. Nestling condition of Canada jays was negatively correlated with the frequency of autumn freezeâ€“thaw events (
   <span class="italic">a</span>), lay date (
   <span class="italic">c</span>) and brood size (
   <span class="italic">d</span>). Nestling condition was positively correlated with mean autumn temperature (
   <span class="italic">b</span>). The shaded area around each line represents a 95% confidence interval. Each line is taken from the top model as determined through model selection using AICc.
