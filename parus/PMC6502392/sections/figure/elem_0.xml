  <p>(
   <span class="italic">a</span>) Range of Canada jays (
   <span class="italic">Perisoreus canadensis</span>) across North America. The red star denotes the study area in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario. Inset is a Canada jay. (
   <span class="italic">b</span>) A Canada jay food cache in the autumn. Canada jays cache food boluses throughout their territories under arboreal lichens and bark flakes. The red arrow indicates the food bolus placed under a bark flake on a black spruce (
   <span class="italic">Picea mariana</span>). (
   <span class="italic">c</span>) An example of a temperature profile throughout the autumn caching period (October–December) and the pre-breeding period (January–February) from 2003. The dashed red line represents the initial freezing point (−1.9°C), which was used to calculate freeze–thaw events (see Methods). When maximum daily temperatures exceeded the initial freezing point and minimum temperatures were below the initial freezing point a freeze–thaw event was determined to have occurred.
