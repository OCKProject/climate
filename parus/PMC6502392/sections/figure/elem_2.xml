  <p>Climatic and non-climatic predictors of nest success in Canada jays. (
   <span class="italic">a</span>) There was a significant interaction between lay date and the frequency of autumn freeze–thaw events, whereby early nesting pairs (red) were less influenced by freeze–thaw events than late nesting pairs (blue). (
   <span class="italic">b</span>) Mean pre-breeding temperatures were negatively correlated with nest success. (
   <span class="italic">c</span>) Female age was positively correlated with nest success. The shaded area around each line represents a 95% confidence interval. Each line is taken from the top model as determined through model selection using AICc.
