 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is strong evidence to suggest that long-term changes in climate have affected a wide range of species around the world [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C1" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C1">1</a>–
  <a rid="RSOS181754C3" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C3">3</a>]. A major consequence of climate change is a poleward shift in the distribution of species [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C4" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C4">4</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS181754C5" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C5">5</a>], whereby populations living at lower latitudes of a species' distribution decline are eventually extirpated because they are most susceptible to warming temperatures [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C6" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C6">6</a>]. However, documentation of such range-edge population declines is rare [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C7" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C7">7</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS181754C8" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C8">8</a>] and even fewer specific mechanisms have been proposed to explain how changes in climate could be causing declines [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C3" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C3">3</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS181754C6" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C6">6</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One group of animals that may be vulnerable to climate change are those that cache food, especially perishable food [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C9" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C9">9</a>]. Food caching is a behavioural strategy in which an animal defers consumption of a food item and handles it in a way that deters other organisms from accessing stored food so that it can be retrieved during a period when demand for resources outweighs supply [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C10" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C10">10</a>]. Once food is cached, it is exposed to environmental conditions that may reduce its quality over time [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C9" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C9">9</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS181754C11" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C11">11</a>]. The degree to which food degrades depends on both the type of food that is stored, as well as where and how long it is stored [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C9" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C9">9</a>]. For example, foods such as nuts and seeds are probably more resistant to changes in environmental conditions compared to perishable foods such as meat, berries and fleshy fungi [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C9" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C9">9</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS181754C10" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C10">10</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Canada jays (
  <span class="italic">Perisoreus canadensis</span>) are year-round residents of the boreal forest that cache a wide variety of perishable foods including arthropods, mushrooms, berries and vertebrate flesh (both carrion and prey) in the late summer and autumn [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C12" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C12">12</a>]. Canada jays are arboreal scatter-hoarders and distribute food caches widely across their territories [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C12" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C12">12</a>]. Foraging for food is not a conspicuous activity in winter, and Canada jays do not exploit boreal tree seed crops or have regular access to animal carcasses in otherwise seemingly foodless boreal winter conditions [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C12" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C12">12</a>]. By contrast, food caching is very prominent in the summer and autumn (e.g. individuals can make as many as 1000 caches a day in Alaska; T. Waite 1991, unpublished data). This evidence strongly implies that large quantities of food are stored throughout a typical jay territory and almost certainly account for their observed high territorial fidelity and winter survival [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C12" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C12">12</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS181754C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C13">13</a>]. Cached food also supports female increases in body mass prior to clutch initiation [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C14" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C14">14</a>] and some evidence suggests that breeding pairs also use stored food to feed nestlings, at least occasionally [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C15" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C15">15</a>]. Critically, however, and notwithstanding the high perishability of food cached by Canada jays, food must survive in sufficient quantity or quality from the time of storage in summer or autumn to the following breeding season if it is to explain the high winter survival and late-winter breeding performance in this species.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Until the onset of consistent sub-freezing winter temperatures, the temperature-dependent degradation of perishable food items stored in the autumn is expected to be an important determinant of food quality [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C16" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C16">16</a>]. Waite &amp; Strickland [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C17" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C17">17</a>] documented a decline in our southern range-edge population of Canada Jays and proposed that warmer autumn temperatures might be accelerating declines in the quality of cached perishable food items, which then carry over to influence reproductive performance. Using 26 years of data from Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario (APP), they provided some support for their ‘hoard-rot’ hypothesis by showing that both clutch size and the timing of breeding were negatively correlated with mean autumn temperatures. However, the support for both models was relatively weak and there was no evidence that autumn temperature influenced brood size, one of the key indicators of reproductive performance.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One possible explanation for this relative lack of support is that other changing features of our study area's warming climate (i.e. beyond higher temperatures) may be contributing to declines in the quality or quantity of stored food, ostensibly resulting in the observed decline of our study population. Food scientists have identified a number of environmental variables, including temperature, and freeze–thaw events, that influence food quality and which may be relevant to wild populations [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C9" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C9">9</a>]. Temperature affects the quality of perishable food primarily through its influence on microbial growth rates [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C18">18</a>]. By contrast, freeze–thaw events act in three distinct ways to degrade perishable food. First, freezing and thawing of a food item cause the denaturation of proteins, which can have downstream consequences on nutritional quality [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C19" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C19">19</a>–
  <a rid="RSOS181754C21" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C21">21</a>]. Second, as water undergoes phase changes (i.e. liquid to solid and vice versa) it causes cell membranes to rupture and this breakage allows enhanced physical leakage during subsequent thaw periods. This process of the soluble contents of the cell leaving is known as ‘drip-loss’ [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C22" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C22">22</a>–
  <a rid="RSOS181754C24" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C24">24</a>]. Finally, ‘drip-loss’ also causes enhanced microbial degradation during thaw periods because nutrients are easily accessed by microbes both within a cell and in the area surrounding the damaged food item [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C25" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C25">25</a>]. By extension, perishable food cached by Canada jays could be susceptible to degradation caused by freeze–thaw events and thus they should be considered when evaluating the ‘hoard-rot’ hypothesis.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our goal was to examine how climate variables linked to specific food degradation mechanisms might influence Canada jay reproductive performance. Using data on reproductive performance from an individually marked population of Canada jays in APP, we examined two hypotheses. The first, ‘Warmer-Temperatures’ hypothesis was that increasing mean temperatures during the autumn and pre-breeding periods lead to greater microbial degradation of perishable food caches that are used by jays during their late-winter breeding period. The second, ‘Number of Freeze–Thaw Events' hypothesis was that the number of freeze–thaw events that occurred during the autumn and pre-breeding periods would damage perishable cached food through both physical and microbial degradation, limiting the amount of food available during the late-winter breeding period. We tested predictions arising from these hypotheses by measuring brood size, nest success and nestling condition from 718 nests monitored between 1977 and 2016.</p>
