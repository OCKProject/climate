  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS181754F1" href="#RSOS181754F1">figure 1</a>; APP; 45° N, 78° W), where Canada jays have been marked and monitored since 1964 [

  <a rid="RSOS181754C28" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C28">28</a>]. Individuals within the study area maintain approximately 130 ha year-round territories and store food items under tree bark and arboreal lichens beginning in the late summer and early autumn [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C29">29</a>]. In this analysis, we use data beginning in 1977 because few nests were found prior to this year and it also allowed us to include a higher proportion of known-age birds.

The dashed red line represents the initial freezing point (−1.9°C), which was used to calculate freeze–thaw events (see Methods). When maximum daily temperatures exceeded the initial freezing point and minimum temperatures were below the initial freezing point a freeze–thaw event was determined to have occurred.

  <span class="italic">N</span> = 40; 1977–2016) up to 25 nests (mean 18, range 9–25 including failed nests) in the study area were found and monitored throughout the breeding season (February–May). Nests were accessed when nestlings were approximately 11 days old, which is roughly halfway through the 22–24 day long nestling period. At the time when nests were accessed, we took morphometric measurements of young and determined brood size. All young were given a unique combination of coloured leg bands and a Canadian Wildlife Service aluminium band. Unmarked individuals that disperse into the study site, typically as juveniles, were captured during the autumn population census conducted in October and uniquely marked in the same way as nestlings.
