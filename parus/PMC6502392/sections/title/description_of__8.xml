 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both mean temperature and frequency of freeze–thaw events varied considerably over the course of the study. Mean temperature in the autumn ranged from −4.4°C to 2.4°C (mean ± s.d.; −0.6°C ± 1.5), while mean pre-breeding temperature varied from −16.4°C to −6.2°C (−10.7°C ± 2.3). The frequency of freeze–thaw events in the autumn ranged from 20 to 57 (40 ± 11) and between 1 and 32 (15 ± 7) in the pre-breeding period.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Brood size ranged from no nestlings (failed nests) to a maximum of five nestlings (1.7 ± 1.4 nestlings). Thirty-five per cent (252 of 718) of nests failed before banding at day 11 and nestling condition varied widely across nests, with residuals from the mass-body size regression ranging from −18.80 to 13.44 (0.18 ± 4.1). Neither mean temperature nor freeze–thaw events showed an increasing trend over the course of our 40-year study (mean temperature: −0.397 ± 0.16,
