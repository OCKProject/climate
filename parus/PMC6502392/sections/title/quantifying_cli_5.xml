 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Freeze–thaw events were calculated by estimating the ‘initial freezing point’ (IFP) of food types (meat, mushrooms and berries) that emulated food items consumed by Canada jays ([

We decided to use the mean of the initial freezing point of meat (−1.9°C) as the value to calculate freeze–thaw events from the historical climate records because this was the lowest value among the food types we surveyed from the literature (electronic supplementary material, table S2) and, therefore, a conservative representation of the initial freezing point for food consumed by jays (i.e. produced the fewest freeze–thaw events). We considered a freeze–thaw event to occur when daily maximum temperatures and daily minimum temperature fluctuated above and below the IFP. For example, if minimum temperatures were below the IFP on consecutive days and maximum temperature rose above IFP on one of these days, then we considered this to be a freeze–thaw event (

The total number of freeze–thaw events was then summed for both autumn (October–December) and pre-breeding (January–February) periods. Mean daily temperatures were averaged during the autumn and pre-breeding periods to calculate a mean temperature for each period.
