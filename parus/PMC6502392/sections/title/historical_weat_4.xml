 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Historical weather records (maximum, minimum and mean temperatures) for two periods of the annual cycle (‘autumn’: October–December and ‘pre-breeding’: January–February) were available from two weather stations. Weather data from 1977 to 2005 were collected from the Dwight weather station (45°23′ N 78°54′ W; 
  <span xlink:href="http://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_e.html" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_e.html</span>), 15 km outside Algonquin's western boundary and data from 2004 to 2017 were collected at its East Gate (45°32′ N 78°16′ W;

For the time period of overlap between the two weather stations (September 2004–December 2005), we compared temperatures from the two stations using reduced major axis (RMA) regression. RMA regression was used because there is potential measurement error associated with temperature (i.e. at each station; [

The relationship of all three temperature variables between the two weather stations appeared to vary seasonally, so we used two season-specific (‘seasons’ determined by the equinoxes) equations to adjust the data from the Dwight station (East Gate autumn temperature: −0.949 + 0.997 × Dwight autumn temperature,

  </span> = 0.96, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001 and East Gate winter temperature: −0.989 + 1.023 × Dwight winter temperature, 
  <span class="italic">R
   <span class="sup">2</span>
  </span> = 0.91, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001) were applied to the Dwight data.
