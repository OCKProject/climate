 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There was only one top model to predict variation in nest success (whether a nest contained nestlings at the time of banding) and, similar to brood size models, it included both the frequency of autumn freeze–thaw events and mean pre-breeding temperatures (
  <a rid="RSOS181754TB3" ref-type="table" href="#RSOS181754TB3">table 3</a>). However, the top model also included an interaction between lay date and the frequency of autumn freeze–thaw events, suggesting that the negative effect of freeze–thaw events on nest success was more pronounced for late nests compared to early nests (estimate and 95% confidence interval; −0.26 (−0.275–−0.225);
