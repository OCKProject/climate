 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study provides evidence that the number of freeze–thaw events during the autumn caching period and, to a lesser extent, mean temperature in the winter pre-breeding period carry over to influence several measures of reproductive performance in Canada jays during their subsequent late-winter breeding season. Our estimate of the effect size of autumn freeze–thaw events on brood size is similar to the estimated effect size of autumn temperature on brood size in a previous study [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C17" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C17">17</a>]. However, our work also demonstrates negative effects of autumn freeze–thaw events on both nest success and nestling condition and shows either no effect or a positive effect of autumn temperatures on these same reproductive metrics. Thus, our results support the general notion that cached food could be degraded by autumn conditions [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C17" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C17">17</a>], but provides stronger support for freeze–thaw events as the specific climate mechanism acting to influence perishable cached food.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Experimental studies on food consumed by humans have demonstrated consistent negative effects of freeze–thaw events on food quality [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C19" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C19">19</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS181754C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C20">20</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS181754C22" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C22">22</a>–
  <a rid="RSOS181754C24" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C24">24</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS181754C42" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C42">42</a>], and it is likely that similar effects occur with perishable food items cached by Canada jays. While we provide support for this hypothesis, it is important to note that we have not directly tested the effect of freeze–thaw events on cached food. Further, our results permit few firm conclusions about the relative importance of the mechanisms by which freeze–thaw events are known to degrade food quality. It seems unlikely that the denaturation of proteins alone could be responsible for a majority of the degradation of food caches because protein within a food item is probably not being degraded to the point where it is no longer usable by Canada jays [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C20">20</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS181754C25" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C25">25</a>]. However, it is difficult to differentiate between the degradation caused by the two remaining processes associated with freeze–thaw events. Both drip loss and enhanced microbial degradation during thaw periods stem from the prior physical damage to cell membranes caused by freezing and thawing [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C20">20</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS181754C22" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C22">22</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS181754C23" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C23">23</a>]. The primary differences between these processes are that degradation due to drip-loss could, in principle, occur in a completely sterile environment and would be dependent on the duration of post-freezing thaws (i.e. longer thaws allow more liquid to leave the cell), whereas food quality degradation attributable to enhanced microbial growth will depend on the intensity (warmth), as well as the duration of post-freezing thaws. These distinctions aside, our finding of an important effect of freeze–thaw events in the autumn, as opposed to those occurring in the pre-breeding period, is equally consistent with degradation due to both drip loss and microbial growth. An autumn freeze–thaw event is expected to have a more negative impact on subsequent reproductive performance simply because the total duration of subsequent thaws, between storage and the eventual breeding-season consumption of a cached food item, will be longer after an autumn freezing event than after a late-winter, pre-breeding event.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our finding that the total number of autumn freeze–thaw events is negatively correlated with reproductive performance also suggests that continued freezing and thawing is an important determinant of food quality. Above we outlined the processes by which a single freeze–thaw event may influence food quality, but there is evidence that the negative effects become compounded with each freeze–thaw events that occurs [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C20">20</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS181754C21" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C21">21</a>]. Previous experiments have demonstrated this over the course of relatively few cycles (e.g. 4–6), but it remains to be seen if the negative effects of freeze–thaw events would continue to accumulate over a typical autumn/late winter period in APP, or if there is a point where food quality deteriorates to a point where it is no longer influenced by additional freeze–thaw events.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is interesting to note that autumn freeze–thaw events appear to be carrying over to influence decisions and outcomes at multiple stages of the breeding period. Both brood size and nest success are directly related to decisions that a breeding pair makes, in particular, how much energy to allocate to reproduction instead of maintaining individual condition [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C13">13</a>]. Cached food is used to support pre-breeding weight gain in females [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C15" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C15">15</a>] and, therefore, if food has degraded prior to clutch initiation, females may choose to invest less energy towards the number of eggs laid and divert it instead towards maintaining their over-winter condition. This is supported by previous work on Canada jays that has demonstrated an effect of autumn climatic conditions on reproduction [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C17" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C17">17</a>], but not on over-winter survival [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C13">13</a>]. Similarly, nest success could be influenced by food available to a female because this would dictate the amount of energy that can be invested in reproduction and when a female should abandon a nest to devote more energy to survival. Although we are unable to identify the cause of failure for most nests, decreased food quality could lead to a greater number of foraging trips by a female or a greater proportion of time spent away from a nest. Both of these scenarios could lead to increased rates of predation because increased activity at the nest could attract predators and time spent away from the nest could mean that females are less able to defend their nest. In contrast to both brood size and nest success, nestling condition is directly influenced by the quality of food that is being fed to young as they develop [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C43" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C43">43</a>]. Therefore, when food is degraded by environmental conditions, less energy can be derived from each cached food item and nestling condition would be expected to suffer.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analysis also points to an intriguing interaction between events in two different periods of the annual cycle. In terms of nest success, Canada jays nesting later in the season, perhaps due to inexperience or lower food reserves, appear to be more susceptible to variation in the frequency of autumn freeze–thaw events compared to individuals nesting early in the season. Individuals nesting later in the season may be raising nestlings at times when temperatures have warmed sufficiently to degrade cached food stores and when there is still little fresh food available in the environment. Thus, late nesting pairs could be more heavily impacted by poor autumn conditions, while early nesting pairs may still have sufficient cached food stores to raise young, even under poor autumn conditions. The importance of early nesting for reproductive performance has been reported previously [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C30" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C30">30</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS181754C35" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C35">35</a>], and, collectively, our work highlights an interesting, potentially opposing effect of long-term changes in climate: warmer autumns, which could lead to an increased number of freeze–thaw events, appear to have a negative effect on reproductive performance [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C17" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C17">17</a>], whereas warmer late winters appear to have a positive effect because a higher proportion of birds nest earlier in the season and, therefore, have higher reproductive success. How these opposing effects of climate may influence long-term population trends remains to be investigated.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to the observed effects on reproductive performance, climate variables in the autumn and pre-breeding periods could carry over to influence other vital rates, such as juvenile survival. Nestling condition is a key determinant of post-fledging survival and, in many passerine species including European blackbirds (
  <span class="italic">Turdus merula</span>), great tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) and coal tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus ater</span>), there is a positive relationship between nestling condition and survival [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C44" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C44">44</a>–
  <a rid="RSOS181754C46" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C46">46</a>]. The negative relationship we observed between autumn climate and nestling condition suggests that conditions during the autumn caching period could influence more than just fecundity. Future studies are needed to quantify potential effects of climatic phenomena across critical life stages, which could have a significant downstream impact on population growth rate.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Contrary to the predictions of the hoard-rot hypothesis, we found a positive correlation between autumn temperature and nestling condition. This surprising effect is challenging to explain but one possibility is that warmer temperatures could have a positive influence on the over-winter survival of prey items that become available in the spring during the nestling period. Warmer autumn conditions generally translate to more benign over-wintering conditions that increase arthropod survival [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C47" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C47">47</a>]. Higher autumn temperatures could, therefore, produce larger or earlier emergence events in the spring and more opportunity for adults to collect greater volumes of food to feed nestlings.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although we provide evidence that Canada jay reproductive performance is influenced by climate during the autumn and, to a lesser extent, the winter pre-breeding period, we do not yet know if these factors are driving the observed decline of Canada jays in APP. Neither freeze–thaw events nor mean temperature in either the autumn or pre-breeding period showed a significant linear increase over time. Previous studies [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C16" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C16">16</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS181754C17" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C17">17</a>] found an increase in mean autumn temperature over time in Algonquin Provincial Park, but immediately after these studies were published a period of cold winters led to the observed trend becoming not significant over time. Thus, while variation in autumn and winter climate may play important roles in determining fecundity, it is possible that fecundity may not be the primary vital rate driving population growth. Consistent with this, observed declines in fecundity in our study population do not match steeper declines in population abundance. There is also no evidence for a corresponding decline in adult survival over the same time period [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C13">13</a>]. The primary demographic vital rate driving declines may be juvenile (first year) survival and subsequent lack of recruitment into the population. What is required is an understanding of how environmental factors throughout the annual cycle influence all vital rates, as well as the relative contribution of those vital rates to population growth [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C48" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C48">48</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Identifying mechanisms that link climate change and fitness are important in order to predict future population responses to climate change [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C6" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C6">6</a>]. Our results suggest that Canada jay populations in areas experiencing increases in the number of freeze–thaw events and warmer winter temperatures could be particularly susceptible to climate change. Environments at both high elevations and northern latitudes, which include much of the Canada jay's range, are predicted to experience more pronounced changes in temperature and precipitation over time than other regions in North America [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C49" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C49">49</a>]. These predicted changes in climate across North America could lead to widespread population declines that may not be restricted to the current southern edge of the Canada jay's range.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study presents evidence of freeze–thaw events influencing reproductive performance in a single food-caching species, but several other food-caching species could be similarly affected by carry-over effects of environmental phenomena. Following the framework proposed by Sutton 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C9" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C9">9</a>], species that store perishable foods for long periods of time, similar to Canada jays, are predicted to be most susceptible to environmental conditions that influence food quality over time. One species in this high-risk category is the wolverine (
  <span class="italic">Gulo gulo</span>), which is declining at the southern edge of its range [
  <a rid="RSOS181754C50" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C50">50</a>]. However, few other species in this category have sufficient demographic data necessary to evaluate how degradation of cached food could influence either survival or reproduction. Long-term demographic studies are needed to assess how climatic events throughout the year, and in particular the events that occur between storage and retrieval of a food item, could influence either survival or reproduction in these species.
