   <a rid="RSOS181754C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C29">29</a>]. In this analysis, we use data beginning in 1977 because few nests were found prior to this year and it also allowed us to include a higher proportion of known-age birds.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each year (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 40; 1977–2016) up to 25 nests (mean 18, range 9–25 including failed nests) in the study area were found and monitored throughout the breeding season (February–May). Nests were accessed when nestlings were approximately 11 days old, which is roughly halfway through the 22–24 day long nestling period. At the time when nests were accessed, we took morphometric measurements of young and determined brood size. All young were given a unique combination of coloured leg bands and a Canadian Wildlife Service aluminium band. Unmarked individuals that disperse into the study site, typically as juveniles, were captured during the autumn population census conducted in October and uniquely marked in the same way as nestlings.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reproductive performance</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We considered three metrics of reproductive performance: 
   <div list-type="simple" class="list">
    <div class="list-item">
     <span class="label">(1)</span>
     <p>‘Brood size’: the total number of nestlings in a nest at the time of banding (excluding nests that failed prior to nestlings being banded and measured). We did not use clutch size as a metric of reproductive performance because, logistically, we were unable to access nests multiple times throughout the reproductive period. However, we believe that, for the vast majority of nests, our brood size and clutch size were the same because there were very few cases where we observed additional eggs at the time of banding.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <span class="label">(2)</span>
     <p>‘Nest success’: whether the first nest attempt of the year had young in the nest at the time they were banded and measured. We acknowledge that this may not be a true representation of fledging success because nestlings were banded and measured halfway through the nestling period. However, for a subset of nests that we monitored after banding, we observed few predation events, which suggests that the presence of nestlings at the time the nest was accessed was a good indicator that they will fledge from the nest.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <span class="label">(3)</span>
     <p>‘Nestling condition’: mass given body size of a nestling at the time it is banded and measured in the nest (typically ∼ 11 days after hatching). Nestling condition was calculated following Derbyshire 
      <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
      <a rid="RSOS181754C30" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C30">30</a>] by first estimating body size using a principal component analysis (PCA; [
      <a rid="RSOS181754C31" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C31">31</a>,
      <a rid="RSOS181754C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C32">32</a>]) on a correlation matrix of tarsus, seventh primary and bill length measurements. This estimate was then regressed against mass using an asymptotic exponential model and residuals from this model were considered to be an estimate of body condition [
      <a rid="RSOS181754C30" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C30">30</a>]. Negative residuals represent individuals that weighed less than expected for a given body size and therefore were assumed to be in below-average condition, while individuals with positive residuals weighed more than expected for a given body size and were assumed to be in above-average condition. We assumed that our condition estimate was a good estimate of body condition at the time of measurement, but have not formally investigated the downstream consequences of our condition estimates on survival. In total, 1263 nestlings from 718 nests were used in the analysis.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Historical weather data</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Historical weather records (maximum, minimum and mean temperatures) for two periods of the annual cycle (‘autumn’: October–December and ‘pre-breeding’: January–February) were available from two weather stations. Weather data from 1977 to 2005 were collected from the Dwight weather station (45°23′ N 78°54′ W; 
   <span xlink:href="http://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_e.html" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_e.html</span>), 15 km outside Algonquin's western boundary and data from 2004 to 2017 were collected at its East Gate (45°32′ N 78°16′ W; 
   <span xlink:href="https://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/on-29_metric_e.html" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/on-29_metric_e.html</span>), located in the southeastern section of our study area. For the time period of overlap between the two weather stations (September 2004–December 2005), we compared temperatures from the two stations using reduced major axis (RMA) regression. RMA regression was used because there is potential measurement error associated with temperature (i.e. at each station; [
   <a rid="RSOS181754C33" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C33">33</a>]). The regression equations generated were then used to transform data from the Dwight weather station. The relationship of all three temperature variables between the two weather stations appeared to vary seasonally, so we used two season-specific (‘seasons’ determined by the equinoxes) equations to adjust the data from the Dwight station (East Gate autumn temperature: −0.949 + 0.997 × Dwight autumn temperature, 
   <span class="italic">R
    <span class="sup">2</span>
   </span> = 0.96,

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Quantifying climate variables</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Freeze–thaw events were calculated by estimating the ‘initial freezing point’ (IFP) of food types (meat, mushrooms and berries) that emulated food items consumed by Canada jays ([
   <a rid="RSOS181754C12" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C12">12</a>]; see electronic supplementary material, table S1). IFP, the point at which ice crystal formation begins, is required to predict both physical and microbial properties of food [
   <a rid="RSOS181754C34" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C34">34</a>]. We decided to use the mean of the initial freezing point of meat (−1.9°C) as the value to calculate freeze–thaw events from the historical climate records because this was the lowest value among the food types we surveyed from the literature (electronic supplementary material, table S2) and, therefore, a conservative representation of the initial freezing point for food consumed by jays (i.e. produced the fewest freeze–thaw events). We considered a freeze–thaw event to occur when daily maximum temperatures and daily minimum temperature fluctuated above and below the IFP. For example, if minimum temperatures were below the IFP on consecutive days and maximum temperature rose above IFP on one of these days, then we considered this to be a freeze–thaw event (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS181754F1" href="#RSOS181754F1">figure 1</a>). The total number of freeze–thaw events was then summed for both autumn (October–December) and pre-breeding (January–February) periods. Mean daily temperatures were averaged during the autumn and pre-breeding periods to calculate a mean temperature for each period.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistical analysis</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To understand how the frequency of freeze–thaw events and mean temperature during the autumn and pre-breeding periods influenced reproductive performance, we constructed a series of generalized mixed effect models for each response variable (brood size: Poisson distribution; nest success: binomial distribution; nestling condition: Gaussian distribution). All models predicting brood size excluded failed nests (brood size = 0) because we were interested in variation in brood size of nests that had young at the time of banding. For each model series, we considered four climate variables: the frequency of freeze–thaw events during the autumn (Freeze-Autumn), the frequency of freeze–thaw events during the pre-breeding period (Freeze-Pre), mean temperature during the autumn (Temp-Autumn) and mean temperature during the pre-breeding period (Temp-Pre). Each series of models, including the base model without climate variables, included the following fixed effects: supplementation (whether individuals on specific territories were regularly fed by park visitors; see Derbyshire 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
   <a rid="RSOS181754C30" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C30">30</a>]), male age, female age and first egg date (the date at which females began incubating). Each fixed effect was included based on previous evidence suggesting that it influences reproductive performance (supplementation [

   <a rid="RSOS181754C35" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C35">35</a>]). For the nestling condition model, brood size was also included as a fixed effect. All models also included year and male and female identity as random effects because many individuals bred in multiple years. For each response variable, we constructed models with single climate variables as well as all possible combination of climate variables in addition to the fixed effects in the base model. We also included an interaction between first egg date and freeze–thaw events or temperature because we were interested in examining whether the possible negative effects of these climate variables were stronger for pairs that nested later in the season given that (i) there is evidence that later nesting birds have lower reproductive success [
   <a rid="RSOS181754C28" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C28">28</a>,
   <a rid="RSOS181754C30" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181754C30">30</a>] and (ii) later nesting birds would retrieve caches that have been stored for longer periods of time to feed their young compared to earlier nesting birds.
