  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ten unrelated great tit nestlings, at 14 days post hatching, were sampled from across the Wytham Woods population and brain, heart, kidney, liver, muscle (pectoralis major), pancreas, skin and testes/ovaries dissected from each individual at between three and 23 minutes after death. Each chick was sexed at sampling and sex was later confirmed molecularly with the Z-002A marker [

   <span class="sup">® </span>(Invitrogen) method. RNA quantity and degradation was tested using a Nanodrop (Agilent) with each tissue yielding a mean (standard error) of 44.4 (7.5) μg of RNA with mean (standard error) RNA integrity number (RIN) of 8.37 (0.21). For each tissue 1 μg of RNA from each bird was pooled, i.e. to make 8 tissue pools, each containing 10 μg of RNA. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesised by Evrogen (Moscow, Russia) from the eight tissue-specific pools using SMART kits [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B36" href="#B36">36</a>]. cDNA was normalised, also by Evrogen. cDNA sequencing was performed by the Liverpool Advanced Genomics Facility, with 3 μg of normalised cDNA sequenced on a 454 FLX Titanium Genome Sequencer. Each tissue was sequenced on half a plate, i.e. four plates were sequenced in total, giving an expected 1600 Mbp of sequence (mean read length 400, 1 M reads per plate;

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Assembly</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our strategy for transcriptome assembly was to first combine sequences from all tissues to create a de novo assembly, and then map sequences from each tissue onto the assembly to examine tissue-specific expression. Using the program NGen (version 2) (DNASTAR, Inc), sequences within each tissue pool were combined and screened to remove poly(A) tails, SMART kit primer sequences (added during cDNA library construction), adaptor sequences (added to enable purification, amplification and sequencing by the FLX technology) and poor quality sequences (average sequence quality less than 14 in a 30 base window). The trimmed sequences were then assembled de novo (i.e., assembled without a reference) with NGen after first assessing the impact of varying various assembly parameters. The final parameter settings of match size 41 (default 19), match percentage 90 (default 85), mismatch penalty 25, gap penalty 25 and minimum average sequence quality 14 were chosen on the basis that they (i) obtained coverage most similar to our expectation of 41x, (ii) had strict settings for match size and minimum match percentage, and should therefore be conservative and (iii) produced the overall highest mean contig length and number of sequences per contig. The choice of assembly was verified by visual examination of the quality of the alignments within a random subset of contigs. For all assemblies, contigs with less than four sequences were excluded from further analysis.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tissue-specific assemblies were also made. Following removal of poly(A) tails, SMART kit primer sequences, adaptor sequences and poor quality sequences with NGen, each of the eight tissue pools was separately mapped onto the all-tissues transcriptome assembly. Default parameters for a reference-guided assembly were used, except for a longer match size (41, default 19) and higher match percentage (90, default 85) than the default settings.</p>

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Potentially some contigs may be expressed in all eight tissues, and some in only one tissue. For each tissue assembly, we assessed how many sequences were assembled into each contig (i.e. by examining the read depth of the contig). Contigs which were absent from a tissue-specific assembly were regarded as not expressed in that tissue at the time of sampling. Contigs which are expressed in all tissues (i.e. each tissue contributes at least one sequence read to the contig) and contigs which were tissue specific (all reads come from a single tissue, with a minimum of four reads from that tissue) were identified. In addition, more formally for each contig a measure of tissue specificity (τ) was calculated. Values for τ range from 0 (transcripts equally expressed in all tissues) to 1 (transcript expression is highly tissue-specific, i.e. very high expression in one tissue). τ accounts for differences in the total number of reads in different tissues [

   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For contigs previously identified as tissue-specific or expressed in all tissues (see "Tissue specificity" above), tissue-unique GO terms were identified by finding GO terms associated with tissue-unique contigs which were not associated with contigs from any other tissue. To investigate whether individual tissues were associated with specific GO terms, the 'pedigree' of each of these tissue-unique GO terms was determined from the GO full ontology file. All GO terms are assigned a domain ('namespace', or equivalently 'root term') of either biological process, molecular function or cellular component [

Note that although all GO terms map to one namespace through subtype 'is_a' relationships, it is possible to map to alternate namespaces through 'part_of' relationships. For each GO term, we extracted the full "pedigree" of the term by finding all possible paths from the GO term to the root term following (i) 'is_a' and 'part_of' relationships, and (ii) by following only 'is_a' relationships.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Contigs may align with a region of the zebra finch genome but not have significant blast alignments with any of the genes in the zebra finch cDNA database, either because some genes are not yet annotated in zebra finch, or because they are aligning to non-exonic gene features, i.e. introns, 5' untranslated regions (5' UTR) or 3' UTR. It is generally assumed that transcriptome sequencing preferentially sequences mRNA, and that other RNA species such as pre-mRNA, the precursor molecule to mRNA, are either not amplified or are present in such small quantities in the cell that sequencing them is unlikely (although see Bakel 
    <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B41" href="#B41">41</a>]). To determine whether non-coding contigs represent pre-mRNA, the location of the nearest gene was calculated by finding the shortest distance between the genome location of known zebra finch genes and the position of the contig alignment to the zebra finch genome (that is, the shortest distance to the start of the 5' UTR or the end of the 3' UTR). The contig was classified into one of six classes according to its genome location relative to the closest mapped gene; class A-contig is downstream from the nearest gene, class B-contig is upstream from the gene, class C-contig is downstream but overlapping one end of the gene, class D-contig is upstream but overlapping one end of the gene, class E-the contig spans the gene, class F-the gene spans the contig (Table 
    <a ref-type="table" rid="T5" href="#T5">5</a>). Note that "upstream" and "downstream" refer to the orientation of the zebra finch genome assembly, for example, position 345 on Tgu1 is upstream from position 350 on Tgu1. Contigs in classes C, D, E and F were further classified to determine whether the 5' and 3' ends of the contig aligned to the 5' UTR, exons, introns or 3' UTR of the gene.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to determine whether non-coding contigs were closer to genes than expected by chance, the distribution of contigs relative to genes in the zebra finch genome was assessed by simulating the random placement of contigs onto the zebra finch genome and calculating the minimum distance from the start or end of a contig to the start or end of a gene. Contigs were selected at random, placed at a randomly chosen position in the genome, and the minimum distance to a gene calculated. One million replicates were performed to generate a distribution of the distance between randomly placed contigs and the nearest gene, i.e., the distribution expected if contigs were not cDNA generated from mRNA (i.e., gene sequences) but were random fragments of genomic DNA. The observed and simulated distributions were compared with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given that class A and B contigs do not overlap annotated coding regions in the zebra finch genome, these "non-gene" contig sequences may represent non-coding RNA, although it is possible that they instead represent gene sequences which are unannotated in the zebra finch genome, or that the start or end position of genes is imprecise or differs between great tit and zebra finch. To assess the alignment between class A and B contigs with non-coding RNA, non-coding RNA sequences (including miRNA (micro), rRNA (ribosomal), snoRNA (small nucleolar), snRNA (small nuclear) and misc_RNA (miscellaneous)) were downloaded from the Ensembl website

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the objectives of the transcriptome sequencing was to identify SNPs which could eventually be typed in a large sample of well-phenotyped individuals as part of a QTL mapping experiment. SeqMan NGen was used to produce a summary file of all SNPs and insertion-deletions (indels) in the great tit contig sequences, selecting only those SNPs with base call quality score greater than 30 and where the six neighbouring bases had a quality score more than 20. The summary file was filtered in a hierarchical manner to give a set of SNPs most likely to be segregating in the Wytham Woods population. The summary file was first screened to remove indels, polymorphisms of depth less than eight reads, and polymorphisms of depth 8-20 with minor allele frequency of less than 25%. Polymorphisms were then further screened to produce "high" and "modest" quality SNP files. For the high quality SNPs, (i) polymorphisms of depth greater than 20 with minor allele count of less than five were removed and (ii) polymorphisms located less than 50 bases from another polymorphism or from the start or end of a contig were removed. For the modest quality SNPs, (i) polymorphisms of depth greater than 20 with minor allele count of less than three were removed and (ii) polymorphisms located less than 40 bases from another polymorphism or from the start or end of a contig were removed. The majority of the high quality SNPs were reported in the modest quality file, although some previously detected high quality SNPs were excluded from the modest quality file because the inclusion of lower stringency SNPs meant they now mapped within 40 bases of another SNP.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The SNP discovery process was then repeated by reassembling the reads onto the great tit assembly using a higher match percentage (90, default 85) than the default settings ('remap assembly'). The match size was kept at the default value (25) rather than increased to 41 (as previously) to allow some movement of sequences from the contigs they were initially assembled to. Any SNPs from the first discovery phase that were not detected in the remap assembly were excluded from further analysis, as they are not robust to small changes in assembly parameters, and hence may not be true polymorphisms.</p>

However, genes which are alternatively spliced are a challenge to the assembly of transcriptome sequence into contigs, as it is difficult to predict whether reads extending over alternative splice sites will be assembled into the same contig, or split into two or more different contigs (Figure 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">2b</a>). For the scenario where reads from alternative splice variants are assembled into a single contig, some reads will "jump" one or more exons, resulting in a region of very poor alignment to the consensus sequence. Across many aligned reads, these regions of poor sequence similarity tend to produce a 'string' of putative (probably false) single nucleotide polymorphisms in close proximity. SNPs were extracted from the original unfiltered SNP summary file, and two or more SNPs were defined as being part of a 'string' provided the distance between them was less than eight bases (for example, a SNP string of five could at most be spread over 33 bases).
