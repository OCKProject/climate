 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The distribution of GO terms from the tissue-specific contigs into the three domains (biological process, molecular function and cellular component) is shown in Table 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T4" href="#T4">4</a>. Note that in general the total number of GO terms is greater than the number of unique contigs, as many of the contigs map to zebra finch genes with more than one associated GO term. Of the 33,574 contigs aligning with zebra finch cDNA sequences, GO terms could be extracted for 20,847 (62%) of the contigs. There were 5,906 contigs with GO terms expressed in all tissues and 2,782 tissue-specific contigs with GO terms (Table 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T4" href="#T4">4</a>). Many of the GO terms from tissue-specific contigs were found in more than one tissue (as many different genes may be associated with the same GO term). The tissue-unique GO terms (Table 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T4" href="#T4">4</a>) are listed in Additional file 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">1</a>, Table S2; a total of 114, 32, 58, 49, 44, 46, 67 and 117 GO terms were uniquely associated with contigs only expressed in brain, heart, kidney, liver, muscle, pancreas, skin and testes, respectively, while 1,654 GO terms were uniquely associated with contigs expressed in all tissues. A total of 84 tissue-unique GO terms were also highly tissue specific (τ &gt; 0.8) (Additional file 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">1</a>, Table S2). Interestingly, it was heart and pancreas that had the highest number of highly tissue specific GO terms (21.4% and 28.5% respectively), and of the seven terms with τ &gt; 0.85, four were unique to heart (connexon complex, myosin filament assembly, A band and myosin heavy chain binding), two to pancreas (glucosamine 6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase activity and cholecystokinin receptor activity) and one to skin (proton-dependent oligopeptide secondary active transmembrane transporter activity). The tissue specificity of these GO terms generally appears biologically consistent, although it is interesting to note, for example, two "ovarian" GO terms associated with testes-ovarian cumulus expansion and ovulation cycle, and two "respiratory" GO terms associated with heart-bronchus morphogenesis and trachea formation (Additional file 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">1</a>, Table S2). Such tissue overlap may reflect (incorrect) alignment of a contig to a protein which shares a conserved domain but has a different function.

   <p>Contigs were assigned into the three GO domains (biological process, molecular function and cellular component) through 'is_a' pedigree mapping. The number of unique GO terms is also reported for each tissue</p>
  </div>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The three GO domains (biological process; GO:0008150, molecular function; GO:0003674 and cellular component; GO:0005575) have 65 immediate child terms (35 with parent 'biological process', 17 with parent 'molecular function' and 13 with parent 'cellular component'). Of the sixty-five terms, 21 were not represented in any of the 'is_a' mappings, two were associated with only one tissue (GO:0016247-channel regulator activity, associated only with brain, and GO:0005198-structural molecule activity, associated only with muscle), and the remaining 42 were all parents of unique GO terms expressed in all tissues (Additional file 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">1</a>, Table S3). For combined 'is_a' and 'part_of' relationships, the same two GO terms were uniquely associated with brain and muscle, but only 14 were not represented in any of the "is_a" or "part_of" mappings, namely carbohydrate, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sugar, and sulfur utilization (domain: biological process), chemoattractant, chemorepellent, electron carrier and nutrient reservoir activity and protein tag (domain: molecular function) and symplast, virion and virion part (domain: cellular component). The remaining 49 terms were expressed in all tissues (Additional file 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">1</a>, Table S3)-i.e., seven GO terms mapped through only 'part_of' and not 'is_a' mappings-cell killing, cell wall organization or biogenesis, reproduction and viral reproduction (domain: biological process) and cell, extracellular region and extracellular region part (domain: cellular component) (Additional file 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">1</a>, Table S3). These results indicate that although there is evidence for highly tissue specific expression of 2,448 contigs (Table 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T2" href="#T2">2</a>), the GO annotations find only a few tissue-specific functions for these contigs (as classified by unique GO terms).
