 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ten unrelated great tit nestlings, at 14 days post hatching, were sampled from across the Wytham Woods population and brain, heart, kidney, liver, muscle (pectoralis major), pancreas, skin and testes/ovaries dissected from each individual at between three and 23 minutes after death. Each chick was sexed at sampling and sex was later confirmed molecularly with the Z-002A marker [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B35" href="#B35">35</a>]. Tissues were stored in RNALater (Ambion) to prevent RNA degradation. RNA was extracted using the TRIzol
  <span class="sup">® </span>(Invitrogen) method. RNA quantity and degradation was tested using a Nanodrop (Agilent) with each tissue yielding a mean (standard error) of 44.4 (7.5) μg of RNA with mean (standard error) RNA integrity number (RIN) of 8.37 (0.21). For each tissue 1 μg of RNA from each bird was pooled, i.e. to make 8 tissue pools, each containing 10 μg of RNA. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesised by Evrogen (Moscow, Russia) from the eight tissue-specific pools using SMART kits [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B36" href="#B36">36</a>]. cDNA was normalised, also by Evrogen. cDNA sequencing was performed by the Liverpool Advanced Genomics Facility, with 3 μg of normalised cDNA sequenced on a 454 FLX Titanium Genome Sequencer. Each tissue was sequenced on half a plate, i.e. four plates were sequenced in total, giving an expected 1600 Mbp of sequence (mean read length 400, 1 M reads per plate;

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B37" href="#B37">37</a>] of the total sequence meets quality criteria and assembles into contigs, a transcriptome coverage of ~41 is estimated.
