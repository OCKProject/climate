 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Microsatellite markers remain an informative and cost-effective tool for small scale population genetic studies. To detect repeats which may be screened to find polymorphic microsatellite markers in the great tit, a modified version of SPUTNIK (

Repeats and their flanking sequences (100 bp) were blasted against passerine microsatellite sequences (downloaded from NCBI;
