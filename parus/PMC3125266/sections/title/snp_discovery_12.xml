 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of an initial 1,038,094 SNPs identified by SeqMan NGen, 23,831 'high' and 35,579 'modest' quality SNPs were detected in 13,026 and 16,187 contigs respectively. The majority of the loss of SNPs was due to exclusion of SNPs with a minor allele count of less than three (~930,000 SNPs). Of the filtered SNPs, 22,427 (94%) high and 33,185 (93%) modest quality SNPs were confirmed by re-assembling pooled and trimmed sequences onto the consensus great tit assembly sequences. Although 35% of all great tit contigs align with zebra finch cDNA (Table 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T3" href="#T3">3</a>, Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1</a>), 46% of contigs containing high quality SNPs and 49% of contigs containing modest quality SNPs aligned with zebra finch cDNA. The reading frame of 4,822 high and 8,194 modest quality SNPs could be inferred from regions of alignment between zebra finch genes and the SNP-containing contig. Of these, 1,503 (31%) of high and 3,541 (43%) of modest quality SNPs caused non-synonymous substitutions while the remainder were not predicted to cause a change in the amino acid sequence (i.e., are synonymous substitutions). Both the number of SNPs and the number of microsatellites mapping to zebra finch chromosomes were highly correlated with the total length of these chromosomes (
