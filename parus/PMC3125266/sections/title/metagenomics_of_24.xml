 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some of the assembled contigs may not represent true great tit sequences, for instance if great tit tissue was contaminated with parasites, or RNA from other species was amplified and sequenced due to lab error. Contigs which did not align with zebra finch or chicken genome, cDNA or protein sequences were compared to sequences of other organisms by blasting against the latest NCBI Transcript Reference Sequence RNA database (RefSeq RNA;

  <span class="sup">-10 </span>and a word size of 20. For each contig, we extracted the genus names of all alignments ("hits") and classified genera as archea, bacteria, algae, protozoa, plant, fungi, invertebrate, vertebrate_fish, vertebrate_amphibians, vertebrate_mammalian, vertebrate_reptiles, vertebrate_birds, unknown or no_hits. Contigs with at least one hit to vertebrate_birds were considered likely to represent true great tit sequences, while contigs which aligned with no vertebrate sequences were further investigated by blasting against sequences from species important in the ecology of the great tit. All available DNA sequences from common great tit ectoparasites (genus 
  <span class="italic">Ceratophyllus </span>(flea) and

  <span class="italic">Trypanosoma avium </span>and genera 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Hepatozoon </span>and 
  <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span>), common trees in Wytham Woods (

Environmental sequences were blasted against contigs with e-value of 10
  <span class="sup">-10</span>. Singleton reads which were not assembled into contigs were also blasted against the 'environmental' sequences, with e-value cut-off of 10
