 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the objectives of the transcriptome sequencing was to identify SNPs which could eventually be typed in a large sample of well-phenotyped individuals as part of a QTL mapping experiment. SeqMan NGen was used to produce a summary file of all SNPs and insertion-deletions (indels) in the great tit contig sequences, selecting only those SNPs with base call quality score greater than 30 and where the six neighbouring bases had a quality score more than 20. The summary file was filtered in a hierarchical manner to give a set of SNPs most likely to be segregating in the Wytham Woods population. The summary file was first screened to remove indels, polymorphisms of depth less than eight reads, and polymorphisms of depth 8-20 with minor allele frequency of less than 25%. Polymorphisms were then further screened to produce "high" and "modest" quality SNP files. For the high quality SNPs, (i) polymorphisms of depth greater than 20 with minor allele count of less than five were removed and (ii) polymorphisms located less than 50 bases from another polymorphism or from the start or end of a contig were removed. For the modest quality SNPs, (i) polymorphisms of depth greater than 20 with minor allele count of less than three were removed and (ii) polymorphisms located less than 40 bases from another polymorphism or from the start or end of a contig were removed. The majority of the high quality SNPs were reported in the modest quality file, although some previously detected high quality SNPs were excluded from the modest quality file because the inclusion of lower stringency SNPs meant they now mapped within 40 bases of another SNP.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The SNP discovery process was then repeated by reassembling the reads onto the great tit assembly using a higher match percentage (90, default 85) than the default settings ('remap assembly'). The match size was kept at the default value (25) rather than increased to 41 (as previously) to allow some movement of sequences from the contigs they were initially assembled to. Any SNPs from the first discovery phase that were not detected in the remap assembly were excluded from further analysis, as they are not robust to small changes in assembly parameters, and hence may not be true polymorphisms.</p>
