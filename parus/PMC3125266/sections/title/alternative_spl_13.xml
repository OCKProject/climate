 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three hundred and thirty-two contigs (0.3%) contained 'strings' of at least six SNPs, suggesting these contigs are likely to include reads from alternative splice variants (strings of SNPs suggest regions of poor alignment representative of alternative splicing, see Methods). Of these, 195 contained only one SNP string. All but 13 of these contigs aligned with the zebra finch genome, and 187 aligned to a mapped gene. Contigs containing SNP strings were expressed in more tissues than contigs without SNP strings (difference of 3.07 tissues, 
  <span class="italic">t </span>= 64.14, 
  <span class="italic">p </span>&lt;&lt; 0.0001, two sided 
  <span class="italic">t </span>test with unequal variance) and were also less tissue specific (that is, were not predominantly expressed in only one tissue) than contigs without SNP strings (Ï„ difference of 0.29, 
  <span class="italic">t </span>= 20.62, 
  <span class="italic">p </span>&lt;&lt; 0.0001). This difference was smaller but still significant once contig length and the number of reads mapping to the contig was taken into account (difference of 0.14 tissues, generalised linear model with Poisson distributed errors, 
  <span class="italic">z </span>= 13.34, 
  <span class="italic">p </span>&lt;&lt; 0.0001). Although two of the alternative splice contigs were expressed in only one tissue (one each in heart and liver), two hundred and sixty two (79%) of the 332 alternative splice contigs were expressed in all eight tissues. These results suggest that it is uncommon (&lt; 1%) for a single tissue to generate more than one splice variant, and that for those alternative splice contigs expressed in more than one tissue, different tissues may be generating different alternative splice variants.
