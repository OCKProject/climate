 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most contig sequences mapped to the zebra finch (97%) and chicken (67%) genomes but only around 1/3 aligned with sequences in the zebra finch and chicken transcriptome databases (Table 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T3" href="#T3">3</a>). The divergence between chicken and passerines is thought to have occurred over 100 Mya while between zebra finch and great tit the divergence is ca. 50 Mya [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B26" href="#B26">26</a>]. The great tit genome has 2n = 80 chromosomes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B27" href="#B27">27</a>] and, given the relative stability of avian chromosomes [[
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B28" href="#B28">28</a>], and references therein], it is expected that the great tit genome is similar in size (1.2 GB) to the zebra finch [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B29" href="#B29">29</a>]. The majority of the contigs that aligned with zebra finch cDNA also aligned to chicken cDNA records (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1</a>). Only 1,913 (2%) contigs did not align with any of the zebra finch or chicken genome, cDNA or protein sequences; the mean length of these contigs was 512 bases so they were not unusually short. Approximately 54% of the sequences in the zebra finch cDNA database (18,597 sequences) and 49% of the sequences in the chicken cDNA database (22,314 sequences) matched great tit contigs suggesting that at least half of the previously known bird transcripts are represented in the assembled great tit contigs. The discordance between the number of contigs and the number of unique sequences they aligned with is due to multiple contigs mapping to the same gene. Given that the zebra finch cDNA database is 26.3 Mbp and the summed length of the reads contributing to contigs aligning with zebra finch cDNA sequences is 654.7 Mbp we estimate an overall transcriptome coverage of ~25×. This figure is lower than a predicted coverage of 41× (based on the amount of sequence generated) due to the low proportion of contigs aligning with zebra finch cDNA.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of the ten most highly expressed contigs (mean coverage depth greater than 1000), six aligned to sequences in the zebra finch and/or chicken cDNA databases. These genes were Pleckstrin homology domain-containing family B member 2 (Golgi organisation and kinesin and protein binding), THO complex subunit 4 (RNA splicing), EF-hand domain-containing protein (calcium ion binding), Diamine acetyltransferase 1, Breast cancer anti-estrogen resistance protein 3 (cell adhesion) and Cadherin-11 Precursor (cell adhesion). Contigs mapping to zebra finch or chicken cDNA and with mean coverage depth greater than 100 are shown in Additional file 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">1</a>, Table S1.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A small number of contigs aligned across most of their length to other contigs in the great tit assembly; blastclust grouped 525 contigs into 228 groups (between two to seven contigs per group) where there was similarity of 95% across all of the shortest contig. Relaxing the blastclust conditions slightly to a similarity of 95% across 95% of the shortest contig clustered 3,432 contigs into 1,184 groups (two to fifteen contigs per group). Given that the alignments are continuous across the shortest contig, there is no evidence to suggest that contigs within a cluster represent splice variants or that one or more of the contigs are pre-mRNA sequences. There is also little evidence to suggest that contigs within a cluster are expressed differentially in different tissues-for groups of two contigs the average correlation of tissue expression is 0.56 (182 pairs with 95% similarity across the shortest contig; for each pair the correlation was calculated from the total number of reads expressed in each tissue for each contig). Of the 182 pairs, 32 mapped to different genomic locations, suggesting that these contigs are paralogues. The remainder of contig pairs appear likely to represent different haplotypes of the same genomic region.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Contigs were also blasted against themselves to identify contigs which did not necessarily share sequence homology across their entire length. A large number (~200,000) of reciprocal pairs of contigs were identified which aligned with e-value less than 10
  <span class="sup">-5</span>. Of these, a very large number (159,956) were single alignments, suggesting regions of shared protein domains across different genes. Five percent of single alignments extended over more than 95% of the shortest contig and, as expected, the set of single alignments included the 187 pairs identified by the blastclust analysis. Twenty-two percent (45,886) of reciprocal pairs of contigs had multiple alignments rather than a single alignment. In a sample of 200 pairs of contigs with multiple alignments, 93 aligned disjointly (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">2a</a>), suggesting the two contigs may represent alternative splice variants, or one may be a pre-mRNA sequence. There were 25,589 contigs in one or more reciprocal pairs with multiple alignments, so a relatively large proportion (~12%) of the overall contig set may represent alternative mRNA or pre-mRNA sequences.

    <span class="bold">Processes whereby reads from one gene can lead to complex contigs</span>. 
    <span class="bold">a) Alignment with pre-mRNA sequences</span>. A gene sequence, including five and three prime untranslated regions, exons and introns, is initially transcribed completely from DNA into pre messenger RNA (pre-mRNA). Amplification and sequencing of RNA libraries may therefore generate contigs which represent pre-mRNA variants (some or all introns are included). In this example, variant 1 contains sequence from the three exons and both introns (solid lines) while variant 2 contains sequence from the three exons but only the first intron (solid line, the second intron is absent, represented by a thin dashed line). The same gene sequence may therefore be assembled into more than one contig. Alignment of such contigs is likely to occur across the whole length of one of the contigs, but occur disjointly for the other (in this case, the second intron in variant 1 cannot align to variant 2, so the two alignments between variant 1 and variant 2 occurs across the whole length of variant 2 but not variant 1) 
    <span class="bold">b) Alignment and detection of splice variants</span>. Reads generated from two different splice variants are shown in the middle of the figure; reads "missing" an exon are discontinuous across the whole coding sequence. Bottom left: all reads are (incorrectly) assembled into a single contig, with reads from the second splice variant contributing to 'strings' of polymorphism (false SNPs) in the consensus sequence (regions shaded grey). Bottom right: reads from the two splice variants are assembled into separate contigs, with no regions of poor sequence similarity

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The overall contig distribution across zebra finch chromosomes is reasonably uniform across the genome (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3</a>), although some regions of very high expression are evident (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">4</a>). There is a reasonable correlation between the distribution of contigs and the distribution of zebra finch genes across the genome (
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2 </span>= 0.34; see Additional file 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2" href="#S2">2</a>, Figure S1 for the distribution of zebra finch genes across the genome). There was no relationship between chromosome length and contig density (
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>1,28 </sub>= 1.35, 
  <span class="italic">p </span>= 0.26; 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2 </span>= 0.04). The mean contig density across chromosomes (excluding TguUn) is 83 contigs per Mbp. Despite a higher gene density on zebra finch microchromosomes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B30" href="#B30">30</a>], there was no evidence to suggest that the density of contigs mapping to microchromosomes (Tgu-13-28 and Tgu1B)-and macrochromosomes (Tgu-1-5 and Tgu1A) differed (
  <span class="italic">t </span>= 0.84, 
  <span class="italic">p </span>= 0.41, two sample 
  <span class="italic">t</span>-test with unequal variance). No contigs aligned with chromosomes Tgu-16, 22, 25, 26 or 27, and one contig containing 17 reads aligned with TguLG5 (part of the assembly that remains unassigned to a chromosome). Tgu-16, 22, 25, 26, 27 and TguLG5 have a combined length of 1.4% of the genome and contain 4.1% of annotated zebra finch genes; it appears likely that by chance these chromosomes have remained unsampled.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The consensus great tit contig sequences contained 99.9% unambiguous bases (A, G, C or T) and 0.1% ambiguous bases (B, D, H, K, M, N, R, S, V, W or Y; these positions may either represent regions of poor sequence quality or possible single nucleotide polymorphisms). The mean GC content of the unambiguous bases in the great tit assembly is 40.7%. The mean GC content in the zebra finch and chicken cDNA databases is 50.4% and 48.6% respectively, while the mean genome GC content of the zebra finch and chicken genomes is 41.3% and 41.6% respectively. The GC content for regions of alignment between great tit contigs (45.4%) and zebra finch cDNA sequences (45.7%) are similar. However, extending the calculation across the whole contig and the whole zebra finch gene it aligns to gives mean GC contents of 42.6% and 48.2% respectively. These figures suggest that either the great tit has an unusually low GC content or that, if it is assumed that the great tit transcriptome has a similar GC content to zebra finch and chicken, the set of great tit contigs may contain genomic as well as transcriptomic sequence-i.e., that some contigs contain intronic or non-transcribed (i.e., pre-mRNA) sequences.</p>
