 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alternative splicing produces genetic variation without the need for additional genes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B33" href="#B33">33</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B42" href="#B42">42</a>]. However, genes which are alternatively spliced are a challenge to the assembly of transcriptome sequence into contigs, as it is difficult to predict whether reads extending over alternative splice sites will be assembled into the same contig, or split into two or more different contigs (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">2b</a>). For the scenario where reads from alternative splice variants are assembled into a single contig, some reads will "jump" one or more exons, resulting in a region of very poor alignment to the consensus sequence. Across many aligned reads, these regions of poor sequence similarity tend to produce a 'string' of putative (probably false) single nucleotide polymorphisms in close proximity. SNPs were extracted from the original unfiltered SNP summary file, and two or more SNPs were defined as being part of a 'string' provided the distance between them was less than eight bases (for example, a SNP string of five could at most be spread over 33 bases). Strings of six or more SNPs were considered likely to represent splice variants.
