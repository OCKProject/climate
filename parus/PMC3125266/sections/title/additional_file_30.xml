  <span class="bold">Table S1</span>. Contigs with high coverage aligning with zebra finch or chicken genes. an excel table listing great tit contigs with high sequencing coverage which align with zebra finch and/or chicken genes. 
  <span class="bold">Table S2</span>. Unique GO terms associated with contigs expressed in only one tissue. an excel table listing the unique GO terms associated with contigs expressed only in one tissue. 
  <span class="bold">Table S3</span>. Classification of unique GO terms into children of the three namespaces. an excel table listing the classification of all the GO terms uniquely associated with contigs expressed in one (or all) tissues into the 65 GO terms which are 'children' of the three namespaces (molecular function, biological process and cellular component). 
  <span class="bold">Table S4</span>. Microsatellites detected in the great tit transcriptome. an excel table listing repeats detected in the great tit assembly. Repeats are listed along with at least 10 bases of flanking sequence on each side (up to a maximum of 200 bases of flanking sequence)
