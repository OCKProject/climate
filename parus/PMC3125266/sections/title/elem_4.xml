  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 4,587,574 sequences with a combined length of 1.4 billion bases were sequenced. Read lengths averaged 302 bases, with a maximum length of 2,028 bases (Table 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">1</a>). Pooling and trimming the sequences left a total of 4,130,014 reads for de novo assembly into contigs. The final NGen assembly ("the great tit assembly") yielded 95,979 contigs with four or more sequences, utilising 3,038,404 (74%) of the trimmed sequences. The mean contig length was 871 bases and the total length of assembled contigs was 83,601,386 bases. Despite normalisation of transcripts before sequencing, there was a large range (1-2,601) in the mean coverage depth of contigs (
   <span class="italic">i.e</span>., the mean number of reads in any given position in the contig), with overall mean coverage depth (accounting for difference in contig lengths) of 12.2x. The total number of sequences contributing to contigs was also highly variable, with a maximum of 9,633, and was relatively weakly correlated with the contig length (
   <span class="italic">r </span>= 0.45). The mean (standard error) and median number of sequences per contig was 32 (104) and 8 respectively. The 1,091,610 sequences not included in contigs ("singletons") had mean length 230 bases, making them shorter than the sequences included in contigs (323 bp) (

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most contig sequences mapped to the zebra finch (97%) and chicken (67%) genomes but only around 1/3 aligned with sequences in the zebra finch and chicken transcriptome databases (Table 
    <a ref-type="table" rid="T3" href="#T3">3</a>). The divergence between chicken and passerines is thought to have occurred over 100 Mya while between zebra finch and great tit the divergence is ca. 50 Mya [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B26" href="#B26">26</a>]. The great tit genome has 2n = 80 chromosomes [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B27" href="#B27">27</a>] and, given the relative stability of avian chromosomes [[
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B28" href="#B28">28</a>], and references therein], it is expected that the great tit genome is similar in size (1.2 GB) to the zebra finch [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B29" href="#B29">29</a>]. The majority of the contigs that aligned with zebra finch cDNA also aligned to chicken cDNA records (Figure 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1</a>). Only 1,913 (2%) contigs did not align with any of the zebra finch or chicken genome, cDNA or protein sequences; the mean length of these contigs was 512 bases so they were not unusually short. Approximately 54% of the sequences in the zebra finch cDNA database (18,597 sequences) and 49% of the sequences in the chicken cDNA database (22,314 sequences) matched great tit contigs suggesting that at least half of the previously known bird transcripts are represented in the assembled great tit contigs. The discordance between the number of contigs and the number of unique sequences they aligned with is due to multiple contigs mapping to the same gene. Given that the zebra finch cDNA database is 26.3 Mbp and the summed length of the reads contributing to contigs aligning with zebra finch cDNA sequences is 654.7 Mbp we estimate an overall transcriptome coverage of ~25×. This figure is lower than a predicted coverage of 41× (based on the amount of sequence generated) due to the low proportion of contigs aligning with zebra finch cDNA.

These genes were Pleckstrin homology domain-containing family B member 2 (Golgi organisation and kinesin and protein binding), THO complex subunit 4 (RNA splicing), EF-hand domain-containing protein (calcium ion binding), Diamine acetyltransferase 1, Breast cancer anti-estrogen resistance protein 3 (cell adhesion) and Cadherin-11 Precursor (cell adhesion). Contigs mapping to zebra finch or chicken cDNA and with mean coverage depth greater than 100 are shown in Additional file

   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A small number of contigs aligned across most of their length to other contigs in the great tit assembly; blastclust grouped 525 contigs into 228 groups (between two to seven contigs per group) where there was similarity of 95% across all of the shortest contig. Relaxing the blastclust conditions slightly to a similarity of 95% across 95% of the shortest contig clustered 3,432 contigs into 1,184 groups (two to fifteen contigs per group). Given that the alignments are continuous across the shortest contig, there is no evidence to suggest that contigs within a cluster represent splice variants or that one or more of the contigs are pre-mRNA sequences. There is also little evidence to suggest that contigs within a cluster are expressed differentially in different tissues-for groups of two contigs the average correlation of tissue expression is 0.56 (182 pairs with 95% similarity across the shortest contig; for each pair the correlation was calculated from the total number of reads expressed in each tissue for each contig). Of the 182 pairs, 32 mapped to different genomic locations, suggesting that these contigs are paralogues. The remainder of contig pairs appear likely to represent different haplotypes of the same genomic region.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Contigs were also blasted against themselves to identify contigs which did not necessarily share sequence homology across their entire length. A large number (~200,000) of reciprocal pairs of contigs were identified which aligned with e-value less than 10
    <span class="sup">-5</span>. Of these, a very large number (159,956) were single alignments, suggesting regions of shared protein domains across different genes. Five percent of single alignments extended over more than 95% of the shortest contig and, as expected, the set of single alignments included the 187 pairs identified by the blastclust analysis. Twenty-two percent (45,886) of reciprocal pairs of contigs had multiple alignments rather than a single alignment. In a sample of 200 pairs of contigs with multiple alignments, 93 aligned disjointly (Figure 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">2a</a>), suggesting the two contigs may represent alternative splice variants, or one may be a pre-mRNA sequence. There were 25,589 contigs in one or more reciprocal pairs with multiple alignments, so a relatively large proportion (~12%) of the overall contig set may represent alternative mRNA or pre-mRNA sequences.

      <span class="bold">a) Alignment with pre-mRNA sequences</span>. A gene sequence, including five and three prime untranslated regions, exons and introns, is initially transcribed completely from DNA into pre messenger RNA (pre-mRNA). Amplification and sequencing of RNA libraries may therefore generate contigs which represent pre-mRNA variants (some or all introns are included). In this example, variant 1 contains sequence from the three exons and both introns (solid lines) while variant 2 contains sequence from the three exons but only the first intron (solid line, the second intron is absent, represented by a thin dashed line). The same gene sequence may therefore be assembled into more than one contig. Alignment of such contigs is likely to occur across the whole length of one of the contigs, but occur disjointly for the other (in this case, the second intron in variant 1 cannot align to variant 2, so the two alignments between variant 1 and variant 2 occurs across the whole length of variant 2 but not variant 1) 
      <span class="bold">b) Alignment and detection of splice variants</span>. Reads generated from two different splice variants are shown in the middle of the figure; reads "missing" an exon are discontinuous across the whole coding sequence. Bottom left: all reads are (incorrectly) assembled into a single contig, with reads from the second splice variant contributing to 'strings' of polymorphism (false SNPs) in the consensus sequence (regions shaded grey). Bottom right: reads from the two splice variants are assembled into separate contigs, with no regions of poor sequence similarity

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B30" href="#B30">30</a>], there was no evidence to suggest that the density of contigs mapping to microchromosomes (Tgu-13-28 and Tgu1B)-and macrochromosomes (Tgu-1-5 and Tgu1A) differed (

No contigs aligned with chromosomes Tgu-16, 22, 25, 26 or 27, and one contig containing 17 reads aligned with TguLG5 (part of the assembly that remains unassigned to a chromosome). Tgu-16, 22, 25, 26, 27 and TguLG5 have a combined length of 1.4% of the genome and contain 4.1% of annotated zebra finch genes; it appears likely that by chance these chromosomes have remained unsampled.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The consensus great tit contig sequences contained 99.9% unambiguous bases (A, G, C or T) and 0.1% ambiguous bases (B, D, H, K, M, N, R, S, V, W or Y; these positions may either represent regions of poor sequence quality or possible single nucleotide polymorphisms). The mean GC content of the unambiguous bases in the great tit assembly is 40.7%. The mean GC content in the zebra finch and chicken cDNA databases is 50.4% and 48.6% respectively, while the mean genome GC content of the zebra finch and chicken genomes is 41.3% and 41.6% respectively. The GC content for regions of alignment between great tit contigs (45.4%) and zebra finch cDNA sequences (45.7%) are similar. However, extending the calculation across the whole contig and the whole zebra finch gene it aligns to gives mean GC contents of 42.6% and 48.2% respectively. These figures suggest that either the great tit has an unusually low GC content or that, if it is assumed that the great tit transcriptome has a similar GC content to zebra finch and chicken, the set of great tit contigs may contain genomic as well as transcriptomic sequence-i.e., that some contigs contain intronic or non-transcribed (i.e., pre-mRNA) sequences.</p>

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The distribution of GO terms from the tissue-specific contigs into the three domains (biological process, molecular function and cellular component) is shown in Table 
    <a ref-type="table" rid="T4" href="#T4">4</a>. Note that in general the total number of GO terms is greater than the number of unique contigs, as many of the contigs map to zebra finch genes with more than one associated GO term. Of the 33,574 contigs aligning with zebra finch cDNA sequences, GO terms could be extracted for 20,847 (62%) of the contigs. There were 5,906 contigs with GO terms expressed in all tissues and 2,782 tissue-specific contigs with GO terms (Table 
    <a ref-type="table" rid="T4" href="#T4">4</a>). Many of the GO terms from tissue-specific contigs were found in more than one tissue (as many different genes may be associated with the same GO term). The tissue-unique GO terms (Table 
    <a ref-type="table" rid="T4" href="#T4">4</a>) are listed in Additional file 
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">1</a>, Table S2; a total of 114, 32, 58, 49, 44, 46, 67 and 117 GO terms were uniquely associated with contigs only expressed in brain, heart, kidney, liver, muscle, pancreas, skin and testes, respectively, while 1,654 GO terms were uniquely associated with contigs expressed in all tissues. A total of 84 tissue-unique GO terms were also highly tissue specific (τ &gt; 0.8) (Additional file 
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">1</a>, Table S2). Interestingly, it was heart and pancreas that had the highest number of highly tissue specific GO terms (21.4% and 28.5% respectively), and of the seven terms with τ &gt; 0.85, four were unique to heart (connexon complex, myosin filament assembly, A band and myosin heavy chain binding), two to pancreas (glucosamine 6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase activity and cholecystokinin receptor activity) and one to skin (proton-dependent oligopeptide secondary active transmembrane transporter activity). The tissue specificity of these GO terms generally appears biologically consistent, although it is interesting to note, for example, two "ovarian" GO terms associated with testes-ovarian cumulus expansion and ovulation cycle, and two "respiratory" GO terms associated with heart-bronchus morphogenesis and trachea formation (Additional file 
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">1</a>, Table S2). Such tissue overlap may reflect (incorrect) alignment of a contig to a protein which shares a conserved domain but has a different function.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The three GO domains (biological process; GO:0008150, molecular function; GO:0003674 and cellular component; GO:0005575) have 65 immediate child terms (35 with parent 'biological process', 17 with parent 'molecular function' and 13 with parent 'cellular component'). Of the sixty-five terms, 21 were not represented in any of the 'is_a' mappings, two were associated with only one tissue (GO:0016247-channel regulator activity, associated only with brain, and GO:0005198-structural molecule activity, associated only with muscle), and the remaining 42 were all parents of unique GO terms expressed in all tissues (Additional file 
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">1</a>, Table S3). For combined 'is_a' and 'part_of' relationships, the same two GO terms were uniquely associated with brain and muscle, but only 14 were not represented in any of the "is_a" or "part_of" mappings, namely carbohydrate, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sugar, and sulfur utilization (domain: biological process), chemoattractant, chemorepellent, electron carrier and nutrient reservoir activity and protein tag (domain: molecular function) and symplast, virion and virion part (domain: cellular component). The remaining 49 terms were expressed in all tissues (Additional file 
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">1</a>, Table S3)-i.e., seven GO terms mapped through only 'part_of' and not 'is_a' mappings-cell killing, cell wall organization or biogenesis, reproduction and viral reproduction (domain: biological process) and cell, extracellular region and extracellular region part (domain: cellular component) (Additional file 
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">1</a>, Table S3). These results indicate that although there is evidence for highly tissue specific expression of 2,448 contigs (Table 
    <a ref-type="table" rid="T2" href="#T2">2</a>), the GO annotations find only a few tissue-specific functions for these contigs (as classified by unique GO terms).

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We further investigated the 59,955 contigs that mapped to the zebra finch genome but did not match anything in the zebra finch cDNA database. Approximately two thirds of contigs mapped either up or downstream of a gene (classes A and B, Table 
    <a ref-type="table" rid="T5" href="#T5">5a</a>, see Methods and Table 
    <a ref-type="table" rid="T5" href="#T5">5</a> for a full description of classes A-F). Of the remainder, the vast majority (20,647) were class F, whereby the contig mapped entirely within the boundaries of the genome location of a known gene, although 49 contigs extended across the entire gene sequence (class E). There are similar numbers of contigs in classes A (gene upstream) and B (gene downstream), and approximately 30% of these contigs align to locations within 2,500 bases of a mapped gene (Table 
    <a ref-type="table" rid="T5" href="#T5">5a</a>). The distribution of the distance of class A and B contigs from their nearest gene differed significantly from the random distribution generated from 1,000,000 simulated contigs (p &lt;&lt; 0.0001, test statistic = 0.31, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, contigs mapping within genes excluded). In other words, Class A and Class B contigs are closer to genes than expected from the sequencing of random genomic DNA, implying that the majority of these "non-gene" contigs are either gene sequences or closely associated with gene sequences (for example involved in gene transcription or regulation) rather than erroneously amplified genomic sequence.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A small number of Class A and B contigs aligned with non-coding RNA sequences. Of the 700 non coding RNA sequences described in the zebra finch genome, including micro, ribosomal, small nucleolar and small nuclear RNA, 45 contigs aligned to 27 unique non-coding RNA sequences. Twenty two of the non-coding RNA contigs mapped within 2,000 bases of a gene, suggesting that these non-coding RNAs may be involved in modulating the expression of the nearby gene. Only ten of the 27 non-coding RNAs have an associated gene name and description, six of which are small nucleolar RNAs. However, it is likely that there are many more than 700 non-coding RNA sequences in the zebra finch (and, indeed, great tit) genomes; 4,431 have been described in zebrafish (

    <a ref-type="table" rid="T5" href="#T5">5b</a>). All genes enclosed by class E contigs contain a single exon and tend to be small (range 64-202 bases, mean 94 bases, Table 
    <a ref-type="table" rid="T5" href="#T5">5c</a>). In class F, the vast majority (20,290) of contigs aligned within a single intron (see 'one gene feature' in Table 
    <a ref-type="table" rid="T5" href="#T5">5d</a>). Two hundred and sixty contigs aligned across more than one gene feature, with 57% of alignments beginning in an intron, and 58% of alignments ending in an intron (see 'more than one gene feature' in Table 
    <a ref-type="table" rid="T5" href="#T5">5d</a>). Thus, the overwhelming majority of class F contigs align with intronic regions of a zebra finch gene, providing very strong support that these contigs represent pre-mRNA (i.e., the RNA transcript has not been spliced to form mRNA). The mean number of reads per contig for the 20,566 class C, D, E and F contigs which align to intronic regions was 14; this differed significantly (

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of the 1,913 contigs which did not align with any zebra finch or chicken genome, cDNA or protein sequences, 80 aligned to RefSeq RNA sequences. Of these, 17 aligned to vertebrate_birds, suggesting they are likely to represent true great tit sequences. Of the remaining 63 contigs that did not align to vertebrate_birds, 22 aligned to another vertebrate group (vertebrate_fish, vertebrate_amphibians, vertebrate_mammalian or vertebrate_reptiles), suggesting that these contigs represent great tit genes without an annotated vertebrate_bird homologue in the RefSeq RNA database. A further 26 contigs aligned with species from two or more kingdoms, and alignments were typically short (&lt; 100 bases) or did not span more than 20% of the contig sequence. Of the remaining 15 contigs which aligned with species from a single kingdom, one aligned with bacterial species, and 14 with plant species. The 'bacterial' contig aligned with 57 different bacterial genera. The remaining 14 contigs aligned with 
    <span class="italic">Populus trichocarpa </span>(twelve contigs), or both 
    <span class="italic">P. trichocarpa </span>and 
    <span class="italic">Sorghum bicolor </span>(two contigs) sequences, and appear most likely to represent non-great tit sequences. The two 
    <span class="italic">S. bicolor </span>alignments and two of the 
    <span class="italic">P. trichocarpa </span>alignments were shorter than 80 bases and covered less than 12% of the contig, suggesting the alignments are unlikely to represent 
    <span class="italic">Populus </span>or 
    <span class="italic">Sorghum </span>but may be plant contamination of some kind. Note that while 
    <span class="italic">P. trichocarpa </span>and 
    <span class="italic">S. bicolor </span>are model species with full genome (and transcriptome) sequences, sequences from trees common in the ecology of the great tit (oak, ash, beech, hazel, sycamore) are not well represented in the RefSeq RNA database. Eleven of the remaining twelve contigs were assembled from skin reads, and the other from a combination of skin and testes reads. The remaining alignments with 
    <span class="italic">P. trichocarpa </span>were of reasonable length (109-438 bases) and identity (84-94%), suggesting there may be sequences from a plant species related to 
    <span class="italic">P. trichocarpa </span>in the great tit assembly (oak, beech and hazel are more closely related to 
    <span class="italic">P. trichocarpa </span>than ash or sycamore).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alignments with 'environmental' sequences (i.e., sequences from species important in the ecology of the great tit, see Methods) provide some evidence to suggest that the great tit assembly includes sequences from flea and tick (ectoparasites that commonly inhabit bird nests). Forty-six contigs aligned with ribosomal RNA sequences from 
    <span class="italic">Ixodes ricinus</span>. Twenty-eight contigs aligned with ribosomal RNA sequences from 
    <span class="italic">Ceratophyllus ciliatus </span>(a grey squirrel flea), with some but not all of these contigs also aligning with sequences from the hen flea

    <span class="italic">Ceratophyllus ciliatus </span>and to

    <span class="italic">C</span>. 
    <span class="italic">ciliatus </span>were expressed in two or more tissues. Similarly all ten of the most significant contig alignments with 
    <span class="italic">I</span>. 
    <span class="italic">ricinus </span>were expressed in two or more tissues. Of the 1,091,610 singletons not assembled into contig sequences, 3,656 aligned with 60 'environmental' sequences. Alignments with flea (
    <span class="italic">Ceratophyllus </span>spp) and tick (
    <span class="italic">Ixodes ricinus</span>) sequences were the most prevalent (1,524 and 829 alignments), in addition there were 700 alignments with badger (
    <span class="italic">Meles meles</span>)-hair from which is frequently incorporated into nests-and 364 with beech (
    <span class="italic">Fagus sylvatica</span>). Thus, there is limited evidence that small amounts of RNA from other species have been included in the great tit sequences. There was little evidence to suggest that the great tit assembly includes sequences from any common endoparasites, nor from the great tit's common food source the winter moth (
    <span class="italic">Opheroptera brumata</span>).

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of an initial 1,038,094 SNPs identified by SeqMan NGen, 23,831 'high' and 35,579 'modest' quality SNPs were detected in 13,026 and 16,187 contigs respectively. The majority of the loss of SNPs was due to exclusion of SNPs with a minor allele count of less than three (~930,000 SNPs). Of the filtered SNPs, 22,427 (94%) high and 33,185 (93%) modest quality SNPs were confirmed by re-assembling pooled and trimmed sequences onto the consensus great tit assembly sequences. Although 35% of all great tit contigs align with zebra finch cDNA (Table 
    <a ref-type="table" rid="T3" href="#T3">3</a>, Figure 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1</a>), 46% of contigs containing high quality SNPs and 49% of contigs containing modest quality SNPs aligned with zebra finch cDNA. The reading frame of 4,822 high and 8,194 modest quality SNPs could be inferred from regions of alignment between zebra finch genes and the SNP-containing contig. Of these, 1,503 (31%) of high and 3,541 (43%) of modest quality SNPs caused non-synonymous substitutions while the remainder were not predicted to cause a change in the amino acid sequence (i.e., are synonymous substitutions). Both the number of SNPs and the number of microsatellites mapping to zebra finch chromosomes were highly correlated with the total length of these chromosomes (
    <span class="italic">r </span>&gt; 0.98), and the overall distribution of microsatellites and SNPs is reasonably uniform across the genome (data not shown).

Of these, 195 contained only one SNP string. All but 13 of these contigs aligned with the zebra finch genome, and 187 aligned to a mapped gene. Contigs containing SNP strings were expressed in more tissues than contigs without SNP strings (difference of 3.07 tissues, 
    <span class="italic">t </span>= 64.14, 
    <span class="italic">p </span>&lt;&lt; 0.0001, two sided 
    <span class="italic">t </span>test with unequal variance) and were also less tissue specific (that is, were not predominantly expressed in only one tissue) than contigs without SNP strings (τ difference of 0.29, 
    <span class="italic">t </span>= 20.62, 
    <span class="italic">p </span>&lt;&lt; 0.0001). This difference was smaller but still significant once contig length and the number of reads mapping to the contig was taken into account (difference of 0.14 tissues, generalised linear model with Poisson distributed errors, 
    <span class="italic">z </span>= 13.34, 
    <span class="italic">p </span>&lt;&lt; 0.0001). Although two of the alternative splice contigs were expressed in only one tissue (one each in heart and liver), two hundred and sixty two (79%) of the 332 alternative splice contigs were expressed in all eight tissues. These results suggest that it is uncommon (&lt; 1%) for a single tissue to generate more than one splice variant, and that for those alternative splice contigs expressed in more than one tissue, different tissues may be generating different alternative splice variants.
