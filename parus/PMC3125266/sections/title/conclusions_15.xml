 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By describing and mining the transcriptome of a wild bird population we have facilitated future evolutionary genomics studies in this species. Genome-wide association studies, using SNPs in known genes, will pave the way for QTL discovery and insight into microevolutionary processes. Similarly, comparison of great tit coding regions with homologous regions in other sequenced bird species (e.g. great tit, zebra finch, turkey) will make it possible to identify genes with elevated rates of molecular evolution. By combining and integrating data from these two discrete types of analysis, it will be possible to investigate whether the same genes are relevant to micro and macro-evolutionary processes. In summary, next generation sequencing of the great tit transcriptome has paved the way to convert a classical ecological organism into one with a genetic toolkit.</p>
