  <span class="bold">Figure S1</span>. Distribution of zebra finch genes across the zebra finch genome. Counts are plotted within 500,000 base pair bins. No genes map to Tgu16 and one gene maps to TguLG5 (not shown). Note that Tgu-22, 25, 26 and 27 are presented out of numeric sequence at the bottom of the plot, to make visual comparison with Figures
