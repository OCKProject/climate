 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Potentially some contigs may be expressed in all eight tissues, and some in only one tissue. For each tissue assembly, we assessed how many sequences were assembled into each contig (i.e. by examining the read depth of the contig). Contigs which were absent from a tissue-specific assembly were regarded as not expressed in that tissue at the time of sampling. Contigs which are expressed in all tissues (i.e. each tissue contributes at least one sequence read to the contig) and contigs which were tissue specific (all reads come from a single tissue, with a minimum of four reads from that tissue) were identified. In addition, more formally for each contig a measure of tissue specificity (τ) was calculated. Values for τ range from 0 (transcripts equally expressed in all tissues) to 1 (transcript expression is highly tissue-specific, i.e. very high expression in one tissue). τ accounts for differences in the total number of reads in different tissues [
