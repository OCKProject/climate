   <span class="bold">Distribution of the predicted minimum distance between known genes and contigs randomly placed on the zebra finch genome (estimated from 1,000,000 simulated contigs), and the observed minimum distance between known genes and alignments with contigs in the great tit assembly (85,109 contigs)</span>. Note that ~8,000 contigs were excluded as they map to unassembled regions of the zebra finch genome (for example, Tgu 1_random)
