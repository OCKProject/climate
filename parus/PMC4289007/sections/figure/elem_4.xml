  <p>Density of breeding pairs of common kestrel and rough-legged buzzard in Stora Sjöfallet National Park 1970–1978 and 2001–2011. Density estimates include breeders only, i.e., nests where egg clutches were initiated. Both species are rodent specialists at this site, and short-term variation in breeding density is largely explained by numerical responses to small mammal fluctuations. Thus, the density of breeding pairs during rodent peaks is the most reliable population estimate. The rough-legged buzzard declined in Sweden in 1980–2000 (Kjellén and Roos
