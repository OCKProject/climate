  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The small herbivore/prey community is dominated by rodents, in particular bank vole (
   <span class="italic">Myodes glareolus</span>), gray-sided vole (
   <span class="italic">Myodes rufocanus</span>), field vole (
   <span class="italic">Microtus agrestis</span>), and Norwegian lemming (
   <span class="italic">Lemmus lemmus</span>). The bank vole is a southern species and field vole is omnipresent, while gray-sided vole and Norwegian lemming are northern species. Their dynamics have been described as generally cyclic with high-amplitude peaks every 3–5 years (Hansson and Henttonen 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">1985</a>; Angerbjörn et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">2001</a>). In the twentieth century, however, high-amplitude lemming peaks failed to appear in northern Sweden in 1941–1960 and 1982–2001 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>; Angerbjörn et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">2001</a>). Although an absence of conspicuous high-amplitude peaks does not exclude the possibility that cycles persist, but with inconspicuous low-amplitude peaks, analyses of the dynamics of rodent-dependent predators in 1960–2008 suggest that regular cycles were absent for some time in the 1980s and 1990s in both alpine and boreal rodent communities (Elmhagen et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">2011</a>). Small mammal trapping data show that cycle amplitude and period declined in boreal voles in 1971–2002, while a pattern with seasonal fluctuations with low spring densities and high autumn densities strengthened (Hörnfeldt 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">2004</a>). High-amplitude cycles reappeared in 2001, with the exception for gray-sided voles in boreal forests that remained at low population density (Ecke et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2010</a>; Elmhagen et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">2011</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since the 1970s, cycle amplitude and spring densities in particular have declined in the majority of the studied populations in Europe. The proximate mechanisms causing cycles to fade may vary within Europe as bioclimatic conditions differ. However, climate change is likely to be involved, as cycle amplitude is connected to winter conditions (Cornulier et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">2013</a>). Substantial snow cover and specific snow characteristics appear to be a prerequisite for high-amplitude peaks in Fennoscandia (Hansson and Henttonen 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">1985</a>; Kausrud et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2008</a>). High-quality snow provides a subnivean space where small rodents can feed and be relatively protected from predators, allowing winter reproduction in lemmings, release from predator control, and rapid population growth (Kausrud et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2008</a>; Ims et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">2011</a>). In the Swedish boreal forest, however, the gray-sided vole also suffers from fragmentation of mature forest (Ecke et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2010</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Medium-sized herbivores/prey</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The medium-sized herbivore/prey community is dominated by mountain hare (
   <span class="italic">Lepus timidus</span>) and grouse (capercaillie 
   <span class="italic">Tetrao urogallus</span>, black grouse 
   <span class="italic">Lyrurus tetrix</span>, hazel grouse 
   <span class="italic">Tetrastes bonasia</span>, willow ptarmigan 
   <span class="italic">Lagopus lagopus</span>, and rock ptarmigan 
   <span class="italic">Lagopus muta</span>). Although grouse also feed on insects, they are primarily herbivorous. Northern grouse and hare populations generally fluctuate or cycle (Angelstam et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">1985</a>). In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the period of these fluctuations appeared to largely reflect the small rodent cycle, although mountain hare also showed a tendency for longer periods of approximately 10 years (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). However, peak abundances seemed to decline in the 1900s in grouse, and after 1930 in hare, possibly with some recovery after 1960. Alternatively, the dynamics may have stabilized temporarily in 1930–1960 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>; Sweden’s Official Statistics 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">1870–1966</a>). Similarly, other sources suggest that rock ptarmigan has declined since the nineteenth century, while capercaillie and black grouse began declining in the 1930s to recover somewhat in the 1960s (Svensson et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">1999</a>). Both ptarmigan species declined in alpine habitat in the last decade (Lehikoinen et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">2014</a>). The medium-sized herbivore/prey community also includes some migratory geese. The lesser white-fronted goose (
   <span class="italic">Anser erythropus</span>) began declining in alpine Sweden in the 1930s, locally to extinction (Svensson et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">1999</a>). In at least one site, extirpation occurred within a few years in the 1940s (Ryd 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">2007</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Early reports attribute low abundance of hare and grouse to unfavorable weather and disease, but increased fox predation is mentioned twice in the 1920s (Sweden’s Official Statistics 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">1870–1966</a>). At present, the dominant hypothesis suggests that 3–5-year cycles in medium-size herbivores are caused by medium-sized predators, which switch from rodent prey to medium-sized prey in the decrease phase of the rodent cycle (Angelstam et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">1985</a>; Kausrud et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2008</a>). The tendency for 10-year fluctuations in mountain hare might be caused by interactions with larger predators, similar to present-day mountain hare populations in Russian Karelia which fluctuate with an approximate 11-year period tracked by the Eurasian lynx (
   <span class="italic">Lynx lynx</span>; Danilov 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2010</a>). In Sweden, strong suppression of medium-sized herbivores by red fox predation is supported by a temporary increase in hare and boreal grouse in the 1980s when a mange epizootic reduced the fox population (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>; Danell and Hörnfeldt 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">1987</a>; Lindström et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">1994</a>). Red fox expansion in alpine Sweden is one potential cause of decline in white-fronted goose (Svensson et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">1999</a>). In Finland, boreal grouse is negatively affected by forestry, climate change, and fox predation (Ludwig 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">2007</a>). In southern Sweden, the mountain hare has declined due to interference with introduced brown hares (
   <span class="italic">Lepus europaeus</span>). Since 1980, the brown hare has advanced north into boreal Sweden, likely in response to mild winters (Fig.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2006</a>). Moose declined due to hunting in the early 1800s. By 1830, only a small population remained in south-central Sweden (Liberg et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">2010</a>). Following protection, moose gradually colonized (recolonized) northern Sweden in 1870–1910 and is now found in all but high alpine areas (Sweden’s Official Statistics

   <span class="italic">Meles meles</span>), red fox, and pine marten (
   <span class="italic">Martes martes</span>). They have all increased or advanced since the nineteenth century. Pine marten was probably absent for some time between the seventeenth and nineteenth century, but increased in the late nineteenth century and in 1930–1960 (Helldin 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2000</a>). The badger had its northern distribution limit in southern boreal Sweden in 1850–1900, but advanced north to the Arctic Circle during the 1900s (Figs.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">1995</a>). The red fox was repeatedly described as increasing in northern Sweden in 1892–1895, 1914–1920, and 1937–1945. In 1945, it was specifically pointed out that it was spreading to new areas (Sweden’s Official Statistics 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">1870–1966</a>). The red fox also increased in Norway in 1891–1920, with further increases in 1930–1950 (Selås and Vik 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">2007</a>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A large number of birds of prey, as well as the omnivorous gulls, are predators on small rodents (Krebs 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">2011</a>). The common gull (
   <span class="italic">Larus canus</span>) and black-headed gull (
   <span class="italic">Chroicocephalus ridibundus</span>) expanded in inland northern Sweden in 1930–1950. The common gull also established in the alpine tundra in the 1960s (Svensson et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">1999</a>). The Eurasian kestrel (
   <span class="italic">Falco tinnunculus</span>) was a rare breeder in at least some mountain regions during the 1970s, but is now at least locally abundant in birch forest and alpine tundra (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). In boreal and alpine Sweden, rodent specialists such as northern harrier (
   <span class="italic">Circus cyaneus</span>) and rough-legged buzzard (
   <span class="italic">Buteo lagopus</span>) declined in 1940–1960 and 1980–2000 (Kjellén and Roos 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">2000</a>). Likewise, boreal owl (
   <span class="italic">Aegolius funereus</span>), short-eared owl (

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2005</a>). The snowy owl (
   <span class="italic">Bubo scandiaca</span>) breeds only in alpine tundra. It was probably more common in the southern alpine tundra in the nineteenth century and did not breed at all in Sweden in 1982–2001 (Svensson et al.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">2009</a>). The only northern mammalian predator, the arctic fox, was abundant in the alpine tundra until the population plummeted in the early 1900s. Excessive hunting was suggested to cause the decline (Lönnberg 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">1927</a>), but the arctic fox did not recover despite protection in 1928. The population declined further in 1982–2001 (Angerbjörn et al.

Both species are rodent specialists at this site, and short-term variation in breeding density is largely explained by numerical responses to small mammal fluctuations. Thus, the density of breeding pairs during rodent peaks is the most reliable population estimate. The rough-legged buzzard declined in Sweden in 1980–2000 (Kjellén and Roos

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are several suggested drivers of change in the southern species. Pine marten appears sensitive to harvest and the increase in 1930–1960 has been attributed to protection, while the species may have been suppressed by forestry and red fox interactions in the late twentieth century (Helldin 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2000</a>). Badger expansion has been suggested to be associated with climate warming, land use promoting young forest stages, reduced hunting pressure, and wolf (
   <span class="italic">Canis lupus</span>) extirpation (Bevanger and Lindström 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">1995</a>). The red fox is favored by climate warming, young forest stages, agricultural land, and anthropogenic infrastructure which provides food sources such as garbage and road kills (Hersteinsson and Macdonald 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">1992</a>; Kurki et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">1998</a>; Selås and Vik 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">2006</a>; Selås et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">2010</a>). In alpine tundra, the red fox is locally favored by changed reindeer herding practices, where reindeer are kept in the tundra throughout winter which increases the abundance of reindeer carcasses (Killengreen et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2011</a>). In southern Sweden, red fox increased in the nineteenth century following large carnivore extirpation, but this effect appeared weak in northern Sweden, potentially due to strong effects of resource limitation (Elmhagen and Rushton 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">2007</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Declines in specialist rodent predators in northern Sweden in 1982–2001 are linked to poor reproduction due to disrupted rodent dynamics (Angerbjörn et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">1995</a>; Svensson et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">1999</a>; Kjellén and Roos

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">2009</a>). In addition, increased competition with the red fox likely contributed to the decline of the arctic fox in the early 1900s and prevented its recovery (Hersteinsson and Macdonald 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">1992</a>). The arctic fox has retreated to high-altitude habitats where red fox interactions are least likely to occur (Herfindal et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2010</a>). Since 2000, the arctic fox has increased in two Swedish areas with intense conservation efforts, red fox culling, and supplemental feeding, while the number of arctic foxes has remained low in Scandinavian areas without intense actions (Angerbjörn et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">2013</a>). The positive effect of increased food availability relies on a relative absence of red foxes, as red foxes can monopolize productive habitats and food resources such as carcasses (Killengreen et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">2007</a>,

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">1870–1966</a>). The brown bear became restricted to small parts of boreal Sweden, but recovered and spread throughout northern Sweden in the twentieth century (Kindberg et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">2011</a>). Likewise, wolf became restricted to alpine tundra, where a few individuals remained until extirpation in the 1960s. Wolves recolonized southern Sweden in the 1980s (Wabakken et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">2001</a>), but the present distribution is restricted by policy to areas south of the reindeer herding area. The southern distribution limit of wolverine, the only northern species, retreated from the southern boreal zone to the alpine zone, where the majority of the population still is found (Flagstad et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2004</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among the large predators, lynx is the only southern species. In the nineteenth century, its northern distribution limit was located slightly south of the Arctic Circle (Sweden’s Official Statistics 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">1870–1900</a>). This limit was assumed to be determined by climate conditions rather than human influences (Lönnberg 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">1930</a>). Lynx established and increased in northernmost Sweden in the 1910s, but continued to decline in other parts of Sweden until protection in 1928 (Sweden’s Official Statistics 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">1870–1966</a>). It has been suggested that lynx was favored by the northern expansion of agriculture and roe deer, as well as large and relatively free-ranging herds of sheep and reindeer, allowing lynx to switch prey from medium-sized herbivores to small ungulates (Sunde et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">2000</a>). In Russian Karelia and Kola (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), the northern distribution limit of lynx is located in the boreal forest slightly north of the Arctic Circle. The more northern distribution in western Fennoscandia has been associated with higher abundance of hare and semi-domesticated reindeer (Danilov 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2010</a>). Hare abundance is relatively low in Karelia due to a larger proportion of old-growth forest (Lindén et al.
