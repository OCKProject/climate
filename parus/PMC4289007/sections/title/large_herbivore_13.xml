  <span class="italic">Alces alces</span>), and roe deer (
  <span class="italic">Capreolus capreolus</span>). All reindeer are semi-domesticated, and the population has fluctuated around 225 000 in the 1900s (Anonymous 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2006</a>). Moose declined due to hunting in the early 1800s. By 1830, only a small population remained in south-central Sweden (Liberg et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">2010</a>). Following protection, moose gradually colonized (recolonized) northern Sweden in 1870–1910 and is now found in all but high alpine areas (Sweden’s Official Statistics

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">2010</a>). In the eighteenth century, the northern distribution limit of roe deer was found in southern boreal Sweden, but the species declined due to hunting in the early 1800s and was extirpated in all but southernmost Sweden (Liberg et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">2010</a>). Roe deer recolonized temperate Sweden in the 1800s, but then continued to spread north in boreal Sweden in the 1900s. It is now found throughout Sweden, with the exception for alpine tundra and inland boreal forest north of the Arctic Circle (Figs.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moose were favored by hunting legislation, including different forms of hunting restrictions, large carnivore extirpation, and clear-cutting practices within forestry. These factors also favored roe deer, alongside winter-feeding, milder winters, and the temporary decrease in fox predation during the epizootic in the 1980s (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>; Liberg et al.
