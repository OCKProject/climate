  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Changes in distributions and population trends in southern and northern bird species since the nineteenth century</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Range shifts or long-term population trends had been reported for 68 of the 118 species (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Range contraction was significantly more frequent in northern than southern species (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>; 15 and 0 %, respectively; 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.0014, 
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 118). In contrast, range expansion were significantly less frequent in northern than southern species (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>; 3 and 33 %, respectively; 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001, 
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 118). Overall, range contraction or decline was reported for 48 % of the northern species and 20 % of the southern species (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>; 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.0030, 
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 118), while range expansion or increase was reported for 3 % of the northern species and 40 % of the southern species (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>; 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001, 
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 118). Land use was suggested as a driver of change for 45 of the 68 species which either changed their distribution limit or increased/declined in abundance (66 %), while climate sensitivity was mentioned for three species (4 %; Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Range expansions, primarily northern or north-western advance in southern species, were often suggested to be linked to historic expansions of agriculture, built-up areas, and forestry. Range contractions and declines were also often linked to land-use change, in particular shifts between traditional and present-day forms of land use which decreased the amount of open and wet habitats due to less mowing and livestock grazing, as well as forestry and drainage. Northern species that declined due to land-use change were only affected in the southern part of their range (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>).

     <p>Long-term trends in northern (N) and southern (S) bird species breeding in alpine and boreal Sweden. Trends were assessed from Svensson et al. (
      <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">1999</a>) and are presented as the percentage of species which contracted or expanded their range. Alternatively, if no range shift was reported, the long-term trend was classified as declining, increasing, or ‘no long-term trend.’ The latter refers to species that showed stable dynamics, fluctuating dynamics without a directional long-term trend, locally different trends, or where there was no information available. For each species, drivers of change suggested by Svensson et al. (

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The small herbivore/prey community is dominated by rodents, in particular bank vole (

    <span class="italic">Myodes rufocanus</span>), field vole (
    <span class="italic">Microtus agrestis</span>), and Norwegian lemming (
    <span class="italic">Lemmus lemmus</span>). The bank vole is a southern species and field vole is omnipresent, while gray-sided vole and Norwegian lemming are northern species. Their dynamics have been described as generally cyclic with high-amplitude peaks every 3–5 years (Hansson and Henttonen 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">1985</a>; Angerbjörn et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">2001</a>). In the twentieth century, however, high-amplitude lemming peaks failed to appear in northern Sweden in 1941–1960 and 1982–2001 (Fig. 
    <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>; Angerbjörn et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">2001</a>). Although an absence of conspicuous high-amplitude peaks does not exclude the possibility that cycles persist, but with inconspicuous low-amplitude peaks, analyses of the dynamics of rodent-dependent predators in 1960–2008 suggest that regular cycles were absent for some time in the 1980s and 1990s in both alpine and boreal rodent communities (Elmhagen et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">2011</a>). Small mammal trapping data show that cycle amplitude and period declined in boreal voles in 1971–2002, while a pattern with seasonal fluctuations with low spring densities and high autumn densities strengthened (Hörnfeldt 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">2004</a>). High-amplitude cycles reappeared in 2001, with the exception for gray-sided voles in boreal forests that remained at low population density (Ecke et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2010</a>; Elmhagen et al.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since the 1970s, cycle amplitude and spring densities in particular have declined in the majority of the studied populations in Europe. The proximate mechanisms causing cycles to fade may vary within Europe as bioclimatic conditions differ. However, climate change is likely to be involved, as cycle amplitude is connected to winter conditions (Cornulier et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">2013</a>). Substantial snow cover and specific snow characteristics appear to be a prerequisite for high-amplitude peaks in Fennoscandia (Hansson and Henttonen 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">1985</a>; Kausrud et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2008</a>). High-quality snow provides a subnivean space where small rodents can feed and be relatively protected from predators, allowing winter reproduction in lemmings, release from predator control, and rapid population growth (Kausrud et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2008</a>; Ims et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">2011</a>). In the Swedish boreal forest, however, the gray-sided vole also suffers from fragmentation of mature forest (Ecke et al.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The medium-sized herbivore/prey community is dominated by mountain hare (
    <span class="italic">Lepus timidus</span>) and grouse (capercaillie 
    <span class="italic">Tetrao urogallus</span>, black grouse 
    <span class="italic">Lyrurus tetrix</span>, hazel grouse 
    <span class="italic">Tetrastes bonasia</span>, willow ptarmigan 
    <span class="italic">Lagopus lagopus</span>, and rock ptarmigan 
    <span class="italic">Lagopus muta</span>). Although grouse also feed on insects, they are primarily herbivorous. Northern grouse and hare populations generally fluctuate or cycle (Angelstam et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">1985</a>). In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the period of these fluctuations appeared to largely reflect the small rodent cycle, although mountain hare also showed a tendency for longer periods of approximately 10 years (Fig. 
    <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). However, peak abundances seemed to decline in the 1900s in grouse, and after 1930 in hare, possibly with some recovery after 1960. Alternatively, the dynamics may have stabilized temporarily in 1930–1960 (Fig. 
    <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>; Sweden’s Official Statistics 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">1870–1966</a>). Similarly, other sources suggest that rock ptarmigan has declined since the nineteenth century, while capercaillie and black grouse began declining in the 1930s to recover somewhat in the 1960s (Svensson et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">1999</a>). Both ptarmigan species declined in alpine habitat in the last decade (Lehikoinen et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">2014</a>). The medium-sized herbivore/prey community also includes some migratory geese. The lesser white-fronted goose (
    <span class="italic">Anser erythropus</span>) began declining in alpine Sweden in the 1930s, locally to extinction (Svensson et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">1999</a>). In at least one site, extirpation occurred within a few years in the 1940s (Ryd 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">2007</a>).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Early reports attribute low abundance of hare and grouse to unfavorable weather and disease, but increased fox predation is mentioned twice in the 1920s (Sweden’s Official Statistics 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">1870–1966</a>). At present, the dominant hypothesis suggests that 3–5-year cycles in medium-size herbivores are caused by medium-sized predators, which switch from rodent prey to medium-sized prey in the decrease phase of the rodent cycle (Angelstam et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">1985</a>; Kausrud et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2008</a>). The tendency for 10-year fluctuations in mountain hare might be caused by interactions with larger predators, similar to present-day mountain hare populations in Russian Karelia which fluctuate with an approximate 11-year period tracked by the Eurasian lynx (
    <span class="italic">Lynx lynx</span>; Danilov 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2010</a>). In Sweden, strong suppression of medium-sized herbivores by red fox predation is supported by a temporary increase in hare and boreal grouse in the 1980s when a mange epizootic reduced the fox population (Fig. 
    <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>; Danell and Hörnfeldt

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">1994</a>). Red fox expansion in alpine Sweden is one potential cause of decline in white-fronted goose (Svensson et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">1999</a>). In Finland, boreal grouse is negatively affected by forestry, climate change, and fox predation (Ludwig 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">2007</a>). In southern Sweden, the mountain hare has declined due to interference with introduced brown hares (
    <span class="italic">Lepus europaeus</span>). Since 1980, the brown hare has advanced north into boreal Sweden, likely in response to mild winters (Fig.

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2000</a>). The badger had its northern distribution limit in southern boreal Sweden in 1850–1900, but advanced north to the Arctic Circle during the 1900s (Figs.

    <span class="italic">Larus canus</span>) and black-headed gull (

    <span class="italic">Buteo lagopus</span>) declined in 1940–1960 and 1980–2000 (Kjellén and Roos 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">2000</a>). Likewise, boreal owl (

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2005</a>). The snowy owl (

Both species are rodent specialists at this site, and short-term variation in breeding density is largely explained by numerical responses to small mammal fluctuations.

   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are several suggested drivers of change in the southern species. Pine marten appears sensitive to harvest and the increase in 1930–1960 has been attributed to protection, while the species may have been suppressed by forestry and red fox interactions in the late twentieth century (Helldin 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2000</a>). Badger expansion has been suggested to be associated with climate warming, land use promoting young forest stages, reduced hunting pressure, and wolf (
    <span class="italic">Canis lupus</span>) extirpation (Bevanger and Lindström 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">1995</a>). The red fox is favored by climate warming, young forest stages, agricultural land, and anthropogenic infrastructure which provides food sources such as garbage and road kills (Hersteinsson and Macdonald 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">1992</a>; Kurki et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">1998</a>; Selås and Vik

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">2010</a>). In alpine tundra, the red fox is locally favored by changed reindeer herding practices, where reindeer are kept in the tundra throughout winter which increases the abundance of reindeer carcasses (Killengreen et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2011</a>). In southern Sweden, red fox increased in the nineteenth century following large carnivore extirpation, but this effect appeared weak in northern Sweden, potentially due to strong effects of resource limitation (Elmhagen and Rushton 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">2007</a>).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Declines in specialist rodent predators in northern Sweden in 1982–2001 are linked to poor reproduction due to disrupted rodent dynamics (Angerbjörn et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">1995</a>; Svensson et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">1999</a>; Kjellén and Roos

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">2009</a>). In addition, increased competition with the red fox likely contributed to the decline of the arctic fox in the early 1900s and prevented its recovery (Hersteinsson and Macdonald 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">1992</a>). The arctic fox has retreated to high-altitude habitats where red fox interactions are least likely to occur (Herfindal et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2010</a>). Since 2000, the arctic fox has increased in two Swedish areas with intense conservation efforts, red fox culling, and supplemental feeding, while the number of arctic foxes has remained low in Scandinavian areas without intense actions (Angerbjörn et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">2013</a>). The positive effect of increased food availability relies on a relative absence of red foxes, as red foxes can monopolize productive habitats and food resources such as carcasses (Killengreen et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">2007</a>,

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">1870–1966</a>). The brown bear became restricted to small parts of boreal Sweden, but recovered and spread throughout northern Sweden in the twentieth century (Kindberg et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">2011</a>). Likewise, wolf became restricted to alpine tundra, where a few individuals remained until extirpation in the 1960s. Wolves recolonized southern Sweden in the 1980s (Wabakken et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">2001</a>), but the present distribution is restricted by policy to areas south of the reindeer herding area. The southern distribution limit of wolverine, the only northern species, retreated from the southern boreal zone to the alpine zone, where the majority of the population still is found (Flagstad et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2004</a>).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among the large predators, lynx is the only southern species. In the nineteenth century, its northern distribution limit was located slightly south of the Arctic Circle (Sweden’s Official Statistics 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">1870–1900</a>). This limit was assumed to be determined by climate conditions rather than human influences (Lönnberg 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">1930</a>). Lynx established and increased in northernmost Sweden in the 1910s, but continued to decline in other parts of Sweden until protection in 1928 (Sweden’s Official Statistics 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">1870–1966</a>). It has been suggested that lynx was favored by the northern expansion of agriculture and roe deer, as well as large and relatively free-ranging herds of sheep and reindeer, allowing lynx to switch prey from medium-sized herbivores to small ungulates (Sunde et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">2000</a>). In Russian Karelia and Kola (Fig. 
    <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), the northern distribution limit of lynx is located in the boreal forest slightly north of the Arctic Circle. The more northern distribution in western Fennoscandia has been associated with higher abundance of hare and semi-domesticated reindeer (Danilov 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2010</a>). Hare abundance is relatively low in Karelia due to a larger proportion of old-growth forest (Lindén et al.
