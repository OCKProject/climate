 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The global mean temperature has increased by 0.89 °C since 1901 (IPCC 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2013</a>). The Arctic experienced an above-average rate of warming during this period, and observed ecosystem change includes a prolonged growing season, changes in species phenology, northern advancement of southern species, and retreat of Arctic species (Post et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">2009</a>). These changes could be expected as a warmer climate should increase primary productivity in temperature-limited ecosystems. This could constrain species adapted to present temperature and resource conditions, while it could allow species limited by those conditions to increase in abundance and expand their distribution. In addition to such bottom-up effects, Callaghan et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2004</a>) suggested that Arctic species are adapted to cope with physically harsh conditions at the expense of competitive ability, which would make them prone to decline in response to interactions with invading boreal species. For example, Hersteinsson and Macdonald (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">1992</a>) suggested that an Arctic specialist, the arctic fox (
  <span class="italic">Vulpes lagopus</span>), should retreat in response to climate warming as its southern distribution limit should be determined by competition, while the northern distribution limit of its larger competitor, the red fox (
  <span class="italic">Vulpes vulpes</span>), should be determined by harsh climate conditions and low resource availability.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although climate change is projected to become the primary driver of biodiversity change in Arctic and boreal ecosystems in the next century, land-use change is projected to be almost as important in the boreal biome (Sala et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">2000</a>). This suggests that both drivers must be taken into account to understand change in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. The Scandinavian mountain range runs south from the Arctic tundra, providing tundra conditions at high altitudes, but a high level of fragmentation by forested valleys creates a substantial interface between alpine tundra and boreal forest (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). The mean temperature in Scandinavia has increased significantly since 1901, by 0.75–1.5 °C (IPCC 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2013</a>), with particularly warm periods in 1930–1950 and after 1980 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). However, human land use also intensified, in particular in boreal Sweden. The indigenous Sami developed an economy based on hunter/gathering, fur trade, and small-scale reindeer (
  <span class="italic">Rangifer tarandus</span>) husbandry at least one millennium ago. Reindeer-keeping practices transitioned into large-scale nomadic reindeer pastoralism in the early seventeenth century, and to extensive reindeer herding for meat production in the late nineteenth century (Lundmark 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">2007</a>). In Sweden, the Sami economy was the primary land use in the north-west interior until the eighteenth century. At that time, the rate of agricultural expansion from the south and east coast increased, and agriculture reached the boreal–alpine interface in the nineteenth century (Anonymous 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2006</a>). Large-scale forestry based on selective logging of large trees developed in the mid-nineteenth century, followed by clear-cutting practices that have dominated forestry since the 1950s (Axelsson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">2001</a>). Hence, over the last 200 years, both climate and land use changed in northern Sweden.

We derived yearly status of hare and grouse from qualitative descriptions in Sweden’s Official Statistics (
     <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">1870–1966</a>) for Västerbotten county or the closest reported area (gaps = no information). Yearly lemming status in Västerbotten is taken from Angerbjörn et al. (
     <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">2001</a>), who assessed qualitative information from different regions in Scandinavia. The absence of high-abundance peaks in Västerbotten 1940–1960 was well supported, while absent peaks prior to 1900 could be related to information deficiency. However, peaks may have occurred in Västerbotten prior to 1900 as some peaks are known to have occurred in adjacent Nordland (NL)

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we review observed changes in the bird and mammal community in boreal and alpine Sweden since the nineteenth century, as well as suggested drivers of change. If climate warming has been an important driver of change, we expect southern species to have advanced their distribution and/or increased in abundance more often than northern species which rather should have retreated or declined. However, by also reviewing suggested drivers of change, we aim to explore whether additional drivers may have been important.</p>
