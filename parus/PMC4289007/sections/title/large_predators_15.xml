 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All large mammalian predators, brown bear (
  <span class="italic">Ursus arctos</span>), wolf, Eurasian lynx, and wolverine (
  <span class="italic">Gulo gulo</span>), declined due to persecution in the nineteenth and early twentieth century (Sweden’s Official Statistics 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">1870–1966</a>). The brown bear became restricted to small parts of boreal Sweden, but recovered and spread throughout northern Sweden in the twentieth century (Kindberg et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">2011</a>). Likewise, wolf became restricted to alpine tundra, where a few individuals remained until extirpation in the 1960s. Wolves recolonized southern Sweden in the 1980s (Wabakken et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">2001</a>), but the present distribution is restricted by policy to areas south of the reindeer herding area. The southern distribution limit of wolverine, the only northern species, retreated from the southern boreal zone to the alpine zone, where the majority of the population still is found (Flagstad et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2004</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among the large predators, lynx is the only southern species. In the nineteenth century, its northern distribution limit was located slightly south of the Arctic Circle (Sweden’s Official Statistics 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">1870–1900</a>). This limit was assumed to be determined by climate conditions rather than human influences (Lönnberg 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">1930</a>). Lynx established and increased in northernmost Sweden in the 1910s, but continued to decline in other parts of Sweden until protection in 1928 (Sweden’s Official Statistics 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">1870–1966</a>). It has been suggested that lynx was favored by the northern expansion of agriculture and roe deer, as well as large and relatively free-ranging herds of sheep and reindeer, allowing lynx to switch prey from medium-sized herbivores to small ungulates (Sunde et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">2000</a>). In Russian Karelia and Kola (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), the northern distribution limit of lynx is located in the boreal forest slightly north of the Arctic Circle. The more northern distribution in western Fennoscandia has been associated with higher abundance of hare and semi-domesticated reindeer (Danilov 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2010</a>). Hare abundance is relatively low in Karelia due to a larger proportion of old-growth forest (Lindén et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">2000</a>).
