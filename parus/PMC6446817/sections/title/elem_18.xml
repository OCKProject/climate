  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the influence of resource availability on warning signals demonstrates, animal coloration is strongly influenced by factors that affect an individual's condition (Griffith, Parker &amp; Olson, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0131" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0131">2006</a>). Disease and parasite load both negatively influence condition and consequently can lead to trade‐offs between immune function and signal expression (McGraw &amp; Hill, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0234" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0234">2000</a>). For example, increased parasite load leads to generally duller coloration in fish and birds of both sexes (Martínez‐Padilla 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0226" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0226">2011</a>; Ciccotto, Dresser &amp; Mendelson, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0060">2014</a>). Currently it is uncertain how such factors may influence aposematic signals specifically, but based on the shared physiological basis of aposematic and non‐aposematic coloration (e.g. sexual signals), it is possible that a similar ‘condition‐dependent’ relationship may occur (Blount 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0019">2009</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How the melanic component of aposematic coloration will be influenced by parasites and disease is unlikely to be clear cut. In common with coloured parts of warning signals, the production of melanin has various associated costs which may lead to trade‐offs between the production of melanin for pigmentation and immune responses (Guindre‐Parker &amp; Love, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0138" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0138">2014</a>). Under such a scenario, a negative relationship between melanin pigmentation and disease or parasite load can occur (Cotter 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0068">2008</a>; Gangoso 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0118" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0118">2011</a>) and may result in polytypisms if these loads vary spatially. However the association between melanisation and resistance to pathogens is not straightforward; for example, in invertebrates, cuticle melanisation acts directly in the protection of individuals from pathogens (Dubovskiy 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0086" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0086">2013</a>). Melanic pigmentation is also highly heritable in both invertebrates and vertebrates (Roff &amp; Fairbairn, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0298" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0298">2013</a>; Roulin &amp; Ducrest, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0308" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0308">2013</a>). It has been suggested that in many species the association between melanic coloration and a suite of disease‐resistance characteristics is a consequence of linkage disequilibrium and/or pleiotropy (Roulin, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0307" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0307">2016</a>). The result is differential life‐history strategies between more‐ and less‐pigmented individuals of the same species, the associated fitness of which is environmentally dependent (Emaresi 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0093" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0093">2014</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The preference of parasites, particularly ovipositing parasites such as parasitic wasps, for specific colour morphs and for within‐morph conspicuousness (or traits correlated with within‐morph conspicuousness) may act as alternative selection pressures on warning coloration. Parasites may prefer one colour morph over another, as is the case for the aphid parasitoid wasp 
   <span class="italic">Aphidius ervi</span> which preferentially lays eggs in pea aphids, 
   <span class="italic">Acyrthosiphon pisum</span>, of a colour morph not favoured by predators (Losey 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0205" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0205">1997</a>). As discussed previously, coloration in aposematic species may be quantitatively linked to chemical defence (Summers 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0369" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0369">2015</a>), levels of which have been linked to decreased (Weldon 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0413" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0413">2006</a>) and increased (Zvereva &amp; Kozlov, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0427" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0427">2016</a>) parasitism risk, the latter being especially prevalent for specialist parasites (Al Abassi 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0002">2001</a>). Chemical defences have even been hypothesised to arise as a mechanism of preventing parasitism, with subsequent predator avoidance a secondary benefit (Weldon 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0413" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0413">2006</a>). This relationship between colour and defence may be further complicated by the fact that some chemical defences can also have antimicrobial properties (Mina 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0245" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0245">2015</a>). It is therefore conceivable that in areas with high risk of parasitism, colour morphs or levels of conspicuousness less attractive to parasitoids may be selected for, either through the parasites' direct response to colour or their response to levels of the strongly associated chemical defence. This may be especially important if infection dramatically reduces host survival (e.g. 
   <span class="italic">Dinocampus coccinellae</span>; Maure 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0228" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0228">2014</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, disease has the potential to cause continuous variation in the chromatic and achromatic parts of an aposematic signal due to current infection, plastic changes at the individual level where infection stimulates increase in melanisation, and local adaptation 
   <span class="italic">via</span> correlated trait responses if coloration is linked to factors such as immunocompetence and if the level of infection risk varies spatially. Pathogens may also cause local extinctions, or repeated bottlenecks, which can disrupt purifying selection and maintain colour variation (Gordon, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0125" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0125">2013</a>; Idris &amp; Hassan, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0161" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0161">2013</a>). Meanwhile, parasitism is likely to influence both morph abundance and within‐morph conspicuousness in populations of aposematic species. These areas are ripe for exploration, and have huge potential for contributing to the understanding of diversity in aposematic coloration and the life‐history trade‐offs involved in its determination.

   <span class="italic">Interspecific interactions</span>
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although predator–prey relationships dominate the study of interspecies interactions, other forms can and do occur. One such example is reproductive interference, i.e. sexual interactions between members of different species (Gröning &amp; Hochkirch, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0133" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0133">2008</a>; Burdfield‐Steel &amp; Shuker, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0047">2011</a>). Since this is, by definition, costly, mate discrimination and avoidance of reproductive interference could constrain warning signals, particularly in cases of mimicry, where effective mimicry could have consequences for mate discrimination (Estrada &amp; Jiggins, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0099" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0099">2008</a>; but see Llaurens, Joron &amp; Théry, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0203" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0203">2014</a>). Thus, the purifying selection on colour and pattern imposed by predators could be counteracted by the costs of sexual or territorial harassment by heterospecifics. While this phenomenon has not been investigated in aposematic species, such harassment has been suggested to play an important role in the maintenance of female colour polymorphisms in odonates (Fincke, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0108" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0108">2004</a>, and references therein). Because avoidance of conspecific harassment has been shown to influence female colour in Batesian mimics (Cook 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0064">1994</a>) this phenomenon may be worthy of further research.

    <span class="italic">Mate choice and parental effects</span>
   </div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mate choice can act either to reinforce or to disrupt the selection imposed on warning coloration by predators. The interaction between warning signals and sexual selection can occur when aposematic traits play a function in mate choice and recognition, or when there is a trade‐off between traits used in mate acquisition and those involved in predator defence. As anti‐predator defence is a key survival trait, we would expect that natural and sexual selection would work in tandem, with better protected individuals also gaining advantages during mating and reproduction, thus enforcing purifying selection on warning coloration. However, when this is not the case sexual selection may act to counter the effect of selection imposed by predators, allowing for polymorphism and other forms of warning‐signal variation to arise (e.g. Cummings &amp; Crothers, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0072">2013</a>).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sexual selection could also lead to sex‐specific differences in warning coloration. For example, increased brightness in male poison frogs could be the result of female preference for brighter males (Maan &amp; Cummings, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0207" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0207">2009</a>; but see Meuche 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0242" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0242">2013</a>). Whether such selection would lead to true polymorphism in the eyes of predators depends on the strength of the respective pressures, as well as the sensitivity of the signalling system itself to evolutionary inputs. In the case of poison frogs, the colour cues selected for by females (i.e. brightness) may be different from those selected by predators (i.e. hue). Indeed there is evidence that 
    <span class="italic">Heliconiu</span>s and 
    <span class="italic">Melinaea</span> co‐mimics show increased interspecies variation in colour combinations that are less visible to their avian predators, allowing for ‘cryptic’ signalling of species identity (Llaurens 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0203" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0203">2014</a>) and similar patterns may exist for within‐species signalling. Alternatively, if the visual conspicuousness of both sexes is already very high, any increases as a result of sexual selection may have no effect on predator learning (Maan &amp; Cummings, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0207" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0207">2009</a>; Crothers &amp; Cummings, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0069">2013</a>). Variation in the strength of female preferences among populations (e.g. Maan &amp; Cummings, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0207" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0207">2009</a>) may create divergent evolutionary trajectories in different populations, causing polytypisms to arise, whilst assortative mating or local morph preference can enable their persistence and even lead to the exaggeration of morph differences. In such cases, warning signals may constitute so‐called ‘magic’ traits, as they are both subject to ecological pressures from predators and contribute to non‐random mating, as is the case for many 
    <span class="italic">Heliconius</span> species (Merrill, Chia &amp; Nadeau, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0239" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0239">2014</a>). Assortative mating by morph may also occur if individuals in a population have different anti‐predator strategies. For example, associating with a conspicuous individual may increase your own risk of attack if you are cryptic (Segami Marzal 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0332" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0332">2017</a>).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to assortative mating, disassortative mating, where individuals prefer to mate with colour morphs different from themselves, can also occur. For example, in the polymorphic 
    <span class="italic">Heliconius numata</span> females show a strong aversion to mating with males of their own morph, preferring instead males of a different morph to themselves. Thus, while males of rare morphs may suffer increased predation risk, they will also have a higher mating success with females of the common morph (Chouteau 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0059">2017</a>). This may be the result of heterozygote advantage, which has been suggested as a possible mechanism for the maintenance of many polymorphisms (Hedrick, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0144" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0144">2012</a>).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, warning signals may not always be indicators of mate quality. Instead, there may be trade‐offs between traits related to predator defence and those that grant higher mating success. In addition, while selection on aposematic‐signal colour patterns is expected to be positively frequency dependent (see Section 
    <a rid="brv12460-sec-0002" ref-type="sec" href="#brv12460-sec-0002">II</a>), it could potentially be opposed if negative frequency‐dependent sexual selection also acts on the signals. Evidence for both phenomena has been found in the wood tiger moth. In this species white males have less‐effective warning signals (Nokelainen 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0264" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0264">2012</a>) than the yellow morph they coexist with, but gain higher mating success in white‐biased populations, despite showing no advantage over yellow males in offspring hatching success (Gordon 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0126" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0126">2015</a>). This could be due to differences in flying behaviour and mating effort (Rojas, Gordon &amp; Mappes, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0303" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0303">2015</a>). Thus, frequency‐dependent selection could allow yellow and white males to co‐exist, as whites compensate for their higher predation rate through increased mating success. Sexual selection may therefore allow for the maintenance of polymorphism within populations, in particular if it leads to, or is a consequence of, a trade‐off between anti‐predator defence and mating success/fecundity.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While we naturally expect mate choice to influence offspring aposematic phenotype 
    <span class="italic">via</span> genetic inheritance, transgenerational non‐genetic effects are also likely to play a role, especially in determining continuous within‐morph variation in warning coloration (Winters 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0422" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0422">2014</a>). It is increasingly clear that offspring phenotype is influenced non‐genetically 
    <span class="italic">via</span> maternal investment in response to a multitude of abiotic and biotic variables present in the offspring environment (Wolf &amp; Wade, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0423" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0423">2009</a>; Day &amp; Bonduriansky, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0081">2011</a>). Mothers can alter offspring phenotype in response to mate ‘quality’ (‘differential allocation’; Ratikainen &amp; Kokko, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0291" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0291">2010</a>) and reliable cues of the offspring environment (‘anticipatory maternal effects’; Marshall &amp; Uller, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0224" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0224">2007</a>). In terms of mate choice, as mentioned above, male warning coloration has been shown to be influential in female mate choice in aposematic species (Nokelainen 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0264" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0264">2012</a>; Mishra &amp; Omkar, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0246" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0246">2014</a>). Theoretical and empirical work suggest two likely responses, that females will either increase investment in response to the brightness or colour of male warning coloration (‘positive differential allocation’; Sheldon, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0334" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0334">2000</a>; Horváthová, Nakagawa &amp; Uller, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0157" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0157">2012</a>) or decrease it (‘negative differential allocation’; Saino 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0321" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0321">2002</a>; Bolund, Schielzeth &amp; Forstmeier, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0023">2009</a>). Recent work provides the first evidence that such a phenomenon may take place, with female 
    <span class="italic">Adalia bipunctata</span> laying brighter eggs when mated with brighter males (Paul 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0280" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0280">2018</a>). This is important as offspring aposematic phenotype in early life can persist into adulthood (Winters 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0422" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0422">2014</a>) and such differential allocation could therefore facilitate the perpetuation of variation in male warning coloration through subsequent generations. However, it is worth noting that work on differential allocation has also shown that a female's reproductive response to signals of male ‘quality’ varies with female age and phenotype (Sheppard 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0336" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0336">2013</a>). Combined with other effects linked to maternal phenotype, condition, or maternal response to the offspring environment, this differential maternal investment in response to male phenotype is likely to lead to a mosaic of continuous colour variation within and among populations of aposematic species.

    <span class="italic">Social signals and competition</span>
   </div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If warning signals can be used as signals during mate choice, and there is evidence that they can, they may also play a role in other forms of intraspecific interactions such as male–male competition, dominance and territorial disputes. While there are many studies that show the importance of visual signals in such interactions [see Shreeve, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0345" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0345">1987</a>, Setchell &amp; Wickings,

    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0204" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0204">2016</a> for examples], few have considered aposematic species. One example comes from work on male–male competition in the frog 
    <span class="italic">O. pumilio</span>; male brightness affected both their own behaviour and the behaviour of other males towards them. Brighter focal males were more likely to approach intruders to their territory, and brighter intruders elicited more calls and approaches than dull ones (Crothers, Gering &amp; Cummings, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0070">2011</a>). This suggests that continuous variation in male brightness may be a conditional signal in this species, and that male–male aggression may play a role in its maintenance within populations.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Intraspecific warning signals may also occur when conspecifics can benefit from signalling their presence to others, and by heeding such signals. This may arise when competition between conspecifics is particularly costly. Possible examples include larval coloration signalling the presence of existing larvae on potential host plants to ovipositing females in order to reduce larval cannibalism in the pipevine swallowtail butterfly 
    <span class="italic">Battus philenor</span> (Papaj &amp; Newsom, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0278" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0278">2005</a>) and bright colours in male damselflies signalling their presence to other males in order to reduce male–male mating attempts during scramble competition (Sherratt &amp; Forbes, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0342" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0342">2001</a>). While intriguing, honest communication of this sort seems unlikely to result in signal polymorphism, as it should also favour a single signal. If however, signals are dishonest, with signallers attempting to deceive the conspecific receivers, then there is the potential for red queen/chase away selection dynamics to unfold, similar to those that may occur during Batesian mimicry. Dishonest intrasexual signalling has been suggested as a potential reason for females displaying male‐like coloration, as this deceives mate‐searching males and reduces male harassment in butterflies (Cook 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As well as increased competition for resources, high conspecific density is linked to increased detectability by predators (Riipi 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0294" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0294">2001</a>). In aposematic species such aggregations actually augment signal strength and thus predator deterrence (Finkbeiner, Briscoe &amp; Reed, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0111" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0111">2012</a>; Rowland, Ruxton &amp; Skelhorn, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0314" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0314">2013</a>), changing the costs and benefits of large conspecific densities. This is reflected in the developmental ‘phase shift’ of the desert locust (
    <span class="italic">Schistocerca gregaria</span>). Coloration in these toxic locusts changes from a cryptic phenotype to an aposematic yellow and black when raised at high conspecific densities (Sword, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0373" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0373">1999</a>). This shift in anti‐predator strategy is a response to the increased likelihood of detection by predators when the cryptic locusts are in large aggregations. Predators learn to associate prey with toxicity more quickly when they are conspicuous rather than cryptic (Sword 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0374" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0374">2000</a>) and the detection costs of warning coloration are diminished by gregariousness (Gamberale &amp; Tullberg, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0117" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0117">1998</a>; Riipi

    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0294" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0294">2001</a>). Conspecifics can therefore influence not only within‐ but between‐morph variation in aposematic signalling.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although not an alternative selection pressure 
   <span class="italic">per se</span>, the conspicuousness of warning signals might also be expected to change over the lifetime of an individual, closely tracking major physiological changes resulting from processes such as reproduction and senescence (Booth, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0027">1990b</a>). For example, when warning coloration has a dual role as a predator deterrent and mate attractant, there might be an increase in signal strength during the mating season (Örnborg 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0272" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0272">2002</a>; Pérez‐Rodríguez, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0283" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0283">2008</a>). Reproduction is also costly and adult condition is often poorer post‐, relative to pre‐breeding (Stearns, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0363" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0363">1992</a>; Monaghan, Metcalfe &amp; Torres, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0250" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0250">2009</a>). Such a decrease in condition may potentially have consequences for the conspicuousness or ‘quality’ of an individual's aposematic signal, especially in longer‐lived species with multiple reproductive bouts (Velando, Drummond &amp; Torres, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0404" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0404">2010</a>). Senescence, on the other hand, is strongly linked to a general decline in phenotype (Rose, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0305" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0305">1991</a>), and the strength of aposematic signals may become less effective with age in the same way as other colour signals, for example the blue feet of male blue‐footed boobies 
   <span class="italic">Sula nebouxii</span> (Torres &amp; Velando, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0385" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0385">2007</a>), the yellow bibs of the common yellowthroat 
   <span class="italic">Geothlypis trichas</span> (Freeman‐Gallant 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0115" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0115">2011</a>), and the wings of the orange sulphur butterfly 
   <span class="italic">Colias eurytheme</span> (Kemp, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0175" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0175">2006</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effects of reproduction on coloration also vary according to an individual's age and sex, leading to a mosaic of colour expression within a population resulting from individual variation in sex, age class, and reproductive status (Evans, Gustafsson &amp; Sheldon, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0100" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0100">2011</a>; Grunst, Rotenberry &amp; Grunst, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0134" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0134">2014</a>). Furthermore, holometabolous insects such as Lepidoptera naturally show dramatic changes in form as well as coloration throughout their lifetime (Booth, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0027">1990b</a>), and more subtle changes in coloration are common in hemimetabolous insects, such as true bugs, between different nymphs and adult forms. Incorporate the aforementioned genetic correlations between warning signals at different life stages, or warning signals and other life‐history traits, and the picture becomes even more complex (Lindstedt 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0199" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0199">2016</a>). An explicit test of the effects of reproduction and senescence on warning coloration variation and efficiency, also taking into consideration possible genetic correlations, is therefore needed. This would then enable us to ascertain whether similar patterns occur in populations of aposematic species and therefore if variation in age class within a population contributes to individual variation in conspicuousness.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is clear therefore that there are myriad different selective pressures with the potential to influence the warning signals of aposematic species, some of which have already been empirically demonstrated to be important, and others worthy of further research. These sources of influence may act in ways that can be diametrically opposed to, or act synergistically with, predation pressure (Table 
   <a rid="brv12460-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" href="#brv12460-tbl-0001">1</a>). These ‘alternative’ selection pressures are most likely to produce and maintain warning signal diversity if they: (
   <span class="italic">i</span>) produce negative frequency‐dependent selection favouring rare morphs (for example those described in 
   <span class="italic">Heliconius</span> by Chouteau 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0059">2017</a>), or (
   <span class="italic">ii</span>) act in combination with heterogeneous selection imposed by predators (as described in Section 
   <a rid="brv12460-sec-0006" ref-type="sec" href="#brv12460-sec-0006">IV</a>) to produce different optimal phenotypes either within or among populations. In the latter case, the resulting selection landscape and associated phenotypic optima are also likely to vary over space and time, further slowing phenotypic convergence and allowing within‐population signal diversity to persist for longer. For example, temperatures will vary not only among habitats but also depending on climatic and seasonal timescales, and selection pressures associated with mate choice will vary in intensity throughout the year, especially in those species with distinct breeding seasons. It is vitally important that future work investigating the role of these selection pressures in producing warning‐signal variation incorporates their potential interaction, both with each other and with predators (e.g. temperature and either predator motivation or intraspecific aggression). It seems only rational to predict that such a movement away from the consideration of selection pressures on warning coloration in isolation is likely to result in a better understanding of the complex patterns of signal variation seen in nature.
