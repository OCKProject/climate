 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Population‐level differences in predation regimes may facilitate the maintenance of continuous variation between populations of warningly coloured species, as seen in the red coloration of newts on Japanese islands (Mochida, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0248" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0248">2011</a>), or polytypisms. Within populations, many studies demonstrate greater predation risks for rare and novel conspicuous forms relative to locally abundant ones (Lindström 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0200" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0200">2001</a>; Borer 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0028">2010</a>), particularly in poison frogs (e.g. Noonan &amp; Comeault, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0266" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0266">2009</a>) and 
  <span class="italic">Heliconius</span> butterflies (e.g. Mallet &amp; Barton, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0213" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0213">1989</a>; Chouteau 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0058">2016</a>). These local predation pressures can produce a purifying selective force, driving populations towards distinct local phenotypes (Joron &amp; Iwasa, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0168" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0168">2005</a>; Sherratt, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0339" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0339">2006</a>). In poison frogs, artificial predation experiments with models resembling distinct colour morphs of 
  <span class="italic">Ranitomeya imitator</span> demonstrate that predation risk for these morphs varies geographically, favouring polytypisms (Chouteau &amp; Angers, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0056">2011</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On a smaller scale, differences between predator communities across microhabitats within a single population may facilitate the maintenance of polymorphisms in aposematic species and even contribute to speciation, as has been suggested for ithomiine butterflies (Mallet &amp; Gilbert, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0215" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0215">1995</a>; Beccaloni, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0015">1997</a>; Elias 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0092" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0092">2008</a>). In a recent study in Ecuador, butterflies with particular wing patterns were found at different frequencies among distinct microhabitats in the canopy (Willmott 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0418" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0418">2017</a>). The community of avian predators likely to be encountered by these butterflies also covaried with these microhabitats, and artificial predation experiments suggested that predation risk experienced by specific wing patterns differed among microhabitats. Moreover, behavioural choices, such as temporal variation in activity or microhabitat selection, will enable aposematic prey to alter their conspicuousness and improve their chances of survival (Rojas, Devillechabrolle &amp; Endler, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0300" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0300">2014a</a>; Arenas &amp; Stevens, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0005">2017</a>), thus enabling multiple signal forms to coexist successfully.
