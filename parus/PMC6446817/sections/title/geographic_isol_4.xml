 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many of the well‐studied polymorphic/polytypic aposematic species occur in the Neotropics, and consequently early hypotheses explaining polymorphisms and polytypisms relied on the Pleistocene refugium theory (Turner, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0391" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0391">1965</a>; Brown, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0040">1979</a>). This theory states that high rates of allopatric speciation/subspeciation resulted from fragmentation of tropical forests during climate warming, and then when climate cooled, and forests became continuous, species became sympatric (for discussion see Merrill 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0240" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0240">2015</a>). The Pleistocene refugium theory has been invoked to explain the diversity of warning colours observed in poison frogs, neotropical Lepidoptera, and other tropical species, with refugia in Europe potentially playing a similar role for temperate species. However, this theory has recently been criticised and, in the case of 
  <span class="italic">Heliconius</span>, time‐calibrated phylogenies indicate that diversity was present before the Pleistocene (Nelson

  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0240" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0240">2015</a>). The current working hypothesis for how geographic or microhabitat variation has led to polymorphisms includes several stages. First, polytypisms arise through parapatric populations (populations with a narrow contact zone and low levels of gene flow) 
  <span class="italic">via</span> a variety of non‐climatic mechanisms, such as genetic drift or adaptation to the local abiotic environment (Mallet, Jiggins &amp; McMillan, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0216" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0216">1998</a>). Then, once populations are established, either gene flow continues or they eventually become sympatric, producing polymorphisms that may be transient (Mallet 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0216" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0216">1998</a>; Joron &amp; Iwasa, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0168" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0168">2005</a>). Polymorphisms/polytypisms can similarly arise due to earlier divergence of one clade, followed by subsequent mimicry by another clade (e.g. Symula, Schulte &amp; Summers, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0375" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0375">2001</a>,
