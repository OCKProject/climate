 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One clear example of a trait that is important for multiple aspects of an organism's fitness is melanisation. Melanin creates the black patterns seen in many of the classic aposematic signals across multiple taxa, from insects to mammals, as well as underlying the structural, iridescent, colours recently shown to act as aposematic signals in many bugs and beetles (Fabricant 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0107" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0107">2013</a>; Fabricant 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0105" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0105">2014</a>). The pigment also increases an organism's ability to absorb radiation (Clusella‐Trullas, van Wyk &amp; Spotila, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0061">2007</a>; Hetem 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0149" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0149">2009</a>) providing fitness benefits for individuals in cooler environments through improved thermoregulation (de Jong, Gussekloo &amp; Brakefield, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0166" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0166">1996</a>). However, while increased melanisation provides fitness benefits for aposematic species in some instances (Clusella‐Trullas 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0061">2007</a>; Lindstedt, Lindström &amp; Mappes, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0198" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0198">2009b</a>), it also has associated costs. Melanic pigmentation often forms a key part of aposematic coloration, yet recent evidence suggests the contrast between a signal and its background (dictated by the chromatic component of the signal) as opposed to internal contrast, is the more important determinant of aposematic signal detectability (Arenas, Troscianko &amp; Stevens, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0006">2014</a>). This may help to explain the much higher level of predation risk associated with melanism in aposematic species (Hegna 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0145" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0145">2013</a>; Arenas, Walter &amp; Stevens, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0007">2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The trade‐off between the positive/thermoregulatory benefits and negative/predation‐risk costs of melanisation are well explored in aposematic species in relation to temperature (e.g. 
  <span class="italic">Arctia plantaginis</span>; Hegna 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0145" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0145">2013</a>). Variation in temperature is known to contribute to within‐ morph plastic adjustment of the levels of melanism in warning signals, for example spot‐size in ladybirds (Michie 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0243" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0243">2010</a>, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0244" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0244">2011</a>), contributing to continuous variation in signal expression within and among populations. Seasonal fluctuations in temperature and changes in predation (see Section 
  <a rid="brv12460-sec-0006" ref-type="sec" href="#brv12460-sec-0006">IV</a>) likely promote melanism‐based polymorphism within populations of aposematic species. Even when the predation costs associated with the pigment are high, asymmetrical mate preferences, such that more‐melanic individuals have higher mating success, may contribute to the persistence of melanic morphs within populations (Saino 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0322" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0322">2013</a>; Culumber 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0071">2014</a>; Mishra &amp; Omkar, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0246" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0246">2014</a>). The relative abundance of these melanic morphs within a population also increases with the benefits of improved thermoregulation (i.e. decreasing temperature), leading to both altitudinal and latitudinal clines in morph abundance (Clusella‐Trullas 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0061">2007</a>). For example, the proportion of melanic morphs in populations of the two‐spot ladybird (
  <span class="italic">Adalia bipunctata</span>) is greater in higher, and therefore colder, latitudes (Brakefield
  <span class="italic">,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0029">1984</a>) and these clines in morph abundance have been shown to alter in response to climate change (de Jong &amp; Brakefield, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0165" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0165">1998</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Melanin also has benefits associated with ultraviolet (UV) protection (Ortonne, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0273" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0273">2002</a>), immunocompetence (Dubovskiy 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0086" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0086">2013</a>), and desiccation (King &amp; Sinclair, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0177" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0177">2015</a>) and its abundance is plastically adjusted in response to increases in these challenges (Wilson 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0419" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0419">2001</a>; Abram 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0001">2015</a>; Välimäki 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0400" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0400">2015</a>). Variation in these factors may act, like temperature, to enable the persistence of variation in the abundance of melanic morphs across spatial (polytypism) and temporal (polymorphism) scales. The selection landscape determining both the abundance of melanic morphs within aposematic populations and the degree of melanism within morphs themselves will thus consist of multiple competing selection pressures, beyond simply temperature and predation risk.
