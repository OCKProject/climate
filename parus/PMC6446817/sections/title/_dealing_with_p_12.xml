  <span class="italic">Dealing with predator diversity within a population</span>
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The presence of a diverse community of predators in a single location may favour variability in warning signals, so as to mitigate overall predation risk. Variation in the extent of conspicuousness may be employed as a compromise strategy, whereby signals of intermediate visibility, but still distinct and recognisable, may deter predators that heed the signal without attracting too much attention from others. For example, the polytypic poison frogs 
  <span class="italic">Oophaga granulifera</span> and 
  <span class="italic">O. pumilio</span> include morphs that are green and cryptic, others that are bright and truly ‘aposematic’, and intermediate phenotypes. This phenomenon seems to be related to behavioural phenotypes and attack rates by predators, as frogs from brighter populations are bolder and experience lower attack rates (Maan &amp; Cummings, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0208" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0208">2012</a>; Willink 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0416" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0416">2013</a>, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0417" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0417">2014</a>). Alternatively, a given signal may vary depending on the position of the observer. In distance‐dependent signalling, aposematic species possess pattern elements that make them appear cryptic from afar, yet conspicuous up close (Barnett &amp; Cuthill, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0428" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0428">2014</a>; Barnett, Scott‐Samuel &amp; Cuthill, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0013">2016</a>). Examples include 
  <span class="italic">Vipera</span> snakes (Valkonen 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0401" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0401">2012</a>), some butterfly larvae (Tullberg, Merilaita &amp; Wiklund, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0390" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0390">2005</a>; Bohlin, Tullberg &amp; Merilaita, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0022">2008</a>) and spotted skunks (
  <span class="italic">Spilogale</span> spp.), which are difficult to detect unless viewed closely (Caro 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0051">2013</a>). Thus, prey coloration is not always exclusively cryptic or aposematic, but rather forms a continuum between camouflage and warning coloration, which can be manipulated to the prey's advantage.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Diversity within a population of predators can also maintain fixed variation within an aposematic prey population, under certain circumstances. Contrary to traditional theories of Müllerian mimicry, positive frequency‐dependent selection is not ubiquitous (Greenwood, Wood &amp; Batchelor, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0130" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0130">1981</a>; Amézquita 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0003">2013</a>; Richards‐Zawacki 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0293" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0293">2013</a>). Müller's more simplistic assumptions about the relations between predators and prey, such as the fixed numbers of prey encounters required for learning, have since been replaced by a greater understanding of the complexity of predator communities. Considering the number of variables potentially affecting the overall outcome of foraging decisions by predators, a broad range of different selection regimes should be expected (Stevens &amp; Ruxton, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0364" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0364">2012</a>; Aubier &amp; Sherratt, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0009">2015</a>) including spatiotemporal variation in selection even within a single population of prey.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In particular, several processes may lead to negative frequency‐dependent selection, facilitating the maintenance of polymorphisms within populations (Svensson, Abbott &amp; Härdling, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0372" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0372">2005</a>; Olendorf 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0271" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0271">2006</a>). Foraging predators must constantly balance the costs and benefits of concentrating on prey they know to be profitable, or sampling unfamiliar prey items, which could be more valuable or potentially harmful. Optimal‐sampling theory predicts that these adaptive decisions will depend on the likelihood that a prey item is defended, and the probability that the predator will encounter this type of prey again. In the context of warning coloration, it suggests that rarer aposematic morphs should be avoided, as predators learn about profitability from their past experiences of more regularly encountered prey (Sherratt, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0341" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0341">2011</a>; Aubier &amp; Sherratt, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0009">2015</a>). Search‐image formation, more‐efficient handling of commonly encountered prey, and the potential costs of gathering information about the profitability of unknown items will all encourage predation of common forms (Skelhorn 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0350" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0350">2016</a>). Whether a predator will decide to attack common defended prey will also depend on prey toxicity within the community; for example, relatively weak defences or few palatable alternatives will favour predation on common aposematic forms, thus promoting polymorphism (Greenwood 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0130" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0130">1981</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effect of predator community in different populations may even override expectations based on positive frequency‐dependent selection. Yellow and white morphs of male wood tiger moths occur at different frequencies across Europe, but local morph frequency does not always predict survival in artificial predation experiments. In one study, predation of the two morphs varied according to the community of bird species present, with yellow morphs being more successful in communities dominated by Paridae (tits, in Northern Europe), rather than Prunellidae, represented by the dunnock 
  <span class="italic">Prunella modularis</span> (Nokelainen 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0265" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0265">2014</a>). This suggests that understanding the characteristics of the relevant predator community may be the most important means of predicting signal evolution. In a general framework, modelling the evolution of a simple polymorphic prey population, with two morphs differing in conspicuousness and facing a mix of predators that differ in their tolerance of the prey defences, demonstrates several possible outcomes (Endler &amp; Mappes, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0097" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0097">2004</a>). Depending on the proportion of predators choosing to avoid the prey, the population may become monomorphic for either the more or less visible morph, or, if both predator types occur in similar numbers, the polymorphism may be maintained. Experiments with firebugs and wild‐caught birds suggests that if a new colour morph of a defended species appears within a population, neophobia alone is unlikely to overcome purifying selection and enable the persistence of the new form (Exnerová 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0104" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0104">2006</a>). However, evolutionary modelling suggests that a combination of dietary wariness, interacting with overall predation risk and signal conspicuousness will favour diversity in warning signals within populations, with or without frequency‐dependent selection (Franks &amp; Oxford, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0114" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0114">2009</a>). Moreover, the results of simulations based on selection regimes observed in polymorphic species such as 
  <span class="italic">Cepaea</span> land snails, 
  <span class="italic">Oophaga</span> poison frogs, 
  <span class="italic">Sonora</span> snakes and 
  <span class="italic">Heliconius</span> butterflies suggest that differences in the range of predators, operating in small local populations or across multiple populations at a regional scale, can promote a mosaic of polymorphisms in prey, without invoking any additional mechanisms favouring diversity (Holmes, Grundler &amp; Davis Rabosky, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0155" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0155">2017</a>). Multiple ways in which predators and predator communities may differ can thus ultimately affect selective pressures leading to diversity in warning coloration.
