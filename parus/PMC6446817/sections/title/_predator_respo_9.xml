  <span class="italic">Predator response to variation in prey toxicity, and its implications for aposematic variation</span>
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Just as variation in predator communities was originally underappreciated, the variability of secondary defences, particularly chemical defences, in natural populations has long been neglected (Speed 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0361" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0361">2012</a>). At the extreme end of this spectrum is automimicry, a phenomenon whereby some individuals within a population of aposematic animals have either extremely low levels of toxins or none at all (Brower, Brower &amp; Corvino, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0036">1967</a>; Ruxton 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0320" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0320">2004</a>). This seems to occur primarily in species that acquire either toxins or toxin precursors from their diet. Automimicry poses a problem for defended individuals because, similar to Batesian mimicry, it degrades the efficiency of the aposematic signal and thus any given individual in the population is more likely to be attacked (Fig. 
  <a rid="brv12460-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#brv12460-fig-0003">3</a>). Further, automimicry poses a problem for predators that may also experience negative side effects, for example by unintentionally consuming toxic prey after previous experience with a palatable individual of the same species (Ruxton 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0320" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0320">2004</a>). Nevertheless, models indicate that automimicry may persist when there are two discrete levels of defence within a population and low predation pressures (Broom, Speed &amp; Ruxton, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0033">2005</a>), or when defence is a continuous trait (and especially when defence levels trade off with fecundity; Svennungsen &amp; Holen, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0371" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0371">2007</a>). Additionally, evidence indicates that automimicry may in fact not affect overall predation rates in a population when automimics are below 25% of the population (Skelhorn &amp; Rowe, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0352" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0352">2007</a>). With respect to this review, automimicry is of interest as a potential intermediate step towards polymorphism, if the population of automimics begins to diverge into two different aposematic strategies. For example, in insects, females could evolve a preference for different host plants to oviposit on, which produces differential toxicity in the population and potentially different peaks in the adaptive landscape. Broom 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0033">2005</a>) have shown this to be a stable strategy and it could function as an intermediate step towards polymorphism 
  <span class="italic">via</span> ecological mechanisms. Although theory would predict that the phenotype in the lower adaptive peak should evolve towards similarity with the higher peaked phenotype (e.g. Turner, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0395" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0395">1983</a>), there are alternative mechanisms that may maintain this (see Section 
  <a rid="brv12460-sec-0013" ref-type="sec" href="#brv12460-sec-0013">V</a>). Over time, this behaviour could become canalised and correlate with the aposematic signal as well. How common this is, or whether it occurs at all, is unknown. Automimicry may also be capable of creating polymorphisms in situations in which toxicity and colour are linked 
  <span class="italic">via</span> some environmental trait. A plausible mechanism would be something akin to the resource‐allocation theory that has been supported by work on ladybird beetles (Blount 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0019">2009</a>, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0018">2012</a>; see Section 
  <a rid="brv12460-sec-0013" ref-type="sec" href="#brv12460-sec-0013">V</a>), wherein some individuals acquire a chemical defence and others do not.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similar to automimicry within a species, mimetic species are often unequally protected. This brings about a scenario known as quasi‐Batesian mimicry, occasionally referred to as Speedian mimicry (Speed, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0358" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0358">1990</a>; Fig. 
  <a rid="brv12460-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#brv12460-fig-0003">3</a>). Although mimicry has often been described as a binary scenario, i.e. either Batesian or Müllerian, there is evidence that it may be better represented as a spectrum, much as visual strategies are now perceived as a continuum ranging from crypsis to aposematism. Mimicry appearing to be Müllerian in nature may in fact be detrimental to one species and lead to quasi‐Batesian mimicry if there is a difference in the level of defence between the two mimetic species (Speed, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0358" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0358">1990</a>). Crucially, it is as yet unclear whether differences in toxicity and associated unpalatability actually produce quasi‐Batesian systems, or if variation between mimetic species with differing levels of toxins is ecologically irrelevant and these species have functionally mutualistic relationships (e.g. Rowland 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0312" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0312">2007</a>; Stuckert 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0365" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0365">2014a</a>). Similar to Batesian mimicry, local polymorphism may be beneficial to individuals of species with a low level of defence; if they can mimic different established aposematic species, they would gain a greater survival advantage, as the costs of mimicry would be spread across several model species (Speed, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0359" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0359">1993</a>; Ruxton 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0320" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0320">2004</a>). Quasi‐Batesian mimicry may also put selective pressure on the less‐defended species to be more similar to the phenotype of the better‐defended species. This in turn may be sufficiently detrimental to the better‐defended species that they may experience selection away from the shared form (similar to Batesian mimicry). This could, theoretically, lead to an evolutionary chase between the model and the quasi‐Batesian mimics in a red queen chase scenario (Van Valen, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0402" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0402">1973</a>), particularly if selective pressures promote similar rates of adaptation in the two species. Furthermore, as discussed above, predators can make decisions based on both their nutritional level and toxin load, and therefore the availability of alternative, palatable prey may strongly influence the relationship between mimetic species, particularly if they differ in toxicity (Rowland 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0313" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0313">2010b</a>). Including information on predator state in models of mimicry can lead to surprising outcomes; for example, two species that are visually distinct may both still benefit from the other species' presence even when toxins are not costly for predators to detoxify (Halpin, Skelhorn &amp; Rowe, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0139" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0139">2012</a>; Halpin 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0141" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0141">2017</a>). Additionally, differences in chemical defences (i.e. Batesian or quasi‐Batesian mimicry) could cause populations of a defended species to experience different coevolutionary trajectories (Laine, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0190" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0190">2009</a>), particularly when they are in geographic isolation. This could lead to polytypism, or polymorphism if the populations eventually become sympatric once more.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In reality, the role that variation in chemical defence has on populations and the evolution and maintenance of variation in colour phenotypes is largely speculative. This, in part, derives from a general uncertainty as to whether or not these differences in toxicity actually make ecological differences to predators. In general, we lack the empirical data to determine what this variation means to predators, or even why this variation occurs. This is a fairly substantial gap in our knowledge, one which could lead to a burgeoning subdiscipline.</p>
