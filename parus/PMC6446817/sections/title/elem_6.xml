 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interactions between predators and defended prey lie at the heart of the paradox surrounding diversity in aposematism. While predation has traditionally been considered to favour monomorphy in warning signals, a growing appreciation of the differences in physiology, psychology and habitat use between predator species, populations, and individuals suggests that predator communities are in fact heterogeneous and dynamic selective agents. This generates diversity in predation risk and creates a significant opportunity for the maintenance of variation in aposematic prey.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Predators vary spatially, temporally, taxonomically, and individually</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A predator's response to warningly coloured prey depends on both the prey's relative unprofitability and the conspicuousness of their visual signals (Mappes, Marples &amp; Endler, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0218" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0218">2005</a>), so aposematic prey must carefully balance their investment in these two strategic components (Speed &amp; Ruxton, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0360" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0360">2007</a>). Yet predators are also highly variable in their response to both chemical defences and visual cues. Therefore, the most adaptive tactic for defended prey will largely depend on the specific predator community in their immediate environment. Variation among predators and predator guilds can occur at several levels: among species, spatially among populations, temporally across seasons or an individual's lifetime, and at a finer scale among individuals (whether based on a stable behavioural type/syndrome or variable factors such as motivation), creating a mosaic of different selective pressures. In the following section, we suggest how variation in multiple predator traits, at different spatial and temporal scales, can facilitate the maintenance of different patterns of variation in prey signals (summarised in Fig.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For a given predator (species or individual), defended prey vary in their degree of unprofitability (Brower 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0037">1968</a>), from mere distastefulness to deadly toxin loads. The impact of this difference is in part dependent on the specific predator and thus will differ among predators according to their susceptibility to specific toxins (Endler &amp; Mappes, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0097" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0097">2004</a>; Mappes

    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0218" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0218">2005</a>), while the willingness of any individual to attack and consume defended prey will further be modulated by other factors, such as motivation and experience. Specialist predators, such as grosbeaks and orioles feeding on defended monarch butterflies, 
    <span class="italic">Danaus plexippus</span> (Fink &amp; Brower, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0110" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0110">1981</a>; Brower, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0035">1988</a>) or raptors preying on vipers (
    <span class="italic">Vipera</span> spp.; Valkonen 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0401" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0401">2012</a>), can overcome the defences of aposematic animals, whether through resistance to their defences or careful handling. As such, attracting their attention with bright aposematic signals would be detrimental to prey survival. Tolerance of prey defences can vary across species but also among populations of predators; for example, some populations of garter snakes, 
    <span class="italic">Thamnophis sirtalis</span>, have evolved resistance to newt tetrodotoxin (Geffeney, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0120" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0120">2002</a>). This may lead to polytypic or polymorphic variation in the conspicuousness of defended prey, following the distribution of more‐ or less‐tolerant predators across populations and microhabitats.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Predator sensory systems, including their perception of visual cues and other cognitive functions (e.g. ability to learn, remember and generalise between signals), may also facilitate the maintenance of polytypic and polymorphic variation among aposematic prey. The key sensory systems used for hunting differ among predator taxa, so, for the same defensive effect, prey may need to employ a diversity of signal forms to maximise their ‘avoid me’ signal efficacy (Guilford &amp; Dawkins, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0136" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0136">1991</a>). Predation experiments with artificial prey demonstrate that only some predators respond to visual cues; for example, while avian predators avoid warningly coloured dendrobatid frog models, crabs and lizards do not (Willink 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0417" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0417">2014</a>). Variation in the effectiveness of warning coloration when confronted with different predator communities may lead to conflicting selective pressures on prey signals. In Japan, the relative abundance of avian predators, which rely on vision when hunting, compared to mammalian predators, for whom visual properties are less relevant, may be responsible for the variation in the extent of red coloration in 
    <span class="italic">Cynops pyrrhogaster</span> newts between island and mainland populations (Mochida, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0248" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0248">2011</a>). Among visually oriented predators themselves, there is considerable variation in perceptual abilities (Osorio &amp; Vorobyev, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0274" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0274">2008</a>), suggesting that some predators could perceive or distinguish visual signals that others may not. In addition, sensory processing in the brain plays a role in determining key features influencing the effectiveness of warning signals, such as detectability, discriminability and memorability (Guilford &amp; Dawkins, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0136" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0136">1991</a>). Finally, environmental conditions also affect the visibility and effectiveness of warning colours, dependent on ambient light and the characteristics of natural backgrounds (Endler, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0094" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0094">1990</a>, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0095" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0095">1993</a>; Bond &amp; Kamil, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0025">2006</a>; Rojas, Rautiala &amp; Mappes, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0301" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0301">2014b</a>); so aposematism overall, or some specific colour morphs, may be more effective in particular habitats.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Beyond perception of the signals, higher‐level cognitive processes may also influence predator responses to prey signals, and thus ultimately impact the adaptive value of conspicuousness and warning coloration. Generalisation between visual signals, whether they cannot be perceptually distinguished or are grouped together by higher‐order cognitive processes, is especially interesting, as it would effectively allow different colour morphs to co‐occur with equal fitness (Amézquita 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>

    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0304" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0304">2018</a>). For example, tests with multiple passerine species suggest that they differ in their ability to generalise prior experience of red firebugs (
    <span class="italic">Pyrrhocoris apterus</span>) to yellow morphs of this species (Exnerová 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0104" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0104">2006</a>). Although it would not itself select for variation, generalisation between morphs could facilitate the maintenance of different forms (which could provide other selective benefits; see alternative selection pressures in Section 
    <a rid="brv12460-sec-0013" ref-type="sec" href="#brv12460-sec-0013">V</a>) in populations where predators tend not to distinguish between morphs.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even if predators classify signals as distinct, further differences in their response will arise due to variation in general neophobia, cautiousness when handling novel prey, and dietary conservatism. These effects can potentially facilitate the evolution of novel conspicuous morphs (Marples, Roper &amp; Harper, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0222" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0222">1998</a>; Thomas 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>

    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0104" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0104">2006</a>); although experimental evidence suggests dietary conservatism may not be sufficient to counteract positive frequency‐dependent selection against novel morphs when these are rare and conspicuous (Marples &amp; Mappes, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0221" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0221">2010</a>). In some cases, innate avoidance of specific patterns plays an important role, as demonstrated by the aversion of naive turquoise‐browed motmots (
    <span class="italic">Eumomota superciliosa</span>) and great kiskadees (
    <span class="italic">Pitangus sulphuratus</span>) to coral snake (
    <span class="italic">Micrurus</span> spp.) patterns (Smith, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0354" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0354">1975</a>, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0355" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0355">1977</a>). Strong innate responses may allow polymorphisms in warning signals to evolve if the predators avoid a broad class of visual signals, such as all ringed patterns in the case of coral snakes. Finally, variability in the learning abilities of predators will affect the benefit of aposematic signalling for defended prey (Endler &amp; Mappes, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0097" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0097">2004</a>; Mappes 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0218" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0218">2005</a>). Recent work on domestic chicks (
    <span class="italic">Gallus gallus domesticus</span>) showed variation in avoidance learning among different breeds of this species. Chickens bred for high productivity were initially less wary of aposematic prey, but also formed weaker associations between signals and defences over time than the other breeds of chicken, leading to differential prey survival in laboratory experiments (Rowland, Fulford &amp; Ruxton, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0311" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0311">2017</a>). Predators in the wild may also differ in their learning abilities, leading to variation in predation risk for aposematic prey with different signals, and are also likely to differ from domestic chickens. Further research on learning in more relevant predators could alter our expectations of predator capabilities and responses to aposematic prey; for example, evidence that predators can rapidly memorise many different signal forms would challenge the assumption of strong selection for aposematic signal monomorphy.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Classic experiments on neophobia and dietary conservatism in passerine birds also reveal further intraspecific variation, which cannot be attributed to factors such as differences in territory, experience or sex (Marples 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0222" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0222">1998</a>). These could be linked to personality, known to affect both initial reactions to aposematic prey and the learning process (Exnerová 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0103" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0103">2010</a>), or individual condition. A predator's level of hunger and current condition will determine its motivation and willingness to attack and consume risky prey, including warningly coloured individuals, which will impact the relative benefit of aposematic displays. Rather than rejecting aposematic prey outright, predators consider all available prey types to make adaptive foraging decisions, based on the relative costs of ingesting toxins 
    <span class="italic">versus</span> the nutritional gain from consuming the prey (Barnett 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0012">2012</a>). Experiments with European starlings (
    <span class="italic">Sturnus vulgaris</span>) suggest they can distinguish not only undefended from toxic prey, but also different levels of chemical defences, 
    <span class="italic">via</span> taste‐rejection (Skelhorn &amp; Rowe, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0351" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0351">2006</a>, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0353" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0353">2009</a>), as well as gaining nutritional information about the prey (Skelhorn 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0350" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0350">2016</a>). This allows them to make educated decisions while foraging, depending on their motivation to feed; accordingly, starlings are more willing to consume defended prey when their own reserves are experimentally reduced (Barnett, Bateson &amp; Rowe, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0011">2007</a>), early‐life or current conditions are harsher (Chatelain, Halpin &amp; Rowe, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0054">2013</a>; Bloxham 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0020">2014</a>), or the prey have greater nutritional value relative to their toxicity (Halpin, Skelhorn &amp; Rowe, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0140" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0140">2014</a>; Smith, Halpin &amp; Rowe, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0356" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0356">2016</a>). While there is a growing body of evidence, primarily from laboratory experiments, suggesting that varying levels of motivation affect prey choice by predators, how this may impact the survival of aposematic prey and selection pressures on signal form in the wild is not yet clear. The physiological mechanisms and cognitive processes responsible for these adaptive decisions are still relatively poorly known, but there is scope for mediation of this toxicity–nutrition trade‐off to vary among species, populations and personalities (Skelhorn 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0350" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0350">2016</a>). Exploring how different predators deal with the trade‐offs associated with foraging in a natural setting, such as balancing the time required to assess the profitability of warningly coloured prey accurately, while managing their own exposure to predators and efficient foraging, would be extremely valuable for obtaining a more well‐rounded picture of predation risk for aposematic prey.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Motivation is not the only highly variable trait affecting predator responses to aposematic prey. Prior experience is critical in determining whether a predator will choose to attack and consume a prey item. This can vary widely across species and populations of predators, as traits such as dietary specialisations (Exnerová 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0101" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0101">2003</a>; Ihalainen

    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0162" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0162">2012</a>) and territoriality (Endler &amp; Rojas, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0098" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0098">2009</a>) affect which prey assemblages a predator may experience. For example, omnivorous and more specialised passerine birds respond differently when presented with aposematic invertebrates (Exnerová 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0101" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0101">2003</a>). Similarly, great tits (
    <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) from Finland are more reluctant to attack aposematic prey than great tits from Bohemia, possibly due to a reduced exposure to warningly coloured invertebrates, and a higher proportion of neophobic and migratory birds in the population (Exnerová 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0102" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0102">2015</a>). On a finer scale, a predator's level of experience will depend on the number of encounters with defended prey, so may differ between age classes (Lindström, Alatalo &amp; Mappes, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0202" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0202">1999</a>). Seasonal fluctuations in overall predator naivety may occur as young predators learn to forage for themselves and sample aposematic prey for the first time, thereby impacting the relative benefits of conspicuousness and crypsis for defended prey at different times of the year (Mappes 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0219" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0219">2014</a>) and potentially favouring seasonal polyphenism, as seen in striated shieldbugs, 
    <span class="italic">Graphosoma lineatum</span> (Tullberg

   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, variation in predator traits interacts with other forms of variation in the whole community of organisms in a given habitat, such that the characteristics of this community, and the interactions between all its members, will ultimately shape the selective pressures acting on warning signal form. From the predators' perspective, the presence, abundance and nutritional value of alternative prey, as well as the effort required to locate them and the toxin load already ingested, all impact the net benefits of attack (Turner &amp; Speed,

    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0350" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0350">2016</a>), and the strength of selection for convergence in prey signals (Fig.

    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0201" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0201">2004</a>). The diversity of prey coloration within populations is equally important, not only in shaping predator experience, but also because of the demands it places on predators' cognitive skills. Selective pressures for signal uniformity may be relaxed in more complex communities, as predator learning is limited by their ability to memorise multiple signals and their associated risks and benefits (Ihalainen 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0162" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0162">2012</a>). In an even broader ecological context, the predation risk experienced by the predators of aposematic prey themselves may also contribute to their response to warning signals (Lima &amp; Dill, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0195" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0195">1990</a>), due to variable costs of exposure to predators incurred by longer prey‐handling times, or increased searching behaviour to find alternative prey. As such, differences in both prey and predator communities among populations, as well as spatio‐temporal heterogeneity within populations, combine to produce variable selection pressures affecting warning signal form.

    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0320" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0320">2004</a>). This seems to occur primarily in species that acquire either toxins or toxin precursors from their diet. Automimicry poses a problem for defended individuals because, similar to Batesian mimicry, it degrades the efficiency of the aposematic signal and thus any given individual in the population is more likely to be attacked (Fig. 
    <a rid="brv12460-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#brv12460-fig-0003">3</a>). Further, automimicry poses a problem for predators that may also experience negative side effects, for example by unintentionally consuming toxic prey after previous experience with a palatable individual of the same species (Ruxton 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0320" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0320">2004</a>). Nevertheless, models indicate that automimicry may persist when there are two discrete levels of defence within a population and low predation pressures (Broom, Speed &amp; Ruxton, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0033">2005</a>), or when defence is a continuous trait (and especially when defence levels trade off with fecundity; Svennungsen &amp; Holen, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0371" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0371">2007</a>). Additionally, evidence indicates that automimicry may in fact not affect overall predation rates in a population when automimics are below 25% of the population (Skelhorn &amp; Rowe, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0352" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0352">2007</a>). With respect to this review, automimicry is of interest as a potential intermediate step towards polymorphism, if the population of automimics begins to diverge into two different aposematic strategies. For example, in insects, females could evolve a preference for different host plants to oviposit on, which produces differential toxicity in the population and potentially different peaks in the adaptive landscape. Broom 
    <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0033">2005</a>) have shown this to be a stable strategy and it could function as an intermediate step towards polymorphism 
    <span class="italic">via</span> ecological mechanisms. Although theory would predict that the phenotype in the lower adaptive peak should evolve towards similarity with the higher peaked phenotype (e.g. Turner, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0395" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0395">1983</a>), there are alternative mechanisms that may maintain this (see Section 
    <a rid="brv12460-sec-0013" ref-type="sec" href="#brv12460-sec-0013">V</a>). Over time, this behaviour could become canalised and correlate with the aposematic signal as well. How common this is, or whether it occurs at all, is unknown. Automimicry may also be capable of creating polymorphisms in situations in which toxicity and colour are linked 
    <span class="italic">via</span> some environmental trait. A plausible mechanism would be something akin to the resource‐allocation theory that has been supported by work on ladybird beetles (Blount 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0019">2009</a>, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0018">2012</a>; see Section 
    <a rid="brv12460-sec-0013" ref-type="sec" href="#brv12460-sec-0013">V</a>), wherein some individuals acquire a chemical defence and others do not.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similar to automimicry within a species, mimetic species are often unequally protected. This brings about a scenario known as quasi‐Batesian mimicry, occasionally referred to as Speedian mimicry (Speed, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0358" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0358">1990</a>; Fig. 
    <a rid="brv12460-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#brv12460-fig-0003">3</a>). Although mimicry has often been described as a binary scenario, i.e. either Batesian or Müllerian, there is evidence that it may be better represented as a spectrum, much as visual strategies are now perceived as a continuum ranging from crypsis to aposematism. Mimicry appearing to be Müllerian in nature may in fact be detrimental to one species and lead to quasi‐Batesian mimicry if there is a difference in the level of defence between the two mimetic species (Speed, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0358" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0358">1990</a>). Crucially, it is as yet unclear whether differences in toxicity and associated unpalatability actually produce quasi‐Batesian systems, or if variation between mimetic species with differing levels of toxins is ecologically irrelevant and these species have functionally mutualistic relationships (e.g. Rowland 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0312" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0312">2007</a>; Stuckert 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0365" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0365">2014a</a>). Similar to Batesian mimicry, local polymorphism may be beneficial to individuals of species with a low level of defence; if they can mimic different established aposematic species, they would gain a greater survival advantage, as the costs of mimicry would be spread across several model species (Speed, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0359" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0359">1993</a>; Ruxton 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0320" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0320">2004</a>). Quasi‐Batesian mimicry may also put selective pressure on the less‐defended species to be more similar to the phenotype of the better‐defended species. This in turn may be sufficiently detrimental to the better‐defended species that they may experience selection away from the shared form (similar to Batesian mimicry). This could, theoretically, lead to an evolutionary chase between the model and the quasi‐Batesian mimics in a red queen chase scenario (Van Valen, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0402" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0402">1973</a>), particularly if selective pressures promote similar rates of adaptation in the two species. Furthermore, as discussed above, predators can make decisions based on both their nutritional level and toxin load, and therefore the availability of alternative, palatable prey may strongly influence the relationship between mimetic species, particularly if they differ in toxicity (Rowland 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0313" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0313">2010b</a>). Including information on predator state in models of mimicry can lead to surprising outcomes; for example, two species that are visually distinct may both still benefit from the other species' presence even when toxins are not costly for predators to detoxify (Halpin, Skelhorn &amp; Rowe, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0139" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0139">2012</a>; Halpin 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0141" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0141">2017</a>). Additionally, differences in chemical defences (i.e. Batesian or quasi‐Batesian mimicry) could cause populations of a defended species to experience different coevolutionary trajectories (Laine, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0190" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0190">2009</a>), particularly when they are in geographic isolation. This could lead to polytypism, or polymorphism if the populations eventually become sympatric once more.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In reality, the role that variation in chemical defence has on populations and the evolution and maintenance of variation in colour phenotypes is largely speculative. This, in part, derives from a general uncertainty as to whether or not these differences in toxicity actually make ecological differences to predators. In general, we lack the empirical data to determine what this variation means to predators, or even why this variation occurs. This is a fairly substantial gap in our knowledge, one which could lead to a burgeoning subdiscipline.</p>

    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0058">2016</a>). These local predation pressures can produce a purifying selective force, driving populations towards distinct local phenotypes (Joron &amp; Iwasa,

    <span class="italic">Ranitomeya imitator</span> demonstrate that predation risk for these morphs varies geographically, favouring polytypisms (Chouteau &amp; Angers,

   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On a smaller scale, differences between predator communities across microhabitats within a single population may facilitate the maintenance of polymorphisms in aposematic species and even contribute to speciation, as has been suggested for ithomiine butterflies (Mallet &amp; Gilbert, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0215" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0215">1995</a>; Beccaloni,

    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0092" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0092">2008</a>). In a recent study in Ecuador, butterflies with particular wing patterns were found at different frequencies among distinct microhabitats in the canopy (Willmott

    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0418" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0418">2017</a>). The community of avian predators likely to be encountered by these butterflies also covaried with these microhabitats, and artificial predation experiments suggested that predation risk experienced by specific wing patterns differed among microhabitats. Moreover, behavioural choices, such as temporal variation in activity or microhabitat selection, will enable aposematic prey to alter their conspicuousness and improve their chances of survival (Rojas, Devillechabrolle &amp; Endler,

    <span class="italic">Dealing with predator diversity within a population</span>
   </div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The presence of a diverse community of predators in a single location may favour variability in warning signals, so as to mitigate overall predation risk. Variation in the extent of conspicuousness may be employed as a compromise strategy, whereby signals of intermediate visibility, but still distinct and recognisable, may deter predators that heed the signal without attracting too much attention from others. For example, the polytypic poison frogs 
    <span class="italic">Oophaga granulifera</span> and 
    <span class="italic">O. pumilio</span> include morphs that are green and cryptic, others that are bright and truly ‘aposematic’, and intermediate phenotypes. This phenomenon seems to be related to behavioural phenotypes and attack rates by predators, as frogs from brighter populations are bolder and experience lower attack rates (Maan &amp; Cummings, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0208" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0208">2012</a>; Willink

    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0417" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0417">2014</a>). Alternatively, a given signal may vary depending on the position of the observer. In distance‐dependent signalling, aposematic species possess pattern elements that make them appear cryptic from afar, yet conspicuous up close (Barnett &amp; Cuthill, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0428" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0428">2014</a>; Barnett, Scott‐Samuel &amp; Cuthill, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0013">2016</a>). Examples include 
    <span class="italic">Vipera</span> snakes (Valkonen 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0401" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0401">2012</a>), some butterfly larvae (Tullberg, Merilaita &amp; Wiklund, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0390" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0390">2005</a>; Bohlin, Tullberg &amp; Merilaita, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0022">2008</a>) and spotted skunks (
    <span class="italic">Spilogale</span> spp.), which are difficult to detect unless viewed closely (Caro

    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0051">2013</a>). Thus, prey coloration is not always exclusively cryptic or aposematic, but rather forms a continuum between camouflage and warning coloration, which can be manipulated to the prey's advantage.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Diversity within a population of predators can also maintain fixed variation within an aposematic prey population, under certain circumstances. Contrary to traditional theories of Müllerian mimicry, positive frequency‐dependent selection is not ubiquitous (Greenwood, Wood &amp; Batchelor, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0130" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0130">1981</a>; Amézquita

    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0293" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0293">2013</a>). Müller's more simplistic assumptions about the relations between predators and prey, such as the fixed numbers of prey encounters required for learning, have since been replaced by a greater understanding of the complexity of predator communities. Considering the number of variables potentially affecting the overall outcome of foraging decisions by predators, a broad range of different selection regimes should be expected (Stevens &amp; Ruxton, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0364" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0364">2012</a>; Aubier &amp; Sherratt, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0009">2015</a>) including spatiotemporal variation in selection even within a single population of prey.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In particular, several processes may lead to negative frequency‐dependent selection, facilitating the maintenance of polymorphisms within populations (Svensson, Abbott &amp; Härdling, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0372" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0372">2005</a>; Olendorf 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0271" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0271">2006</a>). Foraging predators must constantly balance the costs and benefits of concentrating on prey they know to be profitable, or sampling unfamiliar prey items, which could be more valuable or potentially harmful. Optimal‐sampling theory predicts that these adaptive decisions will depend on the likelihood that a prey item is defended, and the probability that the predator will encounter this type of prey again. In the context of warning coloration, it suggests that rarer aposematic morphs should be avoided, as predators learn about profitability from their past experiences of more regularly encountered prey (Sherratt, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0341" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0341">2011</a>; Aubier &amp; Sherratt, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0009">2015</a>). Search‐image formation, more‐efficient handling of commonly encountered prey, and the potential costs of gathering information about the profitability of unknown items will all encourage predation of common forms (Skelhorn 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0350" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0350">2016</a>). Whether a predator will decide to attack common defended prey will also depend on prey toxicity within the community; for example, relatively weak defences or few palatable alternatives will favour predation on common aposematic forms, thus promoting polymorphism (Greenwood 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0130" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0130">1981</a>).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effect of predator community in different populations may even override expectations based on positive frequency‐dependent selection. Yellow and white morphs of male wood tiger moths occur at different frequencies across Europe, but local morph frequency does not always predict survival in artificial predation experiments. In one study, predation of the two morphs varied according to the community of bird species present, with yellow morphs being more successful in communities dominated by Paridae (tits, in Northern Europe), rather than Prunellidae, represented by the dunnock 
    <span class="italic">Prunella modularis</span> (Nokelainen 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0265" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0265">2014</a>). This suggests that understanding the characteristics of the relevant predator community may be the most important means of predicting signal evolution. In a general framework, modelling the evolution of a simple polymorphic prey population, with two morphs differing in conspicuousness and facing a mix of predators that differ in their tolerance of the prey defences, demonstrates several possible outcomes (Endler &amp; Mappes, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0097" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0097">2004</a>). Depending on the proportion of predators choosing to avoid the prey, the population may become monomorphic for either the more or less visible morph, or, if both predator types occur in similar numbers, the polymorphism may be maintained. Experiments with firebugs and wild‐caught birds suggests that if a new colour morph of a defended species appears within a population, neophobia alone is unlikely to overcome purifying selection and enable the persistence of the new form (Exnerová 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0104" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0104">2006</a>). However, evolutionary modelling suggests that a combination of dietary wariness, interacting with overall predation risk and signal conspicuousness will favour diversity in warning signals within populations, with or without frequency‐dependent selection (Franks &amp; Oxford, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0114" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0114">2009</a>). Moreover, the results of simulations based on selection regimes observed in polymorphic species such as 
    <span class="italic">Cepaea</span> land snails, 
    <span class="italic">Oophaga</span> poison frogs, 
    <span class="italic">Sonora</span> snakes and 
    <span class="italic">Heliconius</span> butterflies suggest that differences in the range of predators, operating in small local populations or across multiple populations at a regional scale, can promote a mosaic of polymorphisms in prey, without invoking any additional mechanisms favouring diversity (Holmes, Grundler &amp; Davis Rabosky, 
    <a rid="brv12460-bib-0155" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0155">2017</a>). Multiple ways in which predators and predator communities may differ can thus ultimately affect selective pressures leading to diversity in warning coloration.
