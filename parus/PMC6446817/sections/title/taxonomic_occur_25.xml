 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">TAXONOMIC OCCURRENCE OF WARNING‐SIGNAL POLYMORPHISM</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our search for variation in aposematic signals, we found examples in nearly every taxon in which we find aposematism (see online Table 
  <a rid="brv12460-supitem-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#brv12460-supitem-0002">S1</a>), suggesting that variation in warning signals is far more widespread than previously appreciated. Despite this taxonomic diversity, a disproportionate amount of research effort has focused on a limited number of taxa, most notably Lepidoptera (especially the Neotropical 
  <span class="italic">Heliconius</span>) and, to a lesser extent, the dendrobatid poison frogs. While this has enabled researchers to delve deeply into the various mechanisms producing patterns of variation within these species, it is unclear whether their findings generalise to other taxonomic groups.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Aposematic research has, for the past century, focused predominantly on terrestrial insects and their avian predators, possibly due to the tractability of these systems. However, examples of aposematic colour and pattern variation in other taxa such as birds (Dumbacher 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0087" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0087">1992</a>, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0089" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0089">2008</a>) and mammals (Hunter, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0159" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0159">2009</a>; Stankowich, Caro &amp; Cox, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0362" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0362">2011</a>; Caro 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0051">2013</a>) have more recently been revealed. Warning‐signal variation in several marine species has also begun to be investigated (Hanlon &amp; Messenger, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0143" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0143">1998</a>; Cortesi &amp; Cheney, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0066">2010</a>; Winters 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0421" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0421">2017</a>), although the aposematic function of conspicuous coloration in aquatic environments has been questioned. This is due to limited light availability, poorly known predator visual systems and predator–prey interactions, and the lack of known defence mechanisms for many brightly coloured organisms in the marine environment (Pawlik, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0281" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0281">2012</a>). It is probably in the non‐animal kingdoms where aposematism has received the least attention, despite reported examples in plants (e.g. Cahn &amp; Harper, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0048">1976</a>; Karageorgou, Buschmann &amp; Manetas, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0172" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0172">2008</a>; Lev‐Yadun, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0194" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0194">2009</a>) and even fungi (Sherratt, Wilkinson &amp; Bain, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0344" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0344">2005</a>). There is therefore a need for more comparative studies on different taxa with robust phylogenies and detailed ecological information in order to address the ultimate causes of signal variation across taxa. Furthermore, utilising other systems parallel to the traditional terrestrial avian–insect interactions, for example, terrestrial plant–herbivore or marine food webs, may well provide new insights into the selective pressures and commonalities creating aposematic variation.
