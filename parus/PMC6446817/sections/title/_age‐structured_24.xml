 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although not an alternative selection pressure 
  <span class="italic">per se</span>, the conspicuousness of warning signals might also be expected to change over the lifetime of an individual, closely tracking major physiological changes resulting from processes such as reproduction and senescence (Booth, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0027">1990b</a>). For example, when warning coloration has a dual role as a predator deterrent and mate attractant, there might be an increase in signal strength during the mating season (Örnborg 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0272" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0272">2002</a>; Pérez‐Rodríguez, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0283" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0283">2008</a>). Reproduction is also costly and adult condition is often poorer post‐, relative to pre‐breeding (Stearns, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0363" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0363">1992</a>; Monaghan, Metcalfe &amp; Torres, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0250" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0250">2009</a>). Such a decrease in condition may potentially have consequences for the conspicuousness or ‘quality’ of an individual's aposematic signal, especially in longer‐lived species with multiple reproductive bouts (Velando, Drummond &amp; Torres, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0404" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0404">2010</a>). Senescence, on the other hand, is strongly linked to a general decline in phenotype (Rose, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0305" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0305">1991</a>), and the strength of aposematic signals may become less effective with age in the same way as other colour signals, for example the blue feet of male blue‐footed boobies 
  <span class="italic">Sula nebouxii</span> (Torres &amp; Velando, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0385" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0385">2007</a>), the yellow bibs of the common yellowthroat 
  <span class="italic">Geothlypis trichas</span> (Freeman‐Gallant 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0115" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0115">2011</a>), and the wings of the orange sulphur butterfly 
  <span class="italic">Colias eurytheme</span> (Kemp, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0175" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0175">2006</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effects of reproduction on coloration also vary according to an individual's age and sex, leading to a mosaic of colour expression within a population resulting from individual variation in sex, age class, and reproductive status (Evans, Gustafsson &amp; Sheldon, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0100" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0100">2011</a>; Grunst, Rotenberry &amp; Grunst, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0134" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0134">2014</a>). Furthermore, holometabolous insects such as Lepidoptera naturally show dramatic changes in form as well as coloration throughout their lifetime (Booth, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0027">1990b</a>), and more subtle changes in coloration are common in hemimetabolous insects, such as true bugs, between different nymphs and adult forms. Incorporate the aforementioned genetic correlations between warning signals at different life stages, or warning signals and other life‐history traits, and the picture becomes even more complex (Lindstedt 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0199" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0199">2016</a>). An explicit test of the effects of reproduction and senescence on warning coloration variation and efficiency, also taking into consideration possible genetic correlations, is therefore needed. This would then enable us to ascertain whether similar patterns occur in populations of aposematic species and therefore if variation in age class within a population contributes to individual variation in conspicuousness.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is clear therefore that there are myriad different selective pressures with the potential to influence the warning signals of aposematic species, some of which have already been empirically demonstrated to be important, and others worthy of further research. These sources of influence may act in ways that can be diametrically opposed to, or act synergistically with, predation pressure (Table 
  <a rid="brv12460-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" href="#brv12460-tbl-0001">1</a>). These ‘alternative’ selection pressures are most likely to produce and maintain warning signal diversity if they: (
  <span class="italic">i</span>) produce negative frequency‐dependent selection favouring rare morphs (for example those described in 
  <span class="italic">Heliconius</span> by Chouteau 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0059">2017</a>), or (
  <span class="italic">ii</span>) act in combination with heterogeneous selection imposed by predators (as described in Section 
  <a rid="brv12460-sec-0006" ref-type="sec" href="#brv12460-sec-0006">IV</a>) to produce different optimal phenotypes either within or among populations. In the latter case, the resulting selection landscape and associated phenotypic optima are also likely to vary over space and time, further slowing phenotypic convergence and allowing within‐population signal diversity to persist for longer. For example, temperatures will vary not only among habitats but also depending on climatic and seasonal timescales, and selection pressures associated with mate choice will vary in intensity throughout the year, especially in those species with distinct breeding seasons. It is vitally important that future work investigating the role of these selection pressures in producing warning‐signal variation incorporates their potential interaction, both with each other and with predators (e.g. temperature and either predator motivation or intraspecific aggression). It seems only rational to predict that such a movement away from the consideration of selection pressures on warning coloration in isolation is likely to result in a better understanding of the complex patterns of signal variation seen in nature.
