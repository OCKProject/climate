 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although predator–prey relationships dominate the study of interspecies interactions, other forms can and do occur. One such example is reproductive interference, i.e. sexual interactions between members of different species (Gröning &amp; Hochkirch, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0133" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0133">2008</a>; Burdfield‐Steel &amp; Shuker, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0047">2011</a>). Since this is, by definition, costly, mate discrimination and avoidance of reproductive interference could constrain warning signals, particularly in cases of mimicry, where effective mimicry could have consequences for mate discrimination (Estrada &amp; Jiggins, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0099" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0099">2008</a>; but see Llaurens, Joron &amp; Théry, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0203" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0203">2014</a>). Thus, the purifying selection on colour and pattern imposed by predators could be counteracted by the costs of sexual or territorial harassment by heterospecifics. While this phenomenon has not been investigated in aposematic species, such harassment has been suggested to play an important role in the maintenance of female colour polymorphisms in odonates (Fincke, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0108" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0108">2004</a>, and references therein). Because avoidance of conspecific harassment has been shown to influence female colour in Batesian mimics (Cook 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0064">1994</a>) this phenomenon may be worthy of further research.
