  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One clear example of a trait that is important for multiple aspects of an organism's fitness is melanisation. Melanin creates the black patterns seen in many of the classic aposematic signals across multiple taxa, from insects to mammals, as well as underlying the structural, iridescent, colours recently shown to act as aposematic signals in many bugs and beetles (Fabricant 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>

   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0105" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0105">2014</a>). The pigment also increases an organism's ability to absorb radiation (Clusella‐Trullas, van Wyk &amp; Spotila, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0061">2007</a>; Hetem 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0149" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0149">2009</a>) providing fitness benefits for individuals in cooler environments through improved thermoregulation (de Jong, Gussekloo &amp; Brakefield, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0166" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0166">1996</a>). However, while increased melanisation provides fitness benefits for aposematic species in some instances (Clusella‐Trullas 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0061">2007</a>; Lindstedt, Lindström &amp; Mappes, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0198" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0198">2009b</a>), it also has associated costs. Melanic pigmentation often forms a key part of aposematic coloration, yet recent evidence suggests the contrast between a signal and its background (dictated by the chromatic component of the signal) as opposed to internal contrast, is the more important determinant of aposematic signal detectability (Arenas, Troscianko &amp; Stevens, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0006">2014</a>). This may help to explain the much higher level of predation risk associated with melanism in aposematic species (Hegna 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0145" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0145">2013</a>; Arenas, Walter &amp; Stevens, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0007">2015</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The trade‐off between the positive/thermoregulatory benefits and negative/predation‐risk costs of melanisation are well explored in aposematic species in relation to temperature (e.g. 
   <span class="italic">Arctia plantaginis</span>; Hegna 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0145" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0145">2013</a>). Variation in temperature is known to contribute to within‐ morph plastic adjustment of the levels of melanism in warning signals, for example spot‐size in ladybirds (Michie 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0243" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0243">2010</a>, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0244" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0244">2011</a>), contributing to continuous variation in signal expression within and among populations. Seasonal fluctuations in temperature and changes in predation (see Section 
   <a rid="brv12460-sec-0006" ref-type="sec" href="#brv12460-sec-0006">IV</a>) likely promote melanism‐based polymorphism within populations of aposematic species. Even when the predation costs associated with the pigment are high, asymmetrical mate preferences, such that more‐melanic individuals have higher mating success, may contribute to the persistence of melanic morphs within populations (Saino 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0322" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0322">2013</a>; Culumber 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0071">2014</a>; Mishra &amp; Omkar, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0246" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0246">2014</a>). The relative abundance of these melanic morphs within a population also increases with the benefits of improved thermoregulation (i.e. decreasing temperature), leading to both altitudinal and latitudinal clines in morph abundance (Clusella‐Trullas 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0061">2007</a>). For example, the proportion of melanic morphs in populations of the two‐spot ladybird (
   <span class="italic">Adalia bipunctata</span>) is greater in higher, and therefore colder, latitudes (Brakefield
   <span class="italic">,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0029">1984</a>) and these clines in morph abundance have been shown to alter in response to climate change (de Jong &amp; Brakefield, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0165" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0165">1998</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Melanin also has benefits associated with ultraviolet (UV) protection (Ortonne, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0273" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0273">2002</a>), immunocompetence (Dubovskiy 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0086" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0086">2013</a>), and desiccation (King &amp; Sinclair, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0177" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0177">2015</a>) and its abundance is plastically adjusted in response to increases in these challenges (Wilson 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0419" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0419">2001</a>; Abram 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>

   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0400" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0400">2015</a>). Variation in these factors may act, like temperature, to enable the persistence of variation in the abundance of melanic morphs across spatial (polytypism) and temporal (polymorphism) scales. The selection landscape determining both the abundance of melanic morphs within aposematic populations and the degree of melanism within morphs themselves will thus consist of multiple competing selection pressures, beyond simply temperature and predation risk.

   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0019">2009</a>), and in many cases specific access to dietary pigments such as carotenoids (Blount 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0018">2012</a>). Experiments in red‐eyed tree frogs (
   <span class="italic">Agalychnis callidryas</span>), a non‐aposematic species, have shown that the amount of carotenoid pigments available at critical times during development influences the redness of their dorsum (Ogilvy, Preziosi &amp; Fidgett, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0268" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0268">2012</a>). Signal expression in aposematic species is therefore likely to be strongly influenced by the availability and quality of food, particularly during early development (Monaghan, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0249" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0249">2008</a>; Blount

   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0019">2009</a>). Research indicates that this most commonly occurs in terms of variation in morph conspicuousness (i.e. saturation and luminance; Blount 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0018">2012</a>) as opposed to the dietary determination of differently coloured morphs observed in the camouflaged caterpillars of numerous lepidoptera species (Greene, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0129" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0129">1989</a>; Fink, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0109" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0109">1995</a>). High‐quality diets during development can lead to the production of larger, brighter, and more colourful warning signals compared to low‐quality diets (Grill &amp; Moore, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0132" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0132">1998</a>; Ojala

   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0197" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0197">2009a</a>). The way that individual foraging areas and populations map onto the landscape of differing resource availability is likely to determine the scale at which the consequent variation in conspicuousness occurs, such as among individuals (continuous within‐morph variation) or among populations, for example along a resource gradient (polytypism). Furthermore, early‐life diet does not always affect warning coloration (Grill &amp; Moore, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0132" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0132">1998</a>; Flores

   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0112" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0112">2013</a>), the relationship between the two is likely complicated by the fact that warning coloration advertises an associated defence (Poulton,

   <span class="italic">The resource‐allocation hypothesis and quantitative honesty</span>
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The nature of the relationship between an aposematic signal and defence is complex and likely to play a role in the way resource availability shapes aposematic signal variation, especially within‐morph variation in conspicuousness. While aposematic species are inherently qualitatively honest, they may not necessarily be quantitatively honest (i.e. show a positive relationship between the level of signal and the level of defence). For example, positive relationships between conspicuousness and toxicity have been identified in a number of species [e.g. ladybird beetles (Bezzerides 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0017">2007</a>; Blount

   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0007">2015</a>) and paper wasps (Vidal‐Cordero 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0409" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0409">2012</a>)]. However, the association is not universally positive, with negative correlations between levels of signal and defence identified across sexes or populations of the same species (Daly &amp; Myers, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0074">1967</a>; Wang, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0411" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0411">2011</a>; Blount 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0018">2012</a>). Furthermore, in some groups it seems that related species can reach approximately equal protection from predators with multiple different signal–toxin strategies (Darst, Cummings &amp; Cannatella, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0076">2006</a>). A number of theories have been proposed to explain these differences (comprehensively reviewed by Summers 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0369" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0369">2015</a>). Research on the availability of resources, those used for coloration and preventing autotoxicity (antioxidants), has provided a feasible mechanism: the ‘resource‐allocation hypothesis’ (Blount 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0019">2009</a>). In this model, coloration and chemical defence both utilise antioxidants which are commonly acquired from the diet. Thus, individuals have to balance investments in the signal and defence, or deal with a trade‐off between investing in the signal or the defence (Blount 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0019">2009</a>). The model predicts that when resources are low individuals will signal honestly, whereas under high resource conditions quantitative honesty would degrade as individuals would preferentially invest in defence over warning coloration. These predictions indicate that the influence of spatial or temporal variation in resource availability upon warning‐signal conspicuousness is unlikely to be consistently linear.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Empirical tests of the resource‐allocation theory are scarce however, and results equivocal in their support, showing that resource variation can lead to both positive and negative relationships between signal and defence (Blount 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0018">2012</a>). The predictions of theoretical models investigating how individuals might invest in each component of an aposematic signal when resources vary also differ, depending on whether the model assumes that individual conspicuousness is an intrinsic component of the defensive signal or can act as a stand‐alone defensive trait (Blount 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0019">2009</a>; Holen &amp; Svennungsen, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0154" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0154">2012</a>; Summers 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0369" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0369">2015</a>). The latter refers to a scenario where the warning coloration alone elicits wariness or acts as a deterrent against predators through its conspicuousness or novelty (Guilford, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0135" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0135">1994</a>). Alternatively, other work has suggested that the honesty of aposematic signals is not mediated by the cost of production, but instead by costs imposed by predators, because predators are able to determine levels of protection rapidly while sampling potential prey (Guilford &amp; Dawkins, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0137" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0137">1995</a>; Hurd &amp; Enquist, 
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0160" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0160">2005</a>). It is therefore clear that whether individuals respond to increased resource availability with a concomitant increase in warning‐signal conspicuousness will depend on the mechanisms of honesty enforcement at work. Further work to clarify the mechanisms determining the honesty of signalling in aposematic species (Summers 
   <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
   <a rid="brv12460-bib-0369" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0369">2015</a>) will therefore aid predictions about how spatial and temporal variation in resources will influence within‐ and between‐population variation in conspicuousness.
