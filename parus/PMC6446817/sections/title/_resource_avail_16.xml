 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The production of warning signals requires adequate resources to deal with the associated cost of signal production, both the overall increase in energy expenditure and the associated oxidative stress burden (McGraw, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0233" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0233">2005</a>; Galván &amp; Alonso‐Alvarez, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0116" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0116">2008</a>; Blount

  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0019">2009</a>), and in many cases specific access to dietary pigments such as carotenoids (Blount 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0018">2012</a>). Experiments in red‐eyed tree frogs (
  <span class="italic">Agalychnis callidryas</span>), a non‐aposematic species, have shown that the amount of carotenoid pigments available at critical times during development influences the redness of their dorsum (Ogilvy, Preziosi &amp; Fidgett, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0268" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0268">2012</a>). Signal expression in aposematic species is therefore likely to be strongly influenced by the availability and quality of food, particularly during early development (Monaghan, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0249" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0249">2008</a>; Blount 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0019">2009</a>). Research indicates that this most commonly occurs in terms of variation in morph conspicuousness (i.e. saturation and luminance; Blount 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0018">2012</a>) as opposed to the dietary determination of differently coloured morphs observed in the camouflaged caterpillars of numerous lepidoptera species (Greene, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0129" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0129">1989</a>; Fink, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0109" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0109">1995</a>). High‐quality diets during development can lead to the production of larger, brighter, and more colourful warning signals compared to low‐quality diets (Grill &amp; Moore, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0132" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0132">1998</a>; Ojala 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0269" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0269">2007</a>; Lindstedt 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0197" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0197">2009a</a>). The way that individual foraging areas and populations map onto the landscape of differing resource availability is likely to determine the scale at which the consequent variation in conspicuousness occurs, such as among individuals (continuous within‐morph variation) or among populations, for example along a resource gradient (polytypism). Furthermore, early‐life diet does not always affect warning coloration (Grill &amp; Moore, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0132" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0132">1998</a>; Flores 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0112" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0112">2013</a>), the relationship between the two is likely complicated by the fact that warning coloration advertises an associated defence (Poulton, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0287" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0287">1890</a>; Summers 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
