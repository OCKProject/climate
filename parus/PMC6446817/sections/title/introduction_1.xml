 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Aposematic prey use warning signals to advertise their defences or unprofitability to potential predators (Poulton, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0287" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0287">1890</a>; Cott, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0067">1940</a>). Since Fritz Müller's (
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0252" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0252">1879</a>) first insights into the dynamics of aposematic species, selection from predators has generally been assumed to favour convergence in warning signals, as this decreases prey mortality during predator avoidance learning (Endler &amp; Greenwood, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0096" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0096">1988</a>; Ruxton, Sherratt &amp; Speed, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0320" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0320">2004</a>; Sherratt, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0340" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0340">2008</a>). Traditional theory holds that aposematic prey benefit from ‘strength in numbers’, as predators should learn an association between a signal and an aversive stimulus more rapidly and more effectively if they encounter it with greater frequency. Conversely, any aberrant forms of the warning signal, deviating from the ‘normative’ pattern (the average pattern or most common morph in the population) should increase mistaken attacks by predators, decreasing the effectiveness and speed of predator learning. Individuals with the ‘normative’ pattern thus benefit from the frequency of that phenotype and incur a reduced predation rate, whereas aberrant individuals do not have this benefit. Therefore, natural selection is thought to disfavour variation in aposematic patterns and favour monomorphism in warning signals (Poulton, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0287" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0287">1890</a>) – a hypothesis supported by many examples from the field (e.g. Mallet &amp; Barton, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0213" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0213">1989</a>; Borer 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0028">2010</a>; Chouteau, Arias &amp; Joron, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0058">2016</a>). As a result, variation in aposematic signals has historically been considered paradoxical.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nevertheless, variation in warning signals is found at several levels, from individual to population and species‐level differences, and recent research has led to a renewed interest in this diversity (Arenas &amp; Stevens, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0005">2017</a>). The degree to which any one aposematic pattern enhances fitness is a product of many different selective pressures, ranging from predator–prey interactions and environmental conditions to trade‐offs with other signal functions (Ojala, Lindström &amp; Mappes, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0269" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0269">2007</a>). In this review, we bring together some of the latest findings of experimental and theoretical work to address the role of these selection pressures, and help resolve the apparent paradox of variation in aposematic phenotypes. While aposematic signallers can utilise multiple modalities (e.g. visual displays, odours, sounds, behaviours), simultaneously or sequentially (Rowe &amp; Halpin, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0309" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0309">2013</a>), visual signals have received the most attention, so we have focused our discussion on variation in colour and pattern in aposematic animals (see examples of aposematic variation in Fig. 
  <a rid="brv12460-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#brv12460-fig-0001">1</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before addressing the processes underpinning variation in warning signals, it is necessary to understand the levels at which it occurs (Fig. 
  <a rid="brv12460-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#brv12460-fig-0002">2</a>). Warning coloration can vary allopatrically between different populations of the same species [e.g. polytypism (Mayr, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0230" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0230">1963</a>)] or sympatrically within populations [e.g. polymorphism (Ruxton 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0320" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0320">2004</a>)]. The conspicuousness of signals, influenced by traits such as luminance and saturation, may also vary continuously among individuals of the same morph, temporally within a single individual across seasons or its life cycle, and among populations across a species' distribution range, forming a cline. Adding further complexity, more than one form of variation can occur simultaneously, and different components of the warning signal, such as size, pattern and hue, can vary independently, according to separate proximate mechanisms. Variation can be genetically determined (i.e. fixed), plastic, or shaped by the interaction of genes and the environment. The harlequin ladybird (
  <span class="italic">Harmonia axyridis</span>) for example, has multiple genetically determined morphs (Komai, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0182" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0182">1956</a>), but the extent of melanism within morphs has been shown to vary with developmental temperature (Knapp &amp; Nedvěd, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0180" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0180">2013</a>). Considerable variation in aposematic signals is most difficult to explain at the intra‐population level, when alternative warning signal phenotypes co‐occur in single location (polymorphism, polyphenism, and continuous variation; Fig. 
  <a rid="brv12460-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#brv12460-fig-0002">2</a>). We have therefore focused our review on making sense of this poorly understood yet remarkably common phenomenon.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here we show how the complex biotic and abiotic environments in which species live give rise to a myriad of different selection pressures, which in turn lead to diversity in warning signals. This provides a general conceptual framework to explain when and why variation in aposematic patterns might exist. We begin by discussing the theory behind warning signal variation, then the demographic and genetic architecture that underpins it, before moving on to consider how variability in predation pressures can favour variation in warning signals, as opposed to monomorphy, even in mimicry systems (see Fig. 
  <a rid="brv12460-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#brv12460-fig-0003">3</a> for mimicry). We then review how the multifunctionality of colour patterns can shape and favour diversity in aposematic signals. Finally, we summarise known cases of signal variation in aposematic species and discuss the taxonomic limitations of our current understanding of the diversity of warning signals. To showcase where and when warning signal variation occurs, and highlight possible systems in need of further study, we compiled a table of aposematic species in which variation has been described in the existing literature (see online Appendix 
  <a rid="brv12460-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#brv12460-supitem-0001">S1</a> and Table 
  <a rid="brv12460-supitem-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#brv12460-supitem-0002">S1</a>). We find examples of warning signal variation in nearly every taxon in which we find aposematism (see online Table 
  <a rid="brv12460-supitem-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#brv12460-supitem-0002">S1</a>), suggesting that variation in warning signals is far more widespread than previously appreciated. Altogether, this review aims to demonstrate that variation in aposematic signalling should no longer be considered paradoxical, a new perspective that stands to advance our understanding of aposematic signalling.
