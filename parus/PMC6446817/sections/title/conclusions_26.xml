 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(1) While predator‐enforced selection on aposematic species appears to favour signal monomorphy in some cases, a growing appreciation of animal sensory systems and of the complexity of predator psychology in particular is challenging the concept of the predator community as a single invariant selective agent.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(2) Investigations of continuous variation or polymorphisms in aposematic species should first assess whether and to what extent the differences between individual signals actually impact predation risk. The perceptual abilities and responses of relevant predators, natural conditions and the microhabitat structure shaping encounter rates between predators and prey are especially important considerations.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(3) Equally as important, a variety of biotic and abiotic selection pressures experienced by aposematic species can contribute to warning signal variation within and among populations, and may potentially act antagonistically or synergistically with predator selection (summary in Table 
  <a rid="brv12460-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" href="#brv12460-tbl-0001">1</a>). Testing the relevance of visual signals to other behaviours, such as mate choice or thermoregulation, as informed by the natural history of the study species, will help piece together a more complex picture of the selective landscape driving signal variation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(4) Moving forward, the field of aposematism should step away from the paradigm that warning signals are entirely determined by a uniform class of predators (generally birds), and instead consider both the strength of selection imposed by predators and alternative selective forces. Future work on aposematic species should adopt a more holistic approach to understanding colour and pattern, applying the tools of behavioural ecology, physiology and genetics to assess the relative power of predation 
  <span class="italic">versus</span> other selective pressures in producing specific phenotypes.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(5) Broadening the taxonomic spread of research on warning signals and focusing on less well‐studied systems, encompassing different types of predators, would also help build a more comprehensive picture of the selective pressures determining variation in aposematism.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(6) Despite an overwhelmingly narrow research focus on predation pressures as the primary determinant of warning coloration, aposematism is affected by a range of forces, of which predation may not necessarily always be the most important. At the outset of this review we asked whether variation in warning coloration is a paradox or if it is the norm. It appears to be both; it is a paradox from the historical perspective that defines aposematic pressures 
  <span class="italic">via</span> purifying selection enforced by predators, and the norm if we consider the empirical data and alternative selective pressures facing these species.
