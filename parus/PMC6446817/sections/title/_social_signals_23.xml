 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If warning signals can be used as signals during mate choice, and there is evidence that they can, they may also play a role in other forms of intraspecific interactions such as male–male competition, dominance and territorial disputes. While there are many studies that show the importance of visual signals in such interactions [see Shreeve, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0345" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0345">1987</a>, Setchell &amp; Wickings, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0333" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0333">2005</a>, López‐Idiáquez 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0204" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0204">2016</a> for examples], few have considered aposematic species. One example comes from work on male–male competition in the frog 
  <span class="italic">O. pumilio</span>; male brightness affected both their own behaviour and the behaviour of other males towards them. Brighter focal males were more likely to approach intruders to their territory, and brighter intruders elicited more calls and approaches than dull ones (Crothers, Gering &amp; Cummings, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0070">2011</a>). This suggests that continuous variation in male brightness may be a conditional signal in this species, and that male–male aggression may play a role in its maintenance within populations.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Intraspecific warning signals may also occur when conspecifics can benefit from signalling their presence to others, and by heeding such signals. This may arise when competition between conspecifics is particularly costly. Possible examples include larval coloration signalling the presence of existing larvae on potential host plants to ovipositing females in order to reduce larval cannibalism in the pipevine swallowtail butterfly 
  <span class="italic">Battus philenor</span> (Papaj &amp; Newsom, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0278" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0278">2005</a>) and bright colours in male damselflies signalling their presence to other males in order to reduce male–male mating attempts during scramble competition (Sherratt &amp; Forbes, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0342" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0342">2001</a>). While intriguing, honest communication of this sort seems unlikely to result in signal polymorphism, as it should also favour a single signal. If however, signals are dishonest, with signallers attempting to deceive the conspecific receivers, then there is the potential for red queen/chase away selection dynamics to unfold, similar to those that may occur during Batesian mimicry. Dishonest intrasexual signalling has been suggested as a potential reason for females displaying male‐like coloration, as this deceives mate‐searching males and reduces male harassment in butterflies (Cook 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0064">1994</a>) and damselflies (Hammers &amp; Van Gossum, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0142" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0142">2008</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As well as increased competition for resources, high conspecific density is linked to increased detectability by predators (Riipi 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0294" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0294">2001</a>). In aposematic species such aggregations actually augment signal strength and thus predator deterrence (Finkbeiner, Briscoe &amp; Reed, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0111" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0111">2012</a>; Rowland, Ruxton &amp; Skelhorn, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0314" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0314">2013</a>), changing the costs and benefits of large conspecific densities. This is reflected in the developmental ‘phase shift’ of the desert locust (
  <span class="italic">Schistocerca gregaria</span>). Coloration in these toxic locusts changes from a cryptic phenotype to an aposematic yellow and black when raised at high conspecific densities (Sword, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0373" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0373">1999</a>). This shift in anti‐predator strategy is a response to the increased likelihood of detection by predators when the cryptic locusts are in large aggregations. Predators learn to associate prey with toxicity more quickly when they are conspicuous rather than cryptic (Sword 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0374" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0374">2000</a>) and the detection costs of warning coloration are diminished by gregariousness (Gamberale &amp; Tullberg, 
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0117" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0117">1998</a>; Riipi 
  <span class="italic">et al.,</span>
  <a rid="brv12460-bib-0294" ref-type="ref" href="#brv12460-bib-0294">2001</a>). Conspecifics can therefore influence not only within‐ but between‐morph variation in aposematic signalling.
