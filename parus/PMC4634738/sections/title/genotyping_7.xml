  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>]. All genetic analyses were carried out at the University of Bielefeld, Germany, as described in [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>]. Sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems 3130 Sequencer (Life Technologies) and genotyping was performed in GENEMARKER (Soft Genetics, USA). We tested for deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) using Monte Carlo simulations in the
