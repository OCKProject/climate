  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.888, 1000 iterations).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mean change in pup body mass from shortly after birth until 3 months of age was 6.01 kg (SD = 1.81 kg) and mean change in pup body length over the same period was 14.59 cm (SD = 5.19 cm). Change in pup body length was greater in the human-impacted colony than in the control colony (GLM: 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 40, estimate = −3.93, SE = 1.54, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.014), but there was no significant difference between sexes (GLM:

  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.056). Change in body mass was greater in male pups than female pups (GLM:

  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.013), but there was no significant difference between colonies (GLM:

  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.083).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For IgG, the first component produced by principal component analyses for each colony was positively correlated with changes in IgG concentration, changes in body mass, and changes in body length (0.93, 0.33, 0.09 and 0.92, 0.33, 0.15 in the human-impacted and control colonies respectively; Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>); and the second component was positively correlated with changes in IgG concentration but negatively correlated with changes in body mass and length (0.34, −0.83, −0.43 and 0.36, −0.91, −0.17 in the human-impacted and control colonies respectively; Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). This demonstrates the separation of variation in IgG into that which is positively correlated with growth through phenotypic correlation, represented by the first principal components, and that which is not, represented by the second principal components. For total leukocyte concentration, the principal component analyses produced a similar pattern to IgG, and for both IgG and total leukocyte concentration, the differences between colonies were minimal (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>; Additional file

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In pups homozoygosity by locus (HL) was negatively associated with the second principal component derived from IgG in the control colony (GLM: estimate = 16.75, SE = 7.58, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.039; Tables 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a> and 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). This principal component was most strongly correlated with changes in body length (−0.91), next with changes in IgG (0.36) and lastly with changes in mass (−0.17; Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The pattern of variation observed with HL suggests that individuals with high levels of heterozygosity grew less but produced more IgG. Sex was included in the statistical models to account for its potentially confounding influence but was never significant as part of an interaction with HL. In juveniles the interaction between HL and sex was not retained in any model, and HL was retained in a single model, in which it was positively correlated with total leukocyte concentration in the human-impacted colony (GLMM: estimate = 5.98, SE = 2.21; likelihood ratio test, LRT: χ
