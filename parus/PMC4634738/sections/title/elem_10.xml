 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study has two main findings: first, two different kinds of immune variation were associated with heterozygosity in a wild mammal; second, the occurrence and nature of these associations varied between ecologically distinct circumstances. The latter allows for the possibility that human impact may influence the relationship between genotype and immune phenotype in this species [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>]. These results – as is necessarily the case with studies of species such as the Galapagos sea lion in the wild – are correlative, and preclude the inference of direct causation. Also, given that the colony on San Cristobal (human-impacted) is unique – as discussed in detail in [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>] – it was not possible to test for interactions between heterozygosity and human-impact on immune variation across a larger sample of colonies. Nevertheless, the results reported here answer a call to incorporate more ecologically relevant variation into the exploration of the impacts of variation in heterozygosity in natural populations [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. In addition, given recent interest in the relationship between variation at immune gene loci and fitness in wild organisms, including in the Galapagos sea lion [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>], the quantification of physiological variation in immunity may prove a valuable tool for understanding the complex mechanisms that give rise to correlations between such immunogenetic variation and fitness.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Physiological measures of immune variation may be condition-dependent [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>], and variation in IgG concentration is correlated with growth in Galapagos sea lion pups [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>]. We partitioned variation in growth and IgG production into principal components to take this co-linearity into account. The majority of Galapagos sea lion pups grow [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>] and produce IgG [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>] during their first three months of life. Given the lack of evidence for infection or disease in the sampled Galapagos sea lion pups (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Supplementary text 1.3–1.4), and a field experiment that showed IgG is not passed from mother to pup during the sampled stage of development in the Galapagos sea lion [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>], the observed IgG production is likely to be driven by post-natal antigen exposure, which stimulates the build-up of protective baseline populations of lymphocytes and antibodies [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Homozygosity weighted by locus (HL) was not associated with the first principal component derived from changes in IgG concentration, body mass and body length. This suggests that heterozygosity may not be straightforwardly related to fitness, as it was not correlated with the axis of variation that most likely describes phenotypic correlation between traits (Tables 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a> and 
   <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>]. The second principal component was negatively correlated with HL, which, given the loadings (Tables 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a> and 
   <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>), suggests that relatively heterozygous individuals grew less but produced more IgG, which is congruent with findings from other systems [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>]. Such a pattern could arise through variation in resource allocation or acquisition between sea lion pups with different levels of heterozygosity [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>]. However, this does not explain why relatively homozygous pups appeared to grow more. The answer to this may lie in the relative magnitude of the length and mass loadings on the two components: there is a small difference between these in the first component (0.33 and 0.15 for length and mass respectively; Tables 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a> and 
   <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>), as we would expect under phenotypic correlation; but length loads more heavily on the second component than mass (−0.91 and −0.17 for length and mass respectively; Tables 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a> and 
   <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>). This suggests that the first component better represents overall growth that is more likely to be positively correlated with fitness, while the second represents elongation, which corresponds to a decrease in body condition [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pups from the human-impacted colony varied less in terms of heterozygosity than pups from the control colony (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Figure S1a-b), so the power to detect an effect may have been lower in the former, which could explain why the above pattern was only observed in the control colony. An alternative explanation is that pups (or mothers) in the human-impacted colony did not vary resource allocation according to heterozygosity in the same way that those in the control colony did. Pups in the human-impacted colony produced more IgG than pups from the control colony during the sampled period of development, which may be due to higher post-natal antigen exposure in the human-impacted colony [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>]. If this is the case, environmental stimulation of IgG production in the human-impacted colony may have over-ridden genetic influence on IgG production, which could obscure the statistical signal of genetic influence on IgG production in the human-impacted colony.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Leukocytes and heterozygosity</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Total leukocyte concentration in mammals is likely to vary over shorter timescales than IgG concentration, and to be more prone to fluctuation, as leukocytes are less cumulative in the blood than antibodies [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>]. In young mammals, though, (including sea lions) total leukocyte concentration changes with age, as cell populations develop during post-natal growth [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>]. Therefore, in pups we used the same principal component analysis approach as we did with IgG. However, heterozygosity was not statistically associated with any of the principal components derived from total leukocyte concentration in pups (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The positive correlation between homozygosity and total leukocyte concentration in juveniles in the human-impacted colony suggests that low within individual genetic diversity may be associated with an increase in the number of circulating leukocytes, under certain ecological circumstances. Total leukocyte concentration in juveniles is more likely to represent mature immune system activity than early-developmental leukocyte production, given that the latter happens during only a short period following birth in pinnipeds [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>]. Low heterozygosity has been associated with increased susceptibility to parasitism [

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>], in these juvenile sea lions, which could have led to relatively high infection rates, e.g. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>]. This may have been observed only in the human-impacted colony as this is where infection risk is likely to be relatively high, given the threat of pathogen exposure [

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>]; an effect that may be compounded by relatively high stress and pollution levels in the human-impacted colony [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Heterozygosity and inbreeding</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A general assumption of heterozygosity-fitness-correlation (HFC) studies is that phenotypic variation is linearly related to fitness and therefore under directional selection [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. Immune variables such as IgG concentration are unlikely to be so, due to the damage caused by immunopathology and other trade-offs involving immunity [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>]; moreover, different kinds of antibody responses have been shown to be under different kinds of selection: in blue tits (
   <span class="italic">Parus caeruleus</span>) “…primary responsiveness to diphtheria was subject to stabilizing selection, whereas secondary responsiveness to tetanus was subject to positive directional selection” [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>]. Correlations between such traits and heterozygosity are nonetheless useful, as when, and under what ecological circumstances, they are detectable can offer insight into their mechanisms [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. Immune traits are unlikely to be influenced by as many genes as complex composite traits such as survival and lifetime reproductive success (to which they contribute), and therefore may be more amenable to a candidate gene approach to the investigation of HFC mechanisms, e.g. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>]. However, this also implies that immune traits are less likely to be influenced by genome-wide inbreeding [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>], which raises the question of whether heterozygosity is acting as a proxy for inbreeding in the Galapagos sea lion.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>]. If the correlations between heterozygosity and immune variation described here are not due to inbreeding, it is possible they are the result of the other widely suggested explanation for HFCs: linkage between one or a few presumed-neutral markers to functional genes under balancing selection [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]. A variety of statistical approaches have been proposed to identify heterogeneities in the contributions of loci to HFCs [

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>]. In addition, unbalanced contributions of one or a few loci to HFCs are implicit in inbreeding theory, as weak inbreeding is not expected to lead to detectable identity disequilibrium [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>]. Therefore, an absence of identity disequilibrium (or other equivalent measure of correlation of heterozygosity across loci) does not preclude the presence of weak inbreeding [
