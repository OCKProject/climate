 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Associations between indices of multi-locus heterozygosity and many fitness-related traits, from birth weight [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>] to song complexity [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>], have been reported in wild animal populations [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. Heterozygosity is of interest because it quantifies within individual genetic diversity, and is likely to be related to inbreeding in some way – although in exactly which way is contentious. Inbreeding has been known to have deleterious effects on fitness for a long time [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>], and these effects have been well documented in captive, laboratory and domesticated animals [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>]. Historically, the occurrence of inbreeding depression in natural populations was disputed, as evidence was scarcer from the wild than other contexts. It is now thought that this is likely to have been due to detection difficulties [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>], and that inbreeding can affect fitness in natural settings [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>]. The consequences of inbreeding in the wild are of particular interest to biologists working to conserve declining populations or threatened species [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>]. Reduced genetic diversity may interact with extrinsic stressors, such as disease, to influence population dynamics [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>]. Moreover, the extent to which the effects of reduced genetic diversity vary across ecological contexts within species has been relatively poorly explored.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An obstacle to the study of inbreeding in the wild is that there is no problem-free way to estimate levels of inbreeding in a population about which we have incomplete information. For example, the estimation of inbreeding coefficients from pedigrees is complicated by the assumption that founding individuals are outbred and unrelated [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>], by the difficulty of accounting for the chance events of Mendelian segregation [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>], and by the rarity of multi-generation pedigrees for natural populations [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>]. An alternative to calculation from pedigrees is to use data from neutral genetic markers to either summarise genetic diversity as multi-locus heterozygosity (MLH), or to estimate inbreeding coefficients directly using relatedness algorithms, as a proxy for inbreeding value. These latter methods have the advantage of being calculable for individuals sampled from a single cohort, and are therefore feasible in many study systems, especially given recent advances in sequencing technology and the availability of resources for the study of genetics.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, whether indices of MLH calculated using small numbers of loci represent variation across the genome well enough for inbreeding depression to be invoked as the cause of heterozygosity-fitness correlations (HFCs) is unresolved [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>]. Empirical comparisons in populations for which both pedigrees and marker data are available have shown that pedigree-derived inbreeding estimates and indices of MLH are not well correlated, especially when the mean and variance of inbreeding value are low [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>]. However, whether this suggests that MLH indices are less accurate than pedigree-derived estimates or that both are inaccurate in different ways is unknown [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An alternative explanation of HFCs to inbreeding depression is that of linkage between one or a few neutral markers and functional genes under balancing selection, which could give rise to the frequently observed pattern of heterosis [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>]. A reappraisal noted, however, that the uneven contribution of loci to HFCs is implicit in inbreeding theory [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>], as weak inbreeding is not expected to lead to detectable identity disequilibrium [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>]. Therefore, the effects of weak inbreeding may be present even if heterozygosity is not correlated across loci – an observation that has previously been used to rule out the presence of inbreeding – and the finding that HFCs are driven by variation at one or a few loci does not preclude weak inbreeding as their underlying cause. In addition, the frequentist statistical tests that have been used to identify single-locus contributions to HFCs suffer from problems of power [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>] and non-independence [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To date, variation in the detection and strength of HFCs has largely been attributed to methodology, and there is consensus that increases in numbers of samples and markers will help delineate the mechanisms that give rise to HFCs [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]. Another way in which HFC studies are working towards this same goal is through the inclusion of ecological heterogeneity in their study designs [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. This approach co-opts natural variation in the expression of the consequences of inbreeding, for example, through episodic heterozygote advantage [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>] or the effects of environmental stress [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>], to further understanding of the mechanisms that drive them in natural settings. This study takes such an approach, by examining the relationships between heterozygosity, growth, body condition and immune variation in the Galapagos sea lion.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Galapagos sea lion (
  <span class="italic">Zalophus wollebaeki</span>) is endemic to the Galapagos archipelago and has an estimated population size of 20,000–40,000 animals [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>], which is spatially and genetically structured amongst small colonies (20–500 animals) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>]. It has a polygynous mating system [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>] and is philopatric [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" href="#CR80">80</a>]. Under these conditions we might expect the inevitable imprecision of marker-based inbreeding estimates to be minimised, as these are both traits that limit the degree to which alleles are mixed within populations, and may therefore promote the necessary variation in heterozygosity required for the statistical detection of underlying patterns [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Growth and condition have been empirically linked with survival probability and reproductive success in many taxa [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>], including marine mammals [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>]. These are likely to be important components of fitness in the Galapagos sea lion as they are related to reproduction, but also because they are related to the ability to resist starvation, which is important in an ecosystem in which fluctuations in marine productivity are driven by unpredictable environmental variation [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>]. The concentration of the most common class of circulating mammalian antibody, Immunoglobulin G (IgG), has been linked to survival probability in the grey seal (
  <span class="italic">Halichoerus grypus</span>) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>], and the capacity to regulate immunity effectively may be an important determinant of Galapagos sea lion fitness given disease risk concerns [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>]. In addition, a recent study reported a link between diversity at an immune gene locus (MHC-DRB) and fitness in the Galapagos sea lion [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>]. The data presented here complement this immunogenetic approach, through the inclusion of phenotypic variation in immunity.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The many influences on immune activity in natural populations mean that phenotypic measures of immune variation are unlikely to be related to fitness in straightforward ways [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>]. In this study we make use of a previously described longitudinal dataset and sample archive on immune variation in the Galapagos sea lion [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>] to take within individual variation, and covariation with other aspects of life history, into account. This previous work describes immune variation in the context of growth and development over the first two years of life in the Galapagos sea lion [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>]. Here we build on this by testing for relationships between heterozygosity and immune activity while controlling for the potentially confounding influences of growth, body condition and age class in two breeding colonies, one located in a town and subject to high levels of anthropogenic environmental impact, and the other in a relatively undisturbed habitat [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>].
