 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A general assumption of heterozygosity-fitness-correlation (HFC) studies is that phenotypic variation is linearly related to fitness and therefore under directional selection [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. Immune variables such as IgG concentration are unlikely to be so, due to the damage caused by immunopathology and other trade-offs involving immunity [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>]; moreover, different kinds of antibody responses have been shown to be under different kinds of selection: in blue tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus caeruleus</span>) “…primary responsiveness to diphtheria was subject to stabilizing selection, whereas secondary responsiveness to tetanus was subject to positive directional selection” [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>]. Correlations between such traits and heterozygosity are nonetheless useful, as when, and under what ecological circumstances, they are detectable can offer insight into their mechanisms [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. Immune traits are unlikely to be influenced by as many genes as complex composite traits such as survival and lifetime reproductive success (to which they contribute), and therefore may be more amenable to a candidate gene approach to the investigation of HFC mechanisms, e.g. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>]. However, this also implies that immune traits are less likely to be influenced by genome-wide inbreeding [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>], which raises the question of whether heterozygosity is acting as a proxy for inbreeding in the Galapagos sea lion.

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>]. This suggests an absence of inbreeding (but see [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>]) in the Galapagos sea lion, which agrees with other assessments using different proxies for inbreeding in the Galapagos sea lion [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>]. If the correlations between heterozygosity and immune variation described here are not due to inbreeding, it is possible they are the result of the other widely suggested explanation for HFCs: linkage between one or a few presumed-neutral markers to functional genes under balancing selection [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]. A variety of statistical approaches have been proposed to identify heterogeneities in the contributions of loci to HFCs [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">65</a>], but problems of power and non-independence mean their results are difficult to assess [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>]. In addition, unbalanced contributions of one or a few loci to HFCs are implicit in inbreeding theory, as weak inbreeding is not expected to lead to detectable identity disequilibrium [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>]. Therefore, an absence of identity disequilibrium (or other equivalent measure of correlation of heterozygosity across loci) does not preclude the presence of weak inbreeding [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>].
