 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Total leukocyte concentration in mammals is likely to vary over shorter timescales than IgG concentration, and to be more prone to fluctuation, as leukocytes are less cumulative in the blood than antibodies [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>]. In young mammals, though, (including sea lions) total leukocyte concentration changes with age, as cell populations develop during post-natal growth [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>]. Therefore, in pups we used the same principal component analysis approach as we did with IgG. However, heterozygosity was not statistically associated with any of the principal components derived from total leukocyte concentration in pups (TableÂ 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The positive correlation between homozygosity and total leukocyte concentration in juveniles in the human-impacted colony suggests that low within individual genetic diversity may be associated with an increase in the number of circulating leukocytes, under certain ecological circumstances. Total leukocyte concentration in juveniles is more likely to represent mature immune system activity than early-developmental leukocyte production, given that the latter happens during only a short period following birth in pinnipeds [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>]. Low heterozygosity has been associated with increased susceptibility to parasitism [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>], so may have compromised aspects of innate immunity, e.g. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>], in these juvenile sea lions, which could have led to relatively high infection rates, e.g. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>]. This may have been observed only in the human-impacted colony as this is where infection risk is likely to be relatively high, given the threat of pathogen exposure [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>]; an effect that may be compounded by relatively high stress and pollution levels in the human-impacted colony [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>].
