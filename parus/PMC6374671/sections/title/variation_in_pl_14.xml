 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found individual‐based variation in female common eiders in plasma MLA across breeding stages (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34873-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34873-fig-0001">1</a>a,b). To date only been a handful of studies that have examined natural variation in this trait, including in thin‐billed prion chicks (Quillfeldt et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0035">2009</a>, ~1.7–2.9 ng/ml), domestic Thai chickens (
  <span class="italic">Gallus domesticus</span>) across the reproductive period (Ngernsoungnern et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0030">2012</a>, ~0.05–1.15 ng/ml), and European starlings within and across life history stages (~10–32 ng/ml, Kordonowy et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0022">2010</a>). We found that common eiders have a range of plasma MLA values (2–15 ng/ml, this study) more similar to those of European starlings, likely because these are wild individuals not selected for growth rate, unlike domesticated species (Lõhmus et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0027">2006</a>; Ngernsoungnern et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0030">2012</a>) in which the selective forces driving foraging are more relaxed. Further, the eiders in this study were in adult life history stages likely under different energetic requirements than thin‐billed prion chicks, highlighting the context‐dependent nature of interpreting variation in plasma MLA within and across species.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although plasma MLA in 
  <span class="italic">domestic, agricultural</span> avian species has been linked to endogenous fat stores and body mass (Lõhmus &amp; Sundström, 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0025">2004</a>; Lõhmus et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0027">2006</a>, we found that in pre‐recruiting and RFG eider females, body mass, and plasma MLA were not correlated. This is consistent with findings in other 
  <span class="italic">wild </span>avian species (Kordonowy et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0022">2010</a>; Quillfeldt et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0035">2009</a>) which often report that plasma MLA levels are often disassociated with body mass in life history stages that require fattening (e.g., migration: Townsend, Kunz, &amp; Widmaier, 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0051">2008</a>; Gogga, Karbowska, Kochan, &amp; Meissner, 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0014">2013</a>). Considering that pre‐laying common eiders are in a life history stage in which they must obtain a substantial amount of endogenous fat resources quickly, plasma MLA levels may therefore be disassociated with body mass, thus explaining the lack of both correlation and interactive effects in all of our analyses. Interestingly, despite the lack of association between plasma MLA and body mass, plasma MLA could significantly predict reproductive decisions of pre‐recruiting and RFG females.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, plasma MLA was higher in non‐breeding and pre‐recruiting females compared to RFG females. Previous research in common eiders has shown that physiological fattening rates (measured though triglycerides) follow similar patterns with females in RFG having lower physiological fattening (Hennin et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0016">2015</a>). Overall, females eiders thus have lower plasma MLA (this study) and physiological fattening during the RFG period compared to the pre‐recruiting period despite the energetic demands of growing follicles (Hennin et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0016">2015</a>). Since female eiders need to achieve a minimum body mass to initiate follicle growth (Descamps et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0008">2011</a>; Sénéchal et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0040">2011</a>), and all RFG females should have achieved this threshold body mass, the reduction in plasma MLA during the RFG period may represent the change in females from rapid and timely somatic fattening, toward more minimal foraging to top up resources available for follicle growth without impacting body condition. Pre‐recruiting females captured shortly after their arrival on the breeding grounds may thus have high plasma MLA because they are depositing significant fat stores to recover from migration and prepare for reproduction.
