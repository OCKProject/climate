 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The gene sequence used to raise antibodies to quantify MLA in the current study was based on a mammalian sequence (Raver et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0036">1998</a>; Taouis et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0049">1998</a>), and therefore not representative of the actual avian leptin sequence (Seroussi et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0041">2016</a>), but rather a mammalian leptin analogue in an avian species. To identify what our assay may have been measuring, we ran a BLAST (basic local alignment search tool; Altschul, Gish, Miller, Myers, &amp; Lipman, 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0002">1990</a>) of the known mammalian leptin gene sequence open to all known avian genome sequences. Specifically, we ran both a BLASTx and BLASTn to identify possibly proteins and nucleotide sequences, respectively. We also ran a BLASTx and BLASTn of the known mammalian‚Äêbased primers used to raise our antibodies for our assays against all known avian genome sequences. In both instances, we found no supported matches within the current sequenced avian genome and cannot currently report an official name and function for this quantified trait.
