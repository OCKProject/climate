 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">DISCUSSION</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Currently, little is known about plasma mammalian leptin analogue (MLA) in avian species (Cerasale et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0006">2011</a>; Kordonowy et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0022">2010</a>; Quillfeldt et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0035">2009</a>), and to date, no studies have examined how variation in plasma MLA relates to reproductive decisions, investment, or reproductive success in wild birds. We demonstrate that plasma MLA differs among years and reproductive stages in arctic‐nesting common eiders, and present the first evidence that plasma MLA significantly predicts variation in reproductive phenology in pre‐laying females. Consistent with our predictions, we show that birds with higher pre‐laying MLA delayed the start of breeding (longer delays before laying and later lay dates). However, plasma MLA did not predict breeding propensity, clutch size, or reproductive success. This was surprising considering how important the timely acquisition of fat stores is to common eiders prior to reproducing, with impacts on reproductive investment and reproductive success (Bêty et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0003">2003</a>; Descamps et al.,

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Variation in plasma mammalian leptin analogue</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found individual‐based variation in female common eiders in plasma MLA across breeding stages (Figure 
   <a rid="ece34873-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34873-fig-0001">1</a>a,b). To date only been a handful of studies that have examined natural variation in this trait, including in thin‐billed prion chicks (Quillfeldt et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0035">2009</a>, ~1.7–2.9 ng/ml), domestic Thai chickens (
   <span class="italic">Gallus domesticus</span>) across the reproductive period (Ngernsoungnern et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0030">2012</a>, ~0.05–1.15 ng/ml), and European starlings within and across life history stages (~10–32 ng/ml, Kordonowy et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0022">2010</a>). We found that common eiders have a range of plasma MLA values (2–15 ng/ml, this study) more similar to those of European starlings, likely because these are wild individuals not selected for growth rate, unlike domesticated species (Lõhmus et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0027">2006</a>; Ngernsoungnern et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0030">2012</a>) in which the selective forces driving foraging are more relaxed. Further, the eiders in this study were in adult life history stages likely under different energetic requirements than thin‐billed prion chicks, highlighting the context‐dependent nature of interpreting variation in plasma MLA within and across species.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although plasma MLA in 
   <span class="italic">domestic, agricultural</span> avian species has been linked to endogenous fat stores and body mass (Lõhmus &amp; Sundström, 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0025">2004</a>; Lõhmus et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0027">2006</a>, we found that in pre‐recruiting and RFG eider females, body mass, and plasma MLA were not correlated. This is consistent with findings in other 
   <span class="italic">wild </span>avian species (Kordonowy et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0022">2010</a>; Quillfeldt et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0035">2009</a>) which often report that plasma MLA levels are often disassociated with body mass in life history stages that require fattening (e.g., migration: Townsend, Kunz, &amp; Widmaier, 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0051">2008</a>; Gogga, Karbowska, Kochan, &amp; Meissner, 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0014">2013</a>). Considering that pre‐laying common eiders are in a life history stage in which they must obtain a substantial amount of endogenous fat resources quickly, plasma MLA levels may therefore be disassociated with body mass, thus explaining the lack of both correlation and interactive effects in all of our analyses. Interestingly, despite the lack of association between plasma MLA and body mass, plasma MLA could significantly predict reproductive decisions of pre‐recruiting and RFG females.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, plasma MLA was higher in non‐breeding and pre‐recruiting females compared to RFG females. Previous research in common eiders has shown that physiological fattening rates (measured though triglycerides) follow similar patterns with females in RFG having lower physiological fattening (Hennin et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0016">2015</a>). Overall, females eiders thus have lower plasma MLA (this study) and physiological fattening during the RFG period compared to the pre‐recruiting period despite the energetic demands of growing follicles (Hennin et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0016">2015</a>). Since female eiders need to achieve a minimum body mass to initiate follicle growth (Descamps et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0008">2011</a>; Sénéchal et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0040">2011</a>), and all RFG females should have achieved this threshold body mass, the reduction in plasma MLA during the RFG period may represent the change in females from rapid and timely somatic fattening, toward more minimal foraging to top up resources available for follicle growth without impacting body condition. Pre‐recruiting females captured shortly after their arrival on the breeding grounds may thus have high plasma MLA because they are depositing significant fat stores to recover from migration and prepare for reproduction.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Influence of plasma mammalian leptin analogue on reproductive parameters</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In both pre‐recruiting and RFG females, individuals with higher plasma MLA had longer delays before laying once on the breeding grounds (i.e., longer time interval between arrival and laying date) and had later laying dates. This occurred despite the lack of association between body mass and plasma MLA, potentially indicating that there may be other indirect impacts of plasma MLA on energetics and energetic management besides direct impacts on body mass. In avian species, experimental manipulations of plasma MLA, using mammalian leptin, have been shown to reduce foraging behaviors (Lõhmus &amp; Sundström, 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0025">2004</a>; Lõhmus et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0026">2003</a>, 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0027">2006</a>). Further, in wild‐breeding great tits (
   <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) females administered mammalian leptin had a higher likelihood of investing in a second brood (Lõhmus and Bjorklund, 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0024">2009</a>, 
   <span class="italic">but see</span> te Marvelde &amp; Visser, 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0050">2012</a>). If plasma MLA provides a signal of condition or endogenous fat stores and negatively influences foraging (Lõhmus &amp; Sundström, 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0025">2004</a>; Lõhmus et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0026">2003</a>, 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0027">2006</a>), female eiders with high plasma MLA may have reduced foraging behavior, take longer to gain in condition for reproduction, and therefore lay later in the breeding season. Considering that plasma MLA influences the functioning of cultured ovarian cells (Sirotkin &amp; Grossmann, 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0044">2007</a>), advances the onset of puberty in chicken (Paczoska‐Eliasiewicz et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0032">2006</a>), and affects reproduction (Lõhmus and Bjorklund, 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0024">2009</a>, this study), plasma MLA may be an important trait mediating life history decisions and potentially trade‐offs.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, if high concentrations of plasma MLA indicate high endogenous fat stores then it seems counterintuitive that female eiders with higher concentrations of plasma MLA delayed laying for a longer period of time and laying later in the breeding season, rather than earlier. Although mammalian leptin has an endocrine function, true avian leptin has been found to fit more so within autocrine/paracrine function (Seroussi et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0041">2016</a>). It may be that plasma MLA may have a similar autocrine/paracrine function as in avian leptin, thus explaining its disassociation with body mass, and the inverse relationships between plasma MLA concentrations and reproductive phenology. Regardless, as in other physiological traits (Williams, 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0053">2008</a>), there is still a substantial amount of diversity in the inherent ability of individuals to produce plasma MLA (Quillfeldt et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0035">2009</a>; Kordonowy et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0022">2010</a>, this study), and likely variation in individual sensitivity to the trait. Furthermore, although receptors for this trait have been identified in multiple avian tissues (Ohkubo et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0031">2007</a>; Paczoska‐Eliasiewicz et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0032">2006</a>; Taoius et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0048">2001</a>), the variation in receptor densities across tissues seasonally has yet to be documented. Research in other hormones suggests seasonal variation in receptor density is probable (e.g., androgens and estrogens: Fusani, Van't Hof, Hutchinson, &amp; Gahr, 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0012">2000</a>, corticosterone: Breuner &amp; Orchinik, 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0005">2001</a>), and therefore a likely contributing factor to individual and species variation in plasma MLA. Since plasma MLA appears to be related to energetics and energetic management, it is possible that some of this variability is also generated from environmental factors such as food availability (Schradin et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0039">2014</a>) or types of food consumed (Frederich et al., 1995), as is the case with leptin in mammalian species.
