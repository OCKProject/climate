  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study colony is located at Mitivik Island (64°02′N, 81°47′W), a small, low‐lying island in a shallow productive bay in Nunavut, Canada. In 2006 and 2007, common eider females were captured opportunistically (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 377) using flight nets from mid‐June to early July. This period of time coincides with the timing of arrival on the breeding grounds and the pre‐laying period (Descamps et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0008">2011</a>; Hennin et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0016">2015</a>; Jean‐Gagnon et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0018">2018</a>), making the timing of capture our best estimate of individual arrival date at the breeding grounds (Descamps et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0008">2011</a>). Within 3 min of capture, females were blood sampled from the tarsal vein with a 1 ml heparinized syringe and 23 G thin wall, 0.5‐inch needle. Samples were transferred to a heparinized eppendorf tube, kept cool and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min within 4 hr of collection. The plasma was siphoned off and stored separately from the red blood cells at −80°C until further analysis.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After blood sampling, females were banded, weighed (g), and given a unique combination of shaped and colored nasal tags attached using UV degradable filament, followed by release. These nasal tags fall off at the end of the season, but allow us to easily track individuals through their reproductive period using spotting scopes from one of seven permanent blinds located around the periphery of the island. Twice daily, trained observers would scan the colony for nasal‐tagged females from seven permanent blinds with one blind dedicated solely to the searching and tracking of nasal‐tagged females specifically, and record nesting behaviors to accurately determine laying date and assess breeding stages of females. Once a female began laying, she was monitored twice daily to track incubation and reproductive success. We confirmed clutch sizes for females by crawling into the colony in transects across it to check individual nests. Since these checks generate significant disturbance, often resulting in the predation of focal common eider nests by nesting pairs of herring gulls (
   <span class="italic">Larus argentatus</span>) on the island, we recorded clutch sizes of focal females opportunistically. Therefore, we obtained clutch size for many birds (Table 
   <a rid="ece34873-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" href="#ece34873-tbl-0001">1</a>), but our analyses for clutch size nonetheless include fewer females than other reproductive metrics.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Assay for mammalian leptin analogue</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Assays for plasma mammalian leptin analogue were conducted in 2007 at the United States Department of Agriculture Laboratories (USDA‐Beltsville, MD, USA) by in‐house radioimmunoassay in tandem with samples from and following the methodologies outlined in Kordonowy et al. (
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0022">2010</a>). Briefly, putative recombinant chicken leptin (rcleptin) was provided by A. Gertler (Raver et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0036">1998</a>) and iodinated to a specific activity of 50 Ci/g, and then stored at −80°C until further use (Kordonowy et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0022">2010</a>). The primary antibody, rabbit anti‐rcleptin (Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, TX) and second antibody, a sheep anti‐rabbit gamma globulin (Linco, Inc., St. Charles, MO) were both commercially available. Both primary and secondary antibodies were diluted using sodium phosphate buffer (0.05 M phosphosaline, pH 7.4) containing 0.025 M EDTA plus 0.05% Triton X‐100 (Sigma Chemical Co.) to a 1:1,600 and a 1:10 dilution, respectively. Plasma samples and radio‐labeled rcleptin (6000 c.p.m. I‐125‐labeled rcleptin; tracer) were diluted in 1% BSA phosphate buffer. These assays were run under nonequilibrium conditions.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the first day of the assay, 100 μl of RIA diluent were added to a plastic tube, along with either 100 μl of standard or plasma, then vortexed and left overnight at 4°C. The following day, 100 μl of tracer was added to each tube and incubated at 4°C overnight once more. On the third day, 100 μl of the second antibody and carrier (normal rabbit serum, Linco, Inc., St. Charles, MO; 1:200 dilution in phosphate buffer) each were added to every tube, vortexed, and incubated at 4°C overnight a final time. On the final day of the assay, all tubes but the total count tubes were centrifuged at 2,500 rpm, the supernatant was aspirated and the remaining pellet was counted in a gamma counter. The RIA data reductions used log/logit transformations. The displacement curve using this assay method in wild birds has been tested previously and shown to be parallel to the standard curve with a sensitivity of 300 pg/tube and 96.1% recovery rate (Kordonowy et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0022">2010</a>). Due to the plasma volume required for this assay (~125 μl), we were only able to assay single samples and therefore could not calculate the amount of variation within a plate. However, the same assay conducted at this same institution has previously demonstrated low intra‐assay (3.2%) and inter‐assay coefficients of variation (5.1%; Kordonowy et al.,

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The gene sequence used to raise antibodies to quantify MLA in the current study was based on a mammalian sequence (Raver et al.,

   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0041">2016</a>), but rather a mammalian leptin analogue in an avian species. To identify what our assay may have been measuring, we ran a BLAST (basic local alignment search tool; Altschul, Gish, Miller, Myers, &amp; Lipman, 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0002">1990</a>) of the known mammalian leptin gene sequence open to all known avian genome sequences. Specifically, we ran both a BLASTx and BLASTn to identify possibly proteins and nucleotide sequences, respectively. We also ran a BLASTx and BLASTn of the known mammalian‐based primers used to raise our antibodies for our assays against all known avian genome sequences. In both instances, we found no supported matches within the current sequenced avian genome and cannot currently report an official name and function for this quantified trait.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since different breeding stages have differing energetic demands (Hennin et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0016">2015</a>; Sénéchal et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0040">2011</a>), which may influence the relationship between plasma MLA and reproductive parameters, we first split individuals into three categories for analyses (Hennin et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0015">2016</a>, 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0016">2015</a>). Females that were captured, but never detected as a breeder (i.e., not resighted on a nest) that year at the colony were considered non‐breeders (Jean‐Gagnon et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0018">2018</a>). Given that common eiders are philopatric and colonial nesters, and that this colony is the only one that is within 200 km (Jean‐Gagnon et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0018">2018</a>), it is unlikely that females were misclassified as non‐breeders and instead nested elsewhere. Breeding individuals were subsequently split into two breeding stages based on the number of days between capture and laying. Females were categorized as

   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0054">2004</a>) if they were 1–7 days away from laying at capture (Hennin et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0016">2015</a>). These categories are based on the average duration of follicle growth in common eiders (approx. 6 days, Alisauskas &amp; Ankney, 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0001">1992</a>) plus an additional 28 hr required to lay an egg (Watson, Robertson, &amp; Cooke, 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0052">1993</a>). There were no instances of recapturing individuals and therefore there are no repeated samples from individuals.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous research at this colony has shown that correcting for body size only enhances our ability to explain variation in body condition by roughly 3%, therefore body mass on its own is an accurate measure of body condition (Descamps et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0008">2011</a>). Rather than analyze ordinal dates for arrival and laying, we use relative dates (individual arrival or lay date relative to the median of the colony for each year; Lepage et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0023">2000</a>) to help control for additional annual variation that may be attributable to environmental variation (i.e., two extreme years in terms of weather, ice break‐up, resource availability) and better focus the analysis on individual‐based differences. To test for differences in body mass and plasma MLA across breeding stages and years, we ran a two‐way ANOVA for each variable including year, breeding stage, and a year by breeding stage interaction, followed by Tukey post hoc tests with a Bonferroni correction. We then tested for correlations between body mass and plasma MLA within each of the three breeding stages with a Bonferroni correction. We analyzed our reproductive parameters using either general linear models (relative lay date, delay before laying) or generalized linear models (clutch size, reproductive success) depending on our dependent variables. In the analyses for the delay before laying and relative laying date, plasma MLA, year, body mass, and relative capture date were included as fixed effects. For clutch size and reproductive success analyses, we included the same fixed effects, but exchanged relative capture date for relative laying date due to the known influence of laying date on both clutch size and reproductive success (Descamps et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0008">2011</a>). We tested for the interaction between body mass and plasma MLA given that plasma MLA is related to foraging and fattening (Lõhmus et al., 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0026">2003</a>, 
   <a rid="ece34873-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0027">2006</a>); however, in all analyses this interaction was nonsignificant and it was therefore removed. Breeding propensity analyses included only non‐breeding and pre‐recruiting females because females in RFG were already committed to laying. All samples were independent of each other. Although we attempted to collect as many variables from each female as possible, we were unable to obtain every variable from every female, therefore making our sample sizes across analyses variable. As such, each reproductive analysis required a different subset of individuals, making each data set unique and unaffected by issues of multiple testing. All results are reported as means ± 
   <span class="italic">SEM</span> unless otherwise stated. Our analyses were run in JMP 12.0.1.
