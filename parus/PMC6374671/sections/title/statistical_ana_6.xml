 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since different breeding stages have differing energetic demands (Hennin et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0016">2015</a>; Sénéchal et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0040">2011</a>), which may influence the relationship between plasma MLA and reproductive parameters, we first split individuals into three categories for analyses (Hennin et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0015">2016</a>, 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0016">2015</a>). Females that were captured, but never detected as a breeder (i.e., not resighted on a nest) that year at the colony were considered non‐breeders (Jean‐Gagnon et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0018">2018</a>). Given that common eiders are philopatric and colonial nesters, and that this colony is the only one that is within 200 km (Jean‐Gagnon et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0018">2018</a>), it is unlikely that females were misclassified as non‐breeders and instead nested elsewhere. Breeding individuals were subsequently split into two breeding stages based on the number of days between capture and laying. Females were categorized as 
  <span class="italic">pre‐recruiting</span> (i.e., not yet growing follicles for laying) if they were 8 days or longer away from laying when captured, or were categorized as 
  <span class="italic">rapid follicle growth</span> (
  <span class="italic">RFG</span>, i.e., quickly growing follicles in preparation for laying, Williams, Kitaysky, &amp; Vézina, 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0054">2004</a>) if they were 1–7 days away from laying at capture (Hennin et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0016">2015</a>). These categories are based on the average duration of follicle growth in common eiders (approx. 6 days, Alisauskas &amp; Ankney, 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0001">1992</a>) plus an additional 28 hr required to lay an egg (Watson, Robertson, &amp; Cooke, 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0052">1993</a>). There were no instances of recapturing individuals and therefore there are no repeated samples from individuals.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous research at this colony has shown that correcting for body size only enhances our ability to explain variation in body condition by roughly 3%, therefore body mass on its own is an accurate measure of body condition (Descamps et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0008">2011</a>). Rather than analyze ordinal dates for arrival and laying, we use relative dates (individual arrival or lay date relative to the median of the colony for each year; Lepage et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0023">2000</a>) to help control for additional annual variation that may be attributable to environmental variation (i.e., two extreme years in terms of weather, ice break‐up, resource availability) and better focus the analysis on individual‐based differences. To test for differences in body mass and plasma MLA across breeding stages and years, we ran a two‐way ANOVA for each variable including year, breeding stage, and a year by breeding stage interaction, followed by Tukey post hoc tests with a Bonferroni correction. We then tested for correlations between body mass and plasma MLA within each of the three breeding stages with a Bonferroni correction. We analyzed our reproductive parameters using either general linear models (relative lay date, delay before laying) or generalized linear models (clutch size, reproductive success) depending on our dependent variables. In the analyses for the delay before laying and relative laying date, plasma MLA, year, body mass, and relative capture date were included as fixed effects. For clutch size and reproductive success analyses, we included the same fixed effects, but exchanged relative capture date for relative laying date due to the known influence of laying date on both clutch size and reproductive success (Descamps et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0008">2011</a>). We tested for the interaction between body mass and plasma MLA given that plasma MLA is related to foraging and fattening (Lõhmus et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0026">2003</a>, 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0027">2006</a>); however, in all analyses this interaction was nonsignificant and it was therefore removed. Breeding propensity analyses included only non‐breeding and pre‐recruiting females because females in RFG were already committed to laying. All samples were independent of each other. Although we attempted to collect as many variables from each female as possible, we were unable to obtain every variable from every female, therefore making our sample sizes across analyses variable. As such, each reproductive analysis required a different subset of individuals, making each data set unique and unaffected by issues of multiple testing. All results are reported as means ± 
  <span class="italic">SEM</span> unless otherwise stated. Our analyses were run in JMP 12.0.1.
