 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Influence of plasma mammalian leptin analogue on reproductive parameters</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In both pre‐recruiting and RFG females, individuals with higher plasma MLA had longer delays before laying once on the breeding grounds (i.e., longer time interval between arrival and laying date) and had later laying dates. This occurred despite the lack of association between body mass and plasma MLA, potentially indicating that there may be other indirect impacts of plasma MLA on energetics and energetic management besides direct impacts on body mass. In avian species, experimental manipulations of plasma MLA, using mammalian leptin, have been shown to reduce foraging behaviors (Lõhmus &amp; Sundström, 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0025">2004</a>; Lõhmus et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0026">2003</a>, 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0027">2006</a>). Further, in wild‐breeding great tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) females administered mammalian leptin had a higher likelihood of investing in a second brood (Lõhmus and Bjorklund, 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0024">2009</a>, 
  <span class="italic">but see</span> te Marvelde &amp; Visser, 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0050">2012</a>). If plasma MLA provides a signal of condition or endogenous fat stores and negatively influences foraging (Lõhmus &amp; Sundström, 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0025">2004</a>; Lõhmus et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0026">2003</a>, 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0027">2006</a>), female eiders with high plasma MLA may have reduced foraging behavior, take longer to gain in condition for reproduction, and therefore lay later in the breeding season. Considering that plasma MLA influences the functioning of cultured ovarian cells (Sirotkin &amp; Grossmann, 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0044">2007</a>), advances the onset of puberty in chicken (Paczoska‐Eliasiewicz et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0032">2006</a>), and affects reproduction (Lõhmus and Bjorklund, 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0024">2009</a>, this study), plasma MLA may be an important trait mediating life history decisions and potentially trade‐offs.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, if high concentrations of plasma MLA indicate high endogenous fat stores then it seems counterintuitive that female eiders with higher concentrations of plasma MLA delayed laying for a longer period of time and laying later in the breeding season, rather than earlier. Although mammalian leptin has an endocrine function, true avian leptin has been found to fit more so within autocrine/paracrine function (Seroussi et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0041">2016</a>). It may be that plasma MLA may have a similar autocrine/paracrine function as in avian leptin, thus explaining its disassociation with body mass, and the inverse relationships between plasma MLA concentrations and reproductive phenology. Regardless, as in other physiological traits (Williams, 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0053">2008</a>), there is still a substantial amount of diversity in the inherent ability of individuals to produce plasma MLA (Quillfeldt et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0035">2009</a>; Kordonowy et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0022">2010</a>, this study), and likely variation in individual sensitivity to the trait. Furthermore, although receptors for this trait have been identified in multiple avian tissues (Ohkubo et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0031">2007</a>; Paczoska‐Eliasiewicz et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0032">2006</a>; Taoius et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0048">2001</a>), the variation in receptor densities across tissues seasonally has yet to be documented. Research in other hormones suggests seasonal variation in receptor density is probable (e.g., androgens and estrogens: Fusani, Van't Hof, Hutchinson, &amp; Gahr, 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0012">2000</a>, corticosterone: Breuner &amp; Orchinik, 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0005">2001</a>), and therefore a likely contributing factor to individual and species variation in plasma MLA. Since plasma MLA appears to be related to energetics and energetic management, it is possible that some of this variability is also generated from environmental factors such as food availability (Schradin et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0039">2014</a>) or types of food consumed (Frederich et al., 1995), as is the case with leptin in mammalian species.
