 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Assay for mammalian leptin analogue</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Assays for plasma mammalian leptin analogue were conducted in 2007 at the United States Department of Agriculture Laboratories (USDA‐Beltsville, MD, USA) by in‐house radioimmunoassay in tandem with samples from and following the methodologies outlined in Kordonowy et al. (
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0022">2010</a>). Briefly, putative recombinant chicken leptin (rcleptin) was provided by A. Gertler (Raver et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0036">1998</a>) and iodinated to a specific activity of 50 Ci/g, and then stored at −80°C until further use (Kordonowy et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0022">2010</a>). The primary antibody, rabbit anti‐rcleptin (Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, TX) and second antibody, a sheep anti‐rabbit gamma globulin (Linco, Inc., St. Charles, MO) were both commercially available. Both primary and secondary antibodies were diluted using sodium phosphate buffer (0.05 M phosphosaline, pH 7.4) containing 0.025 M EDTA plus 0.05% Triton X‐100 (Sigma Chemical Co.) to a 1:1,600 and a 1:10 dilution, respectively. Plasma samples and radio‐labeled rcleptin (6000 c.p.m. I‐125‐labeled rcleptin; tracer) were diluted in 1% BSA phosphate buffer. These assays were run under nonequilibrium conditions.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the first day of the assay, 100 μl of RIA diluent were added to a plastic tube, along with either 100 μl of standard or plasma, then vortexed and left overnight at 4°C. The following day, 100 μl of tracer was added to each tube and incubated at 4°C overnight once more. On the third day, 100 μl of the second antibody and carrier (normal rabbit serum, Linco, Inc., St. Charles, MO; 1:200 dilution in phosphate buffer) each were added to every tube, vortexed, and incubated at 4°C overnight a final time. On the final day of the assay, all tubes but the total count tubes were centrifuged at 2,500 rpm, the supernatant was aspirated and the remaining pellet was counted in a gamma counter. The RIA data reductions used log/logit transformations. The displacement curve using this assay method in wild birds has been tested previously and shown to be parallel to the standard curve with a sensitivity of 300 pg/tube and 96.1% recovery rate (Kordonowy et al., 
  <a rid="ece34873-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34873-bib-0022">2010</a>). Due to the plasma volume required for this assay (~125 μl), we were only able to assay single samples and therefore could not calculate the amount of variation within a plate. However, the same assay conducted at this same institution has previously demonstrated low intra‐assay (3.2%) and inter‐assay coefficients of variation (5.1%; Kordonowy et al.,
