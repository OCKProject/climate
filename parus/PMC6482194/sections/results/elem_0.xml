   <span class="italic">loci</span> (cry1, per2, per3) whereas no significant relationship with methylation of the social father existed at any 
   <span class="italic">locus</span> (Table 
   <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>). Removal of the statistically non-significant paternity by paternal methylation interaction effect disclosed a significant positive relationship between adult offspring methylation and paternal (independent of genetic parentage) methylation at cry1, per2 and per3.
  </p>
  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effect of the interaction between maternal methylation and offspring sex significantly predicted offspring methylation at per2 at both offspring life stages (Table 
   <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>). Maternal methylation positively predicted methylation of daughters but not sons (Table 
   <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>). However, analyses restricted to the genetic fathers and their within-pair offspring did not disclose any significant interaction between methylation of the father and sex of the offspring on offspring methylation (F values associated to P values always &gt;0.06; see also SOM).
  </p>
  <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thus, there was a composite pattern of differential covariation between methylation in the offspring at either the nestling or the adult stage and methylation of the genetic versus the social father, with some hint for a stronger relationship between methylation in the offspring and in the genetic father as compared to the social father.</p>
