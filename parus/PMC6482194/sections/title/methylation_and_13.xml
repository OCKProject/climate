 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Genetic polymorphism at clock has been shown to be associated with phenological variation in several, though not all, vertebrate species tested so far
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">66</a>
  </span>, including the barn swallow
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
  </span>. Besides genetic polymorphism, however, methylation state may also intervene in regulating clock-dependent photoperiodic responses. In a previous study we showed that methylation at the clock poly-Q predicted timing of breeding of old female barn swallows from the same geographical area where the present study was carried out
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>. To assess the robustness of the previously reported relationship, here we considerably expanded the sample size of the previous study and confirmed that large methylation at clock poly-Q is associated with early breeding in females but not in males. The relationship between breeding date and methylation at clock poly-Q held for both yearling (not tested in a previous study
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>) and older individuals, which are known to breed on average at different times
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span>. As previously noted
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>, the sign of the relationship between methylation at clock poly-Q and breeding date is consistent with the expectation. This is the case because increasing methylation levels are expected to reduce the expression of CLOCK/BMAL1 transcription factor, thus reducing the transcriptional activation of the clock genes.
 </p>
 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, the present analyses on an expanded sample disclosed a marginally non-significant (P = 0.062) negative association between breeding date, independently of sex and age, and methylation at the clock 5′-UTR 
  <span class="italic">locus</span>, which was not previously detected
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>, suggesting that methylation at other regions of clock may also be functionally relevant to timing of breeding. However, we did not find any hint for an association between methylation at other four circadian clock genes and breeding date in both sexes, which were not tested in the previous study.
 </p>
 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Populations of birds and other organisms have undergone rapid phenotypic changes in phenological traits during the last decades, likely in response to climate change
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>
  </span>, which have occurred at a pace that may be difficult to explain by invoking relatively slow micro-evolutionary processes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>
  </span>. The observed association between methylation at clock and breeding date (present study) or migration dates
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>, and the observation of parent-offspring resemblance in methylation at this gene may help explaining rapid phenological change in the barn swallow and, potentially, also in several other bird species
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">68</a>
  </span>. This is the case because methylation at clock poly-Q, which shows high resemblance between genetic parents and young offspring, may mediate phenological shifts at least in early life stages, with likely carry-over consequences in adulthood, independently of any micro-evolutionary change in population genetic composition at clock.
