 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Methylation of nestlings at clock 5′-UTR, clock poly-Q, cry1, per3 and timeless significantly increased with methylation of their genetic mother (Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). At the adult offspring stage, however, a significant positive relationship with maternal methylation persisted only for timeless (Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>; Fig.

    <p>Relationship between methylation of the offspring and their father and mother. Linear mixed models of methylation in the offspring at the nestling or at the adult (1-year-old) stage in relation to paternity and methylation of the father (genetic or social) and of the mother. Colony and year are included in all models as random effects. Separate models were run for paternal and maternal methylation at clock 5′-UTR because of collinearity (see 
     <span class="italic">Statistical analyses</span>). The interaction term between paternity and paternal methylation was removed from the models when its effect was statistically non-significant before FDR correction. Thus, for example, the main effects on nestling cry1 are computed while excluding from the model the interaction effect, as indicated by the asterisk. The slopes of the relationships for extra-pair (EPO) and within-pair (WPO) offspring are shown and significant ones are bolded. ‘n’ values in parentheses are the number of nestlings or, respectively, 1-year-old recruits that were included in the analyses. The maternal methylation by offspring sex interaction was retained only for per2, based on statistical significance.

  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). The effect of the paternity by paternal methylation term was either marginally non-significant (clock 5′-UTR) after FDR correction or far from significance for the other 
  <span class="italic">loci</span> (Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>). A closer inspection of within-paternity group coefficients (see 
  <span class="italic">Statistical analyses</span> and SOM for a justification) showed that nestling methylation was significantly positively related to methylation of the genetic father at clock 5′-UTR and clock poly-Q, whereas the relationships for the social father were either significantly negative (clock poly-Q) or non-significant (Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>).

 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At no 
  <span class="italic">locus</span> did offspring methylation at the adult stage significantly, differentially covary with methylation of the genetic as compared to the social father (Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>). Again, however, inspection of the within paternity group coefficients showed significant positive relationships between offspring and genetic father’s methylation at some 
  <span class="italic">loci</span> (cry1, per2, per3) whereas no significant relationship with methylation of the social father existed at any 
  <span class="italic">locus</span> (Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>). Removal of the statistically non-significant paternity by paternal methylation interaction effect disclosed a significant positive relationship between adult offspring methylation and paternal (independent of genetic parentage) methylation at cry1, per2 and per3.
 </p>
 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effect of the interaction between maternal methylation and offspring sex significantly predicted offspring methylation at per2 at both offspring life stages (Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>). Maternal methylation positively predicted methylation of daughters but not sons (Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>). However, analyses restricted to the genetic fathers and their within-pair offspring did not disclose any significant interaction between methylation of the father and sex of the offspring on offspring methylation (F values associated to P values always &gt;0.06; see also SOM).
 </p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thus, there was a composite pattern of differential covariation between methylation in the offspring at either the nestling or the adult stage and methylation of the genetic versus the social father, with some hint for a stronger relationship between methylation in the offspring and in the genetic father as compared to the social father.</p>
