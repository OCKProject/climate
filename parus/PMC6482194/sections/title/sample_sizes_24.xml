 <p id="Par59" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We sampled 58 pairs of breeding adults, and their recruited offspring both as nestlings and as 1-year-old recruits. Of these breeding pairs, 5 had two recruited offspring and 1 had three recruits included in the sample (65 offspring in total). The 65 offspring comprised 54 males (39 WPO and 15 EPO) and 11 females (8 WPO and 3 EPO). This sex-bias in recruitment is typical of the barn swallow and other birds due to female-biased natal dispersal
