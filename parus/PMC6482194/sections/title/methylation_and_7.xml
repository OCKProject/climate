 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Breeding date was significantly predicted by the interaction between methylation at clock poly-Q and sex, whereas the interaction effect between methylation at clock poly-Q and age was non-significant (Table 
  <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a>; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). In females, breeding date was significantly earlier as methylation increased (Table 
  <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a>; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). In both age classes, the relationship between breeding date and methylation was significantly negative, but it was marginally non-significantly more steep for yearlings than for older individuals (Table 
  <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a>; Fig.

    <p>Variation in breeding date in relation to methylation at clock. Linear mixed model of breeding date in relation to methylation at clock poly-Q or clock 5′-UTR, sex and age (yearling vs older). Family, year and study area (Italy or Switzerland) were included in the models as random effects. Sample size was 234 individuals (75 yearlings, 159 older individuals; 141 males; 93 females) for clock poly-Q and 236 individuals (77, 159, 143, 93) for clock 5′-UTR.</p>
