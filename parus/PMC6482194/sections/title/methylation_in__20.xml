 <p id="Par52" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Variation in methylation according to sex and life stage was also analyzed in LMMs. For each 
  <span class="italic">locus</span>, each methylation datum of parents and offspring was classified according to sex (male: 1; female: 2) and life stage (parent and 1-year-old offspring: 1; offspring at the nestling stage: 2). In the models, methylation was considered as the dependent variable, sex and life stage as fixed effect factors (with their two-way interaction), and year and colony as random effects. In addition, we also included a random factor family, i.e. a factor where the father (whether genetic or social), the mother, and their offspring at both the nestling and the adult stage were assigned the same code. The effect of the sex by life stage interaction is always presented in the 
  <span class="italic">Results</span>, but when it was non-significant it was excluded from the model including the main effects. In these analyses, we also tested for the (random) effect of year and colony on methylation, by comparing the model including both random effects with reduced models that contained only the year or, respectively, the colony effects, by likelihood ratio tests.
