 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In spring 1999–2002 and 2010–2016 we captured all adult breeding barn swallows at a total of 12 colonies (=farms) located near Milan (Northern Italy) over nine years. Swallows were sexed, individually marked, subjected to blood sampling for methylation and genetic parentage analyses, and released. The breeding birds were assigned to their nest by observation of color rings. The nests were inspected every 2–5 days. When nestlings were 6–12 days old, they were also individually marked and a blood sample was collected for methylation and genetic paternity analyses. In all years, all adults at the breeding colonies were captured to identify the marked offspring born in the previous year that were recruited as 1-year-old breeding adults. These recruits were also subject to blood sampling for methylation analyses. Thus, for each breeding pair that generated one (or more; see below) recruited offspring, we measured methylation for the male and the female mates, and for their offspring both as nestlings in the year of birth and in the year following that of birth, when they reached sexual maturity.</p>
 <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because in the years preceding those of blood sampling for methylation analyses all breeding adults were captured in the study colonies and barn swallows have extremely high breeding philopatry, in each sampling year we could assume that adult individuals that had not been captured in the previous year were ca. 1-year-old individuals, immigrating from other colonies (unless they were local recruits)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span>. Thus, in each year, breeding parents could be assigned to either of two age classes: yearling (1-year old) or ‘older’ (two or more years old). All the recruits thus were in the ‘yearling’ age class.
 </p>
 <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Breeding date (expressed as Julian date of laying of the first egg in the first clutch) was known for all the parents and also for part of their offspring that were later recruited as breeders.</p>

  <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We analyzed a total of six 
   <span class="italic">loci</span> at five clock genes: clock, per2, per3, cry1, and timeless. When we started the present work no barn swallow genome sequence was available. We therefore decided to exploit the synteny between passerine birds to isolate the barn swallow genomic sequences of interest. Mainly, the genomes of 
   <span class="italic">Ficedula albicollis</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Phylloscopus trochilus</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Pseudopodoces humilis</span>, were used. Except for clock, where PCR primers for the poly-Q exon and 5′-UTR region of the gene, specific for barn swallow, were already available
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">69</a>
   </span>, we concentrated our attention on the promoter region of the other selected genes. A 5,000 bp region upstream of the predicted ATG start codon was identified in the different species, sequences were aligned and the portions conserved in all species were examined to identify candidate CpG methylation sites, flanked by DNA sequences suitable for PCR primer design. For each specific gene the primers were designed to cover the greatest possible number of CpG sites within the promoter region, taking into account the necessary length of the PCR amplicon, length of the target sequence, and primers that avoided CpGs. Sequences were designed using PyroMark Assay Design software (Qiagen, Germany). The identified primers were used to amplify the homologous sequence present in the barn swallow genome. Those fragments were purified (Wizard SV Gel and PCR clean-up System, Promega, Madison, Wi, USA) and sequenced (BMR genomics, Padua, Italy) to confirm their homology and to design specific PCR primers required for bisulfite pyrosequencing. Primer sequences are reported in SOM (Table 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2S</a>).

  <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One µg DNA (concentration 50 ng/µl) was treated using EZ DNA Methylation-Gold™ Kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Final elution was performed with 30 µl of M-Elution Buffer. Bisulfite-treated DNA was stored at −20 °C and used shortly after treatment. Analysis of DNA methylation was performed using previously published methods

   </span>, with minor modifications. Briefly, a 50 µl PCR was carried out in 25 µl of GoTaq Green Master mix (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), 1 pmol of the forward primer, 1 pmol of the biotinylated reverse primer, 50 ng of bisulfite-treated genomic DNA and water. The biotin-labelled primers were used to purify the final PCR product using Sepharose beads. The PCR product was bound to Streptavidin Sepharose HP (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) and the Sepharose beads containing the immobilized PCR product were purified, washed, denatured using a 0.2 M NaOH solution, and washed again using the Pyrosequencing Vacuum Prep Tool (Pyrosequencing, Inc., Westborough, MA), as recommended by the manufacturer. Then, 0.3 µΜ pyrosequencing primer was annealed to the purified single-stranded PCR product and pyrosequencing was performed using the PyroMark MD System (Pyrosequencing, Inc.). The degree of methylation was expressed as percentage of methylated cytosines divided by the sum of methylated and unmethylated cytosines (%5mC). Every sample was measured three times and the average of the replicates was used in statistical analyses. Assays which did not result in good quality pyrograms were repeated. If after 3 replicates the pyrogram quality was still not satisfactory according to pyrosequencing quality controls, the measure resulted in a missing value (see below and SOM for sample sizes). Each assay also included a bisulfite conversion check to verify full conversion of the DNA.

In the models, methylation was considered as the dependent variable, sex and life stage as fixed effect factors (with their two-way interaction), and year and colony as random effects. In addition, we also included a random factor family, i.e. a factor where the father (whether genetic or social), the mother, and their offspring at both the nestling and the adult stage were assigned the same code. The effect of the sex by life stage interaction is always presented in the 
    <span class="italic">Results</span>, but when it was non-significant it was excluded from the model including the main effects. In these analyses, we also tested for the (random) effect of year and colony on methylation, by comparing the model including both random effects with reduced models that contained only the year or, respectively, the colony effects, by likelihood ratio tests.

   <p id="Par54" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relationship between methylation at the nestling stage or at the 1-year-old recruit stage and methylation of the father and mother was analyzed in LMMs where we included methylation of the nestling as the dependent variable and methylation of the father and of the mother as independent variables. In addition, we included a factor ‘paternity’ to account for the fact that the father was the genetic or, respectively, the social, non-genetic father of the offspring. The interaction between paternity and methylation of the father allowed us to test whether the relationship between nestling’s and father’s methylation differed between genetic and social fathers. Finally, we also included a factor offspring sex to account for variation in methylation between male and female offspring and its interaction with maternal methylation, to account for any differential effect of methylation of mothers on methylation of sons as compared to daughters. The interaction between paternal methylation and offspring sex was not tested because of admixture of genetic and social fathers (see also SOM). The effect of sex as well as the effect of the interaction between paternity and paternal methylation were removed from final models when statistically non-significant. However, even when the paternity by father’s methylation was statistically non-significant, we still reported and inspected the within-paternity group relationships because these could provide information as to whether the 
    <span class="italic">strength</span> (not the 
    <span class="italic">slope</span>) of the relationship between nestling and father differed according to paternity (see also SOM).

   <p id="Par55" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As an exception to the above modelling approach, because of very high collinearity between mates at clock 5′-UTR (r = 0.648, n = 64, P &lt; 0.0001; see also

   <p id="Par56" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We tested whether methylation at the six 
    <span class="italic">loci</span> statistically predicted breeding date. We thus designed LMM with sex and age (yearling vs older) as fixed effects and methylation, and their two-way interactions as predictors. In the models we also included year as a random factor and, in addition, a factor ‘family’ which accounted for the fact that in the dataset pairs of mates and, in some cases, trios (two parents plus one breeding offspring) were included.
