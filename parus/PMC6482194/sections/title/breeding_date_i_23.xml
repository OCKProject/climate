 <p id="Par56" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We tested whether methylation at the six 
  <span class="italic">loci</span> statistically predicted breeding date. We thus designed LMM with sex and age (yearling vs older) as fixed effects and methylation, and their two-way interactions as predictors. In the models we also included year as a random factor and, in addition, a factor ‘family’ which accounted for the fact that in the dataset pairs of mates and, in some cases, trios (two parents plus one breeding offspring) were included. In the analyses on the effect of methylation at the two clock 
  <span class="italic">loci</span>, where we also considered information on methylation and breeding date already reported in a study based in both Italy and Switzerland
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>, we also included a random factor ‘study area’ (Italy or Switzerland). Because the mean and the variances of the clock 5′-UTR and clock poly-Q between the present methylation data and those previously reported
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span> differed, methylation data were standardized to a mean of 0 and a variance of 1 within the two datasets.

 <p id="Par57" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because repeated tests were run on the same individuals at the six 
  <span class="italic">loci</span>, the results of the statistical tests were corrected according to the false discovery rate (FDR) procedure (see also SOM). Throughout the 
  <span class="italic">Results</span>, uncorrected P values are presented and those that remained significant after FDR correction are marked with a ‘
  <span class="sup">†</span>’.
