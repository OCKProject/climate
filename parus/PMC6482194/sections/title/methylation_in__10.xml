 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found clear evidence for variation in methylation in relation to age and sex. At clock poly-Q and timeless, nestlings had higher methylation than older individuals and females had higher methylation than males. The pattern was more complex and partly reversed for clock 5â€²-UTR, as methylation was lower in nestlings than in adults among females but not males, and was lower in female than male nestlings whereas no difference existed at the adult life stage.</p>
 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We are aware of two cases where age-related variation in methylation in birds has been studied in the wild. Methylation at the avian glucocorticoid receptor gene did not differ between nestling and adult superb starlings (
  <span class="italic">Lamprotornis superbus</span>) whereas methylation at the agouti-related neuropeptide varied with age in the black grouse

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>. In humans, DNA methylation changes over the lifespan, but predominantly in the first year of life and throughout later childhood and adolescence, becoming more stable in the adulthood
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>
  </span>. As a general pattern, repetitive elements are usually heavily methylated and become hypomethylated with age; gene promoters can be hypo- or hypermethylated according to their biological function and the presence of multiple methylated CpG sites in promoters causes stable silencing of genes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
  </span>. At the mechanistic level, changes in the expression of enzymes regulating methylation could lead to generalized or gene-specific modulation of methylation with age
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>
  </span>. The present age-related variation in methylation may contribute to cause the age-dependent variation in phenological traits, which is strongly expressed in barn swallows

  </span>.

 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sex differences in DNA methylation have been studied in humans and other mammalian model organisms
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>
  </span>, seldom in domestic birds
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>
  </span>, while information on sex differences from the few studies of non-artificially selected avian models in the wild is extremely limited
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>. Barn swallows show variation in behaviors that may depend on circadian rhythmicity and photoperiodic responses according to sex, including for example timing of migration
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>
  </span>. The sex-related differences that we observed in methylation may therefore partly account for such behavioral sex differences. In the present study, however, we did not investigate the environmental factors, if any, that could contribute to generate the observed variation of methylation levels according to age and sex, and very limited knowledge of methylation in wild vertebrates prevented us from speculating on which factors could in fact be responsible for such age- and sex-dependency.
