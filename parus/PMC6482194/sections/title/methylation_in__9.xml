 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found evidence for non-random mating (i.e. assortative mating according to its definition in
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>) according to methylation at clock 5â€²-UTR but not at the other 
  <span class="italic">loci</span>. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence for positive assortative mating according to methylation profile in any vertebrate species. Since the clock gene is believed to be involved in photoperiodic responses, including timing of spring phenological events in birds
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
  </span>, positive assortative mating for methylation may result from an effect of methylation at this 
  <span class="italic">locus</span> on timing of arrival from migration and pre-breeding activities, favoring the pairing between individuals with synchronized life cycles. An alternative interpretation is that similarity in methylation during the breeding season arises as an effect of synchrony in breeding activities, therefore being the consequence, rather than the cause, of synchronization of spring life-cycle events.
