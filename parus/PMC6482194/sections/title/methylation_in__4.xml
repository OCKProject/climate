 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">LMMs with sex and life stage as fixed-effect factors showed a composite pattern of variation in methylation at the six 
  <span class="italic">loci</span> (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Methylation at clock 5′-UTR was lower in females than in males and in nestlings compared to adults (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). However, the sex-difference also depended on life stage, as shown by the significant two way-interaction (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Specifically, there was a significant difference between nestling and adult females but not males and, in addition, there was a significant difference between nestling (but not adult) males and females (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). For clock poly-Q and timeless, methylation was significantly higher in nestlings than in adults and in females compared to males (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Methylation at cry1, per2 and per3 did not vary according to sex or life stage (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>).

    <p>Mean (+SE) methylation at six 
     <span class="italic">loci</span> of adult and nestling male and female barn swallows from 58 families. Means for the adult life stage are computed by pooling parents with their offspring considered at the adult (1-year old) stage. S: significant difference according to sex; LS: significant difference according to life stage (adult vs nestling); S × LS: significant effect of the sex by life stage interaction. See also Table

 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In these models we also tested the random effects of year of birth of the offspring and colony. At no 
  <span class="italic">locus</span> did colony predict variation in methylation (χ
  <span class="sup">2</span> &lt; 0.3, df = 1, P &gt; 0.65 for all 
  <span class="italic">loci</span>). Methylation was found to significantly vary among years for clock 5′-UTR (χ
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 25.0, df = 1, P &lt; 0.001
  <span class="sup">†</span>), and per3 (χ
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 13.1 df = 1, P &lt; 0.001
  <span class="sup">†</span>), and marginally non-significantly (after FDR) so for timeless (χ 
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 4.2, df = 1, P = 0.040), but not for the other 
  <span class="italic">loci</span> (χ 
  <span class="sup">2</span> &lt; 2.1, df = 1, P &gt; 0.14 in all cases).
