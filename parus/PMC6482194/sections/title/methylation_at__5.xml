 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Methylation at the nestling stage significantly and positively predicted methylation at the 1-year-old adult stage for clock 5′-UTR, clock poly-Q, per2 and timeless (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). The relationship was significantly negative for cry1 (Table
