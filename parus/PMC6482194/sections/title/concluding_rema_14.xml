 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, we found extensive evidence for differential variation in methylation levels according to sex and age, whose physiolocal and ecological causes remain to be elucidated. In addition, we also showed extensive, yet 
  <span class="italic">locus</span>-dependent parent-offspring resemblance in methylation levels, with a hint that, for fathers, resemblance with the offspring is more strongly mediated by variation in germline methylation, genetic variation in susceptibility to methylation or sperm factors rather than by extrinsic environmental factors during early life stages. Such intergenerational resemblance in methylation has obvious implications for estimates of genetic heritability of traits that depend on clock genes. There is widespread evidence that rapid phenological changes have occurred in animal populations in response to climate change, and the fast pace of such changes has proven difficult to be reconciled with micro-evolutionary changes in populations. Epigenetic effects can rapidly generate phenotypic plasticity in phenological and other traits. The association between methylation at clock and phenological traits, in combination with intergenerational resemblance in methylation levels can thus provide a mechanistic basis to interpret the rapid phenological changes that populations have recently undergone in response to climate change.
