  </span>, implying that methylation can change during life, as present results suggest to be the case at four 
  <span class="italic">loci</span> (see above). However, individuals that at the nestling stage had high methylation also did so at the 1-year old stage at four of the six 
  <span class="italic">loci</span> that we investigated, implying that 
  <span class="italic">relative</span> methylation levels tended to remain constant across individuals during the first year of life. Consistency of methylation level has been previously documented during the first life stages (e.g. from childhood to first pregnancy) in humans
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>
  </span>. The present results thus suggest that individual consistency in behavioral patterns that is observed at phenological or other behavioral traits that may depend on circadian clocks, can partly result from consistency of individual methylation level during life
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span>. Cry1 and per3 represented an exception to the positive relationship between methylation levels at different life stages, with cry1 even showing a negative relationship between life stages. However, the mechanism and the function, if any, of such negative relationship for cry1 remains obscure at present.
