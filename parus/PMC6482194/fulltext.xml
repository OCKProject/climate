The potential for epigenetic effects to be transmitted across generations, thus modulating phenotypic variation and affecting ecological and evolutionary processes, is increasingly appreciated. However, the study of variation in epigenomes and inter-generational transmission of epigenetic alterations in wild populations is at its very infancy. We studied sex- and age-related variation in DNA methylation and parent-offspring resemblance in methylation profiles in the barn swallows. We focused on a class of highly conserved &#x02018;clock&#x02019; genes (clock, cry1, per2, per3, timeless) relevant in the timing of activities of major ecological importance. In addition, we considerably expanded previous analyses on the relationship between methylation at clock genes and breeding date, a key fitness trait in barn swallows. We found positive assortative mating for methylation at one clock <italic>locus</italic>. Methylation varied between the nestling and the adult stage, and according to sex. Individuals with relatively high methylation as nestlings also had high methylation levels when adults. Extensive parent-nestling resemblance in methylation levels was observed. Occurrence of extra-pair fertilizations allowed to disclose evidence hinting at a prevalence of paternal germline or sperm quality effects over common environment effects in generating father-offspring resemblance in methylation. Finally, we found an association between methylation at the clock poly-Q region, but not at other <italic>loci</italic>, and breeding date. We thus provided evidence for sex-dependent variation and the first account of parent-offspring resemblance in methylation in any wild vertebrate. We also showed that epigenetics may influence phenotypic plasticity of timing of life cycle events, thus having a major impact on fitness.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Ecological genetics</kwd><kwd>Behavioural ecology</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Environmental conditions can induce regulation of the expression and function of genes via epigenetic effects, without directly altering nucleotide sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.

The possibility that ancestors&#x02019; experiences result in epigenetic transmission across generation borders of phenotypic traits has obvious, tremendous and yet poorly explored implications for ecological and evolutionary processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Indeed, heritable epigenetic effects are known to affect phenotypic variation at major life-history traits including physiology, morphology and behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Epigenetic modulation of gene expression occurs through major classes of mechanisms that include DNA methylation, histone modifications, the effect of non-coding RNAs, and the activity of chaperones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. DNA methylation, particularly at the palindrome dinucleotide sequences 5&#x02032;CpG3&#x02032; at the 5 position of cytosine, is generally regarded as the most common epigenetic mark in mammals, although information for other vertebrates is scanty. Methylation of cytosines located in gene promoters modulates gene transcription, is involved in alternative promoter usage and regulation of enhancer activity, and often causes downregulation of the gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Epigenetic effects mediated by DNA methylation may be a key mechanism that controls variation in behavioral traits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. For example, methylation at the dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) gene is related to exploratory behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, while methylation at the dopamine receptor and serotonin transporter is related to novelty seeking behaviour in great tits (<italic>Parus major</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In addition, methylation at the agouti-related peptide is significantly related to sexual coloration in the black grouse (<italic>Lyrurus tetrix</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">DNA methylation can also be transmitted across generations, generally meaning that offspring resemble their parents in methylation levels, as shown exclusively by laboratory studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Such inheritance of methylation states can arise via different pathways. First, &#x02018;true&#x02019; transgenerational inheritance occurs via the germline if methylation profile of the gametes is carried over to the zygote and later developmental stages. Rigorously demonstrating &#x02018;true&#x02019; transgenerational inheritance of methylation profiles is extremely difficult, particularly in the wild, as it requires showing that ancestors resemble their F3 or later-generation descendants. Despite these difficulties, some studies have provided evidence for transgenerational inheritance of responses to parental experiences including diet, stressful conditions and exposure to toxins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, and via gamete-mediated inheritance of methylation marks. Such transmission by germline methylation has been demonstrated in studies of the effects of vinclozolin in mice on anxiety-like behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and also in a single study of birds under laboratory conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. However, it must be emphasized that while environmentally driven changes in DNA methylation has been repeatedly documented to be inherited in plants, the evidence for transgenerational environmental effects on methylation is still scanty and contentious for taxa like vertebrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">An alternative pathway of methylation inheritance is via &#x02018;soma-to-soma&#x02019; interactions. These can occur when the prenatal environment in terms for example of in utero conditions or egg composition directly affect the methylome of the developing offspring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In addition, RNA molecules stored in sperm and components of the seminal fluid also have the potential for transgenerational transmission of epigenetic traits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Such soma-to-soma effects can also occur via general environmental effects whenever ancestors&#x02019; experience of environmental conditions causes a new epigenetic mark and phenotype to arise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> and ancestors tend to reinstate similar environmental (e.g. physical or social) conditions across subsequent generations, causing the same epigenetic mark to re-appear in descendants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Finally, parent offspring resemblance may arise because of transgenerational genetic effects, whereby similarity in methylation levels in parents and offspring arises because of similarity in their genetic background<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">Inheritance of methylation may not necessarily occur symmetrically from either parental genome, as exemplified at a paradigmatic extreme by parental sex-specific genetic imprinting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The evidence for the relative contribution of maternal versus paternal methylation states to descendant methylation patterns in humans and other vertebrates is mixed and parental sex-specific inheritance effects may vary among taxa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">It is worth emphasizing that, independently of the exact mechanisms that determine resemblance in methylation states across generations, any such resemblance has extremely important ecological and evolutionary consequences because it implies that new epigenetic phenotypes can be carried over to subsequent generations independently of genetic inheritance. Yet, to the best of our knowledge, no study has been published to date on any vertebrate species in the wild where resemblance in methylation at the single-<italic>locus</italic> level between parent and offspring has been investigated.</p><p id="Par9">The first main aim of this study thus was to investigate whether offspring, at their nestling stage and also once they attain sexual maturity, resemble their parents in CpG methylation at five highly conserved genes (clock, per2, per3, cry1, timeless), using a small, migratory bird, the barn swallow (<italic>Hirundo rustica</italic>) as a study system. In doing so, we also tested for any differential effect of methylation state of either parent on methylation of offspring of either sex, and on age- (nestling vs adult) and sex-specific variation in methylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Stemming from current interest on control of timing of major life cycle stages in the barn swallow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, in the present study we focused on methylation at &#x02018;clock&#x02019; genes whose products dynamically interact to elicit rhythmic patterns of transcription, translation, biochemical and physiological processes, and behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> and are thus involved in circadian rhythmicity and photoperiodic responses (see also Supplementary Material). In addition, we tested for resemblance in methylation levels between pair members because similarity in methylation profiles at photoperiodic genes might influence mate choice or, reciprocally, synchronization in reproductive behavior might result in resemblance in methylation levels between pair members.</p><p id="Par10">To our goals, we measured methylation at the focal <italic>loci</italic> in blood cells of 65 barn swallows (from 58 social pairs) when they were nestlings and when they were subsequently recruited as 1-year-old sexually mature adults, and in their parents. Because nucleated erythrocytes in barn swallows and other birds represent a large fraction of nucleated blood cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, our methylation data essentially reflect methylation of erythrocytes. Parent-offspring resemblance in methylation can result from diverse mechanisms, which are extremely difficult to tease apart (see above), especially in the wild. When extra-pair fertilizations occur, however, two types of families are naturally established: first, families where parental fathers (i.e. the males that attend the offspring) are also the genetic fathers of the offspring (hereafter, within-pair offspring, WPO) that they attend; second, families where the parental father is the &#x02018;social&#x02019;, but not the genetic father (hereafter, &#x02018;social father&#x02019;) of one or more of the offspring (hereafter, extra-pair offspring, EPO) that they attend. Extra-pair fertilizations, which are common in the barn swallow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, afford an opportunity to get an insight into the contribution of different mechanisms of parent-offspring resemblance in methylation states, and we therefore subjected the 65 sampled offspring to genetic parentage tests. If genetic father-WPO resemblance in methylation is stronger than social father-EPO resemblance, a mechanism of inheritance mediated by the paternal germline or via non-genetic sperm and seminal fluid constituents can be invoked. Because the reciprocal condition whereby mothers attend non-genetically related offspring in their nest is very uncommon in barn swallows<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, as in the majority of altricial birds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, no such approach could be undertaken to assess the relative contribution of maternal germline/egg effects as compared to postnatal environmental effects.</p><p id="Par11">Very limited background knowledge on methylation in wild birds, however, prevented us from formulating explicit predictions on the differential father-offspring relationships according to paternity and on sex- and age-dependency of methylation levels.</p><p id="Par12">In a previous study focusing on two clock <italic>loci</italic> (clock poly-Q and clock 5&#x02032;-UTR) we showed that methylation at the clock poly-Q was statistically associated with spring migration and breeding date in the same barn swallow population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. The previous analysis was restricted to relatively old (two or more years) individuals and focused on just two <italic>loci</italic>. Here, we expand the analysis of the association between methylation at these two <italic>loci</italic> and breeding date, which is a major fitness trait because in barn swallows it predicts both seasonal reproductive success and offspring quality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, on a much larger sample of birds and we also assess whether methylation at other genes besides clock is related to breeding date. The importance of such replication studies to test for consistency of results has been repeatedly advocated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. In the analyses of breeding date in relation to methylation at clock 5&#x02032;-UTR and clock poly-Q, we thus also considered the data included in Saino <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> (see also below).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methylation in pair members</title><p id="Par13">LMMs showed that methylation of males at clock 5&#x02032;-UTR significantly and positively predicted methylation of their female mate (F<sub>1,39</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;14.75, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001<sup>&#x02020;</sup>, coefficient: 0.310 (0.081); Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) whereas the relationships between mates at the other <italic>loci</italic> were non-significant (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1S</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Relationship between methylation at clock 5&#x02032;-UTR in females and in their male mates.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2019_42798_Fig1_HTML" id="d29e661"/></fig><table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Methylation in relation to life stage and sex.

Yet, DNA methylation and other pathways of epigenetic alterations of gene expression can have profound effects on the formation and maintenance of phenotypic variation and thus major potential, and yet largely unexplored, consequences for ecological and evolutionary processes.</p><p id="Par26">In this correlational study, we contribute to start filling some of these major gaps of knowledge by focusing on a class of highly conserved genes contributing to the circadian clock system. We first analyzed age- and sex-related variation in methylation levels at six focal genetic <italic>loci</italic> in a wild population of barn swallow, and found variation in methylation according to age and between males and females. Second, individuals were highly consistent in relative methylation levels between the nestling and the yearling life stage at most <italic>loci</italic>. Third, offspring resembled their genetic mother and their attending father in methylation particularly at the nestling stage. The occurrence of extra-pair fertilizations in the barn swallows allowed to identify some hints of stronger resemblance between the offspring and their genetic father compared to the non-genetic social father, possibly suggesting inheritance of methylation levels not only mediated by common-environment effects. In addition, methylation at clock 5&#x02032;-UTR was found to positively covary between breeding mates. Finally, by largely expanding a previous dataset, we confirmed that methylation at clock poly-Q negatively predicts a major phenological fitness trait, breeding date, of females but not males and we provided novel evidence that breeding date is not predicted by methylation at the other <italic>loci</italic>. Admittedly, in the present study we did not investigate the environmental factors that govern variation in methylation levels, which was found to occur among years (clock 5&#x02032;-UTR and per3) but not among colonies. The ecological causes and the ontogenetic and sex-dependent mechanisms behind variation in methylation levels thus remain to be elucidated.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methylation in mates</title><p id="Par27">We found evidence for non-random mating (i.e. assortative mating according to its definition in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>) according to methylation at clock 5&#x02032;-UTR but not at the other <italic>loci</italic>. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence for positive assortative mating according to methylation profile in any vertebrate species.

An alternative interpretation is that similarity in methylation during the breeding season arises as an effect of synchrony in breeding activities, therefore being the consequence, rather than the cause, of synchronization of spring life-cycle events.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Methylation in relation to sex and life stage</title><p id="Par28">We found clear evidence for variation in methylation in relation to age and sex.

Albeit non-conclusive, these results may thus suggest father-offspring resemblance of methylation levels independent of environmental effects also at the other <italic>loci</italic>, besides clock poly-Q. In fact, the relationships between methylation of the non-genetic, social fathers and the offspring that they attended were not statistically significant. However, for clock poly-Q the relationship between methylation of the offspring at the nestling stage and that of their social father was negative, rather than null or positive as expected in the case of no or, respectively, non-null environmental effects. The interpretation of the latter result is open to speculation. Because the genetic father-offspring relationship was positive, whereas the relationship was negative for the social father, it might be speculated that mothers generating extra-pair offspring were fertilized by extra-pair males whose methylation level was negatively correlated with that of their mate. The function of such differential assortative mating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> with the social mate compared to the extra-pair mate might consist in increasing the epigenetic diversity of the offspring, with potential advantages in terms of adaptation to unpredictable ecological conditions, in line with the theory that considers the function of extra-pair fertilizations as a mean to increase phenotypic diversity of the offspring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par36">Overall, the parent-offspring resemblance analyses suggested that genetic parents of either sex can differentially contribute to determine offspring methylation at individual <italic>loci</italic> and at different offspring life stages. Genetic fathers, in particular, seemed to contribute to offspring methylation at some <italic>loci</italic> of the clock genes also at the adult stage, whereas this was not the case for genetic mothers. In addition, the effect of methylation of the social (non-genetic) father on methylation of the extra-pair offspring was very weak, suggesting only minor, if any, effects of shared environment between fathers and offspring on resemblance in methylation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Methylation and breeding date</title><p id="Par37">Genetic polymorphism at clock has been shown to be associated with phenological variation in several, though not all, vertebrate species tested so far<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>, including the barn swallow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Besides genetic polymorphism, however, methylation state may also intervene in regulating clock-dependent photoperiodic responses. In a previous study we showed that methylation at the clock poly-Q predicted timing of breeding of old female barn swallows from the same geographical area where the present study was carried out<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. To assess the robustness of the previously reported relationship, here we considerably expanded the sample size of the previous study and confirmed that large methylation at clock poly-Q is associated with early breeding in females but not in males. The relationship between breeding date and methylation at clock poly-Q held for both yearling (not tested in a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>) and older individuals, which are known to breed on average at different times<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. As previously noted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, the sign of the relationship between methylation at clock poly-Q and breeding date is consistent with the expectation. This is the case because increasing methylation levels are expected to reduce the expression of CLOCK/BMAL1 transcription factor, thus reducing the transcriptional activation of the clock genes.</p><p id="Par38">In addition, the present analyses on an expanded sample disclosed a marginally non-significant (P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.062) negative association between breeding date, independently of sex and age, and methylation at the clock 5&#x02032;-UTR <italic>locus</italic>, which was not previously detected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, suggesting that methylation at other regions of clock may also be functionally relevant to timing of breeding. However, we did not find any hint for an association between methylation at other four circadian clock genes and breeding date in both sexes, which were not tested in the previous study.</p><p id="Par39">Populations of birds and other organisms have undergone rapid phenotypic changes in phenological traits during the last decades, likely in response to climate change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>, which have occurred at a pace that may be difficult to explain by invoking relatively slow micro-evolutionary processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>. The observed association between methylation at clock and breeding date (present study) or migration dates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, and the observation of parent-offspring resemblance in methylation at this gene may help explaining rapid phenological change in the barn swallow and, potentially, also in several other bird species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. This is the case because methylation at clock poly-Q, which shows high resemblance between genetic parents and young offspring, may mediate phenological shifts at least in early life stages, with likely carry-over consequences in adulthood, independently of any micro-evolutionary change in population genetic composition at clock.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p id="Par40">In conclusion, we found extensive evidence for differential variation in methylation levels according to sex and age, whose physiolocal and ecological causes remain to be elucidated. In addition, we also showed extensive, yet <italic>locus</italic>-dependent parent-offspring resemblance in methylation levels, with a hint that, for fathers, resemblance with the offspring is more strongly mediated by variation in germline methylation, genetic variation in susceptibility to methylation or sperm factors rather than by extrinsic environmental factors during early life stages. Such intergenerational resemblance in methylation has obvious implications for estimates of genetic heritability of traits that depend on clock genes. There is widespread evidence that rapid phenological changes have occurred in animal populations in response to climate change, and the fast pace of such changes has proven difficult to be reconciled with micro-evolutionary changes in populations. Epigenetic effects can rapidly generate phenotypic plasticity in phenological and other traits. The association between methylation at clock and phenological traits, in combination with intergenerational resemblance in methylation levels can thus provide a mechanistic basis to interpret the rapid phenological changes that populations have recently undergone in response to climate change.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par41">In spring 1999&#x02013;2002 and 2010&#x02013;2016 we captured all adult breeding barn swallows at a total of 12 colonies (=farms) located near Milan (Northern Italy) over nine years. Swallows were sexed, individually marked, subjected to blood sampling for methylation and genetic parentage analyses, and released. The breeding birds were assigned to their nest by observation of color rings. The nests were inspected every 2&#x02013;5 days. When nestlings were 6&#x02013;12 days old, they were also individually marked and a blood sample was collected for methylation and genetic paternity analyses. In all years, all adults at the breeding colonies were captured to identify the marked offspring born in the previous year that were recruited as 1-year-old breeding adults. These recruits were also subject to blood sampling for methylation analyses. Thus, for each breeding pair that generated one (or more; see below) recruited offspring, we measured methylation for the male and the female mates, and for their offspring both as nestlings in the year of birth and in the year following that of birth, when they reached sexual maturity.</p><p id="Par42">Because in the years preceding those of blood sampling for methylation analyses all breeding adults were captured in the study colonies and barn swallows have extremely high breeding philopatry, in each sampling year we could assume that adult individuals that had not been captured in the previous year were ca. 1-year-old individuals, immigrating from other colonies (unless they were local recruits)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Thus, in each year, breeding parents could be assigned to either of two age classes: yearling (1-year old) or &#x02018;older&#x02019; (two or more years old).

When we started the present work no barn swallow genome sequence was available.

Mainly, the genomes of <italic>Ficedula albicollis</italic>, <italic>Phylloscopus trochilus</italic> and <italic>Pseudopodoces humilis</italic>, were used. Except for clock, where PCR primers for the poly-Q exon and 5&#x02032;-UTR region of the gene, specific for barn swallow, were already available<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>, we concentrated our attention on the promoter region of the other selected genes. A 5,000&#x02009;bp region upstream of the predicted ATG start codon was identified in the different species, sequences were aligned and the portions conserved in all species were examined to identify candidate CpG methylation sites, flanked by DNA sequences suitable for PCR primer design. For each specific gene the primers were designed to cover the greatest possible number of CpG sites within the promoter region, taking into account the necessary length of the PCR amplicon, length of the target sequence, and primers that avoided CpGs. Sequences were designed using PyroMark Assay Design software (Qiagen, Germany). The identified primers were used to amplify the homologous sequence present in the barn swallow genome. Those fragments were purified (Wizard SV Gel and PCR clean-up System, Promega, Madison, Wi, USA) and sequenced (BMR genomics, Padua, Italy) to confirm their homology and to design specific PCR primers required for bisulfite pyrosequencing.

The biotin-labelled primers were used to purify the final PCR product using Sepharose beads. The PCR product was bound to Streptavidin Sepharose HP (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) and the Sepharose beads containing the immobilized PCR product were purified, washed, denatured using a 0.2&#x02009;M NaOH solution, and washed again using the Pyrosequencing Vacuum Prep Tool (Pyrosequencing, Inc., Westborough, MA), as recommended by the manufacturer. Then, 0.3 &#x000b5;&#x0039c; pyrosequencing primer was annealed to the purified single-stranded PCR product and pyrosequencing was performed using the PyroMark MD System (Pyrosequencing, Inc.). The degree of methylation was expressed as percentage of methylated cytosines divided by the sum of methylated and unmethylated cytosines (%5mC). Every sample was measured three times and the average of the replicates was used in statistical analyses. Assays which did not result in good quality pyrograms were repeated. If after 3 replicates the pyrogram quality was still not satisfactory according to pyrosequencing quality controls, the measure resulted in a missing value (see below and SOM for sample sizes).
