  <p>Unrooted phylogenetic tree of the ten most common alleles at MHC class II, exon 2 in song sparrows in this study (SOSP‐DAB*), plus 25 other sequences retrieved from GenBank with 94%–98% identity published for other songbird species. These additional sequences are denoted as Emja (Jankowski's bunting, 
   <span class="italic">Emberiza jankowskii</span>), Emci (meadow bunting, 
   <span class="italic">Emberiza cioides</span>), Agph (red‐winged blackbird, 
   <span class="italic">Agelaius phoeniceus</span>), Gefo (medium ground finch, 
   <span class="italic">Geospiza fortis</span>), Geco (Española cactus finch, 
   <span class="italic">Geospiza conirostris</span>), Capa (woodpecker finch, 
   <span class="italic">Cactospiza pallida</span>), Getr (common yellowthroat, 
   <span class="italic">Geothlypis trichas</span>), and Pase (Savannah sparrow, 
   <span class="italic">Passerculus sandwichensis</span>). All sequence names are followed by their GenBank accession number. Phylogeny was inferred by maximum likelihood based on the Jukes–Cantor model (log likelihood = −905.29). Bootstrap values, or the percentage of trees in which the associated alleles clustered together, are shown left of the nodes. Tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site
