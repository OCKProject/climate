  <p>Frequency distribution of pairwise genetic distances at exon 2 of MHC class II, generated by Monte Carlo simulations of 10,000 randomized male–female pairings based on MHC genotypes characterized in the population. The vertical line at 0.623 denotes the average pairwise genetic distance between observed mates, inferred from behavioral and trapping records. Shading corresponds to ±1 
   <span class="italic">SE</span> around this average. Mated pairs were more similar at MHC than expected under random mating (two‐tailed 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.018)
