 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We tested for signatures of positive selection using all available genotypes from the study population in 2014 and 2015 (128 breeding adults). After filtering out chimeras and very low‐frequency reads as described above, we tested for positive selection across our sequenced portion of exon 2, using PAMLx 1.3.1 (Xu &amp; Yang, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0072">2013</a>). Statistical significance was assessed by a 
  <span class="italic">Z</span>‐test, bootstrapped at 500 replicates, and conducted in MEGA 7.0 (Kumar et al., 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0035">2016</a>). To ensure we confidently identified positively selected sites, we tested for positive selection at each codon site separately using multiple complementary approaches implemented in 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.datamonkey.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">datamonkey.org</span> (Weaver et al., 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0068">2018</a>) in addition to PAMLx 1.3.1. Specifically, we tested for positive selection using a mixed‐effects model of evolution (MEME; Murrell et al., 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0045">2012</a>), fixed‐effects likelihood (FEL; Kosakovsky Pond &amp; Frost, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0032">2005</a>), single‐likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC; Kosakovsky Pond &amp; Frost, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0032">2005</a>), and fast, unconstrained Bayesian approximation (FUBAR; Murrell et al., 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0044">2013</a>). Finally, because positive selection is expected to be strongest at peptide‐binding codons, we compared the set of codons our analyses identified as having experienced past positive selection to the set of codons identified as peptide‐binding in humans (Brown et al. 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0011">1993</a>), as well as to those codons recently identified as positively selected in passerines in general (Minias et al., 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0043">2018</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In PAMLx 1.3.1, we used the 
  <span class="italic">codeml</span> command (Yang, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0075">2007</a>) to calculate ω, defined as the ratio of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site (dN) to synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS). Codons (sites) at which ω is less than, equal to, or greater than one is interpreted as having undergone purifying (negative) selection (ω
  <sub>0</sub>,) neutral evolution (ω
  <sub>1</sub>), and positive selection (ω
  <sub>2</sub>), respectively. 
  <span class="italic">Codeml</span> does not make a priori assumptions as to which codons are likely to experience each type of selection (Yang &amp; Swanson, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0076">2002</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To evaluate which model(s) of sequence evolution best explained the observed variation in MHC class II exon 2 sequence in 
  <span class="italic">codeml</span>, we used an information theoretic approach (Burnham &amp; Anderson, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0012">2002</a>), ranking candidate models generated by PAML based on Akaike's information criterion (AIC). Candidate models were M1a (nearly neutral; ω
  <sub>0</sub> &lt; 1, ω
  <sub>1</sub> = 1), M2a (positive selection; ω
  <sub>2</sub> &gt; 1), M8 (positive selection with β distribution; 0 &lt; ω &lt; 1, ω &gt; 1), and M7 (null model counterpart to M8). Models M1a and M2a use the ω distribution to model parameters, and models M7 and M8 use the β distribution, constrained to range between 0 and 1 (Yang, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0074">2000</a>). We were particularly interested in the explanatory power of M2a relative to M1a, and of M8 relative to M7, because models M2a and M8 permit some codons to experience positive selection, whereas the null models M1a and M7 assume that codons experience neutral evolution, but also test for purifying selection. We identified positively selected codons using the Bayes empirical Bayes approach (Yang, Wong, &amp; Nielsen, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0077">2005</a>) implemented in PAMLx 1.3.1 (Xu &amp; Yang, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0072">2013</a>).
