 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Trans‐species polymorphisms involve two or more alleles, each occurring in two or more species. We conducted a nonexhaustive survey for such polymorphisms, including variants that while not identical across species, are more similar to their heterospecific counterpart than to one or more conspecific alleles. We identified the ten most common alleles in the study population of song sparrows and queried them against BLAST in GenBank (Altschul et al., 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0001">1990</a>). For each allele, we identified any heterospecific sequences with at least 94% DNA sequence similarity. In all, we retrieved 25 such sequences from other songbirds.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We constructed a maximum‐likelihood phylogeny of the ten most common song sparrow alleles and the 25 heterospecific sequences, using a Jukes–Cantor model. Interdigitation of song sparrow alleles with those of other species would suggest that allelic diversification occurred prior speciation events and that balancing selection is of ancient origin. Conversely, if the ten song sparrow alleles comprised a monophyletic clade, this would suggest that allelic diversification has occurred more recently than speciation events and that balancing selection is of relatively recent origin.</p>
