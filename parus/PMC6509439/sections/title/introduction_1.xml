 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In jawed vertebrate animals, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a key component of adaptive immune defense. MHC genes encode cell‐surface glycoproteins that recognize and bind antigenic peptides, present them to T cells, and, in the case of nonself antigens, initiate an adaptive immune response (Trowsdale, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0066">1995</a>). MHC genotype determines the suite of pathogens to which an individual can respond, making these loci critical to disease resistance and subject to intense pathogen‐mediated selection. Although both directional (e.g., good genes, locally good genes) and balancing selection (e.g., rare‐allele advantage, heterozygote advantage) are well established to occur at MHC, the latter mode of selection is particularly well‐studied (Bernatchez &amp; Landry, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0003">2003</a>). Supporting the widespread importance of balancing selection at MHC, these loci are the most polymorphic in the vertebrate genome: In some systems, upwards of a thousand alleles are maintained (Robinson, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0055">2003</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Balancing selection at MHC may take the form of negative frequency‐dependent selection, arising from arms races with pathogens (Slade &amp; McCallum, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0063">1992</a>), and/or heterozygote advantage (Niskanen et al., 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0048">2014</a>). Contemporary balancing selection can be demonstrated directly, for example, if disease resistance is higher in individuals bearing rare alleles (Phillips et al., 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0050">2018</a>) or highly heterozygous genotypes (Doherty &amp; Zinkernagel, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0015">1975</a>; McClelland, Penn, &amp; Potts, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0040">2003</a>; Penn, Damjanovich, &amp; Potts, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0049">2002</a>). In addition to such snapshots of current selection regimes, historical balancing selection has also been inferred over longer timescales. Signatures of past balancing selection include the occurrence of trans‐species polymorphisms, thought to be maintained by long‐standing balancing selection that originated before the lineages became reproductively isolated (Hedrick, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0022">1998</a>; Hess &amp; Edwards, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0024">2002</a>; Klein, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0030">1980</a>). Past balancing selection can also be reflected in positive selection, inferred from an excess of nonsynonymous relative to synonymous sequence variation within a population. Although positive selection is rare across most of the genome (Yang &amp; Swanson, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0076">2002</a>), this pattern is observed relatively frequently at MHC (Hughes &amp; Hughes, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0025">1995</a>; Piertney &amp; Oliver, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0051">2006</a>), suggesting that parasite‐mediated balancing selection has often favored new and rare variants at these loci.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The survival advantage associated with particular combinations of alleles suggests that provided individuals can assess the genetic similarity of potential mates, sexual selection in the form of disassortative mating may further reinforce the balancing effects of pathogen‐mediated natural selection. Pathogen‐mediated balancing selection and disassortative mating are both expected to increase individual diversity (heterozygosity): the former by maintaining multiple alleles within the population, and the latter by increasing the likelihood of dissimilar parental genotypes coming together to produce offspring. To the extent that disease resistance varies positively with MHC diversity (e.g., Brambilla, Keller, Bassano, &amp; Grossen, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0009">2018</a>; Hughes &amp; Nei, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0026">1989</a>), disassortative mating at MHC should enhance offspring quality. Indeed, preferences for MHC‐dissimilar mates have been reported for many animal species (Kamiya, O'Dwyer, Westerdahl, Senior, &amp; Nakagawa, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0027">2014</a>), including mammals (e.g., mice 
  <span class="italic">Mus musculus domesticus; </span>Yamazaki et al., 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0073">1979</a>), fish (e.g., brown trout 
  <span class="italic">Salmo trutta; </span>Forsberg, Dannewitz, Petersson, &amp; Grahn, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0018">2007</a>), reptiles (e.g., tuatara 
  <span class="italic">Sphenodon punctatus</span>; Miller, Moore, Nelson, &amp; Daugherty, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0042">2009</a>), seabirds (e.g., blue petrels 
  <span class="italic">Halobaena caerulea</span>; Leclaire, Strandh, Mardon, Westerdahl, &amp; Bonadonna, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0036">2017</a>), and passerine birds (e.g., savannah sparrows 
  <span class="italic">Passerculus sandwichensis</span>; Freeman‐Gallant, Johnson, Saponara, &amp; Stanger, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0019">2002</a>). Nonrandom mating at MHC is thought to be facilitated by olfactory cues, because MHC gene products affect not only pathogen resistance but also individual odor (Brennan &amp; Zufall, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0010">2006</a>; Milinski et al., 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0041">2005</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although disassortative mating at MHC is taxonomically widespread among vertebrate animals, it is not universal. Some species mate assortatively, rather than disassortatively, at MHC (mammals: European badgers 
  <span class="italic">Meles meles</span> (Sin et al., 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0058">2015</a>); wolves 
  <span class="italic">Canis lupus</span> (Galaverni et al., 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0020">2016</a>); amphibians: tiger salamanders 
  <span class="italic">Ambystoma tigrina</span> (Bos, Williams, Gopurenko, Bulut, &amp; Dewoody, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0007">2009</a>); passerine birds: house sparrows 
  <span class="italic">Passer domesticus</span> (Bonneaud, Chastel, Federici, Westerdahl, &amp; Sorci, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0006">2006</a>)). Assortative mating at MHC may provide material benefits to the choosy individual, such as reduced risk of infection with novel pathogens carried by MHC‐dissimilar immigrants (Lewis, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0037">1998</a>). Such assortative mating may also confer genetic benefits to offspring, for example, by reducing outbreeding depression in hybrid zones, reducing the disruption of coadapted sets of alleles (Roberts, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0054">2009</a>), and reducing susceptibility to autoimmune disorders associated with excessive individual diversity at MHC (Wegner, Kalbe, Kurtz, Reusch, &amp; Milinski, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0069">2003</a>). Genetic benefits to assortative mating may be particularly salient in systems in which MHC is highly polygenic due to extensive duplication (Bollmer, Dunn, Whittingham, &amp; Wimpee, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0005">2010</a>; Hess &amp; Edwards, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0024">2002</a>; Minias, Pikus, Whittingham, &amp; Dunn, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0043">2018</a>). In such systems, assortative mating may allow individuals to avoid the disadvantages of producing offspring with an excessive number of alleles at MHC. If so, rather than uniformly reinforcing MHC diversity, sexual selection may under some circumstances counteract—or “balance”—the effects of historical balancing selection.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, some species appear to mate randomly with respect to MHC profiles. This pattern is particularly well‐documented in passerine birds (e.g., great reed warblers 
  <span class="italic">Acrocephalus arundinaceus</span> (Westerdahl, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0070">2004</a>); common yellowthroats 
  <span class="italic">Geothlypis trichas</span> (Bollmer, Dunn, Freeman‐Gallant, &amp; Whittingham, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0004">2012</a>); great tits 
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span> (Sepil et al., 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0057">2015</a>), although not restricted to this group (e.g., brown bears 
  <span class="italic">Ursus arctos</span>; Kuduk et al., 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0034">2014</a>). Random mating at MHC, particularly among free‐living animals, could suggest that any genetic benefits associated with MHC‐mediated pairing may be outweighed by material benefits or other critical traits. Alternatively, this pattern might reflect sensory constraints and an inability to assess potential mates’ MHC profiles. Thus, naturally occurring patterns of mate choice are particularly illuminating for species with documented phenotypic cues of MHC genotype.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We examined MHC‐mediated mate choice in free‐living song sparrows (
  <span class="italic">Melospiza melodia</span>; Figure 
  <a rid="ece35087-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35087-fig-0001">1</a>). In the focal population, chemical composition of preen oil (the major source of body odor in birds) conveys information regarding MHC profiles (Slade et al., 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0061">2016</a>). To our knowledge, song sparrows are the only passerine bird for which this relationship has been demonstrated. We then related patterns of social mate choice to evidence for historical pathogen‐mediated balancing selection, which we inferred from signatures of positive molecular evolution and trans‐species polymorphisms. MHC molecules are generally categorized into two major classes: Classes I and II interact primarily with intracellular (e.g., viruses) and extracellular antigens (e.g., bacteria), respectively (Klein, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0031">1986</a>). We focused on the hypervariable second exon of class II for two reasons. First, chemical composition of preen oil covaries with MHC class II genotype (Slade et al., 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0061">2016</a>), raising the possibility that olfactory cues of class II similarity could facilitate nonrandom mating. Second, this region shows the highest individual‐ and population‐level variability in song sparrows (Slade, Sarquis‐Adamson, Gloor, Lachance, &amp; MacDougall‐Shackleton, 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0060">2017</a>) and other passerines (Minias et al., 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0043">2018</a>). Song sparrows show as many as 26 alleles per individual at MHC class II, implying at least 13 loci (Slade, Sarquis‐Adamson, et al., 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0060">2017</a>), and common yellowthroats as many as 39 alleles per individual, implying at least 20 loci (Bollmer et al., 
  <a rid="ece35087-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35087-bib-0005">2010</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess MHC‐mediated mating, we identified breeding pairs in the wild, calculated genetic distance between mates, and compared observed distances to those expected under random mating. To assess historical evidence of balancing selection, presumably mediated by pathogen resistance, we examined patterns of molecular evolution (i.e., ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous variation), and surveyed for trans‐species polymorphisms by comparing song sparrow sequences at MHC class II to those from other passerine species. Ultimately, we sought to determine whether nonrandom mating at MHC affects individual diversity in a manner congruent with, or opposing, the inferred effects of past selection.</p>
