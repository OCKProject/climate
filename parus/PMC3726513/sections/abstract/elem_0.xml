  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The incidence of tick-borne diseases is increasing in Europe. Sub national information on tick distribution, ecology and vector status is often lacking. However, precise location of infection risk can lead to better targeted prevention measures, surveillance and control.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this context, the current paper compiled geolocated tick occurrences in Belgium, a country where tick-borne disease has received little attention, in order to highlight the potential value of spatial approaches and draw some recommendations for future research priorities.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mapping of 89,289 ticks over 654 sites revealed that ticks such as 
   <span class="italic">Ixodes ricinus</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Ixodes hexagonus</span> are largely present while 
   <span class="italic">Dermacentor reticulatus</span> has a patchy distribution. Suspected hot spots of tick diversity might favor pathogen exchanges and suspected hot spots of 
   <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> abundance might increase human-vector contact locally. This underlines the necessity to map pathogens and ticks in detail. While 
   <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> is the main vector, 
   <span class="italic">I. hexagonus</span> is a vector and reservoir of 
   <span class="italic">Borrelia burgdorferi s.l.,</span> which is active the whole year and is also found in urban settings. This and other nidiculous species bite humans less frequently, but seem to harbour pathogens. Their role in maintaining a pathogenic cycle within the wildlife merits investigation as they might facilitate transmission to humans if co-occurring with 
   <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span>. Many micro-organisms are found abroad in tick species present in Belgium. Most have not been recorded locally but have not been searched for. Some are transmitted directly at the time of the bite, suggesting promotion of tick avoidance additionally to tick removal.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conclusion</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This countrywide approach to tick-borne diseases has helped delineate recommendations for future research priorities necessary to design public health policies aimed at spatially integrating the major components of the ecological cycle of tick-borne diseases. A systematic survey of tick species and associated pathogens is called for in Europe, as well as better characterisation of species interaction in the ecology of tick-borne diseases, those being all tick species, pathogens, hosts and other species which might play a role in tick-borne diseases complex ecosystems.</p>
