 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From 2007 to 2009, ticks from wild cervids (
  <span class="italic">Cervus elaphus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Capreolus capreolus</span>) found dead, hunted or killed for sanitary reasons were collected by the Wild Screen Network disease monitoring activities in Southern Belgium [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B23" href="#B23">23</a>]. Ticks were preserved in 70% ethanol at room temperature, and morphologically identified up to stage and species level (by L. Lempereur and A. Nahayo). Sex and repletion were recorded. 
  <span class="italic">Dermacentor reticulatus</span> was also collected on wild cervids from 2010 to 2012. As 
  <span class="italic">D. reticulatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">D. marginatus</span> may show overlapping phenotypes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B24" href="#B24">24</a>], a PCR was used for confirmation, targeting the 
  <span class="italic">Dermacentor</span> second Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2) with the following primers: ITS_forward (5′-GTG-CGT-CCG-TCG-ACT-CGT-TTT-GA-3′) and ITS_reverse (5′-ACG-GCG-GAC-TAC-GAC-GGA-ATG-C-3′) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B25" href="#B25">25</a>]. The DNA purification was carried out using the NucleoSpin tissue kit for tissue protocol (Macherey-Nagel GmbH, Germany). Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenized on a Tissue Lyser
  <span class="sup">®</span> (Qiagen, GmbH, Germany). PCR conditions were as follow: each reaction was carried out in 50 μL volume containing 4 μl of the DNA preparation, 5 μl of each 2 mM dNTP, 2 μl of each 10 μM oligonucleotide primer, 2 U of TaqDNA polymerase (New England Bio labs) with 5 μl of the 10x PCR supplied buffer and completed to 50 μl with sterile water. PCR was achieved with an initial denaturation cycle at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles (94°C, 45 s), annealing (53°C, 45 s), extension (72°C, 70 s) and a final extension step at 72°C for 10 min. All ITS2 PCR products were sequenced using a modified Sanger method with the Big Dye terminator kit version 3.1 and resolved with a 3730 ABI capillary sequencer (Applied Bio systems). Sequencing reaction was performed with the same primers as for the PCR and sequences aligned by BLAST search.
