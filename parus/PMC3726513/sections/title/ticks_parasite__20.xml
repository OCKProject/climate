 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Birds probably carry ticks to most geographical locations but this does not mean that ticks will survive in these locations. The presence of all pathogenic species of 
  <span class="italic">B. burgdorferi s.l.</span> in 
  <span class="italic">I. frontalis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">I. arboricola</span> in Belgium suggests a potential role in the 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> life cycle [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B7" href="#B7">7</a>]. Up to 50% of 
  <span class="italic">I. frontalis</span>[
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B69" href="#B69">69</a>] and also 
  <span class="italic">I. lividus</span>[
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B70" href="#B70">70</a>] were infected with 
  <span class="italic">B. burgdorferi s.l</span>. in other countries. While seldom reported as biting humans, they might maintain the pathogen cycle in wildlife
  <span class="italic">. I. frontalis</span> (previously 
  <span class="italic">I. pari</span>) is associated with a broad range of songbirds, including thrushes (Turdidae), the Great tit and the collared dove [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B7" href="#B7">7</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B28" href="#B28">28</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B43" href="#B43">43</a>], with up to 30 specimens per bird [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B71" href="#B71">71</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">I. frontalis</span> is occasionally collected by flagging [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B72" href="#B72">72</a>] and evidence suggests that it might be more often present in under-storey vegetation than in nests [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B7" href="#B7">7</a>]. In Belgium it has been found on birds in 11 sites. 
  <span class="italic">I. arboricola</span> is found mainly in Europe but was recorded in Egypt on birds coming back to Europe [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B27" href="#B27">27</a>]. It is a nidicolous tick infesting birds and bats [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B73" href="#B73">73</a>]. The Great tit might be the dominant host but heavy infestations occur on the Common starling and Peregrine falcon [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B32" href="#B32">32</a>]. In Belgium it was recorded in 10 places including 3 sites with 70 specimens (sites 233, 252, 337) where the species was actively surveyed. Specimens were found on birds (TableÂ 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T3" href="#T3">3</a>) and in nests of the House martin. 
  <span class="italic">I. lividus</span> is found on the Sand martin and in their nests [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B27" href="#B27">27</a>]. Experimental records showed that these ticks were collected on the Great tit [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B74" href="#B74">74</a>] and it was found repeatedly in nests of the House martin in Japan [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B75" href="#B75">75</a>].
