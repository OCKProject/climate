 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three tick species are not frequent but bite humans and can establish populations inside houses, making them a potential threat. 
  <span class="italic">Rhipicephalus sanguineus</span> is a tropical tick imported on dogs or rarely with hares, cattles, horses, or plants [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B55" href="#B55">55</a>]. The tick cannot survive outside but multiplies inside houses and dog kennels [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B27" href="#B27">27</a>]. Ticks hunt for hosts by moving actively [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B86" href="#B86">86</a>], can drink free water and survive for years inside. This was shown to cause house infestations in 12 cities in the Netherlands, in Switzerland [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B87" href="#B87">87</a>] and 334 foci in Berlin [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B88" href="#B88">88</a>]. Tick populations can build up in some years from one engorged female to thousands of ticks and eggs [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B87" href="#B87">87</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B89" href="#B89">89</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B90" href="#B90">90</a>]. Eggs are hidden in cracks and crevices and ticks crawl around. Mean temperature probably limits its northward distribution [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B91" href="#B91">91</a>]. This species is rarely found on humans [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B27" href="#B27">27</a>], but seems to more willingly bite humans occasionally, representing at times up to 7% of ticks biting men [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B92" href="#B92">92</a>]. Up to 22 ticks on one man were reported in France [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B93" href="#B93">93</a>]. Some studies suggest that this highlights a change of behaviour related to temperature increase [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B94" href="#B94">94</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B95" href="#B95">95</a>] but this needs to be further investigated. 
  <span class="italic">R. sanguineus</span> is a vector of highly pathogenic 
  <span class="italic">Rickettsiae conorii</span> with confirmed transovarial passage [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B96" href="#B96">96</a>]. Prevalence in nymphs infesting houses can reach up to 40% [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B87" href="#B87">87</a>], against usually 1% [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B94" href="#B94">94</a>] outside. In Belgium, 
  <span class="italic">R. sanguineus</span> was found in houses in Antwerp [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B27" href="#B27">27</a>] (site 210), Hoboken (site 199) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B90" href="#B90">90</a>] and Maldegem (site 71), but also on dogs with a travel history (e.g. sites 338, 426, 536, 684) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B13" href="#B13">13</a>] and on humans (site 210) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B27" href="#B27">27</a>].

  <span class="italic">Argas reflexus</span> is frequent mainly on pigeons but readily bites humans, chickens or horses in buildings in the absence of pigeons [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B43" href="#B43">43</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B55" href="#B55">55</a>]. With 
  <span class="italic">Argas vespertilionis</span> (see below) this species belongs to the Argasidae family, which differs from Ixodidae in their feeding habits. Ticks take many short meals. Nymphs and adults engorge in less than an hour. Ticks feed on eight to twelve hosts per life cycle and spend most of their life in the hosts’ habitat [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B97" href="#B97">97</a>]. Building infestations are undetected for years because of nocturnal host-seeking behaviour, high host specificity and short meals [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B98" href="#B98">98</a>]. However, when pigeons are eradicated, 
  <span class="italic">A. reflexus</span> appear seeking for alternative hosts [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B97" href="#B97">97</a>]. Even if the build-up of a large number of ticks takes years, thousands of ticks were found repeatedly when investigating 188 infested buildings in Germany [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B98" href="#B98">98</a>]. Searching for ticks before renovating is now a current recommendation in Germany. Particularities include a long lifetime of up to 9 years without food, low water loss rate, absorption of water vapour at 75% relative humidity and high tolerance of temperature extremes. Movements are restricted to periods of host-seeking, the remaining time being spent resting aggregated in cracks of walls [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B97" href="#B97">97</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B99" href="#B99">99</a>]. In Belgium ticks were recorded in 7 sites from pigeons, pigeon houses, houses and flats. The bites may cause allergy, anaphylactic shock or loss of consciousness [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B100" href="#B100">100</a>]. It is an unconfirmed vector of human pathogens.

  <span class="italic">Argas vespertilionis</span> parasitizes bats [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B43" href="#B43">43</a>]. They stay the whole year in or near caves or other shelters (roofs of houses), the hosts being present or not. Eggs were found together with eggs of 
  <span class="italic">I. hexagonus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">I. vespertilionis</span>[
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B43" href="#B43">43</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B44" href="#B44">44</a>]. Ticks bite alternative hosts in the absence of their usual host and readily bite man. People reported being bitten in caves or in their bed when bats are in the attics [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B55" href="#B55">55</a>]. Larvae attach for 19 days. Nymphs and adults feed in less than one hour [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B97" href="#B97">97</a>]. They take many small meals on many hosts potentially accumulating pathogens. 
  <span class="italic">A. vespertilionis</span> causes irritating bites on humans and viable strains of 
  <span class="italic">C. burnetii</span> were isolated from ticks which had been dead for a year [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B97" href="#B97">97</a>]. While 84% of museum specimens tested positive for 
  <span class="italic">B. burgdorferi s.l.</span> in the UK [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B78" href="#B78">78</a>], this might reflect sample contamination. 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> sp. organisms related to 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia recurrentis</span>, 
  <span class="italic">B. duttonii</span> and 
  <span class="italic">B. crocidurae</span> were present in numbers in a dying bat in the UK [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B101" href="#B101">101</a>] parasitized by 
  <span class="italic">A. vespertilionis</span>. In Belgium, 11 ticks were found on hosts in four locations.
