 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mapping of 89,289 ticks over 654 sites revealed that ticks such as 
  <span class="italic">Ixodes ricinus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Ixodes hexagonus</span> are largely present while 
  <span class="italic">Dermacentor reticulatus</span> has a patchy distribution. Suspected hot spots of tick diversity might favor pathogen exchanges and suspected hot spots of 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> abundance might increase human-vector contact locally. This underlines the necessity to map pathogens and ticks in detail. While 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> is the main vector, 
  <span class="italic">I. hexagonus</span> is a vector and reservoir of 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia burgdorferi s.l.,</span> which is active the whole year and is also found in urban settings. This and other nidiculous species bite humans less frequently, but seem to harbour pathogens. Their role in maintaining a pathogenic cycle within the wildlife merits investigation as they might facilitate transmission to humans if co-occurring with 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span>. Many micro-organisms are found abroad in tick species present in Belgium. Most have not been recorded locally but have not been searched for. Some are transmitted directly at the time of the bite, suggesting promotion of tick avoidance additionally to tick removal.
