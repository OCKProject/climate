 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Small mammals and particularly rodents are reservoirs of many diseases, but few studies have targeted ticks on rodents in Belgium. Next to 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">I. hexagonus</span>, ticks present on rodents and small mammals include 
  <span class="italic">I. canisuga, I. trianguliceps</span> and 
  <span class="italic">I. acuminatus.</span> These species are carriers of some pathogens (TableÂ 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T5" href="#T5">5</a>) including 
  <span class="italic">B. burgdorferi s.l.</span>[
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B76" href="#B76">76</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B78" href="#B78">78</a>] with 30% prevalence for 
  <span class="italic">I. canisuga</span> in Spain [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B66" href="#B66">66</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">I. canisuga</span> is part of a group of species difficult to discriminate morphologically (including 
  <span class="italic">I. hexagonus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">I. arboricola</span> and 
  <span class="italic">I. lividus</span>) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B27" href="#B27">27</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">I. canisuga</span> is widely distributed and found on half of the foxes in Northern France [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B30" href="#B30">30</a>] but also on polecats, weasels, badgers, Eurasian owls, dogs and cats [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B79" href="#B79">79</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B80" href="#B80">80</a>] with up to 200 specimens reported on one dog [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B81" href="#B81">81</a>]. In Great Britain, 11% of the ticks found on dogs were 
  <span class="italic">I. canisuga</span>[
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B80" href="#B80">80</a>] but none were reported in a Belgian survey [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B13" href="#B13">13</a>]. This nidiculous species is found in nests, burrows or rarely in caves [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B44" href="#B44">44</a>] with fed females climbing upwards in crevices above ground [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B28" href="#B28">28</a>]. In Belgium, only two specimens were found, on a polecat (site 132) and a nest (site 207). 
  <span class="italic">I. trianguliceps</span> is found almost exclusively on micromammals including shrews and rodents, exceptionally on moles, birds or goats and very rarely on humans [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B27" href="#B27">27</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B55" href="#B55">55</a>]. The tick is nidiculous but may wait for hosts on the soil surface [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B82" href="#B82">82</a>]. It is commonly found in wet biotopes including moorlands, meadows, or pine, deciduous and birch forests [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B83" href="#B83">83</a>]. In France, immature are found with immature of 
  <span class="italic">D. reticulatus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">I. acuminatus</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> on the same rodents [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B84" href="#B84">84</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B85" href="#B85">85</a>]. In Belgium, 
  <span class="italic">I. trianguliceps</span> is probably frequent and found on rodents in 8 sites. 
  <span class="italic">I. acuminatus</span> parasitizes small mammals, birds and sometimes humans and is mostly found in nests and burrows [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B28" href="#B28">28</a>]. Only one specimen was found in Belgium on a wood mouse (site 630).
