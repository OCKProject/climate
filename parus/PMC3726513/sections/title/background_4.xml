 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The incidence of tick-borne diseases is increasing in Europe [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B1" href="#B1">1</a>] and follows an increase in the number of tick bites [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B2" href="#B2">2</a>] attributed to two factors: abundance of questing ticks and human exposure to ticks [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B3" href="#B3">3</a>]. Measures targeting human exposure by promoting timely removal of ticks failed to stop the rise in Lyme borreliosis incidence in the Netherlands. On the other hand, this rise was related to an increase in 
  <span class="italic">Ixodes ricinus</span> abundance [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B3" href="#B3">3</a>]. Knowing the local variations in the distribution of the species interacting in tick-borne diseases systems, including ticks, pathogens and species influencing the presence and abundance of ticks and pathogens, could provide new opportunities to estimate potential infection risks locally, identify local hot spots and develop targeted prevention, surveillance and control.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Necessary information is lacking at national and sub national levels in many countries. The first missing information concerns the presence and distribution of tick species. Efforts to characterise tick distribution on a European scale [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B4" href="#B4">4</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B6" href="#B6">6</a>] are limited by the information available at sub national level and only target major vectors such as 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span>. Other tick species less willingly biting humans sometimes harbour high pathogen prevalence’s and might contribute locally to the pathogens’ cycles [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B7" href="#B7">7</a>]. The role of all tick species present should be investigated jointly per pathogen and their distribution clarified. The second missing information concerns the spatial distribution of hosts, predators and species influencing tick populations and pathogens’ prevalence in ticks. The presence and abundance of tick species varies locally according to many factors, including host availability [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B3" href="#B3">3</a>]. Pathogen prevalence in ticks also varies locally according to availability of reservoirs, dead-end hosts and vectors [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B8" href="#B8">8</a>]. The third set of missing information concerns pathogens associated to ticks, their presence, reservoirs, vectors and distribution. Pathogens found using classical PCR methods are those searched for, while others might be present but undetected. Because micro-organisms are increasingly found in ticks, a more systematic approach is needed. The list of micro-organisms found locally or abroad in local tick species could be narrowed by clarifying pathogenicity, vector capacity and presence of reservoirs to provide a list of potential pathogens to investigate locally. This would clarify the spectrum of pathogens potentially transmitted locally through a tick bite.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper, occurrence records and information on tick species relevant for public health have been compiled for a country where tick-borne diseases received little attention. In Belgium, the limited quality of current information is obvious because of proximity to the Netherlands, a country that stands out for efficient investigations of tick-borne diseases. In the Netherlands, tick bites are subject to spatial monitoring [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B9" href="#B9">9</a>]. Lyme borreliosis is monitored by physician surveys targeting 
  <span class="italic">Erythema migrans</span>, the most common symptom [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B2" href="#B2">2</a>]. In Belgium, only Lyme borreliosis is regularly diagnosed. In 2009, official numbers of cases varied from 500 to 1500 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B10" href="#B10">10</a>] or 9000 cases [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B11" href="#B11">11</a>] according to the source. In the Netherlands, 22000 cases were recorded for that same year [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B2" href="#B2">2</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> is believed to occur in Southeast Belgium but records occur elsewhere. Detailed distribution can approximate local exposure to ticks. This is of direct public health interest because according to European guidelines for Lyme borreliosis, an individual presenting an 
  <span class="italic">Erythema migrans</span> is considered a confirmed case if potentially exposed to areas favourable for vector ticks [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B12" href="#B12">12</a>]. Laboratory confirmation and remembering a tick bite are not necessary to confirm this diagnosis.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study aims to show how an integrated spatial approach on tick species in a given country can provide the preliminary information needed for adapted national public health policies by providing: 1) a list of tick species present and their detailed distribution, 2) the micro-organisms they could harbour, 3) ecological traits influencing vector status, 4) implications for public health and suggestions for future research priorities.</p>
