 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Currently, climate change is seen as the most wide-ranging and dangerous threat for plants and animals in the 21st century and beyond [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref001">1</a>]. Climate change scenarios predict that increasing CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations lead to globally rising air and ocean temperatures, acidification of the marine environment and an increase in climate variability ([
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref002">2</a>] and references therein). In the marine environment, the water column undergoes a shallower and more stable stratification under higher temperatures, resulting in a reduced availability of macronutrients for primary producers in the light-exposed upper zone of the ocean [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref003">3</a>]. As a consequence, ocean productivity decreases [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref003">3</a>] and changes in the composition of the food web occur [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref004">4</a>]. Temperature changes can therefore affect ocean productivity and consequently availability of food in space and time [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref005">5</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref006">6</a>]. Such changes in food availability may affect body mass of animals [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref007">7</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref009">9</a>] and/or parental investment into reproduction [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref010">10</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref011">11</a>]. Both responses reflect a form of phenotypic plasticity (i.e. the ability of a single genotype to modify its phenotype in response to short-term environmental conditions; [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref012">12</a>]), a trait that appears particularly important for long-lived animals to adapt to the consequences of global climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref013">13</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Especially in income breeders, i.e. animals that acquire the necessary energy for breeding concurrently [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref014">14</a>], environmentally driven food availability may directly affect reproductive investment of parents. On the other hand, in capital breeders, i.e. animals that accumulate energy reserves for breeding before the actual reproductive period [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref014">14</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref015">15</a>], food availability should affect reproductive investment indirectly, through the link of body mass. In fact, a positive effect of female body mass or body condition (i.e. body mass corrected for body size, thus reflecting energy reserves) on egg and/or offspring mass has been described in various taxonomic groups [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref016">16</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref018">18</a>]. The same relationship, albeit less consistently, has been shown for males [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref017">17</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref019">19</a>]. Mechanistically, male body mass (as well as other sexual signals such as male colouration or song) should indicate “mate quality”, with the consequence of females investing more energy into eggs when they can expect a higher contribution to parental care by their male partner [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref020">20</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref022">22</a>]. Likewise, individual differences in body mass (or body condition) over time may result in differential reproductive investment among these individuals [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref023">23</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref024">24</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considering that body mass may thus affect reproductive investment (linked to life-time reproductive success; [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref025">25</a>]), the effects of global climate change may go beyond a reduction in body mass and reproductive investment as a phenotypically plastic response. In the long term, the effect of decreased food availability on body mass due to increasing temperatures may also have consequences for population dynamics and the conservation status of species.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Penguins show extreme intra-annual variation in their body mass due to extended fasting periods during incubation and moult, when they may lose more than 40% of their body mass [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref026">26</a>]. Both partners invest heavily into parental care and therefore need to acquire the necessary energy reserves prior to breeding, as they will abandon reproductive duties when reaching a critical minimum threshold body mass [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref027">27</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref028">28</a>]. Inter-annual as well as between-individual differences in body mass at arrival in colonies may therefore be directly linked to breeding success [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref029">29</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref031">31</a>]. Consequently, individual body mass in both sexes may be a visual indicator of the future ability to attend the nest and thus the birds’ investment into reproduction. Poisbleau et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref032">32</a>] indeed showed that females adapted resource-allocation according to their male partners’ mass. That said, and considering the extreme intra-annual variation, there is still a complete lack of information on whether body mass and reproductive investment are consistent in individual penguins across time. However, such an individual-based approach with data collected across several years is critically important to differentiate between environmental and individual effects and assessing the level of phenotypic plasticity when analysing variation in body mass and reproductive investment.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Southern rockhopper penguins (
  <span class="italic">Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome</span>) are one of the smallest species of penguins [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref033">33</a>] and ideal to study the phenotypic plasticity in body mass and reproductive investment as a response to their environment. They mainly feed on low trophic level prey (e.g. krill, small fish and squid; [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref034">34</a>]). This makes them sensitive to changes in environmental conditions that affect local primary productivity. As other crested penguins (genus 
  <span class="italic">Eudyptes</span>), they are long-lived, monogamous and exhibit a high fidelity to both nest-site and partner, usually attempting to breed every year [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref035">35</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref036">36</a>], which enabled us to study the same individuals across several years. Furthermore, they are typical capital breeders [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref015">15</a>] and therefore acquire the necessary energy reserves for reproduction before and during their migration to breeding sites. Thus, if environmental conditions affect food availability and body mass, this should also be visible in the reproductive investment.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rockhopper penguins lay a two-egg clutch, with chicks from first-laid (A-)eggs hatching about one day after the chicks from second-laid (B-)eggs [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref037">37</a>]. Maternal investment for B-eggs is higher, as these are on average 28% larger and heavier than A-eggs [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref037">37</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref038">38</a>]. A-chicks often die in the first days after hatching, but occasionally parents fledge both chicks [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref037">37</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref039">39</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The marine foraging habitat of the southern rockhopper penguin is influenced by the cold, nutrient-rich Falkland Current that originates north of the Antarctic Peninsula [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref040">40</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref041">41</a>]. This area has undergone one of the strongest warming trends worldwide [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref042">42</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref043">43</a>], which is reflected in the advancement of breeding, demographic responses and distribution shifts in local Antarctic penguin species (e.g. [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref044">44</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref045">45</a>]). Effects of this warming trend on southern rockhopper penguins therefore appear very likely in the long-term. Considering that the species is currently listed as vulnerable [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref046">46</a>], predictions on how environmental changes affect adult body mass and consequently reproductive investment will be important for conservation actions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using a dataset of individually marked females and males, their body mass at clutch initiation, and egg mass across six years, we 1) tested for the repeatability of body mass and egg mass within individuals to understand whether individuals may be consistent in these traits across several years. We also tested for the repeatability of body condition, in order to assess the potential effect of structural body size on repeatability of body mass. Subsequently, 2) we tested for the expected effect of temperature-related environmental conditions on body mass and consequently 3) of body mass on egg mass. We therefore identified which one of several à-priori chosen temperature-related environmental variables explained variation in body mass across years best, and then tested the following predictions: A) As lower temperatures generally imply higher primary productivity and food availability in the marine ecosystem, we expected body mass of both sexes to be higher under such colder conditions; B) Heavier birds can afford to invest more energy into reproduction (besides egg laying also subsequent feeding of the offspring; e.g. [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref047">47</a>]). We therefore expected egg mass to increase with parental (both female and male) body mass. Due to the pronounced egg-mass dimorphism, we considered A- and B-egg mass separately.
