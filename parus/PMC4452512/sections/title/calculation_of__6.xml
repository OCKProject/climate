 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As differences in body mass may not only reflect energy reserves but also inter-individual differences in structural body size, we calculated a body condition index and determined between-year repeatabilities for both body mass and body condition. Separately for males and females, we tested for a correlation between either of the body size measurements that we had obtained (flipper length, bill depth and bill length) with body mass, and chose the measurement, for which the correlation coefficient was highest (bill depth in both sexes; Pearson R = 0.34, P &lt; 0.001 and R = 0.31 and P &lt; 0.001 for females and males, respectively). We therefore used bill depth and body mass to calculate the scaled mass index [
