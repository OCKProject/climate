 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Out of the three temperature-related environmental variables that we included in our analysis to explain annual variation in adult female and male body mass, SAM showed a slightly better model fit than SSTA. SAM also showed a significant effect on body mass, while SSTA did not—although both variables were significantly negatively correlated. SAM is a broad-scale environmental variable that reflects climatic variability in the entire Southern Ocean [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref051">51</a>]. The—relatively—better fit of this broad-scale environmental variable compared to the local one may be due to the fact that southern rockhopper penguins are migratory during winter (e.g. [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref086" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref086">86</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref087" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref087">87</a>]). They should therefore accumulate their energy reserves for reproduction at wintering grounds or during migration to breeding sites, and thus not in local waters around the Falkland Islands. This result is in line with earlier findings which show a relatively higher importance of broad-scale environmental variables on the breeding behaviour of migratory seabird species compared to resident species [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In agreement with our first prediction, body mass in both sexes increased under positive SAM values, which reflect lower sea surface temperatures and stronger westerly winds, and therefore overall colder conditions and higher primary productivity [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref088" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref088">88</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref089" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref089">89</a>]. SAM-associated climatic conditions (low SST and increased westerly winds) have already previously been associated with better foraging conditions and higher survival rates in the southern rockhopper penguin [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref048">48</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref057">57</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref090" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref090">90</a>]. Furthermore, a recent study identified SAM also as the best explanatory environmental variable for clutch initiation date in rockhopper penguins, with birds breeding earlier under positive SAM and thus colder conditions [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref091" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref091">91</a>]. The same study showed that total clutch mass in rockhopper penguins was best explained by local SST, and females laid heavier eggs under lower SST [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref091" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref091">91</a>]. Within the marine food web, southern rockhopper penguins are located at a relatively low trophic level position compared to other seabird species [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref092" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref092">92</a>], and are therefore likely to benefit rapidly from increased primary productivity. A positive SAM going along with low SST thus implies favourable foraging conditions for southern rockhopper penguins, and under these conditions, rockhopper penguins can reach higher body mass values—and lay heavier eggs. Notably, however, body mass differences among breeding seasons were not very distinct (
  <a rid="pone.0128776.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0128776.g001">Fig 1</a>), and SAM explained at maximum 3% of the variation of body mass in models, thus much less than individual effects. The overall phenotypic response to SAM in the here analysed time period therefore appeared rather limited, and inter-annual variation in body mass was lower compared to data presented by Crawford et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref029">29</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref093" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref093">93</a>]. These differences between our study and those by Crawford et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref029">29</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref093" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref093">93</a>] could, however, be caused by the longer time series and—inevitably—larger environmental variability during their study period. Alternatively, regional differences in the environmental conditions and/or food availability in wintering grounds of rockhopper penguins from Marion Island could be less predictable than those of rockhopper penguins from New Island leading to more variation in body mass among years.
