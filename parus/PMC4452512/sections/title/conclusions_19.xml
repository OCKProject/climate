 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We here showed that—despite substantial intra-annual body mass variation—adult female and male body mass at breeding is highly repeatable across several years in rockhopper penguins. Furthermore, we showed that SAM affected adult body mass, with penguins being heavier under colder conditions, and heavier females producing heavier clutches. Relating our current knowledge to the warming trend of atmosphere and ocean, we can expect that cold environmental conditions that favour high food availability and consequently high body mass and high egg mass in rockhopper penguins (positive SAM) will occur less frequently in the future [

  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref076" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref076">76</a>]). We might furthermore expect that other long-lived species that also rely on the marine food web, especially within the group of seabirds, will in the long-term show similar phenotypic responses.
