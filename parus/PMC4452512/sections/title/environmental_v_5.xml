 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We evaluated the effect of three different environmental variables on adult female and male body mass: the two broad-scale climatic indices Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) as well as local sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA). All three variables are temperature-related and we here also consider them as potential proxies for food availability, as a direct quantification of food availability in the ocean is problematic. SAM is the dominant mode of atmospheric variability in the Southern hemisphere, with distinct effects on wind patterns and sea surface temperatures [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref051">51</a>]. SOI (also referred to as El Niño Southern Oscillation or ENSO) is defined as the air-pressure difference between the mid-Pacific (Tahiti) and west-Pacific (Darwin). Both of these broad-scale climatic indices have effects on sea surface temperatures in the South Atlantic Ocean, with positive SAM and SOI indices coupled to lower surface temperatures [

  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref053">53</a>]. Local SSTA represent a different spatial scale and thus reflect environmental conditions close to the colony. All three variables have previously shown to affect either breeding biology or population dynamics of other seabird species, including (rockhopper) penguins [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similarly to Lynch et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref045">45</a>], we averaged SAM, SOI and SSTA for the three-month period from August through to October. Monthly SAM data were downloaded from the British Antarctic Survey (

For local SSTA (in°C), we selected a 2° grid in the west of New Island (50–52°S, 61–63°W). This area is known to be the major foraging location of this population of southern rockhopper penguins during the breeding season [

  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref062" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref062">62</a>]. Due to their migratory behaviour in winter, it is, however, not proven yet whether the penguins utilize this area shortly before arrival to the breeding sites in spring. Monthly SSTA data were based on the difference between monthly sea surface temperature and the long-term monthly average (data from 1971 to 2000). These data were obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA:
