 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In agreement with the second prediction, A-egg mass and B-egg mass, and consequently overall reproductive investment increased with female body mass. Notably, this effect was stronger for B-eggs than A-eggs. As chicks from A-eggs rarely fledge, they may rather form an “insurance” for the case that the B-egg or chick is lost [

  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref094" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref094">94</a>]. Thus, by investing relatively more into B-eggs when being heavy, females selectively increased their investment into those eggs that would most likely produce fledglings while keeping “insurance costs” low. This also agrees with previous findings from the same population of rockhopper penguins which showed that females decrease their relative investment in A-egg mass compared to B-egg mass with increasing (later) laying dates [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to the effect of female body mass, we could not confirm an effect of male body mass on egg mass—despite the significant repeatability estimates of egg mass for males. These findings are concordant with the literature, in which positive effects of female body mass, body size or a body condition index on egg mass or egg size are well described (e.g. [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref017">17</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref095" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref095">95</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref096" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref096">96</a>]). A significant relationship between male mass and egg mass has been shown less frequently (but see [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref017">17</a>]), even when other related parameters like testis size were positively correlated with egg mass [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref019">19</a>]. In line with this and our current results, Poisbleau et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0128776.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0128776.ref032">32</a>] did not find an effect of male body mass on total clutch mass (i.e. A-egg mass + B-egg mass) either. Thus, this longer-term study confirmed that female rockhopper penguins do not adapt their overall reproductive investment when paired with a heavy male partner.
