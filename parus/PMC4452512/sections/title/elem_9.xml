 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Body mass and also body condition were significantly and highly repeatable in the same individuals across several years both in females and males (
  <a rid="pone.0128776.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0128776.t001">Table 1</a>). Notably, there was no correlation between female and male body mass or body condition (Pearson’s R = -0.03, P = 0.547 for body mass, and R &lt; 0.01 and P = 0.882 for body condition), indicating that birds did not pair assortatively according to body mass or condition.

Similarly, egg mass was highly repeatable for males that were paired with the same female partner for two or more years. When paired with different female partners, repeatability estimates for egg mass in males were markedly lower, albeit still highly significant (
