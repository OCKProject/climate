 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Current evidence from across Europe highlights the importance of the 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> complex in the current and potential future transmission of important medical and veterinary arboviruses. It is therefore imperative that a concerted effort be made between research and governmental agencies across Europe to better target future sampling efforts to answer the remaining questions concerning the ecology and genetics of mosquito and pathogen that influence this association.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Surveillance for mosquito-borne viruses in mosquito populations varies widely across Europe [
  <a rid="B17-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-ijerph-15-00389">17</a>]. Extensive surveillance is conducted in northern Italy where cases of WNV occur annually in an attempt to detect virus in mosquitoes populations [
  <a rid="B202-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B202-ijerph-15-00389">202</a>]. This offers the opportunity for public health authorities to warn health professionals before the occurrence of human disease. Both Germany and Switzerland conduct extensive surveillance to detect invasive mosquitoes and the emergence of virus infections. This has proven useful in mapping the spread of USUV across Europe. In the majority of countries across Europe, however, surveillance is reactive in response to disease outbreaks or changes in the mosquito population [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The extent of the distribution of the specific forms of 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> is just beginning to be defined. However, evidence indicates that latitudinal differences in the distribution of 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> forms and their hybrids, together with the distribution of the sibling species 
  <span class="italic">Cx. torrentium</span>, may influence the transmission dynamics of arboviruses in Europe. However, the picture is more complicated than simply this fact and will include the effect of different environmental conditions on the life cycle and behaviour of the mosquitoes, as well as intrinsic factors such as vector competence. In addition, despite the importance of this species in current and potential pathogen transmission, increasing our understanding of how species complexes as a whole function within an ecosystem to contribute to pathogen transmission is vitally important. For example, Rift Valley fever virus outbreaks involve multiple species that act sequentially depending on environmental circumstances. Therefore, maintenance of surveillance approaches that target a wide range of mosquito species should be used.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Current evidence continues to support the importance of birds as a major blood-meal host for 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> across Europe. However, there is considerable evidence from blood meal and host-baited studies that ecoform pipiens can also take blood meals from humans and other mammals. Conversely, ecoform molestus also feeds to a considerable extent on birds, in many cases to the same degree as the pipiens ecoform. Therefore, it may be necessary to take a broader view and consider the potential for both ecoforms to act as enzootic and bridge vectors of medically important arboviruses.
