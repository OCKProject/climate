 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sindbis virus (SINV) was first isolated from a pool of 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> and/or 
  <span class="italic">Culex univittatus</span> (Theobald, 1901) mosquitoes collected from the Sindbis health district, 30 km north of Cairo, Egypt [
  <a rid="B70-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B70-ijerph-15-00389">70</a>]. Infection causes a rash and long-lasting polyarthritis that has been recognised in northern Europe for decades [
  <a rid="B23-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-ijerph-15-00389">23</a>,
  <a rid="B71-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B71-ijerph-15-00389">71</a>]. It is known colloquially as Ockelbo disease in Sweden, Pogosta disease in Finland and Karellian fever in Russia. In South Africa it has been reported to cause disease in horses [
  <a rid="B72-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B72-ijerph-15-00389">72</a>]; SINV infection in horses or other domestic animals has not been observed in Europe, possibly due to a lack of surveillance. The virus circulates between birds and mosquitoes with occasional spill over into human populations [
  <a rid="B73-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B73-ijerph-15-00389">73</a>]. Phylogenetic analysis of SINV suggests that there is long distance translocation of the virus, possibly through bird migration [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Experimental studies have shown that a range of mosquito species present in Scandinavia are capable of transmitting SINV but that 
  <span class="italic">Culex torrentium</span> (Martini, 1925) demonstrated higher infection and transmission rates than 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> [
  <a rid="B75-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B75-ijerph-15-00389">75</a>,
  <a rid="B76-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B76-ijerph-15-00389">76</a>]. Subsequent field studies have shown higher rates of SINV infection in wild caught 
  <span class="italic">Cx. torrentium</span> than in other species [
  <a rid="B77-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B77-ijerph-15-00389">77</a>] and this is now considered the most important vector species. Although 
  <span class="italic">Cx. torrentium</span> is found across Europe and the Middle East, few cases of SINV are reported outside of northern Europe, and are limited to occasional virus isolations [
  <a rid="B78-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B78-ijerph-15-00389">78</a>]. The susceptibility to infection of 
  <span class="italic">Cx. torrentium</span> for WNV or USUV has not been defined [
