 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Usutu virus was first detected in Europe in dead blackbirds (
  <span class="italic">Turdus merula</span>) collected following a wild bird die-off event in Tuscany, Italy, in 1996 [
  <a rid="B64-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B64-ijerph-15-00389">64</a>]. A later emergence in 2001 is better documented due to a highly visible die-off of birds around Vienna, Austria. Submission of blackbirds, great gray owls (
  <span class="italic">Strix nebulosa</span>) and a barn swallow (
  <span class="italic">Hirundo rustica</span>) resulted in detection of virus by histopathology and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [
  <a rid="B43-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43-ijerph-15-00389">43</a>]. Usutu virus has emerged in countries across southern Europe and it has subsequently spread north across western and central Europe [
  <a rid="B65-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B65-ijerph-15-00389">65</a>,
  <a rid="B66-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B66-ijerph-15-00389">66</a>]. A small but growing number of documented cases of human infection with USUV have been recorded, although these have often been in patients with additional underlying health conditions [
  <a rid="B67-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67-ijerph-15-00389">67</a>,
  <a rid="B68-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68-ijerph-15-00389">68</a>]. However, most cases of USUV infection appear to be asymptomatic [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phylogenetic analysis using complete USUV genomes suggests that there have been multiple introductions of the virus into Europe over the past 50 years and that migrating birds are the most likely mechanism of translocation over long and short distances [
  <a rid="B20-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-ijerph-15-00389">20</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">Culex pipiens</span> originating from a colony established in the Netherlands have been shown experimentally to be highly susceptible to infection with USUV when compared to WNV, although the ecoform status of the mosquitoes used was not explored [
