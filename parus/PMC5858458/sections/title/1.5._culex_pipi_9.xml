 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A critical behavioural trait relevant to arthropod-borne virus transmission is a vectorâ€™s host feeding pattern. Host selection determines the exposure of a mosquito to pathogens and its involvement in enzootic, zoonotic or anthroponotic transmission cycles [
  <a rid="B131-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B131-ijerph-15-00389">131</a>]. Host selection by mosquitoes is a complex phenomenon, influenced by an interplay of genetic and environmental factors [
  <a rid="B132-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B132-ijerph-15-00389">132</a>]. The latter includes the local and seasonal presence of vertebrate hosts [
  <a rid="B133-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B133-ijerph-15-00389">133</a>], host defensive behaviour against biting [
  <a rid="B134-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B134-ijerph-15-00389">134</a>] and the presence of pathogens in the arthropod, host, or both, which may influence rates of vector-host contact [
  <a rid="B135-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B135-ijerph-15-00389">135</a>,
  <a rid="B136-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B136-ijerph-15-00389">136</a>,
  <a rid="B137-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B137-ijerph-15-00389">137</a>,
  <a rid="B138-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B138-ijerph-15-00389">138</a>,
  <a rid="B139-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B139-ijerph-15-00389">139</a>]. Evidence for preferential feeding on specific hosts may be derived from studies that identify the blood meal hosts of wild-caught engorged mosquitoes, or semi-field or laboratory tests offering a choice of feeding from different hosts [
  <a rid="B132-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B132-ijerph-15-00389">132</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The pipiens ecoform is considered to be almost exclusively ornithophilic (bird-feeding), whilst the molestus ecoform feeds on other mammalian hosts, including humans [
  <a rid="B140-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B140-ijerph-15-00389">140</a>,
  <a rid="B141-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B141-ijerph-15-00389">141</a>] (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-15-00389-t002" href="#ijerph-15-00389-t002">Table 2</a>). Here, we collated data from 29 European studies identifying the blood meals of 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-15-00389-t004" href="#ijerph-15-00389-t004">Table 4</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Collectively, these data show feeding of 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> on a wide range of hosts encompassing mammals (eight orders, 12 families and 17 species), birds (14 orders, 33 families, 82 species) and reptiles (two orders, three families, three species). Eight of these studies identified specimens to ecoform, and three of these [
  <a rid="B117-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B117-ijerph-15-00389">117</a>,
  <a rid="B147-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B147-ijerph-15-00389">147</a>,
  <a rid="B149-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B149-ijerph-15-00389">149</a>] successfully collected blood-fed specimens of both ecoforms and their hybrids, identified by sequence analysis of the CQ11 locus. Collectively, these latter three studies identified both ecoforms and their hybrids as feeding on both mammals and birds. Interestingly, all found that birds were highly utilised by the pipiens and molestus ecoforms plus their hybrids (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-00389-f004" href="#ijerph-15-00389-f004">Figure 4</a>), with no significant differences in feeding preference between the forms. These results contrast with findings in the USA showing that specimens with a higher proportion of molestus ancestry fed more frequently on humans [
  <a rid="B170-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B170-ijerph-15-00389">170</a>,
  <a rid="B171-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B171-ijerph-15-00389">171</a>]. Reasons for these disparate findings may lie with geographic or seasonal differences in host availability, the relatively low sample sizes inherent with the challenges of collecting blood-fed specimens, or with differences in the microsatellite markers used to identify the forms in each study.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Relatively few manipulative comparisons of host selection, whereby mosquitoes are offered choices to feed on different hosts, have been carried out with 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> under field, semi-field or laboratory conditions. Preferential attraction was recorded towards chicks by the pipiens ecoform, to humans by the molestus ecoform, and intermediate feeding behaviour in pipiens/molestus hybrids from field-collected populations in Chicago, USA [
  <a rid="B126-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B126-ijerph-15-00389">126</a>]. Choice tests can be an effective method to compare feeding preferences between individual hosts, but to our knowledge, these have not been conducted to compare the ecoforms and hybrids of European populations of 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Field studies collecting mosquitoes attempting to feed on live human or animal baits can also greatly contribute to our understanding of host preference [
  <a rid="B172-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B172-ijerph-15-00389">172</a>]. Several field studies have reported human-biting 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span>; studies in Portugal [
  <a rid="B149-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B149-ijerph-15-00389">149</a>] and the UK [
  <a rid="B173-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B173-ijerph-15-00389">173</a>] collected both pipiens and molestus ecoforms by human landing catch. Although the study in Portugal identified human blood in one engorged pipiens female [
  <a rid="B149-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B149-ijerph-15-00389">149</a>], the specimens collected by human landing catch in both studies did not contain blood to permit confirmation of human feeding. However, this collection method is considered the gold-standard approach for assessing mosquito-human contact rates, with mosquito feeding (or at least probing) assumed to occur after landing [
  <a rid="B172-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B172-ijerph-15-00389">172</a>]. Combining these field data with laboratory choice tests and, although challenging, with blood meal studies that are coupled with comprehensive surveys of vertebrate hosts in the sample area to assess the impact of host availability, will contribute further to our understanding of host selection and preference of members of the 
  <span class="italic">Culex pipiens</span> complex. However, studies where wild mosquitoes are offered a choice of host are very rare and findings such as those reported above could therefore represent opportunistic feeding rather than a true preference.
