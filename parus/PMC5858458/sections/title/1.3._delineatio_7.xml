 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Differences in the structure of the male genitalia can be used to distinguish members of the complex [
  <a rid="B85-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B85-ijerph-15-00389">85</a>]. However, the lack of distinguishing morphological features to separate females adds complication to the identification of surveillance trap catches where females are usually the target. The presence or absence of behavioural traits such as autogeny (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-15-00389-t002" href="#ijerph-15-00389-t002">Table 2</a>) have been used to identify between the forms; however, this approach is not a consistently reliable method for separating the ecoforms. Furthermore, demonstrating autogeny in wild-caught populations is labour intensive, requiring the collection and rearing of larvae, and is therefore impractical for large scale screening. This has led to the development of several molecular techniques for differentiating the two ecoforms and their hybrids (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-15-00389-t003" href="#ijerph-15-00389-t003">Table 3</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Initial differentiation techniques were aimed at identifying polymorphisms at 20 loci in order to differentiate above and belowground breeding populations associated with the London Underground, and to examine gene flow [
  <a rid="B92-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B92-ijerph-15-00389">92</a>]. This method was developed to include sequence comparison of up to 11 concatenated sequences to enable phylogenetic distinction of the two ecoforms [
  <a rid="B85-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B85-ijerph-15-00389">85</a>]. An alternative approach compared polymorphic microsatellite markers amplified to generate fingerprints for autogenous and anautogenous populations [
  <a rid="B90-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B90-ijerph-15-00389">90</a>,
  <a rid="B96-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B96-ijerph-15-00389">96</a>]. Subsequent methodologies have largely been based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA sequencing or restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-15-00389-t003" href="#ijerph-15-00389-t003">Table 3</a>). Many of these have focused on a single locus to distinguish between the two forms, particularly the CQ11 locus [
  <a rid="B97-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B97-ijerph-15-00389">97</a>] (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-00389-f001" href="#ijerph-15-00389-f001">Figure 1</a>). This end-point PCR approach is often preceded by the use of a multiplex PCR to separate 
  <span class="italic">Cx. torrentium</span> from 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> [
  <a rid="B98-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B98-ijerph-15-00389">98</a>] (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-00389-f001" href="#ijerph-15-00389-f001">Figure 1</a>), although identification via comparative wing morphometrics can be used for this [
  <a rid="B99-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B99-ijerph-15-00389">99</a>]. In a further modification, fluorescent probes have been developed that selectively bind to the polymorphisms within the same real-time PCR amplification [
  <a rid="B100-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B100-ijerph-15-00389">100</a>]. Some authors have expressed caution in using only a single diagnostic marker for the identification of the 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> complex [
  <a rid="B101-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B101-ijerph-15-00389">101</a>,
  <a rid="B102-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B102-ijerph-15-00389">102</a>], and advocate the use of multiple targets for maximum taxonomic clarity. For example, although a nucleotide substitution from G to A at the 3rd position of the 68th codon of the COI gene was reported as being diagnostic for form molestus over form pipiens [
  <a rid="B91-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B91-ijerph-15-00389">91</a>], this finding was not replicated in a subsequent UK study that targeted the same region [
  <a rid="B103-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B103-ijerph-15-00389">103</a>]. In an attempt to avoid differences between assays, a recent study employed a combined four-point approach to characterising Mediterranean 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> populations, using assays targeting the CQ11, 
  <span class="italic">ace-2</span>, COI and 
  <span class="italic">Wolbachia</span> (
  <span class="italic">w</span>Pip) infection typing markers [
  <a rid="B102-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B102-ijerph-15-00389">102</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An alternative approach to species delineation is the application of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). While this application is still in relative infancy, it has been used for the identification of various vector groups [
  <a rid="B111-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B111-ijerph-15-00389">111</a>,

  <a rid="B113-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B113-ijerph-15-00389">113</a>] and in future it may be possible to use this to define ecoforms of 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> based on changes in protein expression.
