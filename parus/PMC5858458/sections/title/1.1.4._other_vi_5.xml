 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The other 
  <span class="italic">Culex</span>-transmitted viruses detected in Europe include Lednice virus (LEDV) and Rabensberg virus (RABV). LEDV, a bunyavirus, was isolated from 
  <span class="italic">Culex modestus</span> (Ficalbi, 1889) in the Czech Republic in 1963 [
  <a rid="B80-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B80-ijerph-15-00389">80</a>]; this mosquito remains the only known vector [
  <a rid="B81-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B81-ijerph-15-00389">81</a>]. RABV is a more recent isolation from the Czech Republic and is a virus related to WNV. It was first isolated from pools of 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> collected in 1997 from South Moravia near the border with Austria [
  <a rid="B82-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B82-ijerph-15-00389">82</a>]. Batai virus (BATV) was originally detected in 
  <span class="italic">Culex gelidus</span> (Theobald, 1901) in Malaysia in 1955 [
  <a rid="B24-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijerph-15-00389">24</a>], but in Europe it has been associated with Anopheline species [
