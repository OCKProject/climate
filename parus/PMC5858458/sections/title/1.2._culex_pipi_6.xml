 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The taxonomy of the 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> complex remains a much debated subject due to the morphological similarity between some species and the varied behaviours exhibited within species [
  <a rid="B84-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B84-ijerph-15-00389">84</a>,
  <a rid="B85-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B85-ijerph-15-00389">85</a>,
  <a rid="B86-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B86-ijerph-15-00389">86</a>,
  <a rid="B87-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B87-ijerph-15-00389">87</a>]. The first description of 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> is attributed to Carl Linnaeus in 1758. The complex (or assemblage [
  <a rid="B86-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B86-ijerph-15-00389">86</a>]) of species includes 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Cx. quinquefasciatus</span> (Say, 1823), 
  <span class="italic">Cx. australicus</span> (Dobrotworsky and Drummond, 1953) and 
  <span class="italic">Cx. globocoxitus</span> (Dobrotworsky, 1953) with varied geographical distribution that has been modified by the translocation of species between continents [
  <a rid="B88-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B88-ijerph-15-00389">88</a>]. Additionally, some authors include the sibling species 
  <span class="italic">Cx. torrentium</span> in taxonomic studies of the complex owing to its similar morphology and larval ecology [
  <a rid="B85-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B85-ijerph-15-00389">85</a>,
  <a rid="B89-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B89-ijerph-15-00389">89</a>]. Within the species 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> there are two ecoforms (sometimes called biotypes) recognised, pipiens (L.) and molestus (Forskål, 1775), based primarily on ecological and behavioural traits. The term molestus was first introduced by Petrus Forskål who recognised the species during an expedition to Egypt and the Arabian Peninsula. The behavioural and physiological traits reported as broadly separating the two forms are summarised in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-15-00389-t002" href="#ijerph-15-00389-t002">Table 2</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evidence from several studies of European 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> populations has indicated that ecoform molestus is a distinct species separate from ecoform pipiens and arose from a single speciation event [
  <a rid="B85-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B85-ijerph-15-00389">85</a>,
  <a rid="B90-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B90-ijerph-15-00389">90</a>,
  <a rid="B91-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B91-ijerph-15-00389">91</a>]. This contrasts with the alternative theory that molestus populations arose from repeated and independent colonisations of underground habitats by aboveground pipiens populations [
  <a rid="B92-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B92-ijerph-15-00389">92</a>,
  <a rid="B93-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B93-ijerph-15-00389">93</a>,
  <a rid="B94-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B94-ijerph-15-00389">94</a>]; other studies have shown equivocal results [
