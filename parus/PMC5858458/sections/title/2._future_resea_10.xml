 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our understanding of the 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> complex has expanded rapidly in recent years, but there remain many intriguing and as yet unexplored questions concerning their biology and ecology. Below we highlight four areas of research important to defining the impact of 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> on present and future virus transmission in Europe.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(1)窶ジhat factors lead to successful arbovirus transmission by populations of 
  <span class="italic">Culex pipiens</span>?
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The distribution of 
  <span class="italic">Culex</span>-transmitted arboviruses is not uniform across Europe. Identification of the different factors that lead to successful transmission of viruses and those that preclude virus emergence are critical to understanding this distribution. Northern Europe has seasonally abundant populations of 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> that appear to support transmission of USUV but not WNV [
  <a rid="B174-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B174-ijerph-15-00389">174</a>]. This suggests environmental and climatic factors alone cannot explain the absence of WNV from countries such as Germany, Poland, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom. In North America, 
  <span class="italic">Culex</span> species, including 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span>, enabled rapid spread of West Nile virus across the continent with no apparent barriers. Expanding upon recent work [
  <a rid="B120-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B120-ijerph-15-00389">120</a>] investigating the distribution of the ecoforms of 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> across Europe is essential to furthering our understanding of the relationship between the ecoforms and their hybrids with current arbovirus distribution patterns. Furthermore, as many important arboviruses exist in bird-mosquito-bird transmission cycles, identifying hotspots of high mosquito and resident and migratory bird populations will enable better targeting of interventions in advance of a novel virus introduction. Such hotspots may include rural wetland areas [
  <a rid="B168-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B168-ijerph-15-00389">168</a>,
  <a rid="B175-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B175-ijerph-15-00389">175</a>] but could, increasingly, include more urbanised areas [
  <a rid="B176-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B176-ijerph-15-00389">176</a>,
  <a rid="B177-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B177-ijerph-15-00389">177</a>,
  <a rid="B178-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B178-ijerph-15-00389">178</a>]. At the level of the mosquito, there remain many questions regarding the complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors that influence vector competence and mosquito-virus-host interactions. These include the extrinsic incubation period, viral adaptivity, mosquito and host immunity and mosquito behaviour. In reference to the latter, newly-emerged Australian ecoform molestus females preferentially delay blood-feeding until after laying their first egg batch [
  <a rid="B179-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B179-ijerph-15-00389">179</a>]. If such high levels of obligatory autogeny exist in European populations, this would not only provide a highly beneficial population survival mechanism but may influence the transovarial maintenance of virus through several generations. Finally, the survival of virus in overwintering 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> is likely a critical factor involved in the maintenance of transmission cycles in Europe; a recent study detected WNV RNA in overwintering 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> in the Czech Republic [
  <a rid="B180-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B180-ijerph-15-00389">180</a>]. Further investigation of the factors influencing overwintering survival, post-hibernation emergence, and subsequent dispersal of 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> and its ecoforms, as conducted elsewhere [
  <a rid="B181-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B181-ijerph-15-00389">181</a>,
  <a rid="B182-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B182-ijerph-15-00389">182</a>], will improve our understanding of the role of overwintering in virus maintenance, particularly in regions of Europe that experience colder winters.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(2)窶ジhat are the potential impacts of a changing environment?</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">That climate changes are occurring and will impact both native and non-native arthropod fauna worldwide is well established. The potential influences on arthropod-borne pathogens have been explored [
  <a rid="B25-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-ijerph-15-00389">25</a>,
  <a rid="B26-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-ijerph-15-00389">26</a>,
  <a rid="B27-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-ijerph-15-00389">27</a>], although the specific effects will vary considerably according to mosquito species biology and the region concerned [
  <a rid="B183-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B183-ijerph-15-00389">183</a>]. Anthroponotic changes influencing the structure of the environment may be equally important in altering mosquito populations at the local or regional scale [
  <a rid="B184-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B184-ijerph-15-00389">184</a>,
  <a rid="B185-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B185-ijerph-15-00389">185</a>]. For example, the creation of urban wetlands as part of sewage treatment works [
  <a rid="B178-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B178-ijerph-15-00389">178</a>] could increase available eutrophic habitat particularly suitable for ecoform molestus [
  <a rid="B85-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B85-ijerph-15-00389">85</a>]. Increasing urbanisation could provide additional container habitats suitable for existing urban mosquito populations, or facilitate an adaptive shift by other species towards the utilisation of urban habitats, as evidenced by an increasing urban population of 
  <span class="italic">Anopheles plumbeus</span> (Stephens, 1828) in various parts of north-western Europe [
  <a rid="B176-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B176-ijerph-15-00389">176</a>,
  <a rid="B177-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B177-ijerph-15-00389">177</a>,
  <a rid="B186-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B186-ijerph-15-00389">186</a>,
  <a rid="B187-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B187-ijerph-15-00389">187</a>]. Urban centres could be at further risk of vector-borne disease if existing temperature rises were compounded by the urban heat island effect in such locations, although the precise effects of this phenomenon on pathogen transmission risk are likely to be complex [
  <a rid="B185-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B185-ijerph-15-00389">185</a>,
  <a rid="B188-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B188-ijerph-15-00389">188</a>]. The storage of water during periods of drought could additionally provide increased urban habitat for mosquito breeding [
  <a rid="B189-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B189-ijerph-15-00389">189</a>], whilst the reversion of arable land to wetlands could provide further habitat for 
  <span class="italic">Culex</span> mosquitoes and provide a location where grazing animals come into contact with migratory birds [
  <a rid="B175-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B175-ijerph-15-00389">175</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(3)窶ジhat are the key factors influencing rates of hybridisation?</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The variable rates of hybridisation in European populations between sympatric populations of pipiens and molestus ecoforms indicate the existence of multiple barriers to hybridisation that extend beyond simple allopatric reproductive isolation. Although in parts of Europe hybridisation rates are low, rates in southern Europe may approach those reported from northern Africa [
  <a rid="B122-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B122-ijerph-15-00389">122</a>,
  <a rid="B190-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B190-ijerph-15-00389">190</a>]. To what extent reproductive barriers are behavioural, such as environmental requirements for swarm formation or specificity of matched wing beat frequencies [
  <a rid="B191-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B191-ijerph-15-00389">191</a>,
  <a rid="B192-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B192-ijerph-15-00389">192</a>], or intrinsic, for example mediated by commensal 
  <span class="italic">Wolbachia</span> strains and cytoplasmic incompatibility [
  <a rid="B109-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B109-ijerph-15-00389">109</a>,
  <a rid="B193-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B193-ijerph-15-00389">193</a>], is currently unknown. Furthermore, although human-mediated transport of mosquitoes may facilitate long-distance species translocation and provide opportunities for hybridisation aboveground [
  <a rid="B121-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B121-ijerph-15-00389">121</a>], to what extent are belowground molestus populations able to disperse within and beyond their existing habitats? Approaches such as the use of mark-release-recapture aided by fluorescently- or immune-marked insects [
  <a rid="B194-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B194-ijerph-15-00389">194</a>,
  <a rid="B195-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B195-ijerph-15-00389">195</a>] in belowground systems could, for example, reveal the dispersal potential of form molestus.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(4)窶ォow do the olfactory responses to semiochemicals of host and environmental origin differ?</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthering the understanding of the responses of the 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> complex to volatile compounds produced by vertebrate hosts, nectar sources and larval habitats will facilitate the development of novel repellents, attractants and more optimal approaches to surveillance and control. To date, the olfactory responses of 
  <span class="italic">Culex</span> species to host odours have been investigated for 
  <span class="italic">Cx. quinquefasciatus</span> [
  <a rid="B196-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B196-ijerph-15-00389">196</a>,
  <a rid="B197-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B197-ijerph-15-00389">197</a>], and to flower odours in ecoform pipiens [
  <a rid="B198-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B198-ijerph-15-00389">198</a>] and molestus [
  <a rid="B199-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B199-ijerph-15-00389">199</a>]. However, directly comparative studies of the olfactory responses between the ecoforms have not been conducted, and paired trap comparison studies comparing above- and belowground collections remain unexplored. Recent work has shown that ecoforms pipiens and molestus, plus their hybrids, were collected in similar ratios by BG-Sentinel and Mosquito Magnet Liberty Plus traps [
  <a rid="B120-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B120-ijerph-15-00389">120</a>]. However, 
  <span class="italic">Cx. torrentium</span> was found to be under-represented in CDC light trap catches in Germany and Sweden in comparison to 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> [
  <a rid="B200-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B200-ijerph-15-00389">200</a>,
  <a rid="B201-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B201-ijerph-15-00389">201</a>] and although the authors did not molecularly identify specimens to ecoform, these results illustrate the need for further field investigation using other trap types.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, it is vital that data on members of the 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> complex is collected from countries across Europe and at a range of geographic scales that reflect different ecological zones. Comparisons should also be made between urban and rural populations and those in intermediate areas. Habitat differences may be more important in influencing distribution and hybridisation rates than broader latitudinal trends [
  <a rid="B118-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B118-ijerph-15-00389">118</a>,
  <a rid="B120-ijerph-15-00389" ref-type="bibr" href="#B120-ijerph-15-00389">120</a>]. Studies conducted at the regional, national and pan-European level will provide critical data to model trends in mosquito biology and virus transmission, and to better inform regional approaches to surveillance and control. However, these large-scale studies cannot replace targeted field-based studies which are critical to understand the factors influencing transmission at the level of the vector and its hosts in different local habitats. Finally, although these research questions span several fields, it has become increasingly clear that future studies should, insofar as is possible, identify 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> to the level of both species and ecoform. The continued decrease in costs and increase in the speed of molecular identification approaches will no doubt greatly contribute towards this goal.
