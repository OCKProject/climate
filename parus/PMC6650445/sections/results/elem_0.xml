  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our literature search focused on studies that investigated how change in temperature, precipitation or both affects morphological or phenological traits in arachnids, insects, amphibians, reptiles, birds or mammals. To assess all three conditions necessary for inferring adaptive responses to climate change (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), we selected publications reporting the following data from natural populations during at least 6 years: (1) annual values of a climatic variable, (2) annual mean values (+SE) of a phenotypic trait at the population level and (3) annual linear selection differentials measured on the trait(s). Annual linear selection differentials were measured as the slope of relative fitness on standardized trait values

   </span> (Methods, Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1d</a>) and reported for at least one of the three fitness components: adult survival, reproduction (measured as number of offspring) or recruitment (measured as number of offspring contributing to the population size the following year).
  </p>
  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A search on Web of Knowledge (Methods) returned 10,090 publications, of which 58 were retained. These publications reported data on 4835 studies (representing 1413 non-aquatic species in 23 countries) that contained information on phenotypic responses to climate change. Out of these 4835 studies, a subset of 71 studies (representing 17 species in 13 countries) contained all the information required to assess whether responses were adaptive (including selection differentials, Methods). We stored information on the 4835 studies in the ‘PRC’ dataset, and information on the subset of the 71 studies in the ‘PRC with Selection data’ (PRCS) dataset. We used the PRC dataset to assess how representative the PRCS subset was with regard to (1) the observed change in climatic factors over time, and (2) the change in phenotypic traits in response to climatic factors. We define a ‘study’ as a dataset satisfying our selection criteria for a unique combination of a species, location, climatic factor, phenotypic trait and fitness component. We had more studies than publications because some publications reported data for several species, several climatic factors and/or several phenotypic traits.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Structure of PRC and PRCS datasets</div>
  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The studies in both datasets were predominantly conducted in the Northern Hemisphere (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). The PRC dataset was heavily biased towards arthropods (88% of studies), with other taxa constituting only a small proportion of the studied species (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). In contrast, the PRCS dataset was heavily biased towards birds (95%). We found no studies for insects and amphibians that reported annual selection data and satisfied all other inclusion criteria. Among the climatic variables used, temperature dominated both datasets (&gt;70%, Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>); therefore, we focused on the effects of temperature changes in the main text and provide results for precipitation in Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a> and Supplementary Note 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>. The majority of studies focused on phenological (rather than morphological) traits, with this bias being less pronounced for the PRCS dataset. The median duration of a study was 29 years in the PRCS dataset and 24 years in the PRC dataset (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>).

  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We generally expected that warming temperatures would be associated with an advance in phenological events, because most studies on phenology in our PRC dataset represented early season (spring) events in the Northern Hemisphere, and such events were previously shown to mainly advance with warming temperatures
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
   </span>. We defined a trait change to be adaptive in response to climate if the climate-driven change in phenotype occurred in the same direction as linear selection. For example, with an increase in temperature over the years, breeding time occurs progressively earlier, with earlier breeding conferring higher fitness (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). In contrast, if the trait changed in the direction opposite to selection (e.g. later breeding, despite earlier breeding being favoured), then the response was considered maladaptive
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
   </span>. The detected adaptive responses might be due to microevolution, phenotypic plasticity or both. As we used selection differentials that were measured at the phenotypic level, we could not differentiate among these sources.
  </p>
  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conducted separate analyses for PRCS and PRC datasets and, within each of them, for temperature and precipitation. We first quantified the three conditions necessary to infer adaptive responses for each study (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). We assessed condition 1 (change in climate over years) with ‘model 1’. This linear mixed-effects model predicted the annual values of the climatic variable using the year (modelled as a quantitative variable), thereby estimating the slope of climate on years for each study (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>). We assessed condition 2 (change of phenotypic traits with the climatic variable) with ‘model 2’. This linear mixed-effects model predicted the mean annual standardized population trait values using the climatic variable (temperature or precipitation, modelled as a quantitative variable), thereby estimating the slope of traits on climate for each study (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>). This model also included year as a quantitative variable to account for effects of years on phenotypic traits not mediated by climate. We assessed condition 3 (climate-driven trait changes are associated with fitness benefits) in a two-step procedure. First, we fitted ‘model 3’—a linear mixed-effects model that predicted the annual linear selection differentials (weighted by the inverse of their variances) with an intercept, thereby estimating the weighted mean of annual selection differentials (WMSDs) for each study (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1e</a>, see Methods for details). Second, we plotted the obtained WMSD as a function of the climate-driven trait change over time, calculated as the product of the slopes from conditions 1 and 2, that is, by 
   <span class="italic">β</span>
   <sub>clim</sub> times 
   <span class="italic">β</span>
   <sub>Trait</sub> (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1f</a>). In this framework, a trait change qualifies as an adaptive response if both WMSD and the trait change over time have the same sign. If their signs differ, then the trait change is maladaptive. We also refitted model 3 using year as a fixed-effect (quantitative) predictor to assess a potential directional change in selection over years (Methods).
  </p>
  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since the measures of phenological responses are sensitive to methodological biases
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
   </span>, in particular to temporal trends in species abundance
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
   </span>, we also refitted an extended version of model 2 by additionally including abundance both as a fixed-effect explanatory variable and as an explanatory variable for residual variance (Methods). This model was fitted to a subset of studies for which we could extract abundance data. In all models, we accounted for first-order temporal autocorrelation (if this increased the predictive power of the fitted model), and thus also considered year (modelled as a qualitative variable) as a random effect.
  </p>
  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We then performed three meta-analyses to obtain (1) the average slope of climate on years across studies, (2) the average slope of traits on climate across studies and (3) the WMSD across studies. The purpose of these meta-analyses is to provide such average values while accounting for the uncertainty associated with each estimate and for the heterogeneity stemming from variation in study design. All three meta-analyses were performed using mixed-effects models (Methods). We also refitted these models to assess whether the relationships found depended on taxon, type of morphological measure, type of phenological measure, endothermy, fitness component used to measure selection and generation length (Methods). Finally, we compared the proportion of studies showing adaptive responses (i.e. the same sign of WMSD and climate-driven trait change over time) to the proportion of studies showing maladaptive responses (i.e. WMSD and trait change over time differ in their sign) with a binomial test (Methods). We also performed a meta-analysis of the product between WMSD and the sign of the climate-driven trait change over time using a mixed-effects model (Methods).</p>

  <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For phenological traits, negative selection favouring the observed advancing phenology in the context of warming temperature suggests adaptive responses. Accordingly, in 23 out of 38 studies, phenology advanced over time as temperatures increased, and at the same time negative selection was acting on phenology (studies in quadrant III of Fig.

  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess the implications for population persistence of selection acting on phenology across studies, we used the ‘moving optimum’ model of Bürger and Lynch
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
   </span>. This model, which assumes an optimum phenotype that changes linearly over time due to environmental change, predicts that the lag between the actual population mean phenotype and the optimum should eventually become constant if the population tracks the moving optimum via microevolution (subsequent extensions allowed for phenotypic plasticity, e.g. ref. 
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
   </span>). This prediction seems valid in our populations since (1) climatic changes are well approximated by a linear trend (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>) and (2) selection is non-zero and constant over time across studies, as indicated by the lack of a temporal trend in annual linear selection differentials. The Bürger and Lynch
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
   </span> model can be used to assess the critical lag behind the optimum, which represents the situation where the population just replaces itself (population growth rate 
   <span class="italic">λ</span> = 1). Comparing the actual to the critical lag provides insight into the expected persistence of populations: if the actual lag is greater than the critical lag, then the population growth rate is lower than 1, meaning substantial extinction risk; otherwise, the populations are assumed to have a negligible extinction risk. The estimation of both the actual and critical lags requires several parameter estimates, which we could not retrieve from the publications behind our data (Methods). However, our numerical analysis of a large parameter space shows that the difference between the actual and critical lags is mostly influenced by two parameters: 
   <span class="italic">β</span>, the strength of directional selection, for which we used the absolute values of our WMSD estimates for each study, and 
   <span class="italic">ω</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span>, the width of the fitness function, for which we did not have study-specific estimates (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6a–f</a>). We thus applied the Bürger and Lynch
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
   </span> model using 
   <span class="italic">ω</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> values published for other species
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
   </span> together with the study-specific 
   <span class="italic">β</span> estimates (absolute values of WMSD) and showed that for the populations of 9 out of 13 study species, the actual lag exceeds the critical lag when large values of 
   <span class="italic">ω</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> are considered (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6g</a>). Moreover, the probability that none of the study species is at risk (
   <span class="italic">λ</span> &lt; 1) is virtually zero (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>).
