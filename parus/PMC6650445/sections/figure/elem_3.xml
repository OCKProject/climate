  <p>Weighted mean of annual selection differentials (WMSDs) for each study. WMSD is shown for phenological (black) and morphological (grey) traits. Each study is identified by the publication identity, the trait, the species and the fitness component. Studies are sorted by trait category (phenological: black; morphological: grey), and within it by species, fitness category and publication identity. Repeated labels correspond to either different locations reported in the same publication, or to measurements on different sexes. Across studies, we found significant negative selection on phenological and no statistically significant selection on morphological traits. There was significant variation in WMSD on phenological traits among fitness components. See Fig.
