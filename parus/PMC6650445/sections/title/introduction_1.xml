  </span>. Fitness losses (i.e. reductions in survival or reproductive rates) can be mitigated, however, if populations respond adaptively by undergoing morphological, physiological or behavioural changes that maintain an adequate match—or at least reduce the extent of mismatch—between phenotype and environment. Such adaptive phenotypic changes—which we call ‘adaptive response’ (to climate change)—come about via phenotypic plasticity, microevolution or a combination of both, and can occur in tandem with geographic range shifts

  </span>. Quantifying adaptive responses, or demonstrating their absence despite directional selection, is important in a biodiversity conservation context for predicting species’ abundances or distributions

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Longitudinal studies of wild populations provide the opportunity to determine whether phenotypic changes are adaptive (e.g. refs. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>). A phenotypic change qualifies as an adaptive response to climate change if three conditions are met: (1) a climatic factor changes over time, (2) this climatic factor affects a phenotypic trait of a species and (3) the corresponding trait change confers fitness benefits (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. These conditions are usually assessed in isolation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>) and hence most studies can only speculate on whether adaptive responses have occurred. Here, we extracted data from many published studies to assess these three conditions in free-living animals and thus determine whether the observed phenotypic changes are adaptive.

     <span class="bold">c</span>) and WMSD was negative (as depicted by the red line in 
     <span class="bold">e</span>), then fitness benefits are associated with phenological advancement, reflecting an adaptive response (point falls in quadrant 3 in

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Multiple studies report data satisfying the first two conditions. In particular, increases in temperatures across multiple locations during recent decades are well documented (i.e. global warming
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>). Similarly, the effects of climate change on several traits are well characterized. For example, the timing of biological events, such as reproduction or migration (hereafter ‘phenological traits’), has generally advanced across multiple taxa and locations

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>,

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span> assessed whether phenotypic responses to climate (PRC) were adaptive because the assembled dataset does not contain data on trait changes.
 </p>
 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conducted a systematic literature search to assemble the necessary data to assess whether trait changes in response to climate change are adaptive across animal species worldwide. We mainly investigated the phenotypic responses of birds, because complete data on other taxa were scarce. We demonstrate that advancement of phenology is adaptive in some bird species, but this response is not universal. Further, modelling suggests that even bird species responding adaptively to climate change may adapt too slowly to be able to persist in the longer term.</p>
