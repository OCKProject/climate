 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess the implications for population persistence of selection acting on phenology across studies, we used the ‘moving optimum’ model of Bürger and Lynch
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>. This model, which assumes an optimum phenotype that changes linearly over time due to environmental change, predicts that the lag between the actual population mean phenotype and the optimum should eventually become constant if the population tracks the moving optimum via microevolution (subsequent extensions allowed for phenotypic plasticity, e.g. ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>). This prediction seems valid in our populations since (1) climatic changes are well approximated by a linear trend (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>) and (2) selection is non-zero and constant over time across studies, as indicated by the lack of a temporal trend in annual linear selection differentials. The Bürger and Lynch
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span> model can be used to assess the critical lag behind the optimum, which represents the situation where the population just replaces itself (population growth rate 
  <span class="italic">λ</span> = 1). Comparing the actual to the critical lag provides insight into the expected persistence of populations: if the actual lag is greater than the critical lag, then the population growth rate is lower than 1, meaning substantial extinction risk; otherwise, the populations are assumed to have a negligible extinction risk. The estimation of both the actual and critical lags requires several parameter estimates, which we could not retrieve from the publications behind our data (Methods). However, our numerical analysis of a large parameter space shows that the difference between the actual and critical lags is mostly influenced by two parameters: 
  <span class="italic">β</span>, the strength of directional selection, for which we used the absolute values of our WMSD estimates for each study, and 
  <span class="italic">ω</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span>, the width of the fitness function, for which we did not have study-specific estimates (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6a–f</a>). We thus applied the Bürger and Lynch
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span> model using 
  <span class="italic">ω</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> values published for other species
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span> together with the study-specific 
  <span class="italic">β</span> estimates (absolute values of WMSD) and showed that for the populations of 9 out of 13 study species, the actual lag exceeds the critical lag when large values of 
  <span class="italic">ω</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> are considered (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6g</a>). Moreover, the probability that none of the study species is at risk (
  <span class="italic">λ</span> &lt; 1) is virtually zero (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>).
