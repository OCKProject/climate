 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The calving dates data was analysed using Linear Mixed-effects Models (LMMs), by running the lmer-function in the R package lme4 ([

  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref047">47</a>] are known to influence the calving date, their respective effect was controlled for in the models. Since in reindeer factors linked to maternal condition interact with each other [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref065" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref065">65</a>] so that older individuals tend to be heavier, we used a female body condition index (BCI) so that (1) effects of female body weight controlling for age be taken into account and (2) multicollinearity between these two highly correlated variables be avoided. This body condition index was estimated by a measure of female body weight the year preceding the calving season after the effect of age is controlled—the age-specific residual body mass (see [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref066" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref066">66</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref067" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref067">67</a>]). This age-specific residual body mass was calculated by subtracting from each female’s body weight the average body weight of all females of the same age. These population terms were included in every model and formed what we call the “basic model”, i.e.: 
  <span class="italic">Calving date</span> ~ 
  <span class="italic">♀ BCI</span> + 
  <span class="italic">PM</span> + (1|
  <span class="italic">ID</span>) + (1|
  <span class="italic">Year</span>), with 
  <span class="italic">BCI</span> the body condition index of females, 
  <span class="italic">PM</span> the proportion of males, 
  <span class="italic">ID</span> the individual identity of the mother, and 
  <span class="italic">Year</span> the year of management. The terms (1|
  <span class="italic">ID</span>) and (1|
  <span class="italic">Year</span>) meant that they were included as random factors in the models.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess which local weather variables over different months best explained variation in the calving date, the weather variables presented in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone.0195603.t001" href="#pone.0195603.t001">Table 1</a> were added to the basic model. As physical condition of females can also be influenced by weather variables, the interactions between BCI and weather variables were also tested in the models. The effect size of each predictor variable was estimated by the parameter estimates from the selected model using the restricted maximum likelihood estimates as recommended for mixed effect models [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref068" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref068">68</a>] whereas the AICc values were calculated using the maximum likelihood methods [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref052">52</a>]. Once the most probable models to explain variation in calving date were selected, we then assessed how the calving date was affected by the most important variables by looking at the sign of their conditional averaged slope values extracted from the entire list of our competing models. The conditional 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> values were calculated to indicate the proportion of variance explained by both the fixed and random factors of the best-fitting models.
