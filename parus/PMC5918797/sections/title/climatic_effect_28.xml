 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The calving synchrony was also affected by an overall warming of the period from August to December as well as a reduced snow cover in winter from December to February reported in the study area since a lengthening of the calving season was observed following an overall warming weather in January and an increasing number of days when mean temperature exceeds 0°C in October-November. The calving synchrony was also weakened by a decreasing snow cover in the period from October to November. Moreover, females with an overall better physical condition (i.e. above the third quantile of the population distribution) delayed their calving dates following a higher number of days when mean temperature exceeds 0°C in October-November (LMM; 
  <span class="italic">b</span> = 1.31 ± 0.56 SE; 95% CI (0.22, 2.39)) and warmer temperatures in January (LMM; 
  <span class="italic">b</span> = 1.36 ± 0.60 SE; 95% CI (0.18, 2.53)) whereas females in poor physical condition (i.e. below the first quantile of the population distribution) showed no phenotypic plasticity in their calving dates when facing better climatic conditions in October-November [95% CI = (-1.62, 0.68)] and in January [95% CI = (-0.05, 2.05)]. The lengthening of the calving season following better climatic conditions in October-November and warmer temperatures in January may thus reflect a reduced plasticity among low-quality mothers (young and light females), so that they are not able to respond as quickly as high-quality mothers (older and heavier females) do, to favourable climatic conditions in fall and winter.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The onset of the rut period in deer species has been shown to be mainly triggered by a sudden drop in temperature around the breeding season (around late September/October) which trigger males’ rutting behaviours to start [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref086" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref086">86</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref088" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref088">88</a>]. Therefore, a higher number of days when mean temperature exceeds 0°C in October-November, highly correlated with a decreasing snow cover during the same period, would delay the time when males begin to display mating behaviours; resulting in a delay in females’ estrus [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref089" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref089">89</a>]. Further analyses on a dataset of validated copulation dates (which led to the birth of a calf within the 211–229 days’ time window for gestation lengths reported in this herd [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref064" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref064">64</a>]) also revealed a delay in copulation dates only for females in poor physical condition in September following a higher number of days when mean temperature exceeds 0°C in October-November (LMM; 
  <span class="italic">b</span> = 3.06 ± 0.74 SE; 95% CI (1.46, 4.69)). Therefore, the delay in estrus dates following better climatic conditions around the mating time would be more pronounced for females in poor physical condition while females in good condition (old and heavy females) would still be mated earlier [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref064" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref064">64</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref089" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref089">89</a>]. As shown in many ungulate species, late copulation dates are also correlated with shorter gestation lengths [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref064" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref064">64</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref084" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref084">84</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref085" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref085">85</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref090" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref090">90</a>] such as females in poor physical condition not having enough reserves to buffer climatic effects and cope with gestation costs. On the contrary, females in good physical condition would be able to afford the risks of delayed calving dates (as reported above) when climatic conditions in fall are better [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref091" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref091">91</a>], and afford such the corresponding gestation costs and thus lengthen their gestation lengths [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref064" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref064">64</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref085" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref085">85</a>] to improve their calves’ condition at birth, increasing their own reproductive success the following summer as shown in caribou and reindeer [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref092" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref092">92</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref094" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref094">94</a>]. The lengthening of the calving season after years with better climatic conditions in October-November (warmer temperatures and a decreased snow cover) would thus be explained by delayed calving dates from females in good physical condition.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The positive relationship between mean temperature in January and calving synchrony was enhanced by females BCI. Indeed, longer calving seasons were observed following warmer temperatures in January contributing to increase females’ physical condition, which in turn delayed their calving dates (as described above). From the mother and offspring’s points of view, delaying calving when climatic conditions in winter are favorable provide selective advantages. A longer gestation length provides (1) the foetus a longer period for growth and development [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref095" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref095">95</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref096" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref096">96</a>], (2) a higher offspring’s birthweight [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref091" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref091">91</a>], ensuring a higher survival probability [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref035">35</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref045">45</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref085" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref085">85</a>] and (3) an enhanced fitness for the offspring [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref093" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref093">93</a>]. A higher offspring’s fitness will certainly mean improved fitness for the mother [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref093" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref093">93</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref094" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref094">94</a>]. However, the ability for a female to be plastic requires a higher physical condition to be physiologically able to do so [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref049">49</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref097" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref097">97</a>]. A warming temperature in January would allow pregnant females to spend less energy for thermoregulation [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref073" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref073">73</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref074" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref074">74</a>] and reduce the costs of locomotion on snow [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref075" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref075">75</a>], thus improving their overall physical condition. However, females with an overall higher physical condition would be more able to buffer climatic effects in warmer winters and allocate more resources to growth and development of their foetus [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref095" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref095">95</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref096" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref096">96</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref098" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref098">98</a>], whereas females in poor physical condition would probably prioritize the maintenance of their own body reserves over their foetus’s growth and development [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref095" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref095">95</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref096" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref096">96</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref099" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref099">99</a>]. In warmer winters, only females in good physical condition would be able to delay their calving dates, thereby contributing to a lengthening of the calving season in those years. Such asymmetric response to improved vs. reduced winter conditions has been demonstrated in reindeer as a ‘risk-averse adjustment in reproductive allocation’ [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref097" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref097">97</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The inter-individual heterogeneity in the response to improved climatic conditions in October-November and January would thus be responsible for the variability in calving synchrony observed in this herd. Understanding what shapes inter-individual heterogeneity in the plasticity of calving date in response to climatic variation would be a natural continuation to this study. We noted that the shift in birth synchrony has occurred in the quasi-absence of predation (20 cases of calves killed by predation out of 2,137 birth dates) so that climatic variability seemed to be one of the main driver shaping calving synchrony in this population. As the competing models explained at best 23% of the variation in calving synchrony, it suggests that other parameters could also be important in explaining variation in the length of calving season (e.g. social, physiological or behavioural cues). Whether phenological changes in calving date and/or calving synchrony have consequences for populations’ recruitment rate and/or females’ reproductive success is a question with contrasted answers among ungulate species. In red deer, Moyes et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref070" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref070">70</a>] did not find a significant temporal change in either offspring birth weight or offspring first-winter survival whereas parturition date has advanced. On the contrary, Post and Forchhammer [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref023">23</a>] found a reduced production and survival of caribou calves following warmer spring temperatures due to a trophic mismatch between the caribou’s timing of calving and onset of the plant growing season in the Low Arctic Greenland. In this semi-domesticated reindeer population, assessing the offspring first-winter survival was not feasible because approximately one third of the calves are slaughtered every fall for meat production. However, calves who survived the summer had earlier birth dates than calves who died either at birth, after one day, one week or later in the summer (LMM; 
  <span class="italic">b</span> = -1.23 ± 0.37 SE; 95% CI (-1.96, -0.50)). Moreover, Holand et al. (unpublished) have found that both the calving dates and calves’ birth weight of this population are under stabilizing selection with advanced birth dates and increased calves’ birth weights. Whether such selection has consequences in terms of population dynamics and life history traits in this population is yet to be demonstrated but as Gaillard et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref100" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref100">100</a>] mentioned: “the immature stage, despite a low relative impact on population growth rate compared with the adult stage, may be the critical component of population dynamics of large herbivores”. Furthermore, conditions early in life has been reported to shape lifetime reproductive success [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref061" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref061">61</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref101" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref101">101</a>]. Therefore, changes in birth dates and birth weights could have major consequences on population dynamics of ungulate species like reindeer. More studies on this matter are needed with the need to disentangle behavioral/phenotypic plastic responses from microevolutionary responses and the consequences for ungulate populations [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref102" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref102">102</a>].
