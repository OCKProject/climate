 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The following statements apply to the analyses for both calving date and calving synchrony. Since phenological variation in calving period (timing and synchrony) could be independently influenced by the previous year’s environmental conditions and conditions in the beginning of current year, we performed models using current year calving data (
  <span class="italic">t</span>), and climatic data for both current year from January to May (
  <span class="italic">t</span>) and precedent calendar year (
  <span class="italic">t</span> − 1) from June to December. Calving dates and calving synchrony were used as response variables in the analyses. We centered and standardized all the predictor variables considered (mean = 0, SD = 1) to be on a comparable scale and assessed for multicollinearity among them using the Variation Inflation Factor (VIF). Predictor variables with VIF smaller than five were kept in the model [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref051">51</a>]. If several consecutive months of the same weather variable significantly influenced one trait of the calving phenology (timing or synchrony) when considered separately, the mean (for temperature) or the cumulative sum (for precipitation and SDI) was calculated for the entire period. For example, if mean temperature in April and in May significantly influenced calving date when considered separately, then the mean temperature for the period from April to May was instead used in the model in order to avoid multicollinearity.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before performing a model selection to identify which variables best explained variation in calving phenology (date and length separately), we assessed the change over time of the reindeer calving phenology using two models both with 
  <span class="italic">Year</span>, the predictor variable considered as a continuous fixed-effect parameter in the models. The first model, had calving date as response variable and we used a Linear Mixed-effects Model (LMM) with 
  <span class="italic">Year</span> and individual identity included as random factors; while the second model had calving synchrony as response variable and a Linear Model (LM) was used. These two models were not subject to model selection. A model selection was then performed to find combinations from all the explanatory variables used providing the most probable models to explain calving phenology and was based both on the Akaike Information Criterion, corrected for small sample size (AICc) and Akaike weights (AICc weights) to compare the relative performance of the models tested [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref052">52</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref053">53</a>]. The delta AICc (Δ
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">i</span>
  </sub>) was calculated to provide a measure of each model relative to the best model (with the lowest AICc value). All models within a ΔAICc of 2 units were retained as competing models since a substantial evidence was given to the model if Δ
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">i</span>
  </sub> &lt; 2 [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref053">53</a>]. To account for model selection uncertainty and if more than one model were retained as best models in explaining the data then the estimates of the coefficients of parameters in all models with ΔAICc &lt; 2 were averaged, following the model averaging approach [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref053">53</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref056">56</a>]. We reported the effect of each predictor variable on the response variable considered with model-averaged parameter estimates, as well as their 95% confidence intervals based on our entire list of candidate models. These estimates are weighted based on the relative importance of the models (given by the AICc weights) containing those parameters and only the ‘conditional averages’ were reported, i.e. the averages over the models where the parameters appeared. The variables included in the competing models were considered important if their 95% CIs excluded 0 and only the important variables were further discussed. Since our predictor variables were beforehand centred and standardized, we could directly interpret their main effects even when involved in interactions and thus avoided the potential misinterpretation of main effects between models with and without the interaction term [

   <a rid="pone.0195603.ref065" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref065">65</a>] so that older individuals tend to be heavier, we used a female body condition index (BCI) so that (1) effects of female body weight controlling for age be taken into account and (2) multicollinearity between these two highly correlated variables be avoided. This body condition index was estimated by a measure of female body weight the year preceding the calving season after the effect of age is controlled—the age-specific residual body mass (see [
   <a rid="pone.0195603.ref066" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref066">66</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0195603.ref067" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref067">67</a>]). This age-specific residual body mass was calculated by subtracting from each female’s body weight the average body weight of all females of the same age. These population terms were included in every model and formed what we call the “basic model”, i.e.: 
   <span class="italic">Calving date</span> ~

   <span class="italic">PM</span> + (1|

   <span class="italic">PM</span> the proportion of males,

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Calving synchrony</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the calving synchrony (length of the calving season) was estimated annually, linear models were used. The predictor variables used were the same weather variables described in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="pone.0195603.t001" href="#pone.0195603.t001">Table 1</a>. Because calving synchrony is estimated annually for the entire population and to control for the effects of population variables (BCI of females and proportion of males) on calving synchrony, an average value of the BCI of all the females per year, as well as an average value of the proportion of males par year was calculated. Our “basic model” for calving synchrony was thus as follow: 
   <span class="italic">Calving synchrony</span> ~ 
   <span class="italic">♀ BCI</span> +
