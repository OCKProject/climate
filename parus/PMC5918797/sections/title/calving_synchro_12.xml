 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the calving synchrony (length of the calving season) was estimated annually, linear models were used. The predictor variables used were the same weather variables described in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone.0195603.t001" href="#pone.0195603.t001">Table 1</a>. Because calving synchrony is estimated annually for the entire population and to control for the effects of population variables (BCI of females and proportion of males) on calving synchrony, an average value of the BCI of all the females per year, as well as an average value of the proportion of males par year was calculated. Our “basic model” for calving synchrony was thus as follow: 
  <span class="italic">Calving synchrony</span> ~ 
  <span class="italic">♀ BCI</span> + 
  <span class="italic">PM</span>, with 
  <span class="italic">BCI</span> the body condition index of females and 
  <span class="italic">PM</span> the proportion of males. To assess which weather variable over different months best explained variation in the calving synchrony, the weather variables presented in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone.0195603.t001" href="#pone.0195603.t001">Table 1</a> were added to this basic model. As physical condition of females can also be influenced by weather variables, the interactions between BCI and weather variables were also assessed in the models. How the calving synchrony was affected by a weather variable was assessed with the conditional averaged slope values extracted from the most important variables of our competing models. Adjusted 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> values were calculated to indicate the proportion of variance explained by the best-fitting models.
