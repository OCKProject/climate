 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reproductive synchrony is the tendency of individuals to carry out parts of their reproductive cycle at the same time as other members of the population [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref001">1</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref002">2</a>]. In natural populations of either plant or animal species, reproductive synchrony is the result of natural selection when a reproductive advantage (e.g. reduced predation) is conferred to individuals breeding in a synchronous pattern [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref003">3</a>]. Being the main ultimate factor of reproductive synchrony, offspring survival can be affected by multiple factors, such as climate, predation and sociobiological. Reproductive synchrony as a mean to reduce predation is explained by several hypotheses: first, the ‘saturation hypothesis’ suggests that predators will be overwhelmed if all young are born in a brief period [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref004">4</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref005">5</a>]; second, adults breeding synchronously could use vigilance to detect predators more efficiently; third [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref003">3</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref006">6</a>], the ‘confusion hypothesis’ states that a high number of young in a group will decrease the predator’s capacity to pursue a specific target [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref004">4</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref007">7</a>]. The wildebeest (
  <span class="italic">Connochaetes taurinus</span>) provides the best known example of synchronized calving, where predation pressure by the hyena (
  <span class="italic">Crocuta crocuta</span>) has promoted a short birth peak and an aggregated over a dispersed spatial distribution of individuals in order to ensure the survival of the young [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref005">5</a>,

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several studies on northern ungulates have shown that climatic variability contributed more than predation in constraining timing and synchrony of births: bighorn sheep (
  <span class="italic">Ovis canadensis</span>) [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref009">9</a>], caribou (

  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref010">10</a>], Dall’s sheep (
  <span class="italic">Ovis dalli</span>) [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref007">7</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref011">11</a>], reindeer (
  <span class="italic">Rangifer tarandus</span>) [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref012">12</a>] and roe deer (
  <span class="italic">Capreolus capreolus</span>) [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref013">13</a>]. In temperate and subarctic climates, a marked seasonality in forage availability has been shown to strongly influence both perinatal and neonatal mortality of ungulates [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref009">9</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref014">14</a>] and thus explains variation in synchrony of ungulates’ births [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref015">15</a>]. Individuals born outside the optimal period for births will have lower probabilities to survive [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref014">14</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref015">15</a>] because (1) they will be more vulnerable to predation by bears, golden eagles and other predators [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref016">16</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref017">17</a>], (2) if born too early, mothers can be in negative energy balance therefore producing a low quality milk [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref011">11</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref018">18</a>] and (3) if born too late, young will be more susceptible to insect harassment and summer heat [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref019">19</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref020">20</a>] and will not accumulate enough resources; ultimately reducing their survival rate during summer season, and during their first winter thereafter [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref009">9</a>]. The calving phenology resulting from thousands of years of evolution is thus expected to reflect the species’ adaptation to its environment.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a context of the worldwide global warming recorded the last decades, a mistiming has been shown to occur between species’ reproductive phenology and their environment leading to a decrease in their recruitment rate: in great tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref021">21</a>], several species of birds [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref022">22</a>], caribou [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref023">23</a>], reindeer [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref024">24</a>], squirrel (
  <span class="italic">Urocitellus columbianus</span>) [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref025">25</a>]. Determining the relationship between reproductive tactics and a species environment and understanding the role of phenotypic plasticity on reproductive traits are therefore crucial to predict how climate change will affect species’ viability. Ungulates with highly synchronized births in particular are of primary concern because they are more susceptible to climatic variation than asynchronously breeding ungulates that are better adapted to large changes in climate [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref026">26</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">Rangifer</span> species (including both caribou and reindeer) in this context is certainly the most vulnerable species since: (1) this is one of the two ungulate species to have successfully colonized the unpredictable and austere arctic environment and (2) 
  <span class="italic">Rangifer</span> species has been shown to produce 80–90% of their calves within a 10-day period and complete the calving season within 4–5 weeks [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref012">12</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref027">27</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref028">28</a>]. Moreover, herding and hunting of 
  <span class="italic">Rangifer</span> allowed northern peoples in the Arctic Circle to survive in a harsh and austere environment, and constitute the cultural and socioeconomic pillar of these cultures [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref029">29</a>]. Surprisingly, reindeer has not received enough attention with respect to the global climate change debate (but see [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref029">29</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref032">32</a>]). Our aim here is thus to investigate how the reindeers’ calving phenology is affected by climatic variability by using a long term dataset of birth dates recorded since 1970 in a semi-domesticated reindeer population in Northern Finland. In this study, the calving phenology will be assessed using both the date when births occur and the length/synchrony of the births season.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since births in ungulates have been reported to occur later following winters with colder temperatures [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref033">33</a>], higher amounts of snowfall [

  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref035">35</a>], females are expected to present a plastic response in calving date according to the severity of winter and consequently the calving season is expected to occur earlier with a reduced snow cover, and an overall warmer and wetter climate as predicted over Northern Hemisphere [

  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref037">37</a>]. Such climatic changes, by contributing to the lengthening of the vegetative growing season [

  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref038">38</a>], would release selective pressure to having births highly concentrated in time to match the forage resources [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref004">4</a>] and a lengthening of the calving season would result. The aims in the present study are to: (1) quantify rates of temporal change of reindeer reproductive phenology (date and length) and of climatic variables for our study site and (2) assess whether phenological changes in reindeer reproduction can be explained by the variation in local climatic condition.
