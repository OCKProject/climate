 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Being a research herd, several experiments have been conducted on this reindeer population for different purposes. Thanks to the book-keeping of the herd, the identity of the animals involved in any experiment was known. Experimental animals were excluded from our analyses when: (1) males or females isolated for experimental purpose could have been subjected to other factors and do not reflect the overall trend of the herd and (2) an artificial feeding could have buffered climatic effects on females’ body condition and therefore on calving date. Indeed the calving date has been shown to be strongly influenced by female’s body weight at different periods of the year [

  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref045">45</a>]. Because artificial feeding in 2009 was done more than would be expected in a normal year, we excluded the data for year 2009 from the analyses since earlier calving dates could just be the result of females being heavier that particular year, independently of climatic conditions. Given the great variability within and between years in females’ body weight (see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195603.g001" href="#pone.0195603.g001">Fig 1</a>), we believe that regular level of supplemental feeding alone could not buffer climatic effects by keeping up females’ body weight at a stable level, hence our decision to remove year 2009.

Between 1996 and 2011 (except 1998), the herd was separated in the two large enclosures, Sinioivi and Lauluvaara and consequently the proportion of males was estimated per enclosure for those years. Using the identity of the females present in each enclosure, the calving date of a specific female was related to the proportion of males estimated in that enclosure the past breeding season. The effect of proportion of males on breeding time and consequently on calving date [
