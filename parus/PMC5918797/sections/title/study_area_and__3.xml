 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The data collected come from the Kutuharju field reindeer research station in Kaamanen, northern Finland (69°N, 27°E). The area is characterized by open birch 
  <span class="italic">Betula spp</span>. and pine 
  <span class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</span> forests with many bogs and lakes and the landscape varies between 185–370 m above the sea level. We studied a semi-domesticated reindeer population constituted of about 100 animals every year. All animals were marked with ear tags from birth, allowing their age to be known, while being individually recognizable thanks to the long term book-keeping of the herd demography. Reindeer are free ranging most of the year, excluding the calving period. In summer and during the rut, reindeer use two large fenced enclosures, the north-west section (Lauluvaara ~ 13.8 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) and the south-east section (Sinioaivi ~ 15 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>). After the breeding season in late October, the animals are gathered and taken to a winter grazing area (15 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) where they can graze freely on natural pastures. Only in late winter and especially after harsh winters, animals receive in addition supplementary feed (pellets and hay). In late April, females are gathered into a calving enclosure (approximately 0.5 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) where newborn calves are captured, weighed, sexed and marked with ear tags [
  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref039">39</a>]. The enclosure is surveyed daily, so that calving date is known for all individuals and has been recorded since 1970.
