 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The calving season of the semi-domesticated reindeer population in Kaamanen, northern Finland has occurred earlier following warmer temperatures in April-May, a decreased amount of snowfalls in April and a reduced snow cover in April and has lengthened with a warming weather in January, a higher number of days when mean temperature exceeds 0°C in October-November and a decreasing snow cover in the period from October to November. Such phenological trends have allowed this reindeer population to track at least partially the climatic changes observed in this area. The phenology of many species have changed in response to climate change, particularly at higher latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere but most evidences came from long-term studies of many taxonomic groups other than ungulate species [

As such, this study enhances our understanding of how reproductive phenology of ungulate species would be affected by climate change. That such results on a semi-domesticated reindeer population were observed, where supplemental feeding in harsh winter years could have helped to buffer against climatic conditions, suggests that influence of climatic variation on the reproductive phenology of wild populations might be even stronger. Therefore, more ecological studies linking reproductive phenology of wild populations to climatic variation are needed. While the calving date has already been found to be influenced by temperature and snow conditions [

  <a rid="pone.0195603.ref105" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref105">105</a>], this study is so far the first to highlight an influence of weather variables on calving synchrony in ungulates. In summary, the variability of climatic conditions in the period from October to November and in January seemed important for the variability in females’ plastic response of calving dates to better climatic conditions and as a consequence in shaping calving synchrony at the population level whereas climatic conditions in early spring, just before the calving season, seemed more important in defining the calving dates at the individual level, likely because of its influence on the adjustment of each female’s gestation length.
