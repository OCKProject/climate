 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Between 1970 and 2016, calving date significantly advanced by an estimated 0.15 (± 0.04 SE) days per year [95% CI = (-0.24, -0.07); 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195603.g002" href="#pone.0195603.g002">Fig 2a</a>]. Across the 45-year study period, calving dates in female reindeer were estimated to have advanced by 6.8 days (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195603.g002" href="#pone.0195603.g002">Fig 2a</a>). There was a tendency for the duration of the calving season to lengthen over time, i.e. a tendency for calving synchrony to weaken along the study period (
