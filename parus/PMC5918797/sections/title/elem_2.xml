  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The data collected come from the Kutuharju field reindeer research station in Kaamanen, northern Finland (69°N, 27°E). The area is characterized by open birch 
   <span class="italic">Betula spp</span>. and pine 
   <span class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</span> forests with many bogs and lakes and the landscape varies between 185–370 m above the sea level. We studied a semi-domesticated reindeer population constituted of about 100 animals every year. All animals were marked with ear tags from birth, allowing their age to be known, while being individually recognizable thanks to the long term book-keeping of the herd demography. Reindeer are free ranging most of the year, excluding the calving period. In summer and during the rut, reindeer use two large fenced enclosures, the north-west section (Lauluvaara ~ 13.8 km
   <span class="sup">2</span>) and the south-east section (Sinioaivi ~ 15 km
   <span class="sup">2</span>). After the breeding season in late October, the animals are gathered and taken to a winter grazing area (15 km
   <span class="sup">2</span>) where they can graze freely on natural pastures. Only in late winter and especially after harsh winters, animals receive in addition supplementary feed (pellets and hay). In late April, females are gathered into a calving enclosure (approximately 0.5 km
   <span class="sup">2</span>) where newborn calves are captured, weighed, sexed and marked with ear tags [
   <a rid="pone.0195603.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref039">39</a>]. The enclosure is surveyed daily, so that calving date is known for all individuals and has been recorded since 1970.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All calendar dates were converted into Julian days since 1 January for analysis purposes. Assuming that the calving dates follow a bell curve, the synchrony—or length—of the calving season (when 95% of births occurred) was estimated as the width of the 95% confidence interval around the peak date of each period, a function of the within-year variance used by Loe et al. [

   <span class="italic">σ</span>) of the whole calving season in any given year. In total, 45 years of data were available for both the calving date and the length of the calving season.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Being a research herd, several experiments have been conducted on this reindeer population for different purposes. Thanks to the book-keeping of the herd, the identity of the animals involved in any experiment was known. Experimental animals were excluded from our analyses when: (1) males or females isolated for experimental purpose could have been subjected to other factors and do not reflect the overall trend of the herd and (2) an artificial feeding could have buffered climatic effects on females’ body condition and therefore on calving date. Indeed the calving date has been shown to be strongly influenced by female’s body weight at different periods of the year [
   <a rid="pone.0195603.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref035">35</a>,

   <a rid="pone.0195603.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref045">45</a>]. Because artificial feeding in 2009 was done more than would be expected in a normal year, we excluded the data for year 2009 from the analyses since earlier calving dates could just be the result of females being heavier that particular year, independently of climatic conditions. Given the great variability within and between years in females’ body weight (see 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195603.g001" href="#pone.0195603.g001">Fig 1</a>), we believe that regular level of supplemental feeding alone could not buffer climatic effects by keeping up females’ body weight at a stable level, hence our decision to remove year 2009.

Between 1996 and 2011 (except 1998), the herd was separated in the two large enclosures, Sinioivi and Lauluvaara and consequently the proportion of males was estimated per enclosure for those years. Using the identity of the females present in each enclosure, the calving date of a specific female was related to the proportion of males estimated in that enclosure the past breeding season. The effect of proportion of males on breeding time and consequently on calving date [

All the weather variables were considered on a monthly basis. Monthly average temperature was the average of the mean daily temperatures recorded over a month whereas the sum was used for precipitation and snow depth. Precipitation includes rain and/or snow depending on the temperature. Snow depth index (SDI) was calculated as the cumulative sum of daily snow depths on the 15

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The following statements apply to the analyses for both calving date and calving synchrony. Since phenological variation in calving period (timing and synchrony) could be independently influenced by the previous year’s environmental conditions and conditions in the beginning of current year, we performed models using current year calving data (
   <span class="italic">t</span>), and climatic data for both current year from January to May (
   <span class="italic">t</span>) and precedent calendar year (
   <span class="italic">t</span> − 1) from June to December. Calving dates and calving synchrony were used as response variables in the analyses. We centered and standardized all the predictor variables considered (mean = 0, SD = 1) to be on a comparable scale and assessed for multicollinearity among them using the Variation Inflation Factor (VIF). Predictor variables with VIF smaller than five were kept in the model [
   <a rid="pone.0195603.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref051">51</a>]. If several consecutive months of the same weather variable significantly influenced one trait of the calving phenology (timing or synchrony) when considered separately, the mean (for temperature) or the cumulative sum (for precipitation and SDI) was calculated for the entire period. For example, if mean temperature in April and in May significantly influenced calving date when considered separately, then the mean temperature for the period from April to May was instead used in the model in order to avoid multicollinearity.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before performing a model selection to identify which variables best explained variation in calving phenology (date and length separately), we assessed the change over time of the reindeer calving phenology using two models both with 
   <span class="italic">Year</span>, the predictor variable considered as a continuous fixed-effect parameter in the models. The first model, had calving date as response variable and we used a Linear Mixed-effects Model (LMM) with 
   <span class="italic">Year</span> and individual identity included as random factors; while the second model had calving synchrony as response variable and a Linear Model (LM) was used. These two models were not subject to model selection. A model selection was then performed to find combinations from all the explanatory variables used providing the most probable models to explain calving phenology and was based both on the Akaike Information Criterion, corrected for small sample size (AICc) and Akaike weights (AICc weights) to compare the relative performance of the models tested [

   <sub>
    <span class="italic">i</span>
   </sub>) was calculated to provide a measure of each model relative to the best model (with the lowest AICc value). All models within a ΔAICc of 2 units were retained as competing models since a substantial evidence was given to the model if Δ

   <a rid="pone.0195603.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref053">53</a>]. To account for model selection uncertainty and if more than one model were retained as best models in explaining the data then the estimates of the coefficients of parameters in all models with ΔAICc &lt; 2 were averaged, following the model averaging approach [

   <a rid="pone.0195603.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195603.ref056">56</a>]. We reported the effect of each predictor variable on the response variable considered with model-averaged parameter estimates, as well as their 95% confidence intervals based on our entire list of candidate models. These estimates are weighted based on the relative importance of the models (given by the AICc weights) containing those parameters and only the ‘conditional averages’ were reported, i.e. the averages over the models where the parameters appeared. The variables included in the competing models were considered important if their 95% CIs excluded 0 and only the important variables were further discussed. Since our predictor variables were beforehand centred and standardized, we could directly interpret their main effects even when involved in interactions and thus avoided the potential misinterpretation of main effects between models with and without the interaction term [

This body condition index was estimated by a measure of female body weight the year preceding the calving season after the effect of age is controlled—the age-specific residual body mass (see [

This age-specific residual body mass was calculated by subtracting from each female’s body weight the average body weight of all females of the same age.
