  <p>Behavioural traits of cane toads from wild-caught and captive-raised populations of Western Australian (range-edge) and Queensland (range-core) origin. Graphs show mean values and associated standard errors (where relevant) for traits measured during trials of exploratory behaviour (time spent moving, rate of movement), risk-taking (emerged from shelter, latency to emerge) and neophilia (approached novel object, time with novel object). </p>
