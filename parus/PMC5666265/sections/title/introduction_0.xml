 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Biological invasions impose novel ecological and evolutionary pressures. Individuals at the expanding range edge experience different demographic, physiological and environmental pressures than those faced by conspecifics from the range core, often leading to phenotypic divergence across the invasion range [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C1" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C1">1</a>]. For example, vanguard individuals often have distinctive phenotypes associated with faster dispersal such as larger size [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C2" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C2">2</a>–
  <a rid="RSOS170789C4" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C4">4</a>], longer legs [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C5" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C5">5</a>] and increased investment in dispersal appendages and mass in plant seeds [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C6" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C6">6</a>–
  <a rid="RSOS170789C8" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C8">8</a>]. More generally, successful invaders exhibit a suite of physiological, life-history, morphological and behavioural traits that enhance dispersal rates and facilitate functioning in novel environments (known as an ‘Invasion Syndrome’; [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C9" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C9">9</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170789C10" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C10">10</a>]). Behavioural traits may play an especially critical role (both as direct facilitators of dispersal rate, and via their influence on selection pressures on other traits), and yet are often overlooked as factors contributing to invasion success [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C10" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C10">10</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170789C11" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C11">11</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A propensity to explore, take risks and engage with novel environments (neophilia) is likely to promote range expansion by stimulating dispersal [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C12" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C12">12</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170789C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C13">13</a>], and these traits also enhance an individual's ability to find water, food, shelter and mates in novel environments [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C11" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C11">11</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170789C14" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C14">14</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170789C15" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C15">15</a>]. In keeping with these predictions, behavioural traits have been linked to range expansion and invasion success in several species. For example, range-edge individuals are more exploratory and bolder (more willing to take risks) than are conspecifics from range-core populations of the round goby (
  <span class="italic">Neogobius melanostomus</span>) [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C16" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C16">16</a>], dark-eyed junco (
  <span class="italic">Junco hyemalis Thurber</span>) [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C17" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C17">17</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170789C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C18">18</a>], common frog (
  <span class="italic">Rana temporaria</span>) [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C19" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C19">19</a>] and house sparrow (
  <span class="italic">Passer domesticus</span>) [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C20">20</a>]. Invasive house sparrows from range-edge populations are also more neophilic than are conspecifics from range-core populations [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C21" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C21">21</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170789C22" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C22">22</a>]. Individuals from range-edge populations also may be more aggressive [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C23" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C23">23</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170789C24" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C24">24</a>] and less social [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C3" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C3">3</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170789C25" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C25">25</a>] compared with those from range-core populations.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the growing body of evidence for distinctive behavioural phenotypes at range edges, the causation for this pattern is ambiguous [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C1" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C1">1</a>]. The two broad categories of explanation involve (i) behavioural plasticity, induced by the novel environments experienced at the range edge and (ii) the rapid elaboration of heritable traits driven by the unique evolutionary pressures imposed by an invasion.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many behavioural phenotypes are highly labile, enabling organisms to plastically respond to changes in their physiological, climatic or social environments [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C26" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C26">26</a>]. Thus, range-edge individuals may shift their behaviour in response to the novel environmental pressures they encounter at the expanding range edge [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C27" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C27">27</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170789C28" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C28">28</a>]. An ability to rapidly shift behaviour in response to novelty may enhance an individual's ability to exploit new ecological niches, habitats or prey items at the range edge [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C29">29</a>]. Indeed, innovation has been linked to invasion success in several species [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C30" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C30">30</a>] including the black rat (
  <span class="italic">Rattus rattus</span>) [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C31" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C31">31</a>] and bird species worldwide [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C30" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C30">30</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170789C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C32">32</a>]. In summary, range-edge individuals may exhibit specific behavioural attributes because those attributes are induced by the novel (range-edge) conditions that an individual experiences during their life.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alternatively, the distinctive behaviour of invasion-front animals may reflect rapid evolutionary change. Behavioural traits are affected by genes [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C33" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C33">33</a>], and traits such as exploration and boldness [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C34" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C34">34</a>–
  <a rid="RSOS170789C36" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C36">36</a>] and aggression [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C37" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C37">37</a>] are heritable in some species (reviewed in [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C38" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C38">38</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170789C39" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C39">39</a>]). Variation in behavioural phenotypes between range-core versus range-edge populations is likely to have both ecological and evolutionary consequences through influences on life-history, physiological and morphological traits, and hence be a target for selection [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C27" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C27">27</a>]. For example, dispersing individuals at the range edge may benefit from reduced competition for resources, a lack of pathogens and parasites, access to the best habitat and a lower risk of predation [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C40" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C40">40</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170789C41" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C41">41</a>]. However, there are also potential costs associated with rapid dispersal, such as the energetic costs of activity, increased risk of injury and a decrease in opportunities to reproduce due to low densities at the range edge [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C42" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C42">42</a>]. Hence, the benefits of dispersal must outweigh the costs for dispersal-enhancing behavioural traits to be adaptive. Importantly, though, personality-dependent dispersal may evolve even in the absence of natural selection. Bold and neophilic individuals are likely to be the first to disperse out of the range core, where they interbreed. At least some of their progeny inherit dispersal-enhancing traits from both parents, leading to a progressive increase across generations in the dispersal rates of individuals at the range edge (dubbed ‘spatial sorting’ by Shine 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C43" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C43">43</a>]). These proximate mechanisms (phenotypic plasticity, adaptation, spatial sorting) are not mutually exclusive; for example, an invasion might favour the evolution of specific reaction norms.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To investigate the causal factors driving behavioural divergence across a biological invasion, the first step is to disentangle plastic responses to novel environments from heritable shifts in behaviour. To answer this question, we need to measure behavioural traits not only of wild-caught individuals, but also of individuals raised in standardized (common-garden) conditions. In this study, we gathered these two types of data on the cane toad (
  <span class="italic">Rhinella marina</span> Linnaeus 1758) and its ongoing invasion across Australia.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The cane toad's current invasion range extends from wet tropical Queensland in the northeast to the seasonally dry monsoonal climate of northwestern Western Australia [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C44" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C44">44</a>]. Hence, toads from the range front versus the range edge experience very different thermal and hydric regimes; environmental factors which can have strong effects on the development of amphibians [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C45" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C45">45</a>–
  <a rid="RSOS170789C47" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C47">47</a>]. Previous research has documented rapid evolution of dispersal-enhancing morphological [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C48" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C48">48</a>], physiological [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C49" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C49">49</a>] and life-history traits [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C5" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C5">5</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170789C41" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C41">41</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170789C48" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C48">48</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170789C50" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C50">50</a>–
  <a rid="RSOS170789C52" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C52">52</a>] across this invasion range. Many of the same traits are seen in offspring raised in ‘common-garden’ experiments, suggesting a heritable component [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C50" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C50">50</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170789C53" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C53">53</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS170789C54" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C54">54</a>]. Invasion-front toads also are more exploratory and willing to take risks than are toads from long-colonized populations [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C55" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C55">55</a>], but the heritability of these latter traits has not been investigated using common-garden methods to date. The cane toad's invasion of Australia provides an ideal model system in which to ask our key question: is behavioural divergence across the invasion range due to plastic responses to the different climatic, physical and demographic environments experienced by range-front versus range-core individuals, or are they due to rapid evolutionary (heritable) changes? To answer this question, we conducted standardized laboratory-based behavioural assays to quantify exploratory, risk-taking and neophilic behaviour in both wild-caught and captive-raised cane toads from the range core and range edge of their Australian invasion range.
