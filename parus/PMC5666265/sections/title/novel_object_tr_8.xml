 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Novel object trial</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test neophilia, we used a silicone fishing lure (20 mm × 10 mm, mimicking a squid) driven by a small motor to move up and down every 2 s as a novel object. The novel object was housed inside a clear container to prevent the toad from consuming the plastic lure. The novel object was placed at the opposite end of the arena to the start point.</p>
