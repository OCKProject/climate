 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Collection of wild-caught toads</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2016, we collected 68 adult cane toads (34 male, 34 female), half from a long-colonized population (Cairns, Queensland: 17°56′ S, 145°56′ E; more than 76 years post-colonization [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C51" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C51">51</a>]; mean annual rainfall: 1999.7 mm, mean annual maximum temperature: 29.0°) and half from a range-front population (Oombulgurri, Western Australia: 15°10′45′′ S,127°52′36′′ E; less than 3 years post-colonization [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C56" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C56">56</a>]; mean annual rainfall: 809.4 mm, mean annual maximum temperature: 35.1° for Kununurra; Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology (
  <span xlink:href="www.bom.gov.au" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.bom.gov.au</span>) 2016). Toads were collected from three sub-populations within each location, hence the years since colonization (above) are means for each area. Our collection and transportation procedures are described in Gruber 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C55" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C55">55</a>]. Toads were kept at the University of Sydney's Tropical Ecology Research Facility at Middle Point, Northern Territory (12°34′ S, 131°18′ E; 11 years post-colonization; mean annual rainfall: 1421.7 mm, mean annual maximum temperature: 33.1°; Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology (
  <span xlink:href="www.bom.gov.au" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.bom.gov.au</span>) 2016). Upon collection, toads were weighed to the nearest 0.1 g on a digital scale and measured (snout–urostyle length (SUL)) to the nearest 0.01 mm using digital callipers.
