 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our common-garden toads were bred in captivity from wild-caught Western Australian and Queensland toads (for collection details and breeding protocols, see [

  <a rid="RSOS170789C58" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C58">58</a>]). All dams and sires were bred only once, hence all F

  <a rid="RSOS170789C58" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C58">58</a>]. We used individuals from 13 clutches from Western Australian and 16 clutches from Queensland ancestry. At the time of testing, these captive-raised toads were approximately 18 months of age and had been raised for their entire lives under standard conditions at the same site (our Northern Territory research station, as described above). All toads were weighed and measured before being housed as described below.
