  <a rid="RSOS170789C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C13">13</a>], we measured the time spent moving and rate of movement [

  <a rid="RSOS170789C62" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C62">62</a>]. We provided a shelter in the arena to give toads the option to hide during trials. This allowed us to distinguish bold exploratory behaviour from fear-driven escape behaviour [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C63" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C63">63</a>]. An empty container was placed next to the shelter and both were positioned equidistant to one another at the opposite end of the arena from the start point.
