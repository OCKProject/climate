  <a rid="RSOS170789C60" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C60">60</a>], we conducted behavioural trials between 18.30 and 01.00 h. Each toad was tested in three different behavioural trials: (i) exploration of a novel arena, (ii) risk-taking (emergence from a shelter into a test arena), and (iii) neophilia (response to a novel object). Trials ran for 30 min and four trials with one toad per trial arena were conducted simultaneously in each trial round. Trials were split over 3 days with six trial rounds on the first two nights (24 toads tested on each night) and five (20 toads tested) on the third night. All toads were exposed to each behavioural trial in the same sequence, that is, an exploratory trial, a risk-taking trial and a neophilia trial with 2 days of rest in between trial types (while the other sets of toads were assayed). An equal number of toads from range-front and range-core populations and each sex were randomly allocated a trial time and arena within each trial day. Toads from the common-garden and wild-caught populations were assayed consecutively rather than simultaneously due to logistical and space constraints.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Trial arenas were large (120 × 120 × 83 cm) hexagonal pens made from waterproof fabric with an open top to allow filming from above. The PVC substrate (and shelters, etc.) of each arena were wiped with diluted ethanol before each trial to eliminate scent. We measured the arena floor temperature before each trial (range: 29–31°C). We included an empty container in all trials to disambiguate hiding behaviour from interest in a novel object (for consistency, empty containers were also included in exploration and emergence trials). At the start of each exploratory and neophilia trial, toads were given 5 min before their resting shelter was removed and trials began. During risk-taking trials, toads began the trial in the safety of the shelter and the entrance was covered for five minutes before the cover was removed. All trials were recorded using CCTV cameras and we scored videos using Ethovision XT10 behavioural analysis software. Ethovision scored all videos in a standardized way without information on the population of origin (to ensure blind scoring). The investigator left the room during trials to avoid affecting toad behaviour.</p>

The novel object was housed inside a clear container to prevent the toad from consuming the plastic lure. The novel object was placed at the opposite end of the arena to the start point.</p>
