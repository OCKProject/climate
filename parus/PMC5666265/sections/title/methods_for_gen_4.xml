 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the research station, toads were transferred from their large outdoor pens [
  <a rid="RSOS170789C58" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C58">58</a>] to smaller containers (100 l plastic tubs with mesh lids) where they were housed in groups of two or three. Each tub had a wood-shaving substrate and contained two shelters (each shelter was large enough to hold three toads) and a large shallow water dish. Toads were fed live crickets four times per week and were provided with fresh water ad libitum. Toads were weighed and measured regularly to monitor their health (average toad SUL 98 mm; average toad mass 120 g). None showed any signs of illness or weight loss. Handling of toads was kept to a minimum and, to reduce stress, toads were transferred to and from trial arenas in dark plastic tubs. To minimize stress, toads were left undisturbed during non-trial periods.
