  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2016, we collected 68 adult cane toads (34 male, 34 female), half from a long-colonized population (Cairns, Queensland: 17°56′ S, 145°56′ E; more than 76 years post-colonization [

   <span xlink:href="www.bom.gov.au" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.bom.gov.au</span>) 2016). Toads were collected from three sub-populations within each location, hence the years since colonization (above) are means for each area. Our collection and transportation procedures are described in Gruber 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
   <a rid="RSOS170789C55" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C55">55</a>]. Toads were kept at the University of Sydney's Tropical Ecology Research Facility at Middle Point, Northern Territory (12°34′ S, 131°18′ E; 11 years post-colonization; mean annual rainfall: 1421.7 mm, mean annual maximum temperature: 33.1°; Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology (
   <span xlink:href="www.bom.gov.au" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.bom.gov.au</span>) 2016). Upon collection, toads were weighed to the nearest 0.1 g on a digital scale and measured (snout–urostyle length (SUL)) to the nearest 0.01 mm using digital callipers.

At the time of testing, these captive-raised toads were approximately 18 months of age and had been raised for their entire lives under standard conditions at the same site (our Northern Territory research station, as described above). All toads were weighed and measured before being housed as described below.

Each tub had a wood-shaving substrate and contained two shelters (each shelter was large enough to hold three toads) and a large shallow water dish. Toads were fed live crickets four times per week and were provided with fresh water ad libitum. Toads were weighed and measured regularly to monitor their health (average toad SUL 98 mm; average toad mass 120 g). None showed any signs of illness or weight loss. Handling of toads was kept to a minimum and, to reduce stress, toads were transferred to and from trial arenas in dark plastic tubs. To minimize stress, toads were left undisturbed during non-trial periods.

   <a rid="RSOS170789C59" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C59">59</a>,
   <a rid="RSOS170789C60" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C60">60</a>], we conducted behavioural trials between 18.30 and 01.00 h. Each toad was tested in three different behavioural trials: (i) exploration of a novel arena, (ii) risk-taking (emergence from a shelter into a test arena), and (iii) neophilia (response to a novel object). Trials ran for 30 min and four trials with one toad per trial arena were conducted simultaneously in each trial round. Trials were split over 3 days with six trial rounds on the first two nights (24 toads tested on each night) and five (20 toads tested) on the third night. All toads were exposed to each behavioural trial in the same sequence, that is, an exploratory trial, a risk-taking trial and a neophilia trial with 2 days of rest in between trial types (while the other sets of toads were assayed). An equal number of toads from range-front and range-core populations and each sex were randomly allocated a trial time and arena within each trial day. Toads from the common-garden and wild-caught populations were assayed consecutively rather than simultaneously due to logistical and space constraints.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Trial arenas were large (120 × 120 × 83 cm) hexagonal pens made from waterproof fabric with an open top to allow filming from above. The PVC substrate (and shelters, etc.) of each arena were wiped with diluted ethanol before each trial to eliminate scent. We measured the arena floor temperature before each trial (range: 29–31°C). We included an empty container in all trials to disambiguate hiding behaviour from interest in a novel object (for consistency, empty containers were also included in exploration and emergence trials). At the start of each exploratory and neophilia trial, toads were given 5 min before their resting shelter was removed and trials began. During risk-taking trials, toads began the trial in the safety of the shelter and the entrance was covered for five minutes before the cover was removed. All trials were recorded using CCTV cameras and we scored videos using Ethovision XT10 behavioural analysis software. Ethovision scored all videos in a standardized way without information on the population of origin (to ensure blind scoring). The investigator left the room during trials to avoid affecting toad behaviour.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistical analysis</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used linear models to analyse the effects of population source (Western Australia–Queensland), population type (common-garden–wild-caught) and population source within population type separately (common-garden toads from Western Australian versus Queensland ancestry and wild-caught toads from Western Australia and Queensland) on behavioural traits. We did not incorporate clutch as a factor in our analysis as we were not able to obtain information on relatedness in wild toads. The specific measurements collected from each trial were as follows: 
   <div list-type="simple" class="list">
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>(1) exploratory trials—total time spent moving and rate of movement (as quantified by the residual scores from a simple linear regression of total distance moved against total time spent moving);</p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>(2) emergence trials—emergence (binomial, whether or not individuals emerged during trials) and latency to emerge; and</p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>(3) novel object trials—whether or not toads approached to within 90 mm (the minimum body length required for toads to be classed as adults [
      <a rid="RSOS170789C64" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C64">64</a>]; thus, toads were recorded as being in the ‘novel object zone’ when within one body length of the focal object) of the novel object (binomial), latency to approach and time spent within 90 mm of the novel object.

   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.001 for latency to emerge (Gruber 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2017, unpublished data). We included data from captive-raised and wild-caught toads in a single model to examine the effects of population (range-core and range-edge), source (captive-raised and wild-caught) and their interaction on toad behaviour. We used top-down stepwise model selection, starting with a full model including all factors, covariates and their interactions, and sequentially deleted non-significant terms. Sex, mass, arena temperature, arena number, time of trial and day of trial had non-significant effects on behavioural traits and thus were excluded from the final models. We did not detect significant interactions between any factors, hence all interaction terms were also removed from the final models.
