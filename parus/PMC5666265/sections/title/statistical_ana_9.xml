 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used linear models to analyse the effects of population source (Western Australia–Queensland), population type (common-garden–wild-caught) and population source within population type separately (common-garden toads from Western Australian versus Queensland ancestry and wild-caught toads from Western Australia and Queensland) on behavioural traits. We did not incorporate clutch as a factor in our analysis as we were not able to obtain information on relatedness in wild toads. The specific measurements collected from each trial were as follows: 
  <div list-type="simple" class="list">
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>(1) exploratory trials—total time spent moving and rate of movement (as quantified by the residual scores from a simple linear regression of total distance moved against total time spent moving);</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>(2) emergence trials—emergence (binomial, whether or not individuals emerged during trials) and latency to emerge; and</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>(3) novel object trials—whether or not toads approached to within 90 mm (the minimum body length required for toads to be classed as adults [
     <a rid="RSOS170789C64" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170789C64">64</a>]; thus, toads were recorded as being in the ‘novel object zone’ when within one body length of the focal object) of the novel object (binomial), latency to approach and time spent within 90 mm of the novel object.
    </p>
   </div>
  </div> Repeatabilities of these behaviours (obtained from a larger sample of toads subjected to these trials on two occasions) ranged from 
  <span class="italic">R</span> = 0.01 (±95% CI 0, 0.56) 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.50 for activity to 
  <span class="italic">R</span> = 0.49 (±95% CI 0.31, 0.81) 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.001 for latency to emerge (Gruber 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2017, unpublished data). We included data from captive-raised and wild-caught toads in a single model to examine the effects of population (range-core and range-edge), source (captive-raised and wild-caught) and their interaction on toad behaviour. We used top-down stepwise model selection, starting with a full model including all factors, covariates and their interactions, and sequentially deleted non-significant terms. Sex, mass, arena temperature, arena number, time of trial and day of trial had non-significant effects on behavioural traits and thus were excluded from the final models. We did not detect significant interactions between any factors, hence all interaction terms were also removed from the final models.
