  </div> evolves toward positive values of a considerable magnitude (regardless of whether plasticity coevolves with maternal effects or not), showing that environmental input to the phenotype is always selectively favored (Fig. 
  <a rid="evo12635-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#evo12635-fig-0004">4</a>A). By contrast, the mean maternal effect

   <div accent="true" class="mover">
    <span class="mi">m</span>
    <span class="mo">¯</span>

   <div accent="true" class="mover">
    <span class="mi">m</span>

    <span class="mo">)</span>

     <span class="mo">−</span>
     <span class="mn">1</span>

  </div>, so that the maternal phenotype provides little information about the location of the selective optimum to offspring. As in the constant environment,

   <div accent="true" class="mover">
    <span class="mi">m</span>
    <span class="mo">¯</span>
   </div>
  </div> therefore merely evolves to slight negative values that reduce phenotypic variance.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By contrast, when maternal effects coevolve with phenotypic plasticity (black line in Fig. 
  <a rid="evo12635-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#evo12635-fig-0004">4</a>B),

   <div accent="true" class="mover">
    <span class="mi">m</span>
    <span class="mo">¯</span>

  </div> evolves to slightly larger values: it attains positive values when environmental fluctuations are weak (i.e., when maternal and offspring environments are strongly positively correlated) and attains negative values in more rapidly fluctuating environments (i.e., when maternal and offspring environments are poorly or negatively correlated). The presence of within‐generational plasticity is conducive to the evolution of maternal effects, as plasticity brings the maternal phenotype closer toward the phenotypic optimum

   <div class="msub">
    <span class="mi">θ</span>

     <span class="mo">−</span>
     <span class="mn">1</span>
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>. As a result, the distribution of maternal phenotypes

    <span class="mi">p</span>
    <span class="mo">(</span>

     </div>
     <span class="mo">*</span>
    </div>
    <span class="mo">)</span>
   </div>
  </div> is now more informative to offspring about the location of the selective optimum, relative to populations in which plasticity is absent.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, the presence of within‐generational plasticity raises the question of why maternal effects evolve at all, as plasticity itself may provide a sufficient means to achieve adaptation. This would indeed have been the case, were it not that slight constraints act on plasticity (Fig. 
  <a rid="evo12635-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#evo12635-fig-0004">4</a> assumes a small cost

    <span class="mn">100</span>

    <span class="mi">τ</span>
    <span class="mo">=</span>

   </div>
  </div>), thereby selectively favoring maternal effects. If plasticity is unconstrained, however, it can be shown that maternal effects always evolve to slight negative values for all frequencies 
  <span class="italic">f</span>, reflecting that maternal effects are not involved in adaptation to fluctuating environments. Consequently, the presence of within‐generational plasticity is conducive to the evolution of maternal effects when selection is weak, provided that plasticity itself is constrained.
