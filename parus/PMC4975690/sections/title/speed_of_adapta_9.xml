Populations in which only maternal effects are present recover more slowly (solid gray line), also relative to populations in which only phenotypic plasticity is present (dashed black line), but still recover ten‐folds of generations faster relative to populations that only have genetic effects (dashed gray line). Consequently, Figure 
  <a rid="evo12635-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#evo12635-fig-0002">2</a> corroborates previous findings that maternal effects are advantageous in changing environments (Räsänen and Kruuk, 
  <a rid="evo12635-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" href="#evo12635-bib-0068">2007</a>; Uller, 
  <a rid="evo12635-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" href="#evo12635-bib-0080">2008</a>; Hoyle and Ezard, 
  <a rid="evo12635-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#evo12635-bib-0026">2012</a>), with combinations of maternal effects and phenotypic plasticity providing the fastest adaptation to change (Hoyle and Ezard, 
  <a rid="evo12635-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#evo12635-bib-0026">2012</a>; Ezard et al., 
  <a rid="evo12635-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#evo12635-bib-0013">2014</a>). Individual‐based simulations result in very similar evolutionary trajectories to those shown in Figure 
  <a rid="evo12635-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#evo12635-fig-0002">2</a> (see Fig. S1).
