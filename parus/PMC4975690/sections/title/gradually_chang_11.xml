 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When environmental shifts occur at slower timescales of 100 or 1000 years (as is the case for current global warming; e.g., PAGES 2k Consortium, 
  <a rid="evo12635-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#evo12635-bib-0063">2013</a>), we find a similar pattern to that in Figure 
  <a rid="evo12635-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#evo12635-fig-0002">2</a> (see Fig. S4). Only when environmental change occurs at a much slower timescale (10,000 years and beyond), do we find that maternal effects and phenotypic plasticity attain transient values of a much more modest magnitude (Fig. S4). In the latter case, changes in the underlying elevation

  </div> are sufficient to account for most of the change, avoiding the slight costs associated with maternal effects or phenotypic plasticity. Consequently, maternal effects and phenotypic plasticity evolve more readily with more rapid environmental shifts.
