 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of this research showed how the environmental transformations undergoing in mountain areas are leading to a shift toward higher elevations of a large part of the species living there (see also Rocchia et al., 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0061">2018</a>; Ferrarini, Alatalo, &amp; Gustin, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0022">2017</a>; but see Scridel et al., 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0064">2018</a>). However, the upward shift was not only driven by temperature increase. Local processes, such as land‐use changes, also appeared to play an incontrovertible and likely synergistic role in exacerbating the displacement of species toward higher elevations. Although these evidences were largely derived from information on relatively common species, it is likely that even rare species pertaining to several different taxa, which are usually more demanding in terms of climatic and habitat factors, may be moving upward to a similar extent (e.g., Pernollet et al., 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0054">2015</a>; Maggini et al., 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0043">2011</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most of the bird species threatened by environmental changes in mountain areas were found to be open habitat species, which are mainly pushed upward by the loss of their physical space due to shrub and forest encroachment (Chamberlain, Negro, Caprio, &amp; Rolando, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0012">2013</a>). This phenomenon is chiefly linked to the land abandonment caused by the widespread loss of economic performance of mountain pastoral activities (Schermer et al., 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0063">2016</a>). Indeed, in a previous study conducted between 2006 and 2015, Rocchia, Luppi, Dondina, Orioli and Bani (
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0061">2018</a>) found that most of the breeding birds showed a significant change of their elevational range and that a large part of these birds were forest species. This pattern, as stated by the authors, is probably due to a significant upward shift of forests (i.e., forest expansion) during the period considered, since they did not find a significant positive trend for temperature.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this research, which covered a long time period (1982–2017), we found a significant positive trend for temperatures in the Central Italian Alps, a trend that was virtually consistent at all elevation. At the same time, we also found a significant increase of shrub and forest cover, which was more conspicuous at lower elevations. Thus, the trends of the two covariates overlapped to some extent, making it difficult to disentangle the net effect of each driver on boosting the elevational changes in species distribution. However, the methodological approach adopted (i.e., hierarchical partitioning) allowed us to evaluate at least the partial (i.e., pure) contribution of each of the two drivers (i.e., the individual contribution without the joined contribution due to covariance). In addition, the availability of a long, almost continuous, time series of breeding bird data strengthened the power of statistical tests adopted in detecting the effect of the investigated drivers, even in the presence of possible stochastic noises, sources of uncertainty in bird data, and the possible effect of many other general or local factors affecting the elevational distribution of birds.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The physical habitat of an animal species is certainly a more important limiting factor compared with the local temperature, which can, however, be critical for the habitat to be colonized (Huey, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0036">1991</a>). For example, the local temperature may be considered a secondary limiting factor that could affect the colonization of a new area by a forest‐dwelling species, provided that there is an available forest habitat (primary limiting factor). Thus, it is not surprising that shrub and forest cover plays a primary role as a physical habitat in driving the elevational change of reference points for a large portion of the studied species. This point was widely confirmed by the upward shift of most of the lower reference points of bird species living in open or edge habitats, for which the encroachment of shrubs and forests (which is greater at lower elevations) led to a decrease of the available habitat, probably regardless of temperature increase. Moreover, for these species, we did not observe a corresponding upward shift of the upper reference points, which has consequently led to a net shrinkage of their elevational range, with a lower boundary contraction.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conversely, forest species showed an upward shift with a displacement of one or more of their central reference points toward higher elevations. In other cases, they even showed an upper boundary expansion, with a displacement toward higher elevations of the upper reference points. These phenomena were likely due to the increase of shrub and forest cover occurred in the mountains within the region, and as highlighted several statistical significant relationships between the elevation values of reference points and this land use.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As expected, the habitat played the role of main driver. However, even the contribution of temperature was not negligible, especially for forest species, whose shift or expansion toward higher elevations was statistically significant. Temperature probably led to an improvement of climatic conditions in preexistent forest areas, which were previously not suitable. Indeed, the temperature driver was found to be more active in the upper part of the elevational range than the shrub and forest cover driver, which can be expected for species that usually inhabit lower and medium‐elevation forests, such as the Eurasian Blackbird (
  <span class="italic">Turdus merula</span>) or Eurasian Bullfinch (
  <span class="italic">Pyrrhula pyrrhula</span>). The lower reference points for these species were shifted upward by the habitat driver instead. For the European Crested Tit (
  <span class="italic">Lophophanes cristatus</span>), we found that the combination of temperature and shrub and forest cover drivers caused an upward range shift. Finally, the temperature was the only driver at all reference points for the Common Chiffchaff (
  <span class="italic">Phylloscopus collybita</span>) and the Coal Tit. In one case only, we found that temperature was a significant driver for an open species. This was noticeable since it was the only case in which temperature shifted the range of the Common Linnet (
  <span class="italic">Carduelis cannabina</span>) upward, causing a lower boundary contraction, without a pure statistically significant habitat effect.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our research showed that the elevation increase of the upper reference points was in contrast with the ecology of forest species in several cases. In fact, it is important to note how, in those cases, the elevation of the upper reference points was inversely related to shrub and forest cover, without a positive temperature effect on the colonization of potentially suitable habitats at higher elevations. This pattern was recurrent, especially for the most common forest species, and seems to indicate that a specific process is in act. An upward shift in the reference points at lower elevations, induced either by an increase in habitat availability or by an improvement in the climatic condition due to temperature increase (which corresponds to a likely increase in population density), seemed to determine a sort of density‐dependent effect that may cause a colonization of even suboptimal habitats at higher elevations.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Species living in open habitats could also colonize preexisting suitable vacant areas at higher elevations, provided that these fall within their climate niche. However, many of these species had a truncated elevational distribution (i.e., lack of higher reference points), which suggested that they were already at the elevational limit reached by their habitats. Indeed, habitat formation is a slow process, especially at higher elevations, since the previous soil formation is likely to be slower than the speed at which the birds’ upward displacements could theoretically progress under environmental pressures (Edwards, Scalenghe, &amp; Freppaz, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0019">2007</a>; Freppaz, Filippa, Caimi, Buffa, &amp; Zanini, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0027">2010</a>; Körner, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0038">2003</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each of the observed patterns of range change was strictly associated with a particular bird ecological group and depended on a specific driver. Forest birds were found to colonize higher elevations shifting their range or expanding upwards, while birds living along edges or in open habitats suffered a contraction of their elevational range due to the shrinkage of the lower boundary. When effective, temperature was found to be the main driver affecting range expansion toward higher elevations for forest species. For many species suffering a range contraction, it was not possible to ascertain a pure contribution of one of the two investigated drivers, although a large portion of these species was found to be affected by shrub and forest encroachment. Finally, long‐distance migrants were all affected by a range contraction. Such a particularly unfavorable situation for these migratory birds can be emphasized by the “trophic mismatch”, as highlighted by different researches (Bairlein &amp; Hüppop, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0005">2004</a>; Both et al., 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0009">2009</a>; Pearce‐Higgins, Eglington, Martay, &amp; Chamberlain, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0053">2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In sum, forest species were clearly the winners in a context of shrub and forest encroachment in mountain areas, besides being favoured by an increase in temperatures. Conversely, edge and open habitat birds were the losers, due to the shrinkage of their habitat at lower elevations and the impossibility to find new habitats at higher elevations (but see Chamberlain et al, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0012">2013</a>). Considering the species that showed a lower boundary contraction (i.e., edge and open habitat species), the overall upward displacement of their reference points was about 390 m in 36 years. Conversely, the species that showed an expansion or an upward shift gained on average about 300 m in the same period of time. A similar rate of displacement was found for the Alpine Rock Ptarmigan (
  <span class="italic">Lagopus muta helvetica</span>) in Swiss Alps over a 29‐year period (Pernollet et al., 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0054">2015</a>). However, these patterns are not universal and are probably more difficult to observe in shorter time periods (e.g., Archaux, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0003">2004</a>, Popy, Bordignon, &amp; Prodon, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0056">2010</a>). Other taxa, usually represented by slow‐reacting organisms, such as tree species and bryophytes, also moved upward but with a less conspicuous displacement, about one order of magnitude lower (10–30 m per decade; Vittoz et al., 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0070">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It should not be underestimated that the loss of open habitats in the long‐term, due to the abandonment of pastoral practices, could be further enhanced by climate warming. Indeed, a shorter permanence of the snow cover favors the progress of shrub and forest vegetation (Gehrig‐Fasel et al., 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0029">2007</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both habitat transformation and climate warming are harsh threatening factors to biodiversity across the world, but while the first can be thwarted effectively from a local to a medium scale, the second requires shared and harmonized policies at a global scale (Goodstein, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0030">2007</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, how can we promptly and effectively counteract the negative trend showed by edge and open habitat birds in mountain areas? The conservation of open mountain habitats (grassland and prairies) is strictly linked to local ad hoc management practices that should also be implemented through several economic activities (e.g., marketing of local typical products, recreational outdoor activities, and food services) that depend on open habitats, even within the wide system of protected areas of the Central Italian Alps (Sicurella et al., 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0065">2017</a>). Of course, these for‐profit activities should be addressed toward sustainable forms by adequate governance policies, in order to maintain a viable mountain economy in the long‐term, which should also be perceived as an attractive employment opportunity and produce a positive and broader perception in terms of ecosystem services (Schermer et al., 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0063">2016</a>).
