 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temperature data were obtained from the E‐OBS version 16.0 dataset with a resolution of 0.25 × 0.25 degree (see Haylock et al., 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0033">2008</a> for technical details), which can be downloaded for free at 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ecad.eu" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.ecad.eu</span>. Following the method proposed by Moreno and Hasenauer (
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0049">2016</a>), we downscaled the E‐OBS dataset of daily temperature to a 1‐km ground resolution, using the WorldClim 2 map (Fick &amp; Hijmans, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0023">2017</a>). By doing this, we obtained a daily high‐resolution map for the annual series of temperature for the whole study area. For each of the 28 available years of breeding bird data, we built two annual temperature maps calculating the overall mean of the daily minimum temperature and the overall mean of the daily maximum temperatures recorded during the main local breeding season, respectively (May and June; see Bani et al., 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0006">2009</a>). As the minimum and maximum temperatures were found to be strongly correlated (
  <span class="italic">R</span> = 0.907), all the analyses were performed considering only the overall mean of the daily minimum temperature of May and June.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The rationale of the selection of May and June temperatures is both (a) accounting for the effect of the yearly variability of temperatures during the breeding season on the yearly altitudinal distribution of birds (i.e., inter‐annual variability), and (b) accounting for the long‐term effect of temperature on the bird species altitudinal distribution (i.e., climate warming).</p>
