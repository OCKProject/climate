 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bird data for the period 1982–1988 were obtained from a dataset published by Realini (
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0060">1988</a>) concerning the mountain‐breeding birds of Lombardy, above 600 m asl. This is the first and only big dataset available containing historic data of breeding birds in the Alps of Lombardy. Bird data were collected in the field using the same point count technique adopted for the long‐term monitoring project of breeding birds in Lombardy started in 1992 (see below), from the last week of April to the first week of July. Since Realini bird data were published in geographical maps indicating each sampling point, we georeferenced all data. Data were found to be evenly distributed, both geographically and along the elevational gradient. Overall, they consist in 1927 point counts, but we did not considered data collected in 1988 (10 point counts only) in our analyses. Between 1982 and 1987, the mean number of point counts performed every year was 321.2 (range 67–782). Besides 1988, no data were available between 1989 and 1991, as the Realini research ended in 1988 and the long‐term monitoring project of breeding birds in Lombardy started in 1992.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bird data for the period 1992–2017 were obtained from the dataset of the long‐term monitoring project of breeding birds in Lombardy (Bani, Massimino, Orioli, Bottoni, &amp; Massa, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0006">2009</a>; Fornasari, Bani, De Carli, &amp; Massa, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0025">1998</a>; Massimino, Orioli, Massa, &amp; Bani, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0045">2008</a>). Data were collected using a standardized method based on the 10‐min, unlimited‐distance point count technique (Blondel, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0008">1981</a>; Fornasari et al., 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0025">1998</a>). The technique is considered more effective in detecting bird species belonging to the orders Columbiformes, Cuculiformes, Apodiformes, Coraciiformes, Piciformes, and Passeriformes. Bird surveys were performed every year during the breeding season (10th May to 20th June), to minimize the count of migrants (birds not breeding in the study area) and to survey territorial birds. Censuses were conducted from sunrise to 11.00 a.m., only in good weather conditions, sunny to cloudy, without rain or strong wind (Bani et al., 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0006">2009</a>). Overall, above 600 m asl (lower elevation threshold set by Realini), 5,140 point counts were performed, with a yearly mean of 233.6 (range 82–478), but no data were available for 1993, 1994, 1997, and 1998, when the long‐term monitoring project of breeding birds in Lombardy was interrupted due to the lack of funding.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The two projects provided a large amount of data collected over wide areas, but since they did not rely on multiple surveys in the same season, it was impossible to account for species detection probability. However, the large dataset used for this research should overcome the potential limit of imperfect detection, reducing the noise produced by stochasticity in species discovery (Dondina et al., 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0016">2017</a>). In addition, Fuller and Langslow (
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0028">1984</a>) highlight that 10‐min point counts are satisfactory in detecting more than 70% of birds present at the census site and recommend how “counts exceeding 10 min are wasteful of field effort which could be used to improve other aspects of sampling”, such as the number of sampling units (see also Matsuoka et al., 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0047">2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the long‐term monitoring project of breeding birds in Lombardy, data were collected as species abundances (number of individuals of each detected species per point count), while the Realini survey only recorded species presences in each point count. Thus, we merged the two datasets using information on species presences only.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, the two projects provide 28 annual survey in the 36‐year time series starting from 1982, making a total of 7,067 point counts, ranging from 600 m asl to 2,700 m asl. The choice of the elevational bounds was due to sampling design constraints, the lower one due to historical data sampling design, the upper one because above this threshold the species’ presence drops abruptly in the study area. Overall, we surveyed 113 bird species breeding in mountain and alpine habitats, for a total of 58,080 bird occurrences.</p>
