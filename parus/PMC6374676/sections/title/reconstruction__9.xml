 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since an annual survey of the habitats is not expected within the study area, we built a habitat time series by interpolating the information contained in the available digital cartography. For each species, we calculated the yearly amount of shrub and forest cover within an elevational belt ranging from the minimum and the maximum value of elevation assumed by each of its reference points along the time series. Shrub and forest cover was interpolated using a thin plate regression spline, using a generalized additive model (Wood, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0075">2017</a>), and setting the maximum degrees of freedom to four for the year. Then, we made a yearly prediction of shrub and forest cover, thus building a habitat time series associated with the reference points’ time series (shrub and forest cover time series [km
  <span class="sup">2</span>]). Although annual habitat data were unavailable, we are confident that the information obtained from their interpolation should not deviate very much from the real condition, given the inertia of dynamics involving shrub and forest changes over large areas.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As regards climate data, for each species and for each of its reference points, within the elevational range defined by the minimum and the maximum value of elevation assumed by the same reference points along the time series, we calculated the overall average of daily minimum temperatures of May and June for each year (minimum temperature time series [°C]).</p>
