 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Shrub and forest cover and temperature as drivers of species elevational range changes</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The contributed deviance of temperature in affecting the trend of reference point varied between zero and 0.722, while that of shrub and forest cover varied between zero and 0.526. The unexplained deviance was often small, higher than 0.3 in five cases only, and always lower than 0.567. The shared deviance (i.e., the common contributed deviance) of temperature and shrub and forest cover varied between 0.099 and 0.993, and was often high, being higher than 0.5 in most cases (35 out of 49; Table 
  <a rid="ece34838-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" href="#ece34838-tbl-0001">1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among the 49 reference points that showed a significant positive trend along the time series, 29 were found to be affected by shrub and forest cover, 10 by the temperature, and one by both shrub and forest cover and temperature. Nine reference points were affected by a not distinguishable effect of shrub and forest cover and temperature (Table 
  <a rid="ece34838-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" href="#ece34838-tbl-0001">1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In five cases in which we found a statistical significance of the habitat driver, and in three cases in which the driver was not distinguishable, shrub and forest cover showed an opposite effect with respect to the known ecology of the species. Indeed, the upper reference points were significantly higher in elevation, the lower was the forest and shrub cover. Nevertheless, since the shrub and forest cover decreases with the elevation, the effect of the driver should be obviously spurious. Therefore, the upward displacement in elevation of the reference points could be due to other causes (temperature also showed a nonsignificant effect), which will be described in the Discussion section.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the case of the Coal Tit (
  <span class="italic">Periparus ater</span>), the driver of the upward shift of the OBR reference point should be not distinguishable (nd) according to our hierarchical partitioning criteria. However, we identified “temperature” as a driver since the temperature effect was consistent with those of the lower reference points and the only significant covariate for the OBR reference point, while habitat cover showed an opposite effect on species ecology and was not significant in the weighted multiple linear regression (Table 
  <a rid="ece34838-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" href="#ece34838-tbl-0001">1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The log‐linear analysis highlighted a significant relationship between the pattern of elevational range change of birds and (a) bird's habitat; (b) bird's migration habit; and (c) range change driver. The statistical significance of these relationships is shown in Table 
  <a rid="ece34838-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" href="#ece34838-tbl-0002">2</a>, and the proportion of species for each association is indicated in Figure 
  <a rid="ece34838-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34838-fig-0003">3</a>.
