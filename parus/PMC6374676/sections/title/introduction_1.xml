 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although habitat transformation is still recognized as one of the major human drivers of species distribution changes at a global scale (Foley et al., 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0024">2005</a>), a rising attention has been addressed in the last decades to the effects produced by climate change on biota (Parmesan &amp; Yohe, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0051">2003</a>; Thuiller, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0067">2007</a>; Walther et al., 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0071">2002</a>). In fact, the variation in climatic conditions forces species to adjust their spatial distribution according to their ecological niches, provided that resources are available (Thomas et al., 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0066">2004</a>; Thuiller, Lavorel, &amp; Araújo, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0068">2005</a>). Among the changes in climate features, those involving the raise of temperatures (referred as global warming) are certainly the best known and probably the most investigated. The magnitude of temperature change appears to be different in different geographical areas, and their effect can become more severe with increasing latitude or elevation (Loarie et al., 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0041">2009</a>). Climate warming may affect species ecology with contrasting, additive or even synergic effects with the other co‐occurring processes (e.g., land‐use changes, pollution, harvesting, and species interactions; Mantyka‐Pringle, Martin, &amp; Rhodes, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0044">2013</a>; Oliver &amp; Morecroft, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0050">2014</a>). This is particularly noticeable in those areas where different relevant environmental changes act simultaneously. Species inhabiting medium latitude mountains, like the Alps, have been documented to suffer not only the effects of rising temperatures, but also those due to changes in agroforestry and pastoral practices, which have played an important role in shaping species’ distribution for a long time (Ausden, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0004">2007</a>; Maurer, Weyand, Fischer, &amp; Stöcklin, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0048">2006</a>). Indeed, until a few decades ago, grazing by herds restrained the forest cover in mountain areas, but after the abandonment of pastures, shrubs and forests widely expanded, and even the tree line tended to raise in elevation, probably as a consequence of the synergic action of climate warming and land abandonment (Gehrig‐Fasel, Guisan, &amp; Zimmermann, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0029">2007</a>; Leonelli, Pelfini, di Cella, &amp; Garavaglia, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0040">2011</a>; Parolo &amp; Rossi, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0052">2008</a>; Pernollet, Korner‐Nievergelt, &amp; Jenni, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0054">2015</a>). In fact, the phenomenon was probably boosted by the increase in temperature, which limiting the period of snow cover, led to the colonization of the higher elevations by shrubs and forests (Gehrig‐Fasel et al., 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0029">2007</a>). Overall, in the long‐term period, the abandonment of pastures and climate warming may promote the shrub and forest expansion at the expense of open habitat in mountain areas, leading to a general complex pattern that can vary between geographical areas (e.g., Rocchia, Luppi, Dondina, Orioli, &amp; Bani, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0061">2018</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As birds are particularly mobile and sensitive to environmental alteration, they could arguably be one of the first taxa to change its distribution in response to both climatic and habitat changes (Ambrosini et al., 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0002">2011</a>; Both et al., 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0011">2004</a>; Both &amp; Visser, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0010">2001</a>; Visser, Both, &amp; Lambrechts, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0069">2004</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To quantify objectively the effects of gradual climate and habitat changes on species distribution, long time series of information are essential. Indeed, long time series may help to counteract the intrinsic, often wide, sources of variability and stochasticity, as well as the measurement and sampling noises contained both in biological and environmental data, which could make it difficult to find significant and strong relationships between them (Hilfinger &amp; Paulsson, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0035">2011</a>). Of course, the data noise due to the stochastic errors of measurement of biological and environmental information can be difficult to manage without a long time series of data. On the other hand, the actual variability of biological data may be due to multiple environmental factors whose interactions are seldom taken into account (Guisan &amp; Zimmermann, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0031">2000</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main purpose of this study was to investigate the drivers of the elevational range changes of breeding birds in Central Italian Alps, separating the effects produced by climatic (temperature increase) and habitat (shrub and forest recolonization) drivers. We did not take into account precipitations since they did not show a significant long‐term trend in the study area. We based our research on the 36‐year time series of breeding bird data in Lombardy (from 1982 to 2017), the longest data collection of breeding birds available in Italy, based on point count surveys (see the Methods section for further details). The variation in the elevational distribution of each species along the time was evaluated using a distribution model, which produced a yearly elevational distribution curve, in terms of presence probability, for a bird species along the elevational gradient. Then, we analyzed the contribution of climate and/or habitat changes in shaping the bird elevational range changes.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, since species‐specific ecological traits are known to affect species responses to environmental changes (Copeland, Bradford, Duniway, &amp; Butterfield, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0014">2018</a>; Dondina, Orioli, D'Occhio, Luppi, &amp; Bani, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0016">2017</a>; Dondina, Orioli, Massimino, Pinoli, &amp; Bani, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0017">2015</a>; Luppi, Dondina, Orioli, &amp; Bani, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0042">2018</a>; Williams et al., 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0072">2010</a>), we considered the species’ breeding habitat and migration habit as ecological traits potentially affecting the elevational responses of birds.
