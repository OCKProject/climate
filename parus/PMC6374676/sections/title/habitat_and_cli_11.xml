 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to assess the environmental drivers of elevational distribution changes, we related the annual value of elevation of each reference point showing a significant trend (reference points’ time series) to the annual values of shrub and forest cover (shrub and forest cover time series, [SF]) and to the annual values of the corresponding temperature (minimum temperature time series, [tn]). For this purpose, we used a weighted multiple linear regression, using the annual number of sampling points as weight. In this analysis, we did not account for the possible bias that could be induced by temporal autocorrelation in the dependent variable because this relation may be due to the obvious temporal autocorrelation in the explanatory variables. The temporal autocorrelation was tested with the Durbin–Watson statistic (Durbin &amp; Watson, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0018">1950</a>), performed using the 
  <span class="italic">car</span> package (Fox &amp; Weisberg, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0026">2011</a>) in R. However, in very few cases, we found a temporal autocorrelation in the residuals.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to assess the contribution of both environmental covariates (habitat and climate), we adopted a hierarchical partitioning approach (Chevan &amp; Sutherland, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0013">1991</a>), using the 
  <span class="italic">ecospat</span> package (Di Cola et al., 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0015">2017</a>) in R. We assessed the net contribution of the habitat covariate (i.e., removing the shared habitat and climate contribution), the shared contribution of both environmental covariates, and the unexplained variation for the values assumed by each reference point along the time series (Randin, Jaccard, Vittoz, Yoccoz, &amp; Guisan, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0059">2009</a>). Then, we classified the drivers as follow, based on their contributed deviance: (a) shared contribution &gt;0.9, driver not distinguishable; (b) both net habitat and climate contribution ≥0.1: independent effect of both drivers; (c) net habitat contribution ≥0.1 and net climate contribution &lt;0.1, habitat driver; (d) net climate contribution ≥0.1 and net habitat contribution &lt;0.1, climate driver; (e) unexplained variation &gt;0.9, neither habitat nor climatic driver.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each species showing a significant elevational range change, we assessed the association of each pattern of elevational range change with the (a) breeding habitat, (b) the migration habit, and (c) the range change driver. The breeding habitat (open, edge, or forest species) and migration habit (long‐distance migrant [ldm], short‐distance migrant [sdm] or resident [res]) were assigned according to Sicurella, Orioli, Pinoli, Ambrosini, and Bani (
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0065">2017</a>) and integrated by the authors where necessary. The association between each pair of categorical variables was assessed performing a log‐linear analysis (Agresti, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0001">1996</a>) on the observed bird species’ frequencies from a contingency table obtained by crossing the pattern of elevational range change, the breeding habitat, the migration habit, and the drivers of range change.
