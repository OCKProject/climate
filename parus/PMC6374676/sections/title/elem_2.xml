  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study was carried out in the Alps of Lombardy (Italy), above 600 m asl. The mountain area of Lombardy covers a large (160‐km wide) portion of the Italian Alpine chain, and includes the groups of the Lepontine, Rhaetian, and Orobic (or Bergamasque) Alps. The area surface amounts to 7,596 km
   <span class="sup">2</span>, about 45% (3,432 km
   <span class="sup">2</span>) of which is currently covered by forests, mainly located (92%) below 1,800 m asl (Figure 
   <a rid="ece34838-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34838-fig-0001">1</a>). The highest peak (Punta Perrucchetti of the Bernina Massif) reaches 4,020 m asl and, overall, about 37% of the study area (2,822 km
   <span class="sup">2</span>) lays above 1,800 m asl. The climate is humid continental, characterized by a high seasonal temperature variation. In winter, the mean temperatures fall far below freezing at 2,000 m asl, while during summer, they can reach values of 10–12°C (RSY,

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bird data for the period 1982–1988 were obtained from a dataset published by Realini (
    <a rid="ece34838-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0060">1988</a>) concerning the mountain‐breeding birds of Lombardy, above 600 m asl. This is the first and only big dataset available containing historic data of breeding birds in the Alps of Lombardy. Bird data were collected in the field using the same point count technique adopted for the long‐term monitoring project of breeding birds in Lombardy started in 1992 (see below), from the last week of April to the first week of July. Since Realini bird data were published in geographical maps indicating each sampling point, we georeferenced all data. Data were found to be evenly distributed, both geographically and along the elevational gradient. Overall, they consist in 1927 point counts, but we did not considered data collected in 1988 (10 point counts only) in our analyses. Between 1982 and 1987, the mean number of point counts performed every year was 321.2 (range 67–782). Besides 1988, no data were available between 1989 and 1991, as the Realini research ended in 1988 and the long‐term monitoring project of breeding birds in Lombardy started in 1992.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bird data for the period 1992–2017 were obtained from the dataset of the long‐term monitoring project of breeding birds in Lombardy (Bani, Massimino, Orioli, Bottoni, &amp; Massa, 
    <a rid="ece34838-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0006">2009</a>; Fornasari, Bani, De Carli, &amp; Massa,

    <a rid="ece34838-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0045">2008</a>). Data were collected using a standardized method based on the 10‐min, unlimited‐distance point count technique (Blondel, 
    <a rid="ece34838-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0008">1981</a>; Fornasari et al., 
    <a rid="ece34838-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0025">1998</a>). The technique is considered more effective in detecting bird species belonging to the orders Columbiformes, Cuculiformes, Apodiformes, Coraciiformes, Piciformes, and Passeriformes. Bird surveys were performed every year during the breeding season (10th May to 20th June), to minimize the count of migrants (birds not breeding in the study area) and to survey territorial birds. Censuses were conducted from sunrise to 11.00 a.m., only in good weather conditions, sunny to cloudy, without rain or strong wind (Bani et al., 
    <a rid="ece34838-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0006">2009</a>). Overall, above 600 m asl (lower elevation threshold set by Realini), 5,140 point counts were performed, with a yearly mean of 233.6 (range 82–478), but no data were available for 1993, 1994, 1997, and 1998, when the long‐term monitoring project of breeding birds in Lombardy was interrupted due to the lack of funding.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The two projects provided a large amount of data collected over wide areas, but since they did not rely on multiple surveys in the same season, it was impossible to account for species detection probability. However, the large dataset used for this research should overcome the potential limit of imperfect detection, reducing the noise produced by stochasticity in species discovery (Dondina et al., 
    <a rid="ece34838-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0016">2017</a>). In addition, Fuller and Langslow (
    <a rid="ece34838-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0028">1984</a>) highlight that 10‐min point counts are satisfactory in detecting more than 70% of birds present at the census site and recommend how “counts exceeding 10 min are wasteful of field effort which could be used to improve other aspects of sampling”, such as the number of sampling units (see also Matsuoka et al., 
    <a rid="ece34838-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0047">2014</a>).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the long‐term monitoring project of breeding birds in Lombardy, data were collected as species abundances (number of individuals of each detected species per point count), while the Realini survey only recorded species presences in each point count. Thus, we merged the two datasets using information on species presences only.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, the two projects provide 28 annual survey in the 36‐year time series starting from 1982, making a total of 7,067 point counts, ranging from 600 m asl to 2,700 m asl. The choice of the elevational bounds was due to sampling design constraints, the lower one due to historical data sampling design, the upper one because above this threshold the species’ presence drops abruptly in the study area. Overall, we surveyed 113 bird species breeding in mountain and alpine habitats, for a total of 58,080 bird occurrences.</p>

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Habitat data</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Habitat data came from to the digital cartography available for the study area in order to associate it with the time series of bird data. We wanted to evaluate the surface covered by shrubs and forests between 1982 and 2017 in the mountain area of Lombardy, above 600 m asl. For the analyses, we pooled together shrub and forest covers, since the distinction between the two land‐use classes using remote information is often difficult (Laliberte et al., 
    <a rid="ece34838-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0039">2004</a>). However, the information obtained by merging the two classes together could be a good proxy of forest cover successional stages at the expense of open habitats. For land use, we use the DUSAF digital cartography (ERSAF, 
    <a rid="ece34838-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0021">2010</a>) are available for the years 1980 (1:50,000), 1999, 2007, 2009, 2012, and 2015 (all 1:10,000; downloadable from

To avoid possible bias in the evaluation of habitat data due to the different cartographies’ resolution, we resampled those with higher resolution to the lower resolution.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temperature data were obtained from the E‐OBS version 16.0 dataset with a resolution of 0.25 × 0.25 degree (see Haylock et al.,

    <a rid="ece34838-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0049">2016</a>), we downscaled the E‐OBS dataset of daily temperature to a 1‐km ground resolution, using the WorldClim 2 map (Fick &amp; Hijmans, 
    <a rid="ece34838-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0023">2017</a>). By doing this, we obtained a daily high‐resolution map for the annual series of temperature for the whole study area. For each of the 28 available years of breeding bird data, we built two annual temperature maps calculating the overall mean of the daily minimum temperature and the overall mean of the daily maximum temperatures recorded during the main local breeding season, respectively (May and June; see Bani et al., 
    <a rid="ece34838-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0006">2009</a>). As the minimum and maximum temperatures were found to be strongly correlated (
    <span class="italic">R</span> = 0.907), all the analyses were performed considering only the overall mean of the daily minimum temperature of May and June.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The rationale of the selection of May and June temperatures is both (a) accounting for the effect of the yearly variability of temperatures during the breeding season on the yearly altitudinal distribution of birds (i.e., inter‐annual variability), and (b) accounting for the long‐term effect of temperature on the bird species altitudinal distribution (i.e., climate warming).</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Annual elevational distribution curves of species</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since the data came from different projects, we were dealing with different sampling effort along the elevation gradient among years. This prevented a direct analysis of temporal changes occurred in the species elevational distribution, which would result biased among years according the year sampling efforts. Thus, we were forced to use a modeling approach to first assess the yearly species distribution, and subsequently, analyze its temporal trend. Indeed, for each species, we calculated the annual elevational distribution curve following the “curve response shape” method (Heegaard, 
   <a rid="ece34838-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0034">2002</a>; Maggini et al., 
   <a rid="ece34838-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0043">2011</a>), which defines a presence probability curve for a bird species along the elevational gradient. The curve was assessed as a smooth function (thin plate regression spline; Wood, 
   <a rid="ece34838-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0075">2017</a>) of the elevation, other than northing and easting to account for spatial autocorrelation, using generalized additive models (Maggini et al.,

   <a rid="ece34838-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0075">2017</a>). We set the maximum degrees of freedom to three for the elevation, in order to avoid overfitting and to obtain unimodal curves, and 15 for the space smooth (geographic coordinates; Maggini et al., 
   <a rid="ece34838-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0043">2011</a>; Massimino et al., 
   <a rid="ece34838-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0046">2015</a>). The analysis was performed using the 
   <span class="italic">mgcv</span> package (Wood,

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Theoretically, up to five reference points characterize the curve: an optimum point (OPT; the central point of the curve), in which projection on the elevation axis indicates the elevation associated with the highest presence probability of the species; a central border left point and an outer border left point (CBL and OBL, two points at lower elevations), with a decreasing probability of the presence of the species; and a central border right point and an outer border right point (CBR and OBR, two points at higher elevations), with decreasing probability of the presence of the species. The central and the outer borders result from a fraction of the maximum response (Heegaard, 
   <a rid="ece34838-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0034">2002</a>). The two central border points were defined by the projections on the elevation axis of the value densities corresponding to OPT*exp(−0.5), while the two outer border points by the projections on the elevation axis of the value densities corresponding to OPT*exp(−2). However, as we were working within a delimited elevational range, we could deal with truncated curves when some reference points fell outside the investigated range. Indeed, for several species, the distribution curve might fall under the 600 m asl or over 2,700 m asl.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each year, bird occurrence data were bootstrapped (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 200) and one curve for each bootstrapped sample was fitted in order to assess the estimated variability of the reference points. We considered a reference point estimate as reliable when the fitting procedure succeeded for at least 50% of the bootstrapped samples. Then, for each species and for each of its (up to 5) reliable reference points, we built a time series (reference points’ time series). Moreover, we considered the reference points having at least 10 reliable values along the time series as informative for the long‐term analysis.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reconstruction of the habitat and climate dataset</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since an annual survey of the habitats is not expected within the study area, we built a habitat time series by interpolating the information contained in the available digital cartography. For each species, we calculated the yearly amount of shrub and forest cover within an elevational belt ranging from the minimum and the maximum value of elevation assumed by each of its reference points along the time series. Shrub and forest cover was interpolated using a thin plate regression spline, using a generalized additive model (Wood, 
   <a rid="ece34838-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0075">2017</a>), and setting the maximum degrees of freedom to four for the year. Then, we made a yearly prediction of shrub and forest cover, thus building a habitat time series associated with the reference points’ time series (shrub and forest cover time series [km
   <span class="sup">2</span>]). Although annual habitat data were unavailable, we are confident that the information obtained from their interpolation should not deviate very much from the real condition, given the inertia of dynamics involving shrub and forest changes over large areas.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As regards climate data, for each species and for each of its reference points, within the elevational range defined by the minimum and the maximum value of elevation assumed by the same reference points along the time series, we calculated the overall average of daily minimum temperatures of May and June for each year (minimum temperature time series [°C]).</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, we assessed the presence of a temporal trend in the species’ reference points. To this aim, we fitted a weighted linear regression using the elevation value of each reference point as dependent variable, the year as independent variable, and the number of sampling units as weight. The analysis was performed using the 
   <span class="italic">nlme</span> package (Pinheiro, Bates, DebRoy, &amp; Sarkar, 
   <a rid="ece34838-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0055">2017</a>) in R. Then, we classified the patterns of elevational range change for all species showing a significant trend in at least one of their reference points as: (a) “contraction” when the changes of the reference points brought to a distance reduction between the extreme reference points; (b) “expansion” when the changes of the reference points brought to an increase of the distance between extreme reference points; (c) “shift” when the changes of the reference points were consistent between each other. Depending on which reference points changed, we referred the observed change to the lower (OBL and CBL) or upper (CBR and OBR) reference points. If the slopes of the year pertaining to the two extreme reference points showed a significant trend with same sign but were significantly different between them, we evaluated if their change caused either a contraction or an expansion of species' range.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have to acknowledge that reference points’ estimation using unlimited‐distance point count technique may be less accurate for open habitat species, since individuals observed at large distances (and different elevations) could be associated to the elevation of the point where observations were performed. Thus, due to the higher variance in observed elevation for open habitat species and the consequent estimation of their reference points, the long‐term changes in elevational distribution could result not significant (type II error). Moreover, the same kind of error could arise from the impossibility to take into account the imperfect detection that, however, should be quite limited according to Fuller and Langslow (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to assess the environmental drivers of elevational distribution changes, we related the annual value of elevation of each reference point showing a significant trend (reference points’ time series) to the annual values of shrub and forest cover (shrub and forest cover time series, [SF]) and to the annual values of the corresponding temperature (minimum temperature time series, [tn]). For this purpose, we used a weighted multiple linear regression, using the annual number of sampling points as weight. In this analysis, we did not account for the possible bias that could be induced by temporal autocorrelation in the dependent variable because this relation may be due to the obvious temporal autocorrelation in the explanatory variables. The temporal autocorrelation was tested with the Durbin–Watson statistic (Durbin &amp; Watson, 
   <a rid="ece34838-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0018">1950</a>), performed using the

   <a rid="ece34838-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0026">2011</a>) in R. However, in very few cases, we found a temporal autocorrelation in the residuals.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to assess the contribution of both environmental covariates (habitat and climate), we adopted a hierarchical partitioning approach (Chevan &amp; Sutherland, 
   <a rid="ece34838-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0013">1991</a>), using the

   <a rid="ece34838-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0015">2017</a>) in R. We assessed the net contribution of the habitat covariate (i.e., removing the shared habitat and climate contribution), the shared contribution of both environmental covariates, and the unexplained variation for the values assumed by each reference point along the time series (Randin, Jaccard, Vittoz, Yoccoz, &amp; Guisan, 
   <a rid="ece34838-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0059">2009</a>). Then, we classified the drivers as follow, based on their contributed deviance: (a) shared contribution &gt;0.9, driver not distinguishable; (b) both net habitat and climate contribution ≥0.1: independent effect of both drivers; (c) net habitat contribution ≥0.1 and net climate contribution &lt;0.1, habitat driver; (d) net climate contribution ≥0.1 and net habitat contribution &lt;0.1, climate driver; (e) unexplained variation &gt;0.9, neither habitat nor climatic driver.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each species showing a significant elevational range change, we assessed the association of each pattern of elevational range change with the (a) breeding habitat, (b) the migration habit, and (c) the range change driver. The breeding habitat (open, edge, or forest species) and migration habit (long‐distance migrant [ldm], short‐distance migrant [sdm] or resident [res]) were assigned according to Sicurella, Orioli, Pinoli, Ambrosini, and Bani (
   <a rid="ece34838-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0065">2017</a>) and integrated by the authors where necessary. The association between each pair of categorical variables was assessed performing a log‐linear analysis (Agresti, 
   <a rid="ece34838-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0001">1996</a>) on the observed bird species’ frequencies from a contingency table obtained by crossing the pattern of elevational range change, the breeding habitat, the migration habit, and the drivers of range change.
