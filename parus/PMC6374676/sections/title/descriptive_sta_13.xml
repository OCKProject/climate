 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Alps of Lombardy (above 600 m asl), the shrub and forest cover showed a positive trend (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34838-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34838-fig-0002">2</a>a), switching from an overall cover of 4,140 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> in the 1980 to 4,364 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> in 2015 (+224 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>; +3.0% on the 7,596 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> of the study area), with a more conspicuous increase between 600 m and 1,200 m asl respect to that observed above 1,200 m asl. Within the study area, also the temperature showed a clear positive trend over time (substantially invariant with respect to the elevation; Figure 
  <a rid="ece34838-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34838-fig-0002">2</a>b), in accordance with the literature about climate warming in Europe (e.g., Beniston, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0007">2006</a>; Elguindi, Rauscher, &amp; Giorgi, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0020">2013</a>). Indeed, the overall mean of the daily minimum temperatures in May and June increased from about 4.7°C in the eighties to about 6.0°C in the last 10 years, with an average increase of about 0.46°C per decade (see Klein Tank &amp; Können, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0037">2003</a>).

   <p>Descriptive statistics between 1980 and 2017 of (a) the shrub and forest cover [km
    <span class="sup">2</span>] and their trend (between 600 m and 1,200 and above 1,200 m asl), and (b) the average of daily minimum temperatures [°C] in the months of May and June and their trend in three elevational belts, in the Alpine areas of the Lombardy Region. For the shrub and forest cover, data were interpolated using a generalized additive model on available survey data (filled circles). For temperatures, data were derived from the E‐OBS dataset.
