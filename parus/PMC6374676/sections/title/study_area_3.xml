 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study was carried out in the Alps of Lombardy (Italy), above 600 m asl. The mountain area of Lombardy covers a large (160‐km wide) portion of the Italian Alpine chain, and includes the groups of the Lepontine, Rhaetian, and Orobic (or Bergamasque) Alps. The area surface amounts to 7,596 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>, about 45% (3,432 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) of which is currently covered by forests, mainly located (92%) below 1,800 m asl (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34838-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34838-fig-0001">1</a>). The highest peak (Punta Perrucchetti of the Bernina Massif) reaches 4,020 m asl and, overall, about 37% of the study area (2,822 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) lays above 1,800 m asl. The climate is humid continental, characterized by a high seasonal temperature variation. In winter, the mean temperatures fall far below freezing at 2,000 m asl, while during summer, they can reach values of 10–12°C (RSY,
