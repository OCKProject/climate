 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Habitat data came from to the digital cartography available for the study area in order to associate it with the time series of bird data. We wanted to evaluate the surface covered by shrubs and forests between 1982 and 2017 in the mountain area of Lombardy, above 600 m asl. For the analyses, we pooled together shrub and forest covers, since the distinction between the two land‐use classes using remote information is often difficult (Laliberte et al., 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0039">2004</a>). However, the information obtained by merging the two classes together could be a good proxy of forest cover successional stages at the expense of open habitats. For land use, we use the DUSAF digital cartography (ERSAF, 
  <a rid="ece34838-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34838-bib-0021">2010</a>) are available for the years 1980 (1:50,000), 1999, 2007, 2009, 2012, and 2015 (all 1:10,000; downloadable from

To avoid possible bias in the evaluation of habitat data due to the different cartographies’ resolution, we resampled those with higher resolution to the lower resolution.
