  <p>Descriptive statistics between 1980 and 2017 of (a) the shrub and forest cover [km
   <span class="sup">2</span>] and their trend (between 600 m and 1,200 and above 1,200 m asl), and (b) the average of daily minimum temperatures [°C] in the months of May and June and their trend in three elevational belts, in the Alpine areas of the Lombardy Region. For the shrub and forest cover, data were interpolated using a generalized additive model on available survey data (filled circles). For temperatures, data were derived from the E‐OBS dataset.
