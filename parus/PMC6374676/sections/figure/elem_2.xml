  <p>Proportion of bird species showing a pattern of range change (lower boundary contraction [Contr] in black, upper boundary expansion [Exp] in dark gray and upward shift [Shift], light gray), classified according to (a) habitat breeding preferences (edge [E], forest [F] and open [O]), (b) the migration habit (long‐distance migrants [LDM], residents [RES] and short‐distance migrants [SDM]), and (c) the range change driver (density‐dependent effect [dde], driver not distinguishable [nd], shrub and forest cover [SF], and temperature [tn]). The column width is proportional to the number of bird species belonging to the considered group</p>
