 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many birds place green plant material and feathers in their nests and usually replenish them on a daily basis throughout the incubation and nestling stages of reproduction (Wimberger 
  <a rid="b182" ref-type="bibr" href="#b182">1984</a>; Brouwer and Komdeur 
  <a rid="b19" ref-type="bibr" href="#b19">2004</a>; Peralta-Sanchez et al. 
  <a rid="b128" ref-type="bibr" href="#b128">2010</a>). Green plant materials contain volatile secondary compounds such as hydrocarbons, mainly monoterpenes and isoprene, which could have biocidal effects on parasites and pathogens (Clark 
  <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">1991</a>; Brouwer and Komdeur 
  <a rid="b19" ref-type="bibr" href="#b19">2004</a>; Dubiec et al. 
  <a rid="b38" ref-type="bibr" href="#b38">2013</a>). Meanwhile, the majority of bacteria found on feathers are known to produce antibiotic substances, meaning that feathers could prevent the establishment of other bacteria within the nest environment (Peralta-Sanchez et al. 
  <a rid="b128" ref-type="bibr" href="#b128">2010</a>). Consequently, both green plant material and feathers may inhibit parasites, although they may also provide thermoregulatory benefits and/or play a role in sexual selection. For example, the nonbuilding partner may select mates on the quantity of feathers or green plant material placed in nests (Brouwer and Komdeur 
  <a rid="b19" ref-type="bibr" href="#b19">2004</a>; Peralta-Sanchez et al. 
  <a rid="b128" ref-type="bibr" href="#b128">2010</a>), and builders may use green plant material to signal their quality to their nonbuilding partners as in contrast to visual cues, fresh plant material in dark nests may be an olfactory cue of the builder's quality (Clark 
  <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">1991</a>). Consequently, there are several nonmutually exclusive hypotheses that seek to explain the function of feathers and green plant material in birds' nests, and they have been examined in a few species.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The function of green plant material has been well studied in starlings, where males build the nest alone. Males select only a small subset of available plant species and have been shown to prefer those plants that possess higher concentrations of mono- and sesquiterpenes than randomly available plant species (Clark and Mason 
  <a rid="b25" ref-type="bibr" href="#b25">1985</a>). While this suggests an antiparasite function, a study that removed green plant material from experimental nests found that when compared to control nests, experimental nests actually contained fewer ectoparasites and nestlings were heavier, although postfledging survival did not differ (Fauth et al. 
  <a rid="b45" ref-type="bibr" href="#b45">1991</a>). When all original nests were replaced with either experimental nests containing green plant material or control nests containing grass, it was found that ectoparasite abundance was similar between treatments (Gwinner et al. 
  <a rid="b53" ref-type="bibr" href="#b53">2000</a>). However, nestlings in nests containing green plant material were heavier and had higher hematocrit levels, and although fledging success was similar, postfledging survival was higher among nestlings raised in nests containing green plant material (Gwinner et al. 
  <a rid="b53" ref-type="bibr" href="#b53">2000</a>). These studies suggest, but do not provide conclusive evidence, that green plant material inhibits parasites. Further, the amount of green plant material carried to nests by males was positively correlated with the time taken to attract a female during courtship (Gwinner 
  <a rid="b52" ref-type="bibr" href="#b52">1997</a>). This suggests that green plant material plays a role in sexual selection, which was supported in a study that found that males nesting in nestboxes experimentally contaminated with ectoparasites did not carry more plant material to nests than males in control nestboxes (Brouwer and Komdeur 
  <a rid="b19" ref-type="bibr" href="#b19">2004</a>). Further, unpaired males carried more greenery to nests when a caged female was positioned adjacent to nests than when a caged male or an empty cage was present, while paired males did not respond to these cues (Brouwer and Komdeur 
  <a rid="b19" ref-type="bibr" href="#b19">2004</a>). Together, these studies suggest that male starlings place green plant material in their nests primarily to attract females and secondarily to repel ectoparasites.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In blue tits, where the females build the nest alone, the experimental addition of green plant material resulted in higher nestling masses in experimentally enlarged, but not reduced, broods (Mennerat et al. 
  <a rid="b106" ref-type="bibr" href="#b106">2009a</a>,
  <a rid="b107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b107">b</a>). Also aromatic plants significantly reduced bacterial richness on nestlings, but not on parents (Mennerat et al. 
  <a rid="b108" ref-type="bibr" href="#b108">2009c</a>). This suggests that green plant material serves to limit the effects of ectoparasites, which was partially supported in a study that added green plant material to experimental nests and grass to control nests. Fleas were less abundant and blackflies and midges more abundant in experimental nests built by young females, although nestling growth and immunity did not differ between treatments or with female age (Tomás et al. 
  <a rid="b171" ref-type="bibr" href="#b171">2013</a>). However, when the amount of aromatic plants within blue tit nests was experimentally increased, there was no decline in the number of Protocalliphora blow flies (Mennerat et al. 
  <a rid="b105" ref-type="bibr" href="#b105">2008</a>). When the nests of blue tits and pied flycatchers differing in composition were swapped between the two species, experimentally induced changes in nest composition did result in significant changes in the abundances of mites, fleas, and blowflies in both species (Moreno et al. 
  <a rid="b119" ref-type="bibr" href="#b119">2009</a>). Differences in ectoparasite abundances between the two bird species were maintained, whatever the experimental change in nest composition used. Meanwhile, blue tit nests have been shown to have a range of distinct odor classes that are easily perceived by humans (Lambrechts and dos Santos 
  <a rid="b76" ref-type="bibr" href="#b76">2000</a>), which occurs because green plant material contains chemical compounds used by humans to make aromatic house cleaners and herbal medicines (Petit et al. 
  <a rid="b130" ref-type="bibr" href="#b130">2002</a>). Blue tit parents use odor cues to determine when to replenish green plant material and both parents hesitated longer outside their own nestboxes when their nests had been experimentally supplied with fresh green plant material than when supplied with moss (Mennerat 
  <a rid="b104" ref-type="bibr" href="#b104">2008</a>). A further complication comes from a study that showed that ants occasionally occupy blue tit nests and their presence may modify host–parasite interactions (Lambrechts et al. 
  <a rid="b77" ref-type="bibr" href="#b77">2008</a>). It is presently unclear whether the ants exploit their avian hosts using their nests as places to search for ectoparasites, and there are still too few studies to completely discount the antiparasite functions of green plant material within blue tit nests, meaning that further studies are required.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The function of feathers within bird's nests has also been studied in tree swallows. When feathers were added to experimental nests, ectoparasites were more abundant in those nests than in control nests where feathers were left untouched, thereby providing no support for the hypothesis that feathers physically separate nestlings and ectoparasites (Dawson et al. 
  <a rid="b32" ref-type="bibr" href="#b32">2011</a>). In another study, nestlings in experimental nests where feathers were removed had higher infestations of mites and lice and lower growth rates when compared to nestlings in control nests. Consequently, there was no reduction in the nestling's exposure to ectoparasites, although the feathers did provide thermal benefits to the nestlings (Winkler 
  <a rid="b184" ref-type="bibr" href="#b184">1993</a>). Consequently, there is no evidence that feathers within tree swallow nests provide protection from ectoparasites, although one study added green plant material to experimental nests and found that they contained fewer ectoparasites than control nests, although breeding success did not differ between treatments (Shutler and Campbell 
  <a rid="b155" ref-type="bibr" href="#b155">2007</a>). This further suggests that cup lining material has only limited effects on parasite abundance.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, it remains unclear whether green plant materials and feathers serve to reduce nest parasites. This uncertainty is further confounded by studies of other species that report contrasting findings. For example, the amount of green plant material in bonelli's eagle (
  <span class="italic">Hieraaetus fasciatus</span>) nests was negatively correlated with ectoparasite abundance (Ontiveros et al. 
  <a rid="b123" ref-type="bibr" href="#b123">2008</a>), whereas the number of nest lining feathers within barn swallow nests was negatively related to eggshell bacterial load (Peralta-Sanchez et al. 
  <a rid="b128" ref-type="bibr" href="#b128">2010</a>), thereby supporting an antiparasite function. Further, a fascinating study examined the function of cigarette butts incorporated into urban house sparrow and house finch (
  <span class="italic">Carpodacus mexicanus</span>) nests and found that the amount of cellulose acetate from the butts, which repels parasites, was negatively associated with the number of nest-dwelling parasites (Suárez-Rodríguez et al. 
  <a rid="b166" ref-type="bibr" href="#b166">2013</a>). However, green plant material in wood stork (
  <span class="italic">Mycteriaa mericana</span>) nests was found to provide insulation for chicks rather than to repel ectoparasites (Rodgers et al. 
  <a rid="b144" ref-type="bibr" href="#b144">1988</a>). Consequently, the exact function of green plant material and feathers remains unclear, and further studies are required to examine their function. They are probably multifunctional materials that limit parasite abundance, provide insulation, and play a role in sexual selection, and further studies that simultaneously examine these possibilities are required.
