 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observational studies have shown that male-built nests play a role in sexual selection (Andersson 
  <a rid="b4" ref-type="bibr" href="#b4">1982</a>; Soler et al. 
  <a rid="b161" ref-type="bibr" href="#b161">1998a</a>,
  <a rid="b162" ref-type="bibr" href="#b162">b</a>) as there is often a positive correlation between some aspect of nest size or design and some aspect of the male's phenotype. In penduline tits (
  <span class="italic">Remiz pendulinus</span>), those males that constructed larger nests were more successful in acquiring a female (Hoi et al. 
  <a rid="b67" ref-type="bibr" href="#b67">1994</a>, 
  <a rid="b68" ref-type="bibr" href="#b68">1996</a>). Although male care was not correlated with nest size, females invested more care into broods raised in large nests, meaning that males that built large nests benefited through increased reproductive success (Szentirmai et al. 
  <a rid="b167" ref-type="bibr" href="#b167">2005</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These observational studies have also been supplemented by several experimental studies. Male black wheatears (
  <span class="italic">Oenanthe leucura</span>) carry about 2 kg of stones to their nest sites, and observational studies have shown that males with larger wing areas carry more stones to nesting sites than males with smaller wing areas (Møller et al. 
  <a rid="b114" ref-type="bibr" href="#b114">1995</a>). The wing area of males appears to be a morphological adaptation to carrying such stones as when some of the primary feathers of experimental males were removed, they carried fewer stones to their nests than control males (Møller et al. 
  <a rid="b114" ref-type="bibr" href="#b114">1995</a>). Nest sites contain a mixture of old and new stones, and when old stones were experimentally removed from nests, males did not respond by carrying more stones, implying that females choose males on the number of new stones that they transfer to nesting sites before each breeding attempt (Soler et al. 
  <a rid="b160" ref-type="bibr" href="#b160">1996</a>). Further, when new stones were experimentally added to nest sites during the stone-carrying period, males carried fewer stones to nests, and when stones were experimentally removed, males compensated by carrying more stones to the nesting site (Moreno et al. 
  <a rid="b116" ref-type="bibr" href="#b116">1994</a>; Soler et al. 
  <a rid="b160" ref-type="bibr" href="#b160">1996</a>). In an experiment which manipulated the number of stones at nests, it was found that females which were paired with males that carried more stones responded by laying earlier in the breeding season, which led to experimental pairs having higher reproductive success than control pairs (Moreno et al. 
  <a rid="b116" ref-type="bibr" href="#b116">1994</a>; Møller et al. 
  <a rid="b114" ref-type="bibr" href="#b114">1995</a>; Soler et al. 
  <a rid="b160" ref-type="bibr" href="#b160">1996</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In starlings (
  <span class="italic">Sturnus vulgaris</span>) and spotless starlings (
  <span class="italic">Sturnus unicolor</span>), males build the nest almost entirely alone, while females occasionally add feathers to nests. Both species incorporate green plant material into their nests, and the function of such material is thought to be associated either with sexual selection or with limiting the detrimental effects of ectoparasites. In spotless starlings, the majority of green plant material was carried to nests during the ten days prior to the start of egg laying, and those males that carried more green plant material to nests controlled a larger number of boxes, meaning that they had more female partners (Veiga et al. 
  <a rid="b176" ref-type="bibr" href="#b176">2006</a>). Meanwhile, the experimental removal and addition of green plant material had no effect on ectoparasite abundance or the mass of nestlings in starling nests, although males with experimentally increased amounts of green plant material did attract females more successfully than control males (Brouwer and Komdeur 
  <a rid="b19" ref-type="bibr" href="#b19">2004</a>). When the amount of green plant material was experimentally increased in spotless starling nests to mimic increased male nest-building effort, females responded by carrying more feathers to nests. Such responsive building behaviors were interpreted as functionally related signaling behaviors that played an important role in courtship activities and the signaling of status (Polo and Veiga 
  <a rid="b132" ref-type="bibr" href="#b132">2006</a>). Further, the experimental addition of green plant material in spotless starling nests resulted in females laying larger clutches (López-Rull and Gil 
  <a rid="b89" ref-type="bibr" href="#b89">2009</a>) and the skewing the sex ratio of such broods by increasing the number of sons in those eggs (Polo et al. 
  <a rid="b133" ref-type="bibr" href="#b133">2004</a>). Consequently, these studies show that the function of green plant material within starling and spotless starling nests is to play a role in sexual selection rather than as an antiparasite behavior.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Meanwhile, the females of some species choose males based on the number of nests that they build within their territories (Metz 
  <a rid="b109" ref-type="bibr" href="#b109">1991</a>). In birds, studies have shown that males that build more nests within their territories have greater reproductive success in yellow-shouldered widowbirds (
  <span class="italic">Euplectes macrourus</span>) (Savalli 
  <a rid="b147" ref-type="bibr" href="#b147">1994</a>), red bishops (
  <span class="italic">Euplectes orix</span>) (Friedl and Klump 
  <a rid="b47" ref-type="bibr" href="#b47">2000</a>) and wrens (
  <span class="italic">Troglodytes troglodytes</span>) (Garson 
  <a rid="b50" ref-type="bibr" href="#b50">1980</a>; Evans and Burn 
  <a rid="b42" ref-type="bibr" href="#b42">1996</a>; Evans 
  <a rid="b40" ref-type="bibr" href="#b40">1997a</a>,
  <a rid="b41" ref-type="bibr" href="#b41">b</a>). Despite one study reporting that the experimental addition of nests did not increase the pairing success of male marsh wrens (
  <span class="italic">Cistothorus palustris</span>) (Leonard and Picman 
  <a rid="b81" ref-type="bibr" href="#b81">1987</a>), there is good evidence that males that build multiple nests gain increased reproductive success. More generally, there is strong evidence that male-built nests act as signals to females, who adjust their reproductive investment accordingly (Andersson 
  <a rid="b4" ref-type="bibr" href="#b4">1982</a>; Moreno 
  <a rid="b115" ref-type="bibr" href="#b115">2012</a>).
