 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our understanding of the design and function of birds' nests has increased considerably in recent years and the evidence suggests that nests have several nonmutually exclusive functions. Therefore, we conclude that far from being simple receptacles for eggs and/or offspring, the design and function of birds' nests is far more sophisticated than previously realized. Nevertheless, there are still several areas that are likely to be fruitful for future research. First, both natural and sexual selection appear to influence nest design, yet while natural selection selects for smaller nests, sexual selection selects for larger nests. One recent study (Sergio et al. 
  <a rid="b153" ref-type="bibr" href="#b153">2011</a>) strongly suggests that natural and sexual selection are directly traded off against each other and further studies should examine the resolution of these conflicting requirements. Second, empirical studies examining the design and function of birds' nests are distributed nonrandomly with respect to their ecology, with the vast majority of studies involve small hole nesting passerines which breed inside nestboxes (Lambrechts et al. 
  <a rid="b78" ref-type="bibr" href="#b78">2010</a>). This bias is understandable as species such as blue tits and starlings are logistically easy to study, yet future studies could usefully assess the generality of these findings by studying open-cup nesting species. This is important as open-cup nesting birds are likely to be under very different selection pressures to hole nesting birds. Third, there is concern that climate change may negatively affect nest-building animals. We therefore urge future studies to examine how climate change may affect nest-building behaviors and the design of the completed nest.
