 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The selection of a safe nesting site is an important determinant of reproductive success, and some birds have been shown to choose their nest sites in order to reduce the risk of predation. An observational study showed that dusky warblers (
  <span class="italic">Phylloscopus fuscatus</span>) selected safer nest sites that were farther from the ground and in more isolated bushes when predatory Siberian chipmunks (
  <span class="italic">Tamias sibiricus</span>) were abundant, despite such locations carrying costs in terms of higher exposure to cold winds (Forstmeier and Weiss 
  <a rid="b46" ref-type="bibr" href="#b46">2004</a>). Elsewhere, veeries (
  <span class="italic">Catharus fuscescens</span>) selected nest sites with low levels of predatory white-footed mice (
  <span class="italic">Peromyscus leucopus</span>) activity (Schmidt et al. 
  <a rid="b151" ref-type="bibr" href="#b151">2006</a>), and Inca Terns (
  <span class="italic">Larosterna inca</span>) showed a clear preference for inaccessible crevices on cliffs that suffered lower predation rates than more exposed cliff sites (Verlando and Márquez 
  <a rid="b177" ref-type="bibr" href="#b177">2002</a>). These observational studies have also been supplemented with experimental studies. Experimentally placing wasp (
  <span class="italic">Polybia rejecta</span>) nests in close proximity to rufous-naped wren (
  <span class="italic">Campylorhynchus rufinucha</span>) nests resulted in experimental wren pairs suffering significantly lower rates of predation from white-faced monkeys (
  <span class="italic">Cebus capucinus</span>) than control pairs without wasps close by, as the monkeys actively avoided the wasps (Joyce 
  <a rid="b70" ref-type="bibr" href="#b70">1993</a>). When the calls of predatory corvids were played in Siberian jay (
  <span class="italic">Perisoreus infaustus</span>) nesting areas, the jays responded by nesting in safer, but less well insulted, sites (Eggers et al. 
  <a rid="b39" ref-type="bibr" href="#b39">2006</a>). Orange-crowned warblers (
  <span class="italic">Vermivora celata</span>) responded to novel nest predator playbacks by shifting from nesting in trees and shrubs nesting on to the ground (Peluc et al. 
  <a rid="b127" ref-type="bibr" href="#b127">2008</a>). In summary, it appears that local abundance of predators does result in adaptive shifts in nest site selection, with birds' nesting in safer locations when the abundance of predators is high. Such shifts in nest sites are presumably under strong selection pressures as such shifts often entail costs through reduced thermoregulatory benefits in sites with lower levels of predation risk.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The threat of predation has resulted in some animals nesting in association with more aggressive species, whose heightened antipredator defenses also benefit the focal species (see review in Quinn and Ueta 
  <a rid="b137" ref-type="bibr" href="#b137">2008</a>). Illustratively, breeding choughs (
  <span class="italic">Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax</span>) associate with lesser kestrels (
  <span class="italic">Falco naumanni</span>) and benefit through the kestrels being very vigilant for, and aggressive toward, potential nest predators. As the kestrels do not prey upon the choughs, then the association is entirely beneficial for the choughs as they suffer significantly fewer nest predation events and consequently have higher levels of breeding success when compared to conspecifics breeding without an association to the kestrels (Blanco and Tella 
  <a rid="b13" ref-type="bibr" href="#b13">1997</a>). However, not all associations may be so advantageous, and in other instances, the protective species can sometimes also prey upon the protected species (Caro 
  <a rid="b23" ref-type="bibr" href="#b23">2005</a>), which means that there may be an optimal nesting distance between them. Nest predation rates suffered by red-breasted geese (
  <span class="italic">Branta ruficollis</span>) are generally negatively correlated with their distance to more aggressive peregrine falcon (
  <span class="italic">Falco peregrinus</span>) nests. However, the geese are also harassed or attacked by the falcons if they nest too close, meaning that the geese optimally nest at least 40–50 m away from the falcons (Quinn and Kokorev 
  <a rid="b136" ref-type="bibr" href="#b136">2002</a>). Nesting associations are therefore an effective way of reducing the threat of predation upon nests (Quinn and Ueta 
  <a rid="b137" ref-type="bibr" href="#b137">2008</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Density-dependent patterns of nest predation are also expected to affect the spacing of nests, and while there is a general consensus that nest predation rates increase as nest density increases, there are too few empirical studies to confirm this (Caro 
  <a rid="b23" ref-type="bibr" href="#b23">2005</a>). One notable exception comes from a study of mustelids, rodents, and colonially nesting fieldfares (
  <span class="italic">Turdus pilaris</span>). Mustelids favor rodent prey but shift to the contents of fieldfare nests when rodents are scarce. Consequently, mustelid predation on fieldfare nests increases as rodent density decreases, and there was a clear tendency for fieldfare colonies to form during years of low rodent abundance and for nesting to be more dispersed or noncolonial, during high rodent years. Hence, colonially nesting birds provided more effective mobbing defenses against mustelid predators, and it was suggested that the fieldfares track rodent density directly as a surrogate cue of predation risk (Hogstad 
  <a rid="b66" ref-type="bibr" href="#b66">1995</a>). While this study strongly suggests that predation can alter the optimal spacing of nests, this is clearly an area where further research is warranted.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The height of nests from the ground also influences nest predation rates (Martin 
  <a rid="b100" ref-type="bibr" href="#b100">1993</a>; Lima 
  <a rid="b84" ref-type="bibr" href="#b84">2009</a>). In a controlled experiment using artificial nests that represented the nests of open-cup nesting passerine birds, it was shown that higher nests were predated significantly more often than nests placed on the ground. The higher nests were predated by avian predators, meaning that the ground nests were safer despite them being more at risk from a range of mammalian predators (Piper and Catterall 
  <a rid="b131" ref-type="bibr" href="#b131">2004</a>). Elsewhere, lesser kestrels preferentially occupied holes located high up on churches as predation rates were negatively correlated with the height of the nest from the ground (Negro and Hiraldo 
  <a rid="b122" ref-type="bibr" href="#b122">1993</a>). Interestingly, the height of Oahu Elepaio (
  <span class="italic">Chasiempis ibidis</span>) nests on the island of Hawaii were negatively correlated with their risk of predation from introduced black rats (
  <span class="italic">Rattus rattus</span>) and the height of nests increased by more than 50% between 1996 and 2011, which led to a decline in nest predation rates (Vanderwerf 
  <a rid="b174" ref-type="bibr" href="#b174">2012</a>). By contrast, higher long-tailed tit (
  <span class="italic">Aegithalos caudatus</span>) nests were predated more frequently by avian predators, such as jays (
  <span class="italic">Garrulus glandarius</span>) and magpies (
  <span class="italic">Pica pica</span>), than lower nests (Hatchwell et al. 
  <a rid="b61" ref-type="bibr" href="#b61">1999</a>). Consequently, there is good evidence to suggest that birds vary the height at which they build their nests in response to predators as they build their nests higher from the ground in response to mammalian predators and lower in response to avian predators. Further, birds should also adapt following a predation event, and there is evidence that if a parent survives a nest predation event, then they disperse further distances to begin another nesting attempt when compared to a successful nesting attempt (review in Lima 
  <a rid="b84" ref-type="bibr" href="#b84">2009</a>). For example, female goldeneyes (
  <span class="italic">Bucephala clangula</span>) whose nests were predated by pine martens (
  <span class="italic">Martes martes</span>) were twice as likely to nest in new locations the following year, than females whose nests were not predated (Dow and Fredga 
  <a rid="b37" ref-type="bibr" href="#b37">1983</a>). To our knowledge, no studies have examined dispersal distances of focal individuals in relation to the breeding success of neighboring conspecifics, and further studies could usefully examine this issue.
