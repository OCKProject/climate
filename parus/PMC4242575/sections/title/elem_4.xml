 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nest design is strongly influenced by natural selection, yet nests may also be extended phenotypic signals of the builder/s quality and hence also be influenced by sexual selection. Individuals normally signal their quality through physical or behavioral signals such as brightly colored wing patches, elaborate songs, or extravagant ornaments such as crests (Andersson 
  <a rid="b4" ref-type="bibr" href="#b4">1982</a>), yet some species build external structures that signal their phenotypic quality (Schaedelin and Taborsky 
  <a rid="b148" ref-type="bibr" href="#b148">2009</a>). Species such as bowerbirds (Madden 
  <a rid="b92" ref-type="bibr" href="#b92">2003</a>) build structures whose sole purpose is to attract a mate (Schaedelin and Taborsky 
  <a rid="b148" ref-type="bibr" href="#b148">2009</a>). By contrast, nests usually contain eggs and/or offspring, thereby potentially suggesting a direct trade-off between the conflicting requirements of natural and sexual selection (Moreno 
  <a rid="b115" ref-type="bibr" href="#b115">2012</a>). However, for nest construction behaviors and nest design to be extended phenotypic signals that play a role in sexual selection, they must reliably indicate the quality of the builder by being associated with costs (Andersson 
  <a rid="b4" ref-type="bibr" href="#b4">1982</a>; Maynard Smith and Harper 
  <a rid="b101" ref-type="bibr" href="#b101">2003</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nests as extended phenotypic signals</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The process of fetching material to construct nests intuitively appears costly, yet such potential costs have generally been overlooked as they were often assumed to be negligible, particularly when compared to the costs of producing eggs or provisioning offspring (Dolnik 
   <a rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" href="#b36">1991</a>; Hansell 
   <a rid="b56" ref-type="bibr" href="#b56">2005</a>; Heenan 
   <a rid="b62" ref-type="bibr" href="#b62">2013</a>). However, there is a growing awareness that the costs of constructing a nest are far higher than previously imagined and indirect evidence of such costs comes from behaviors suggesting that animals minimize the costs of nest construction. Illustratively, some species exploit the efforts of others by stealing nesting material or completed nests from conspecifics (Moreno et al. 
   <a rid="b117" ref-type="bibr" href="#b117">1995</a>; Lindell 
   <a rid="b85" ref-type="bibr" href="#b85">1996</a>) or heterospecifics (Ewins et al. 
   <a rid="b43" ref-type="bibr" href="#b43">1994</a>; Schulz 
   <a rid="b152" ref-type="bibr" href="#b152">1997</a>), while other species breed in old nests despite incurring costs due to ectoparasitism (Brown and Brown 
   <a rid="b20" ref-type="bibr" href="#b20">1986</a>; Møller 
   <a rid="b112" ref-type="bibr" href="#b112">1990b</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Direct evidence that nest building is a costly process comes from studies that have estimated the costs, with one study showing that cliff swallows (
   <span class="italic">Petrochelidon pyrrhonota</span>) constructing a 600 g nest expend 122 kJ by making an estimated 1400 trips to collect construction materials (Withers 
   <a rid="b186" ref-type="bibr" href="#b186">1977</a>). Meanwhile, observational evidence that nest construction behaviors accurately reflect the quality of the builder/s comes from studies which report a positive correlation between the phenotype of the building parent and the time to completion of nests (Lens et al. 
   <a rid="b80" ref-type="bibr" href="#b80">1994</a>; De Neve and Soler 
   <a rid="b33" ref-type="bibr" href="#b33">2002</a>) and the size of completed nests (Moreno et al. 
   <a rid="b116" ref-type="bibr" href="#b116">1994</a>; Lens et al. 
   <a rid="b80" ref-type="bibr" href="#b80">1994</a>; Fargallo et al. 
   <a rid="b44" ref-type="bibr" href="#b44">2001</a>; Tomás et al. 
   <a rid="b170" ref-type="bibr" href="#b170">2006</a>; Mainwaring et al. 
   <a rid="b97" ref-type="bibr" href="#b97">2008</a>). Elsewhere, a comparative analysis by Soler et al. (
   <a rid="b165" ref-type="bibr" href="#b165">2007</a>) found a positive correlation between nest-building effort and immunity both among European passerine birds and among barn swallows (
   <span class="italic">Hirundo rustica</span>), thereby demonstrating that birds in higher body condition invested more energy in nest building.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Experimental studies have also demonstrated that nest building is costly. For example, male Australian reed warblers (
   <span class="italic">Acrocephalus australis</span>) build multiple nests within their territories, which consist of one “type 1” nest that is structurally capable of holding eggs and nestlings and one or more “type 2” nests that are not structurally capable of holding eggs and nestlings. When experimental males were provided with supplementary food, they built more “type 2” nests within their territories than unfed control males (Berg et al. 
   <a rid="b11" ref-type="bibr" href="#b11">2006</a>). Meanwhile, supplementary fed female blue tits (
   <span class="italic">Cyanistes caeruleus</span>) built heavier nests than unfed control females in one study (Mainwaring and Hartley 
   <a rid="b94" ref-type="bibr" href="#b94">2009</a>) and shallower nests in another study (Smith et al. 
   <a rid="b158" ref-type="bibr" href="#b158">2012</a>), while great tit nest sizes did not differ between treatments (Smith et al. 
   <a rid="b158" ref-type="bibr" href="#b158">2012</a>). Therefore, despite none of these studies demonstrating any advantages of larger nests to the builders, nest-building behaviors appear to be limited by the availability of food. Other studies have further tested the costs of nest construction by directly manipulating nest-building effort, rather than carrying out indirect manipulations of food availability. When the nests and eggs of experimental pairs of pied flycatchers (
   <span class="italic">Ficedula hypoleuca</span>) were removed, thereby forcing them to build a second nest, experimental females built smaller nests than control females (Moreno et al. 
   <a rid="b118" ref-type="bibr" href="#b118">2008</a>). Further, when the costs of nest building were experimentally reduced in pied flycatchers, experimental females spent more time incubating their eggs before provisioning their nestlings at a higher rate than control females. This resulted in nestlings in experimental nests having longer tarsi at prefledging than nestlings in control nests (Moreno et al. 
   <a rid="b120" ref-type="bibr" href="#b120">2010</a>), although the advantages accrued by having longer tarsi are presently unclear (Mainwaring and Hartley 
   <a rid="b95" ref-type="bibr" href="#b95">2012</a>). Meanwhile, Lambrechts et al. (
   <a rid="b79" ref-type="bibr" href="#b79">2012</a>) experimentally removed the nests and eggs of blue tits after about 5 days of incubation and found that experimental females, which were forced to expend effort by building a second nest, built smaller nests and laid smaller clutches than control females.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To summarize, there is now observational, comparative, and experimental evidence that nest construction is a costly process. While these studies have focused disproportionately on birds, presumably because their nest-building visits can be accurately counted and their completed nests can be weighed and measured (Mainwaring and Hartley 
   <a rid="b96" ref-type="bibr" href="#b96">2013</a>), there is no reason to suggest that nest construction is not associated with costs in other taxa (Barber 
   <a rid="b9" ref-type="bibr" href="#b9">2013</a>). There is strong evidence that nest construction is costly (Maynard Smith and Harper 
   <a rid="b101" ref-type="bibr" href="#b101">2003</a>; Schaedelin and Taborsky 
   <a rid="b148" ref-type="bibr" href="#b148">2009</a>), and so nest-building behaviors and nest design have the capacity to act as extended phenotypic signals, which may be influenced by sexual selection (Andersson 
   <a rid="b4" ref-type="bibr" href="#b4">1982</a>; Moreno 
   <a rid="b115" ref-type="bibr" href="#b115">2012</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Male-built nests</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observational studies have shown that male-built nests play a role in sexual selection (Andersson 
   <a rid="b4" ref-type="bibr" href="#b4">1982</a>; Soler et al. 
   <a rid="b161" ref-type="bibr" href="#b161">1998a</a>,
   <a rid="b162" ref-type="bibr" href="#b162">b</a>) as there is often a positive correlation between some aspect of nest size or design and some aspect of the male's phenotype. In penduline tits (
   <span class="italic">Remiz pendulinus</span>), those males that constructed larger nests were more successful in acquiring a female (Hoi et al. 
   <a rid="b67" ref-type="bibr" href="#b67">1994</a>, 
   <a rid="b68" ref-type="bibr" href="#b68">1996</a>). Although male care was not correlated with nest size, females invested more care into broods raised in large nests, meaning that males that built large nests benefited through increased reproductive success (Szentirmai et al. 
   <a rid="b167" ref-type="bibr" href="#b167">2005</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These observational studies have also been supplemented by several experimental studies. Male black wheatears (
   <span class="italic">Oenanthe leucura</span>) carry about 2 kg of stones to their nest sites, and observational studies have shown that males with larger wing areas carry more stones to nesting sites than males with smaller wing areas (Møller et al. 
   <a rid="b114" ref-type="bibr" href="#b114">1995</a>). The wing area of males appears to be a morphological adaptation to carrying such stones as when some of the primary feathers of experimental males were removed, they carried fewer stones to their nests than control males (Møller et al. 
   <a rid="b114" ref-type="bibr" href="#b114">1995</a>). Nest sites contain a mixture of old and new stones, and when old stones were experimentally removed from nests, males did not respond by carrying more stones, implying that females choose males on the number of new stones that they transfer to nesting sites before each breeding attempt (Soler et al. 
   <a rid="b160" ref-type="bibr" href="#b160">1996</a>). Further, when new stones were experimentally added to nest sites during the stone-carrying period, males carried fewer stones to nests, and when stones were experimentally removed, males compensated by carrying more stones to the nesting site (Moreno et al. 
   <a rid="b116" ref-type="bibr" href="#b116">1994</a>; Soler et al. 
   <a rid="b160" ref-type="bibr" href="#b160">1996</a>). In an experiment which manipulated the number of stones at nests, it was found that females which were paired with males that carried more stones responded by laying earlier in the breeding season, which led to experimental pairs having higher reproductive success than control pairs (Moreno et al. 
   <a rid="b116" ref-type="bibr" href="#b116">1994</a>; Møller et al. 
   <a rid="b114" ref-type="bibr" href="#b114">1995</a>; Soler et al. 
   <a rid="b160" ref-type="bibr" href="#b160">1996</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In starlings (
   <span class="italic">Sturnus vulgaris</span>) and spotless starlings (
   <span class="italic">Sturnus unicolor</span>), males build the nest almost entirely alone, while females occasionally add feathers to nests. Both species incorporate green plant material into their nests, and the function of such material is thought to be associated either with sexual selection or with limiting the detrimental effects of ectoparasites. In spotless starlings, the majority of green plant material was carried to nests during the ten days prior to the start of egg laying, and those males that carried more green plant material to nests controlled a larger number of boxes, meaning that they had more female partners (Veiga et al. 
   <a rid="b176" ref-type="bibr" href="#b176">2006</a>). Meanwhile, the experimental removal and addition of green plant material had no effect on ectoparasite abundance or the mass of nestlings in starling nests, although males with experimentally increased amounts of green plant material did attract females more successfully than control males (Brouwer and Komdeur 
   <a rid="b19" ref-type="bibr" href="#b19">2004</a>). When the amount of green plant material was experimentally increased in spotless starling nests to mimic increased male nest-building effort, females responded by carrying more feathers to nests. Such responsive building behaviors were interpreted as functionally related signaling behaviors that played an important role in courtship activities and the signaling of status (Polo and Veiga 
   <a rid="b132" ref-type="bibr" href="#b132">2006</a>). Further, the experimental addition of green plant material in spotless starling nests resulted in females laying larger clutches (López-Rull and Gil 
   <a rid="b89" ref-type="bibr" href="#b89">2009</a>) and the skewing the sex ratio of such broods by increasing the number of sons in those eggs (Polo et al. 
   <a rid="b133" ref-type="bibr" href="#b133">2004</a>). Consequently, these studies show that the function of green plant material within starling and spotless starling nests is to play a role in sexual selection rather than as an antiparasite behavior.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Meanwhile, the females of some species choose males based on the number of nests that they build within their territories (Metz 
   <a rid="b109" ref-type="bibr" href="#b109">1991</a>). In birds, studies have shown that males that build more nests within their territories have greater reproductive success in yellow-shouldered widowbirds (
   <span class="italic">Euplectes macrourus</span>) (Savalli 
   <a rid="b147" ref-type="bibr" href="#b147">1994</a>), red bishops (
   <span class="italic">Euplectes orix</span>) (Friedl and Klump 
   <a rid="b47" ref-type="bibr" href="#b47">2000</a>) and wrens (
   <span class="italic">Troglodytes troglodytes</span>) (Garson 
   <a rid="b50" ref-type="bibr" href="#b50">1980</a>; Evans and Burn 
   <a rid="b42" ref-type="bibr" href="#b42">1996</a>; Evans 
   <a rid="b40" ref-type="bibr" href="#b40">1997a</a>,
   <a rid="b41" ref-type="bibr" href="#b41">b</a>). Despite one study reporting that the experimental addition of nests did not increase the pairing success of male marsh wrens (
   <span class="italic">Cistothorus palustris</span>) (Leonard and Picman 
   <a rid="b81" ref-type="bibr" href="#b81">1987</a>), there is good evidence that males that build multiple nests gain increased reproductive success. More generally, there is strong evidence that male-built nests act as signals to females, who adjust their reproductive investment accordingly (Andersson 
   <a rid="b4" ref-type="bibr" href="#b4">1982</a>; Moreno 
   <a rid="b115" ref-type="bibr" href="#b115">2012</a>).

 <sec class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Female-built nests</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Meanwhile, there is a growing appreciation that female-built nests reflect the phenotype of the building female in a similar way to male-built nests (Moreno et al. 
   <a rid="b118" ref-type="bibr" href="#b118">2008</a>, 
   <a rid="b120" ref-type="bibr" href="#b120">2010</a>; Lambrechts et al. 
   <a rid="b79" ref-type="bibr" href="#b79">2012</a>). However, studies examining the function of female-built nests are less common than studies of male-built nests for two reasons. First, female-built nests are considered to be relatively uncommon when compared to male-built and bi-parentally built nests (Collias and Collias 
   <a rid="b28" ref-type="bibr" href="#b28">1984</a>; Hansell 
   <a rid="b55" ref-type="bibr" href="#b55">2000</a>), and second, the theory of extended phenotypic signals has focused disproportionately on male signals (Andersson 
   <a rid="b4" ref-type="bibr" href="#b4">1982</a>; Moreno 
   <a rid="b115" ref-type="bibr" href="#b115">2012</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observational studies of female-built nests are relatively scarce, but one study showed that female spotless starlings, which placed feathers in their nests within nestboxes whenever they were locally available, did so in a nonrandom manor (Veiga and Polo 
   <a rid="b175" ref-type="bibr" href="#b175">2005</a>). Wood pigeon (
   <span class="italic">Columba palumbus</span>) and spotless starling feathers that show higher ultraviolet and visible reflectance on their reverse side were overwhelmingly placed with this side upwards, jay feathers which have higher reflectance on the obverse side were overwhelmingly placed with this side upwards, while azure-winged magpie (
   <span class="italic">Cyanopica cyana</span>) feathers were placed randomly as both sides have similar reflectance values. This indicates that feathers were placed so that their conspicuousness was maximized and suggests that they play a role in sexual selection (Veiga and Polo 
   <a rid="b175" ref-type="bibr" href="#b175">2005</a>). In blue tits meanwhile, healthier females that were less infected with 
   <span class="italic">Trypanosoma avium</span> built heavier nests than females that had higher infection rates (Tomás et al. 
   <a rid="b170" ref-type="bibr" href="#b170">2006</a>). While it is generally acknowledged that female blue tits build the nest alone, a recent study examined why males sometimes carry feathers into nests. Males that delivered feathers had longer tarsi and fed their offspring more frequently than males that did not deliver feathers, and females responded to the delivery of feathers by reducing their own provisioning rates. Nevertheless, the females still obtained direct fitness benefits as the nestlings fledged in better condition than nestlings in those nests where males did not carry feathers to the nest (Sanz and García-Navas 
   <a rid="b146" ref-type="bibr" href="#b146">2011</a>). When feathers were experimentally added to blue tit nests, thereby mimicking nest building by extra-pair males, social males responded to such uncertainty over their own paternity by reducing the frequency at which they provisioned the offspring and in their nest defense behavior, when compared to control males (García-Navas et al. 
   <a rid="b49" ref-type="bibr" href="#b49">2013</a>). In ecologically similar great tits (
   <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) meanwhile, the phenotypic quality of females did not correlate with nest size or characteristics (Álvarez and Barba 
   <a rid="b2" ref-type="bibr" href="#b2">2008</a>), but nest size and characteristics were positively correlated with reproductive success (Alabrudzińska et al. 
   <a rid="b1" ref-type="bibr" href="#b1">2003</a>; Álvarez and Barba 
   <a rid="b3" ref-type="bibr" href="#b3">2011</a>). This discrepancy may be explained by another study which found that females with relatively high chromatic breast plumage, and not body size 
   <span class="italic">per se</span>, built bigger nests and particularly so when paired to males with relatively high chromatic breast plumage (Broggi and Senar 
   <a rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" href="#b18">2009</a>). Elsewhere, young female tree swallows (
   <span class="italic">Tachycineta bicolor</span>) built nests with fewer feathers and had reduced fledging success when compared to older females (Lombardo 
   <a rid="b86" ref-type="bibr" href="#b86">1994</a>), suggesting that experience may play a part in determining variation in nest design.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Experimental studies of female-built nests are rare, but one study examined how the amount of green plant material placed in blue tit nests influenced male behavior. When the size of nests and the amount of green plant material were experimentally enlarged or reduced, male risk-taking behaviors were found to be significantly lower at those nests reduced in size and significantly higher at nests where green plants were added. Males that exhibited increased risk-taking behaviors at nests with more green plant material resulted those pairs having increased reproductive success, meaning that females that placed more green plant material in their nests accrued fitness benefits via increased male investment (Tomás et al. 
   <a rid="b171" ref-type="bibr" href="#b171">2013</a>). In summary, the evidence to date suggests that female-built nests are extended phenotypic signals, but experimental studies examining these issues are generally lacking, and this is clearly an area where further research is warranted (Tomás et al. 
   <a rid="b171" ref-type="bibr" href="#b171">2013</a>; Moreno 
   <a rid="b115" ref-type="bibr" href="#b115">2012</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bi-parentally built nests</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observational studies examining the function of nest-building behaviors in bi-parentally built nests are relatively uncommon because bi-parentally built nests are relatively uncommon when compared to both male-built and female-built nests (Collias and Collias 
   <a rid="b28" ref-type="bibr" href="#b28">1984</a>). In crested tits (
   <span class="italic">Parus cristatus</span>), only males in good condition contributed to nest building, which shortened the interval between the start of nest building and the onset of laying by about 5 days. This resulted in nestlings fledging about 5 days earlier and as earlier fledged nestlings had enhanced survival prospects, then male nest-building efforts increased offspring fitness (Lens et al. 
   <a rid="b80" ref-type="bibr" href="#b80">1994</a>). Studies of barn swallows have shown that higher quality males with long tails contributed less to nest construction than lower quality males with shorter tails. Female nest-building effort remained constant across males with varying tail lengths, yet females paired with males with longer tails built nests with thinner walls and larger nest cups so that they could lay larger clutches inside them (Soler et al. 
   <a rid="b161" ref-type="bibr" href="#b161">1998a</a>,
   <a rid="b162" ref-type="bibr" href="#b162">b</a>). Interestingly, male tail lengths have increased over temporal timescales as anthropogenic climate change has increased ambient temperatures and has led to a general reduction in male nest-building effort and a subsequent decline in nest size (Møller 
   <a rid="b113" ref-type="bibr" href="#b113">2006</a>). Similarly, female rufous bush robins (
   <span class="italic">Cercotrichas galactotes</span>) responded to greater male effort during the nest-building stage by laying larger clutches (Palamino et al. 
   <a rid="b126" ref-type="bibr" href="#b126">1998</a>). However, extended phenotypic signals may not always be an honest indicator of the builder's quality, and signaling theory suggests that such exaggeration should be punished (Moreno 
   <a rid="b115" ref-type="bibr" href="#b115">2012</a>). Objects placed in black kite (
   <span class="italic">Milvus migrans</span>) nests were found to be an honest indicator of the pair's phenotypic quality by accurately predicting their fighting ability. Black kite pairs settle to breed in territories containing suitable nesting sites, but nonbreeding birds sometimes attempt to violently take over such breeding territories. Nests containing many objects were built by pairs with high fighting capabilities and lower quality birds did not dishonestly signal their phenotypic quality. Such cheating would have easily been possible, but the honesty of this signal was maintained by the threat of individuals being severely hurt in aggressive challenges from intruding birds (Sergio et al. 
   <a rid="b153" ref-type="bibr" href="#b153">2011</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are a few experimental studies which have examined how bi-parental nest-building behaviors are influenced by sexual selection. In chinstrap penguins (
   <span class="italic">Pygoscelis antarctica</span>), both sexes collect stones in order to protect their eggs and chicks against flooding, thereby suggesting that natural selection determines the collection of stones (Moreno et al. 
   <a rid="b117" ref-type="bibr" href="#b117">1995</a>). When nests were experimentally manipulated so that some had half of the stones removed, some had half of the stones removed and snow added, while control nests were left alone, the penguins at nests where stones were removed had increased stone-provisioning rates by 44%, and those nests with stone removal and snow added increased their stone provisioning by 123%, while control nests remained unaltered or unchanged. This indicates that stone carrying is determined by both sexual and natural selection (Fargallo et al. 
   <a rid="b44" ref-type="bibr" href="#b44">2001</a>). Female magpies (
   <span class="italic">Pica pica</span>) adjusted their reproductive effort in relation to the male's nest-building efforts. When the first clutches of experimental pairs were removed, high-quality pairs that originally built large nests were more capable of building a replacement nest, and females were found to lay larger clutches in nests that were built faster, irrespective of nest size (De Neve and Soler 
   <a rid="b33" ref-type="bibr" href="#b33">2002</a>). Moreover, a study which experimentally enlarged magpie nests, thereby mimicking increased male nest-building effort, resulted in females laying larger clutches and beginning incubation later, thereby creating fewer late hatched nestlings which have poor survival prospects (Soler et al. 
   <a rid="b164" ref-type="bibr" href="#b164">2001</a>). Interestingly, great spotted cuckoos (
   <span class="italic">Clamator glandarius</span>) preferentially parasitize those magpies which have built larger nests, as nest size provides a reliable indication of parental quality (Soler et al. 
   <a rid="b159" ref-type="bibr" href="#b159">1995</a>). As a consequence, magpies living in areas with great spotted cuckoos have been found to build smaller nests than magpies living in areas without cuckoos (Soler et al. 
   <a rid="b163" ref-type="bibr" href="#b163">1999</a>). Finally, a study examined the function of feather carrying behaviors in male house sparrows (
   <span class="italic">Passer domesticus</span>). Males call to females when adding feathers to the nest, suggesting that they wish the behavior to be noticed, and when feathers were experimentally removed from nests, males responded by carrying more feathers, although the number of feathers carried to nests varied between males. The volume of feathers delivered by males was positively correlated with clutch size and female provisioning rates. While this suggests that feathers play a role in sexual selection, the feathers were usually added during the incubation and the early nestling period, when the need for insulation was greatest. Consequently, feathers probably play a role in both sexual and natural selection in house sparrows (García-López de Hierro et al. 
   <a rid="b48" ref-type="bibr" href="#b48">2013</a>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, there is clear evidence to suggest that nests are extended phenotypic signals that accurately indicate the phenotypic quality of the building parent/s. This applies to male-built, female-built, and bi-parentally built nests (Moreno 
   <a rid="b115" ref-type="bibr" href="#b115">2012</a>) and is an important development as while species such as bowerbirds build structures that are extended phenotypic signals whose sole purpose is to attract a mate (Schaedelin and Taborsky 
   <a rid="b148" ref-type="bibr" href="#b148">2009</a>), nests contain eggs, and/or offspring, thereby suggesting a direct trade-off between the conflicting requirements of natural and sexual selection (Moreno 
   <a rid="b115" ref-type="bibr" href="#b115">2012</a>). A trade-off between natural and sexual selection is likely to occur because while natural selection selects for small nests, sexual selection selects for big nests. However, our current understanding of this trade-off is relatively poor, and further research is required to further understand how these conflicting requirements are resolved.
