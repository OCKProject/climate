 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prior to constructing a nest, one or both of the parents must decide on the location in which to construct the nest (Collias and Collias 
  <a rid="b28" ref-type="bibr" href="#b28">1984</a>). The selection of a suitable nest site is determined by a combination of five main factors: the availability of food for both parents and offspring, the risk of predation, the presence and behavior of conspecifics, the availability of suitable nest material, and the presence of a suitable ambient climate for raising offspring (Collias and Collias 
  <a rid="b28" ref-type="bibr" href="#b28">1984</a>; Hansell 
  <a rid="b56" ref-type="bibr" href="#b56">2005</a>). Ambient temperatures are usually lower than the optimal temperatures for offspring development, and empirical studies show that nests are located in sites that lose less heat than sites selected at random. Grasshopper sparrows (
  <span class="italic">Ammodramus savannarum</span>) and eastern meadowlarks (
  <span class="italic">Sturnella magna</span>) breeding in grasslands built domed nests that were orientated away from prevailing winds, and the orientation of the nests shifted temporally over the course of the breeding season as the direction of the prevailing winds changed (Long et al. 
  <a rid="b88" ref-type="bibr" href="#b88">2009</a>). Further, orange-tufted sunbirds (
  <span class="italic">Nectarinia osea</span>), horned larks (
  <span class="italic">Eremophila alpestris</span>), lark buntings (
  <span class="italic">Calamospiza melanocorys</span>), and McCown's longspurs (
  <span class="italic">Calcarius mccownii</span>) all selected nest sites that faced away from the prevailing winds, as well as being located away from direct sunshine during the middle part of the day, which prevented the nests from overheating (With and Webb 
  <a rid="b185" ref-type="bibr" href="#b185">1993</a>; Sidis et al. 
  <a rid="b156" ref-type="bibr" href="#b156">1994</a>; Hartman and Oring 
  <a rid="b60" ref-type="bibr" href="#b60">2003</a>). Lesser black-backed gulls (
  <span class="italic">Larus fuscus</span>) which nested adjacent to tall vegetation and were therefore sheltered from cold winds raised chicks that grew faster than chicks raised in more exposed nests which experienced cooler temperatures (Kim and Monaghan 
  <a rid="b73" ref-type="bibr" href="#b73">2005</a>). Further, an observational study of eider ducks (
  <span class="italic">Somateria mollissima</span>) showed that females breeding in sheltered nests experienced milder temperatures and laid larger clutches with higher hatching rates than females nesting in exposed nests at cooler temperatures. Then, when shelters were experimentally added to nests at exposed sites, experimental females had lower rates of mass loss than control females, although hatching success did not differ between the two treatments (D'Alba et al. 
  <a rid="b31" ref-type="bibr" href="#b31">2009</a>). By contrast, in arid environments, animals select sites that are cooler than randomly selected sites. Desert lark (
  <span class="italic">Ammomanes deserti deserti</span>) nests in an arid environment were found to be located adjacent to a bush or stone and to face north which provided shade from the midday sun (Orr 
  <a rid="b125" ref-type="bibr" href="#b125">1970</a>). Consequently, there is a large amount of empirical evidence to show that ground-nesting animals select sites that minimize heat loss in cool environments and prevent overheating in warm environments, thereby creating an optimal microclimate in which to raise offspring. However, those sites that create the optimal microclimate for offspring development may also be conspicuous to predators.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two studies have examined the trade-off that parents face between selecting a site that creates a suitable microclimate for raising offspring and minimizing the risk of predation. Hoopoe larks (
  <span class="italic">Alaemon alaudipes</span>) breeding in a hot desert were found to select sites on gravel away from vegetation during the early part of the breeding season when temperatures were relatively cool. They then increasingly selected sites in shrubs as the season progressed and ambient temperatures increased, and while nest predation rates did not differ between the two sites, nests on the gravel experienced higher temperatures. This indicates that the exposed nest sites were preferred because the incubating adults could protect themselves from approaching predators during the early part of the breeding season, but were forced to move to more sheltered sites as the season progressed and temperatures increased (Tielman et al. 
  <a rid="b168" ref-type="bibr" href="#b168">2008</a>). Piping plovers (
  <span class="italic">Charadrius melodus</span>) preferentially laid their eggs on white pebbles that resembled the color of their eggs more closely than randomly available pebbles. Eggs that closely matched their adjacent pebbles suffered lower levels of predation, yet artificial nests constructed of randomly available pebbles warmed faster and were warmer than plover nest pebbles, with temperatures inside nests being about 2–6°C cooler than surrounding substrates. The nest sites rapidly lost heat when they were not incubated by an adult, which suggests that pebble selection is a trade-off between maximizing heat reflectance to improve egg microclimate and minimizing the conspicuous contrast of eggs and surrounding substrates (Mayner et al. 
  <a rid="b102" ref-type="bibr" href="#b102">2009</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spotted owls (
  <span class="italic">Strix occidentalis</span>) were found to select those nesting holes that provided the most suitable microclimate for incubating parents and developing offspring. This is important for the owls as they live in northern regions of America that are characterized by inclement weather during the nesting season, and the owl pairs which chose sites out of the wind had higher reproductive success than pairs in exposed sites (Rockweit et al. 
  <a rid="b143" ref-type="bibr" href="#b143">2012</a>). The orientation of Gila Woodpecker nests changed temporally throughout the year. In the breeding season, northerly facing holes reduced the levels of water loss from nests in the hot summer months, while warmer south-facing nests reduced energy expenditures during the cold winter months (Inouye et al. 
  <a rid="b69" ref-type="bibr" href="#b69">1981</a>). The thermal properties of spiny-cheeked honeyeater (
  <span class="italic">Acanthagenys rufogularis</span>) and yellow-throated miner (
  <span class="italic">Manorina flavigula</span>) nests were studied across three wind speeds. Nest dimensions differ between the species, despite the adults having similar body masses, although the nest conductance of both species nests is comparable. The study found that the rate of heat loss from nests increased in both species as wind speed increased and as a result of forced convection through the nest, incubating parents would be required to double their heat production to maintain a suitable microclimate within the nest (Heenan and Seymour 
  <a rid="b64" ref-type="bibr" href="#b64">2012</a>). Nestbox-breeding prothonotary warbler (
  <span class="italic">Protonotaria citrea</span>) pairs that nested early in the season, when ambient temperatures were low, preferentially selected those nestboxes which had the highest ambient temperatures. Pairs that nested late in the season when ambient temperatures were warm preferentially selected those nestboxes which had the lowest ambient temperatures (Blem and Blem 
  <a rid="b14" ref-type="bibr" href="#b14">1994</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The importance of nest sites in creating optimal microclimates for offspring development was also supported in an interspecific study (Burton 
  <a rid="b21" ref-type="bibr" href="#b21">2007</a>). A comparative study of seven North American and European bird species found a trend toward nests being north-facing at lower latitudes and eastward- or southward-facing farther north. At southern latitudes, the requirement for shade results in birds selecting northward orientations, at mid-latitudes, predominantly easterly orientations reflect the balance between the benefits of warmth in the early morning and shade in the afternoon, while at northern latitudes, nests are orientated southwards to gain warmth throughout the day (Burton 
  <a rid="b21" ref-type="bibr" href="#b21">2007</a>). Therefore, while it is clear that animals create the optimal microclimate for offspring development by selecting sites that either conserve or lose heat more efficiently than sites selected at random, the microclimates within nests can be further enhanced by the addition of various construction materials (Hansell 
  <a rid="b56" ref-type="bibr" href="#b56">2005</a>).
