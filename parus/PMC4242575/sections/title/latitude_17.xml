 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An interspecific study of passerine birds in Europe demonstrated that those species which breed relatively early and hence, at lower ambient temperatures, were more likely to add feathers as nest lining material to their nests than later breeding species (Møller 
  <a rid="b110" ref-type="bibr" href="#b110">1984</a>). Meanwhile, an intraspecific study showed that citrine wagtails (
  <span class="italic">Motacilla citreola</span>) breeding at the northerly part of their breeding range lined their nests with feathers while their more southerly breeding conspecifics did not (Møller 
  <a rid="b110" ref-type="bibr" href="#b110">1984</a>). Other cup nesting birds also show latitudinal variation in nest composition. An examination of the nest structures of yellow warblers (
  <span class="italic">Dendroica petechia</span>) breeding in northern and southern Canada showed that birds breeding further north built larger, less porous nests that retained heat better but also absorbed more water and then took longer to dry than nests from the south (Briskie 
  <a rid="b16" ref-type="bibr" href="#b16">1995</a>; Rohwer and Law 
  <a rid="b145" ref-type="bibr" href="#b145">2010</a>). Also, American robin (
  <span class="italic">Turdus migratorius</span>), yellow warbler, and 
  <span class="italic">Carduelis</span> finches nests were heavier and had thicker nest walls in northern Canada than in southern Canada (Crossman et al. 
  <a rid="b30" ref-type="bibr" href="#b30">2011</a>). Patterns of nest site selection of northern oriole (
  <span class="italic">Icterus spp</span>) nests also varied with latitude. Nests in the north were built on thinner branches, presumably to make them less accessible to squirrels. Nests in the south are better protected from the sun as they have a smaller opening and more spacious than those further north (Schaeffer 
  <a rid="b149" ref-type="bibr" href="#b149">1976</a>). The nest insulatory properties of northern oriole nests also varied with latitude, being better insulated in the north than in the south (Schaeffer 
  <a rid="b150" ref-type="bibr" href="#b150">1980</a>). Elsewhere, common blackbirds living in cooler environments at higher latitudes within Great Britain built nests with thicker walls and consequently, greater insulatory properties, than conspecifics living in warmer environments at lower latitudes (Mainwaring et al. 
  <a rid="b99" ref-type="bibr" href="#b99">2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among hole nesting birds, the mass of the cup lining material and nest insulatory properties of blue tit and great tit nests decreased with increasing spring temperatures as latitude decreased in Great Britain (Mainwaring et al. 
  <a rid="b98" ref-type="bibr" href="#b98">2012</a>). As spring temperatures increased with decreasing latitude, the mass of the nest base material did not vary in either species, while the mass of the cup lining material and nest insulatory properties decreased in both species. This suggests that in response to increasing temperatures, the breeding female reduces the mass of the cup lining material, thereby maintaining an appropriate microclimate for incubating and brooding (Mainwaring et al. 
  <a rid="b98" ref-type="bibr" href="#b98">2012</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, these results indicate that the decrease in the mass of the nest cup lining material in birds' nests may be counteracting increasing spring temperatures to create an appropriate microclimate for both parents and offspring. There are now several studies that report the fine-scale adjustment of nest cup lining material in response to ambient temperatures in birds (e.g., McGowan et al. 
  <a rid="b103" ref-type="bibr" href="#b103">2004</a>; Mainwaring and Hartley 
  <a rid="b93" ref-type="bibr" href="#b93">2008</a>; Britt and Deeming 
  <a rid="b17" ref-type="bibr" href="#b17">2011</a>), which is important as a recent study has shown that the nest microclimate has important consequences for the body condition of both parents and chicks in tree swallows (Peréz et al. 
  <a rid="b129" ref-type="bibr" href="#b129">2008</a>). Further research is required to investigate how nest construction reflects the thermoregulatory needs of the incubating adult. Moreover, nest lining material has been shown to have sexual (Sanz and García-Navas 
  <a rid="b146" ref-type="bibr" href="#b146">2011</a>) and other nonthermoregulatory (Mennerat et al. 
  <a rid="b107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b107">2009b</a>) functions, and further research could usefully examine the functionality of nest lining. To summarize, there is a reasonable amount of evidence to show that both hole nesting and open-cup nesting species systematically vary the design of their nests in response to large-scale latitudinal variation in ambient temperatures.
