 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The majority of nests are differentiated structures that are constructed from a variety of materials which can generally be classified as being either structural materials or lining materials. While structural materials make up the general shape of the nest and provide structural support for the parents and offspring, lining materials generally create a suitable microclimate in which parents can raise their offspring (Hansell 
  <a rid="b55" ref-type="bibr" href="#b55">2000</a>, 
  <a rid="b56" ref-type="bibr" href="#b56">2005</a>). The exact function of structural materials is not yet fully understood because while an interspecific study of Australian birds that build cup-shaped nests suggested that structural support for the eggs and incubating parents was the primary factor driving nest design (Heenan and Seymour 
  <a rid="b63" ref-type="bibr" href="#b63">2011</a>), other studies have shown that structural materials provide thermoregulatory benefits. Illustratively, the nests of white-crowned sparrows (
  <span class="italic">Zonottrichia leucophrys</span>) block out 96–99% of air currents to which they are exposed (Kern 
  <a rid="b71" ref-type="bibr" href="#b71">1984</a>). Further, the enclosed nests of cactus wrens (
  <span class="italic">Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus</span>) moderate the nest environment under widely varying environmental conditions by both retaining heat during cold weather and by shading the nest contents from direct sunlight during hot weather (Ricklefs and Hainsworth 
  <a rid="b142" ref-type="bibr" href="#b142">1969</a>). Meanwhile, several studies have examined the function of the structural materials in the nests of sociable weavers (
  <span class="italic">Philetairus socius</span>), where nests are huge structures that contain the individual nesting chambers of colonies of birds that sometimes compromise a hundred or more pairs. The enormous nests have been found to ameliorate the impact of low temperatures (White et al. 
  <a rid="b180" ref-type="bibr" href="#b180">1975</a>) and significantly reduce the metabolic expenditure by colony members (Bartholomew et al. 
  <a rid="b10" ref-type="bibr" href="#b10">1976</a>). However, the thermal benefits of individual nests vary in relation to the size of the communal nest and the position of individual nest chambers within it. This has important consequences for the fitness of individuals as higher quality individuals occupy those nests that maintain heat with the most efficiency (Van Dijk et al. 
  <a rid="b173" ref-type="bibr" href="#b173">2013</a>). Therefore, while a comparative study indicates that structural materials provide structural support for the parents and offspring (Heenan and Seymour 
  <a rid="b63" ref-type="bibr" href="#b63">2011</a>), empirical studies also show that structural materials provide thermoregulatory benefits for the parents and offspring (Kern 
  <a rid="b71" ref-type="bibr" href="#b71">1984</a>; Bollazzi and Roces 2010). Consequently, further studies are required to elucidate the function of structural materials in nests. By contrast, there is little doubt that the function of nest lining materials is to provide thermoregulatory benefits to the parents and offspring within the nest cup.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among ground-nesting birds, one interspecific study of six species of Arctic breeding shorebirds showed that smaller species, with greater surface-area-to-volume ratios, created nest scrapes with greater amounts of nest lining material than larger species, thereby demonstrating that smaller species invest more in the insulation of their nests than larger species (Tulp et al. 
  <a rid="b172" ref-type="bibr" href="#b172">2012</a>). Pectoral sandpipers (
  <span class="italic">Calidris melanotos</span>) have been shown to excavate a scrape and use lining material, which reduced the rate at which the nests lost heat by 9% and 25%, respectively. Hence, lined scrapes insulate clutches much more efficiently than unlined scrapes (Reid et al. 
  <a rid="b141" ref-type="bibr" href="#b141">2002</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many birds line their nests with feathers (Calvelo et al. 
  <a rid="b22" ref-type="bibr" href="#b22">2006</a>; Liljeström et al. 
  <a rid="b83" ref-type="bibr" href="#b83">2009</a>), which is advantageous as when the insulation properties of a range of commonly used lining materials were tested in the laboratory, feathers were found to provide the most insulation to nests, while grasses provided the least (Hilton et al. 
  <a rid="b65" ref-type="bibr" href="#b65">2004</a>). The most comprehensive studies of the function of feathers as a nest lining material come from studies of tree swallows. Meanwhile, nestlings in experimental nests with added feathers were structurally larger at prefledging than nestlings in control nests, suggesting that feathers provided thermal benefits that resulted in increased nestling growth (Dawson et al. 
  <a rid="b32" ref-type="bibr" href="#b32">2011</a>). This conclusion was supported in an observational study that demonstrated that nests with more feathers and with deeper nest cups cooled at slower rates than nests with fewer feathers and shallow nest cups (Windsor et al. 
  <a rid="b183" ref-type="bibr" href="#b183">2013</a>). Experimental nests, in which feathers were removed, contained nestlings that were lighter and had shorter tarsi and wing chords than nestlings in control nests. Ectoparasite abundance was unaffected by the removal of feathers, but experimental nests had higher fledging success which indicates that the insulation quality of feathers increases reproductive success (Lombardo et al. 
  <a rid="b87" ref-type="bibr" href="#b87">1995</a>). In another study, nestlings in experimental nests where feathers were removed had lower rates of mass, tarsus, and wing length growth and higher infestations of mites and lice, when compared to nestlings in control nests. Therefore, feathers benefitted nestlings directly by keeping them warm and indirectly by facilitating higher growth rates, but once again, there was no reduction in the nestling's exposure to detrimental ectoparasites (Winkler 
  <a rid="b184" ref-type="bibr" href="#b184">1993</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fitness consequences of varying temperatures within nests have also been examined in tree swallows. In experimentally cooled nests, incubating females reduced the intensity of their incubation behaviors, which resulted in extended incubation times and lighter nestlings with weaker immune systems, when compared to nestlings raised in control nests (Ardia et al. 
  <a rid="b8" ref-type="bibr" href="#b8">2008</a>). Meanwhile, experimentally heated nests resulted in females maintaining a higher body condition than control females, which resulted in them provisioning their nestlings at higher rates and raising heavier nestlings than females in control broods (Peréz et al. 
  <a rid="b129" ref-type="bibr" href="#b129">2008</a>). In multibrooded starlings, those pairs that had their nests heated during the incubation phase of their first brood had higher levels of fledging success in that first brood and higher levels of hatching success in second broods, when compared to control pairs (Reid et al. 
  <a rid="b140" ref-type="bibr" href="#b140">2000</a>). Consequently, there is good evidence to suggest that nest lining materials, such as feathers, serve to create suitable microclimates in which to raise offspring and not to provide protection from ectoparasites. However, environmental conditions are not stable over temporal or spatial timescales, and the design of nests must vary accordingly.
