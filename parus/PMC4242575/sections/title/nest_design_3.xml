 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The design of completed nests also influences the risk of predation (Caro 
  <a rid="b23" ref-type="bibr" href="#b23">2005</a>), and for example, ground-nesting birds must rely on crypsis to conceal their nests from predators. A study of Japanese quail (
  <span class="italic">Coturnix japonica</span>) found that egg patterning and color varied between, but not within, females and individual females consistently selected those laying substrates that matched the patterning and color of their eggs to make the visual detection of their eggs most challenging for predators. This suggests that the quail “knew” their individual egg patterning and color and actively sought out a nest site that provided the most effective camouflage (Lovell et al. 
  <a rid="b90" ref-type="bibr" href="#b90">2013</a>). Some birds cover their eggs in the absence of an incubating parent, and a study of mallard ducks (
  <span class="italic">Anas platyrhynchos</span>) found that when nests were covered with nest material, they suffered significantly lower rates of nest predation than nests which were left experimentally uncovered (Kreisinger and Albrecht 
  <a rid="b75" ref-type="bibr" href="#b75">2008</a>). However, while such behaviors may improve the crypsis functions of nests, there is often an assumption that crypsis is traded off against the requirement to create optimal microclimates within the nests (Lima 
  <a rid="b84" ref-type="bibr" href="#b84">2009</a>). This trade-off was examined in a study of little grebes (
  <span class="italic">Tachybaptus ruficollis</span>) which lay their eggs on floating nests built from wet plant material and cover their eggs with surplus nesting material when no parent is incubating. When nests were experimentally left uncovered, they suffered both lower predation rates and reduced temperatures when compared to control nests that were left covered (Prokop and Trnka 
  <a rid="b135" ref-type="bibr" href="#b135">2011</a>), thereby providing no evidence for such a trade-off. However, further research could usefully examine the potential trade-off between the requirements of crypsis and thermoregulation in animals.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The risk of predation also influences the design of nests that are built above ground. Darwin's small tree finch (
  <span class="italic">Camarhynchus parvuus</span>) females preferred to pair with males that built nests that were well concealed by surrounding vegetation, whereas exposed nests were rarely used for nesting (Kleindorfer 
  <a rid="b74" ref-type="bibr" href="#b74">2007</a>). Elsewhere, larger eastern olivaceous warbler (
  <span class="italic">Hippolais pallida elaeca</span>) nests were predated significantly more often than smaller nests (Antonov 
  <a rid="b5" ref-type="bibr" href="#b5">2004</a>). However, observational studies examining nest sizes and predation rates may be confounded by nest site selection, clutch sizes, and parental activities, and several studies have attempted to disentangle these potential determinants of nest predation. Nest predation rates are extremely high in the tropics, and one study examined whether higher nest predation rates select for smaller nests. When nests of different sizes were experimentally swapped around, nest predation rates increased with nest size, but not with the location of nests, indicating that nest size was the primary determinant of nest predation (Biancucci and Martin 
  <a rid="b12" ref-type="bibr" href="#b12">2010</a>). An experimental study showed that artificially enlarged blackbird (
  <span class="italic">Turdus merula</span>) nests were predated more frequently than nests which remained unchanged in size and nests which were made artificially smaller (Møller 
  <a rid="b111" ref-type="bibr" href="#b111">1990a</a>). Meanwhile, a study which examined the relative contributions of nest size, nest site, parental nest defense behaviors, and clutch size in determining the predation rates upon blackbird nests found that higher nests and nests with greater external diameters were predated more often than expected by chance (Gregoire et al. 
  <a rid="b51" ref-type="bibr" href="#b51">2003</a>). Elsewhere, nest failure in blackbirds was found to be dependent on the nest's detectability, and to a lesser extent, height, but not on parental behaviors, clutch size, or nest site characteristics (Cresswell 
  <a rid="b29" ref-type="bibr" href="#b29">1997</a>). Therefore, it appears that nest predation rates are not solely explained by either their size or location, and further studies are required in order to elucidate their relative contributions to nest predation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, the requirement to minimize the risk of predation strongly influences both nest site selection and the design of completed nests. However, while there is strong evidence that nest predation rates influence nest design over evolutionary timescales, few studies have examined whether nest design varies adaptively within a bird's lifetime (Lima 
  <a rid="b84" ref-type="bibr" href="#b84">2009</a>). This omission has presumably occurred because of the general assumption that nest building is a largely instinctive process (Hansell and Ruxton 
  <a rid="b58" ref-type="bibr" href="#b58">2008</a>; Raby and Clayton 
  <a rid="b138" ref-type="bibr" href="#b138">2009</a>). Consequently, further studies examining changes in nest building in responsive to variable levels of predation risk a bird's lifetime would be valuable.
