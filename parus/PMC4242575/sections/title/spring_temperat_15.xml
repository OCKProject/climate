 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At temperate latitudes, nest design should vary in relation to increasing ambient temperatures as spring advances. A series of observational studies have examined seasonal variation in blue tit and great tit nest characteristics (Mainwaring and Hartley 
  <a rid="b93" ref-type="bibr" href="#b93">2008</a>; Britt and Deeming 
  <a rid="b17" ref-type="bibr" href="#b17">2011</a>; Deeming et al. 
  <a rid="b35" ref-type="bibr" href="#b35">2012</a>). The nest-building period of blue tits was found to decrease seasonally, probably because later pairs needed to build their nests rapidly in order to synchronize the time of maximal nestling food demand with the period of maximal availability of their winter oak moth (
  <span class="italic">Operophtera brumata</span>) caterpillar food supply. Despite this pattern, there was no seasonal trend in the mass of nests, but there were seasonal changes in nest composition. The mass of the nests' moss base showed no seasonal variation, but there was a seasonal decline in the mass of the cup lining material (Mainwaring and Hartley 
  <a rid="b93" ref-type="bibr" href="#b93">2008</a>). A similar study reported that the amount of both animal- and plant-derived materials decreased with increasing spring temperatures as spring progressed in blue tits, but not in great tits (Britt and Deeming 
  <a rid="b17" ref-type="bibr" href="#b17">2011</a>). A further study showed that the mass of nest cup lining materials decreased as spring temperatures increased along a latitudinal gradient in both blue tits and great tits (Deeming et al. 
  <a rid="b35" ref-type="bibr" href="#b35">2012</a>). Together, these studies suggest that female blue tits and great tits are able to gauge environmental conditions and selectively adjust the cup lining component of their nests to reflect increasing ambient temperatures as spring progresses.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Chilean swallows (
  <span class="italic">Tachycineta meyeni</span>), there was a negative association between the number of feathers added to nests and the average daily ambient temperatures, which increased as spring progressed (Liljeström et al. 
  <a rid="b83" ref-type="bibr" href="#b83">2009</a>). The hatching success of the eggs was not associated the number of feathers at the start of laying or at the end of incubation, and there was no association between the number of feathers and the average weight of the nestlings at the prefledging stage. Consequently, the swallows make temporal adjustments to the number of feathers that they add to nests over the course of the breeding season (Liljeström et al. 
  <a rid="b83" ref-type="bibr" href="#b83">2009</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An observational study of long-tailed tits (
  <span class="italic">Aegithalos caudatus</span>) showed that the mass of feathers used as cup lining materials declined through the breeding season, but there was no seasonal decrease in nest insulation quality because of increasing ambient temperatures. Then, in an experimental study where feathers were added to experimental nests at an early stage of the lining phase of nest construction, the total mass of feathers in experimental nests was comparable to that in control nests, and there was no significant difference in the insulation quality of nests. The experimental provisioning of feathers at experimental nests meant that parents at experimental nests collected approximately 50% fewer feathers. This reduction in effort is insightful as there was no significant effect on the duration over which feathers were collected, suggesting that the seasonal decline in feather mass was due to long-tailed tits adjusting feather mass to environmental conditions. This also suggests that feathers were not a limiting resource (McGowan et al. 
  <a rid="b103" ref-type="bibr" href="#b103">2004</a>), which is consistent with a previous study that found that when a range of woodland passerine birds, including long-tailed tits and blue tits, were supplied with feathers, they were barely used as nest material (Hansell and Ruxton 
  <a rid="b57" ref-type="bibr" href="#b57">2002</a>). Therefore, these studies provide good evidence that nest design varies adaptively in relation to predictable temporal increases in ambient temperatures as spring advances, and an experimental study (McGowan et al. 
  <a rid="b103" ref-type="bibr" href="#b103">2004</a>) suggests that these patterns are not a function of the availability of feathers or time constraints).
