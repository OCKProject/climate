 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observational studies examining the function of nest-building behaviors in bi-parentally built nests are relatively uncommon because bi-parentally built nests are relatively uncommon when compared to both male-built and female-built nests (Collias and Collias 
  <a rid="b28" ref-type="bibr" href="#b28">1984</a>). In crested tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus cristatus</span>), only males in good condition contributed to nest building, which shortened the interval between the start of nest building and the onset of laying by about 5 days. This resulted in nestlings fledging about 5 days earlier and as earlier fledged nestlings had enhanced survival prospects, then male nest-building efforts increased offspring fitness (Lens et al. 
  <a rid="b80" ref-type="bibr" href="#b80">1994</a>). Studies of barn swallows have shown that higher quality males with long tails contributed less to nest construction than lower quality males with shorter tails. Female nest-building effort remained constant across males with varying tail lengths, yet females paired with males with longer tails built nests with thinner walls and larger nest cups so that they could lay larger clutches inside them (Soler et al. 
  <a rid="b161" ref-type="bibr" href="#b161">1998a</a>,
  <a rid="b162" ref-type="bibr" href="#b162">b</a>). Interestingly, male tail lengths have increased over temporal timescales as anthropogenic climate change has increased ambient temperatures and has led to a general reduction in male nest-building effort and a subsequent decline in nest size (Møller 
  <a rid="b113" ref-type="bibr" href="#b113">2006</a>). Similarly, female rufous bush robins (
  <span class="italic">Cercotrichas galactotes</span>) responded to greater male effort during the nest-building stage by laying larger clutches (Palamino et al. 
  <a rid="b126" ref-type="bibr" href="#b126">1998</a>). However, extended phenotypic signals may not always be an honest indicator of the builder's quality, and signaling theory suggests that such exaggeration should be punished (Moreno 
  <a rid="b115" ref-type="bibr" href="#b115">2012</a>). Objects placed in black kite (
  <span class="italic">Milvus migrans</span>) nests were found to be an honest indicator of the pair's phenotypic quality by accurately predicting their fighting ability. Black kite pairs settle to breed in territories containing suitable nesting sites, but nonbreeding birds sometimes attempt to violently take over such breeding territories. Nests containing many objects were built by pairs with high fighting capabilities and lower quality birds did not dishonestly signal their phenotypic quality. Such cheating would have easily been possible, but the honesty of this signal was maintained by the threat of individuals being severely hurt in aggressive challenges from intruding birds (Sergio et al. 
  <a rid="b153" ref-type="bibr" href="#b153">2011</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are a few experimental studies which have examined how bi-parental nest-building behaviors are influenced by sexual selection. In chinstrap penguins (
  <span class="italic">Pygoscelis antarctica</span>), both sexes collect stones in order to protect their eggs and chicks against flooding, thereby suggesting that natural selection determines the collection of stones (Moreno et al. 
  <a rid="b117" ref-type="bibr" href="#b117">1995</a>). When nests were experimentally manipulated so that some had half of the stones removed, some had half of the stones removed and snow added, while control nests were left alone, the penguins at nests where stones were removed had increased stone-provisioning rates by 44%, and those nests with stone removal and snow added increased their stone provisioning by 123%, while control nests remained unaltered or unchanged. This indicates that stone carrying is determined by both sexual and natural selection (Fargallo et al. 
  <a rid="b44" ref-type="bibr" href="#b44">2001</a>). Female magpies (
  <span class="italic">Pica pica</span>) adjusted their reproductive effort in relation to the male's nest-building efforts. When the first clutches of experimental pairs were removed, high-quality pairs that originally built large nests were more capable of building a replacement nest, and females were found to lay larger clutches in nests that were built faster, irrespective of nest size (De Neve and Soler 
  <a rid="b33" ref-type="bibr" href="#b33">2002</a>). Moreover, a study which experimentally enlarged magpie nests, thereby mimicking increased male nest-building effort, resulted in females laying larger clutches and beginning incubation later, thereby creating fewer late hatched nestlings which have poor survival prospects (Soler et al. 
  <a rid="b164" ref-type="bibr" href="#b164">2001</a>). Interestingly, great spotted cuckoos (
  <span class="italic">Clamator glandarius</span>) preferentially parasitize those magpies which have built larger nests, as nest size provides a reliable indication of parental quality (Soler et al. 
  <a rid="b159" ref-type="bibr" href="#b159">1995</a>). As a consequence, magpies living in areas with great spotted cuckoos have been found to build smaller nests than magpies living in areas without cuckoos (Soler et al. 
  <a rid="b163" ref-type="bibr" href="#b163">1999</a>). Finally, a study examined the function of feather carrying behaviors in male house sparrows (
  <span class="italic">Passer domesticus</span>). Males call to females when adding feathers to the nest, suggesting that they wish the behavior to be noticed, and when feathers were experimentally removed from nests, males responded by carrying more feathers, although the number of feathers carried to nests varied between males. The volume of feathers delivered by males was positively correlated with clutch size and female provisioning rates. While this suggests that feathers play a role in sexual selection, the feathers were usually added during the incubation and the early nestling period, when the need for insulation was greatest. Consequently, feathers probably play a role in both sexual and natural selection in house sparrows (García-López de Hierro et al. 
  <a rid="b48" ref-type="bibr" href="#b48">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, there is clear evidence to suggest that nests are extended phenotypic signals that accurately indicate the phenotypic quality of the building parent/s. This applies to male-built, female-built, and bi-parentally built nests (Moreno 
  <a rid="b115" ref-type="bibr" href="#b115">2012</a>) and is an important development as while species such as bowerbirds build structures that are extended phenotypic signals whose sole purpose is to attract a mate (Schaedelin and Taborsky 
  <a rid="b148" ref-type="bibr" href="#b148">2009</a>), nests contain eggs, and/or offspring, thereby suggesting a direct trade-off between the conflicting requirements of natural and sexual selection (Moreno 
  <a rid="b115" ref-type="bibr" href="#b115">2012</a>). A trade-off between natural and sexual selection is likely to occur because while natural selection selects for small nests, sexual selection selects for big nests. However, our current understanding of this trade-off is relatively poor, and further research is required to further understand how these conflicting requirements are resolved.
