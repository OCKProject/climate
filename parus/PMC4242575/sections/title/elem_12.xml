 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The primary function of nests is to provide a suitable location for parents to lay their eggs and/or raise their offspring. The design of completed nests is known to influence the microclimate within the nest cup, thereby affecting the conditions experienced by both parents and offspring (Skowron and Kern 
  <a rid="b157" ref-type="bibr" href="#b157">1980</a>; Webb 
  <a rid="b179" ref-type="bibr" href="#b179">1987</a>; Ar and Sidis 
  <a rid="b6" ref-type="bibr" href="#b6">2002</a>; Dawson et al. 
  <a rid="b32" ref-type="bibr" href="#b32">2011</a>; Lambrechts et al. 
  <a rid="b79" ref-type="bibr" href="#b79">2012</a>; Ardia 
  <a rid="b7" ref-type="bibr" href="#b7">2013</a>). Nest microclimates that are suboptimal have negative impacts upon the growth and development of offspring (Lombardo et al. 
  <a rid="b87" ref-type="bibr" href="#b87">1995</a>). While parental behaviors, such as increased bouts of brooding, may help to regulate conditions within the nest so that they are within acceptable limits, such behaviors are likely to be energetically costly for parents (Reid et al. 
  <a rid="b140" ref-type="bibr" href="#b140">2000</a>; Deeming 
  <a rid="b34" ref-type="bibr" href="#b34">2011</a>). One way in which parents can mitigate this energetic demand is to alter the design of their nests to adjust to environmental conditions (Collias and Collias 
  <a rid="b28" ref-type="bibr" href="#b28">1984</a>; Webb 
  <a rid="b179" ref-type="bibr" href="#b179">1987</a>; Hansell

  <a rid="b34" ref-type="bibr" href="#b34">2011</a>). Nevertheless, the construction of thermally optimal nests must be traded off against the associated energetic costs of nest construction (Skowron and Kern 
  <a rid="b157" ref-type="bibr" href="#b157">1980</a>; Mainwaring and Hartley 
  <a rid="b96" ref-type="bibr" href="#b96">2013</a>), and so variation in nest site selection and nest construction materials may result if parents adjust their nests to suit prevailing conditions (Webb 
  <a rid="b179" ref-type="bibr" href="#b179">1987</a>; Ar and Sidis 
  <a rid="b6" ref-type="bibr" href="#b6">2002</a>; Shimmin et al.

  <a rid="b103" ref-type="bibr" href="#b103">2004</a>). Consequently, the design of nests should vary adaptively in relation to predictable changes in environmental conditions with increasing spring temperatures, altitude, and latitude.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nest site selection</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prior to constructing a nest, one or both of the parents must decide on the location in which to construct the nest (Collias and Collias 
   <a rid="b28" ref-type="bibr" href="#b28">1984</a>). The selection of a suitable nest site is determined by a combination of five main factors: the availability of food for both parents and offspring, the risk of predation, the presence and behavior of conspecifics, the availability of suitable nest material, and the presence of a suitable ambient climate for raising offspring (Collias and Collias 
   <a rid="b28" ref-type="bibr" href="#b28">1984</a>; Hansell 
   <a rid="b56" ref-type="bibr" href="#b56">2005</a>). Ambient temperatures are usually lower than the optimal temperatures for offspring development, and empirical studies show that nests are located in sites that lose less heat than sites selected at random. Grasshopper sparrows (
   <span class="italic">Ammodramus savannarum</span>) and eastern meadowlarks (
   <span class="italic">Sturnella magna</span>) breeding in grasslands built domed nests that were orientated away from prevailing winds, and the orientation of the nests shifted temporally over the course of the breeding season as the direction of the prevailing winds changed (Long et al. 
   <a rid="b88" ref-type="bibr" href="#b88">2009</a>). Further, orange-tufted sunbirds (
   <span class="italic">Nectarinia osea</span>), horned larks (
   <span class="italic">Eremophila alpestris</span>), lark buntings (
   <span class="italic">Calamospiza melanocorys</span>), and McCown's longspurs (
   <span class="italic">Calcarius mccownii</span>) all selected nest sites that faced away from the prevailing winds, as well as being located away from direct sunshine during the middle part of the day, which prevented the nests from overheating (With and Webb 
   <a rid="b185" ref-type="bibr" href="#b185">1993</a>; Sidis et al. 
   <a rid="b156" ref-type="bibr" href="#b156">1994</a>; Hartman and Oring 
   <a rid="b60" ref-type="bibr" href="#b60">2003</a>). Lesser black-backed gulls (
   <span class="italic">Larus fuscus</span>) which nested adjacent to tall vegetation and were therefore sheltered from cold winds raised chicks that grew faster than chicks raised in more exposed nests which experienced cooler temperatures (Kim and Monaghan 
   <a rid="b73" ref-type="bibr" href="#b73">2005</a>). Further, an observational study of eider ducks (
   <span class="italic">Somateria mollissima</span>) showed that females breeding in sheltered nests experienced milder temperatures and laid larger clutches with higher hatching rates than females nesting in exposed nests at cooler temperatures. Then, when shelters were experimentally added to nests at exposed sites, experimental females had lower rates of mass loss than control females, although hatching success did not differ between the two treatments (D'Alba et al. 
   <a rid="b31" ref-type="bibr" href="#b31">2009</a>). By contrast, in arid environments, animals select sites that are cooler than randomly selected sites. Desert lark (
   <span class="italic">Ammomanes deserti deserti</span>) nests in an arid environment were found to be located adjacent to a bush or stone and to face north which provided shade from the midday sun (Orr 
   <a rid="b125" ref-type="bibr" href="#b125">1970</a>). Consequently, there is a large amount of empirical evidence to show that ground-nesting animals select sites that minimize heat loss in cool environments and prevent overheating in warm environments, thereby creating an optimal microclimate in which to raise offspring. However, those sites that create the optimal microclimate for offspring development may also be conspicuous to predators.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two studies have examined the trade-off that parents face between selecting a site that creates a suitable microclimate for raising offspring and minimizing the risk of predation. Hoopoe larks (
   <span class="italic">Alaemon alaudipes</span>) breeding in a hot desert were found to select sites on gravel away from vegetation during the early part of the breeding season when temperatures were relatively cool. They then increasingly selected sites in shrubs as the season progressed and ambient temperatures increased, and while nest predation rates did not differ between the two sites, nests on the gravel experienced higher temperatures. This indicates that the exposed nest sites were preferred because the incubating adults could protect themselves from approaching predators during the early part of the breeding season, but were forced to move to more sheltered sites as the season progressed and temperatures increased (Tielman et al. 
   <a rid="b168" ref-type="bibr" href="#b168">2008</a>). Piping plovers (
   <span class="italic">Charadrius melodus</span>) preferentially laid their eggs on white pebbles that resembled the color of their eggs more closely than randomly available pebbles. Eggs that closely matched their adjacent pebbles suffered lower levels of predation, yet artificial nests constructed of randomly available pebbles warmed faster and were warmer than plover nest pebbles, with temperatures inside nests being about 2–6°C cooler than surrounding substrates. The nest sites rapidly lost heat when they were not incubated by an adult, which suggests that pebble selection is a trade-off between maximizing heat reflectance to improve egg microclimate and minimizing the conspicuous contrast of eggs and surrounding substrates (Mayner et al. 
   <a rid="b102" ref-type="bibr" href="#b102">2009</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spotted owls (
   <span class="italic">Strix occidentalis</span>) were found to select those nesting holes that provided the most suitable microclimate for incubating parents and developing offspring. This is important for the owls as they live in northern regions of America that are characterized by inclement weather during the nesting season, and the owl pairs which chose sites out of the wind had higher reproductive success than pairs in exposed sites (Rockweit et al. 
   <a rid="b143" ref-type="bibr" href="#b143">2012</a>). The orientation of Gila Woodpecker nests changed temporally throughout the year. In the breeding season, northerly facing holes reduced the levels of water loss from nests in the hot summer months, while warmer south-facing nests reduced energy expenditures during the cold winter months (Inouye et al. 
   <a rid="b69" ref-type="bibr" href="#b69">1981</a>). The thermal properties of spiny-cheeked honeyeater (
   <span class="italic">Acanthagenys rufogularis</span>) and yellow-throated miner (
   <span class="italic">Manorina flavigula</span>) nests were studied across three wind speeds. Nest dimensions differ between the species, despite the adults having similar body masses, although the nest conductance of both species nests is comparable. The study found that the rate of heat loss from nests increased in both species as wind speed increased and as a result of forced convection through the nest, incubating parents would be required to double their heat production to maintain a suitable microclimate within the nest (Heenan and Seymour 
   <a rid="b64" ref-type="bibr" href="#b64">2012</a>). Nestbox-breeding prothonotary warbler (
   <span class="italic">Protonotaria citrea</span>) pairs that nested early in the season, when ambient temperatures were low, preferentially selected those nestboxes which had the highest ambient temperatures. Pairs that nested late in the season when ambient temperatures were warm preferentially selected those nestboxes which had the lowest ambient temperatures (Blem and Blem 
   <a rid="b14" ref-type="bibr" href="#b14">1994</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The importance of nest sites in creating optimal microclimates for offspring development was also supported in an interspecific study (Burton 
   <a rid="b21" ref-type="bibr" href="#b21">2007</a>). A comparative study of seven North American and European bird species found a trend toward nests being north-facing at lower latitudes and eastward- or southward-facing farther north. At southern latitudes, the requirement for shade results in birds selecting northward orientations, at mid-latitudes, predominantly easterly orientations reflect the balance between the benefits of warmth in the early morning and shade in the afternoon, while at northern latitudes, nests are orientated southwards to gain warmth throughout the day (Burton 
   <a rid="b21" ref-type="bibr" href="#b21">2007</a>). Therefore, while it is clear that animals create the optimal microclimate for offspring development by selecting sites that either conserve or lose heat more efficiently than sites selected at random, the microclimates within nests can be further enhanced by the addition of various construction materials (Hansell 
   <a rid="b56" ref-type="bibr" href="#b56">2005</a>).

 <sec class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nest construction materials</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The majority of nests are differentiated structures that are constructed from a variety of materials which can generally be classified as being either structural materials or lining materials. While structural materials make up the general shape of the nest and provide structural support for the parents and offspring, lining materials generally create a suitable microclimate in which parents can raise their offspring (Hansell 
   <a rid="b55" ref-type="bibr" href="#b55">2000</a>, 
   <a rid="b56" ref-type="bibr" href="#b56">2005</a>). The exact function of structural materials is not yet fully understood because while an interspecific study of Australian birds that build cup-shaped nests suggested that structural support for the eggs and incubating parents was the primary factor driving nest design (Heenan and Seymour 
   <a rid="b63" ref-type="bibr" href="#b63">2011</a>), other studies have shown that structural materials provide thermoregulatory benefits. Illustratively, the nests of white-crowned sparrows (
   <span class="italic">Zonottrichia leucophrys</span>) block out 96–99% of air currents to which they are exposed (Kern 
   <a rid="b71" ref-type="bibr" href="#b71">1984</a>). Further, the enclosed nests of cactus wrens (
   <span class="italic">Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus</span>) moderate the nest environment under widely varying environmental conditions by both retaining heat during cold weather and by shading the nest contents from direct sunlight during hot weather (Ricklefs and Hainsworth 
   <a rid="b142" ref-type="bibr" href="#b142">1969</a>). Meanwhile, several studies have examined the function of the structural materials in the nests of sociable weavers (
   <span class="italic">Philetairus socius</span>), where nests are huge structures that contain the individual nesting chambers of colonies of birds that sometimes compromise a hundred or more pairs. The enormous nests have been found to ameliorate the impact of low temperatures (White et al. 
   <a rid="b180" ref-type="bibr" href="#b180">1975</a>) and significantly reduce the metabolic expenditure by colony members (Bartholomew et al. 
   <a rid="b10" ref-type="bibr" href="#b10">1976</a>). However, the thermal benefits of individual nests vary in relation to the size of the communal nest and the position of individual nest chambers within it. This has important consequences for the fitness of individuals as higher quality individuals occupy those nests that maintain heat with the most efficiency (Van Dijk et al. 
   <a rid="b173" ref-type="bibr" href="#b173">2013</a>). Therefore, while a comparative study indicates that structural materials provide structural support for the parents and offspring (Heenan and Seymour 
   <a rid="b63" ref-type="bibr" href="#b63">2011</a>), empirical studies also show that structural materials provide thermoregulatory benefits for the parents and offspring (Kern 
   <a rid="b71" ref-type="bibr" href="#b71">1984</a>; Bollazzi and Roces 2010). Consequently, further studies are required to elucidate the function of structural materials in nests. By contrast, there is little doubt that the function of nest lining materials is to provide thermoregulatory benefits to the parents and offspring within the nest cup.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among ground-nesting birds, one interspecific study of six species of Arctic breeding shorebirds showed that smaller species, with greater surface-area-to-volume ratios, created nest scrapes with greater amounts of nest lining material than larger species, thereby demonstrating that smaller species invest more in the insulation of their nests than larger species (Tulp et al. 
   <a rid="b172" ref-type="bibr" href="#b172">2012</a>). Pectoral sandpipers (
   <span class="italic">Calidris melanotos</span>) have been shown to excavate a scrape and use lining material, which reduced the rate at which the nests lost heat by 9% and 25%, respectively. Hence, lined scrapes insulate clutches much more efficiently than unlined scrapes (Reid et al. 
   <a rid="b141" ref-type="bibr" href="#b141">2002</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many birds line their nests with feathers (Calvelo et al. 
   <a rid="b22" ref-type="bibr" href="#b22">2006</a>; Liljeström et al. 
   <a rid="b83" ref-type="bibr" href="#b83">2009</a>), which is advantageous as when the insulation properties of a range of commonly used lining materials were tested in the laboratory, feathers were found to provide the most insulation to nests, while grasses provided the least (Hilton et al. 
   <a rid="b65" ref-type="bibr" href="#b65">2004</a>). The most comprehensive studies of the function of feathers as a nest lining material come from studies of tree swallows. Meanwhile, nestlings in experimental nests with added feathers were structurally larger at prefledging than nestlings in control nests, suggesting that feathers provided thermal benefits that resulted in increased nestling growth (Dawson et al. 
   <a rid="b32" ref-type="bibr" href="#b32">2011</a>). This conclusion was supported in an observational study that demonstrated that nests with more feathers and with deeper nest cups cooled at slower rates than nests with fewer feathers and shallow nest cups (Windsor et al. 
   <a rid="b183" ref-type="bibr" href="#b183">2013</a>). Experimental nests, in which feathers were removed, contained nestlings that were lighter and had shorter tarsi and wing chords than nestlings in control nests. Ectoparasite abundance was unaffected by the removal of feathers, but experimental nests had higher fledging success which indicates that the insulation quality of feathers increases reproductive success (Lombardo et al. 
   <a rid="b87" ref-type="bibr" href="#b87">1995</a>). In another study, nestlings in experimental nests where feathers were removed had lower rates of mass, tarsus, and wing length growth and higher infestations of mites and lice, when compared to nestlings in control nests. Therefore, feathers benefitted nestlings directly by keeping them warm and indirectly by facilitating higher growth rates, but once again, there was no reduction in the nestling's exposure to detrimental ectoparasites (Winkler 
   <a rid="b184" ref-type="bibr" href="#b184">1993</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fitness consequences of varying temperatures within nests have also been examined in tree swallows. In experimentally cooled nests, incubating females reduced the intensity of their incubation behaviors, which resulted in extended incubation times and lighter nestlings with weaker immune systems, when compared to nestlings raised in control nests (Ardia et al. 
   <a rid="b8" ref-type="bibr" href="#b8">2008</a>). Meanwhile, experimentally heated nests resulted in females maintaining a higher body condition than control females, which resulted in them provisioning their nestlings at higher rates and raising heavier nestlings than females in control broods (Peréz et al. 
   <a rid="b129" ref-type="bibr" href="#b129">2008</a>). In multibrooded starlings, those pairs that had their nests heated during the incubation phase of their first brood had higher levels of fledging success in that first brood and higher levels of hatching success in second broods, when compared to control pairs (Reid et al. 
   <a rid="b140" ref-type="bibr" href="#b140">2000</a>). Consequently, there is good evidence to suggest that nest lining materials, such as feathers, serve to create suitable microclimates in which to raise offspring and not to provide protection from ectoparasites. However, environmental conditions are not stable over temporal or spatial timescales, and the design of nests must vary accordingly.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spring temperatures</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At temperate latitudes, nest design should vary in relation to increasing ambient temperatures as spring advances. A series of observational studies have examined seasonal variation in blue tit and great tit nest characteristics (Mainwaring and Hartley 
   <a rid="b93" ref-type="bibr" href="#b93">2008</a>; Britt and Deeming 
   <a rid="b17" ref-type="bibr" href="#b17">2011</a>; Deeming et al. 
   <a rid="b35" ref-type="bibr" href="#b35">2012</a>). The nest-building period of blue tits was found to decrease seasonally, probably because later pairs needed to build their nests rapidly in order to synchronize the time of maximal nestling food demand with the period of maximal availability of their winter oak moth (
   <span class="italic">Operophtera brumata</span>) caterpillar food supply. Despite this pattern, there was no seasonal trend in the mass of nests, but there were seasonal changes in nest composition. The mass of the nests' moss base showed no seasonal variation, but there was a seasonal decline in the mass of the cup lining material (Mainwaring and Hartley 
   <a rid="b93" ref-type="bibr" href="#b93">2008</a>). A similar study reported that the amount of both animal- and plant-derived materials decreased with increasing spring temperatures as spring progressed in blue tits, but not in great tits (Britt and Deeming 
   <a rid="b17" ref-type="bibr" href="#b17">2011</a>). A further study showed that the mass of nest cup lining materials decreased as spring temperatures increased along a latitudinal gradient in both blue tits and great tits (Deeming et al. 
   <a rid="b35" ref-type="bibr" href="#b35">2012</a>). Together, these studies suggest that female blue tits and great tits are able to gauge environmental conditions and selectively adjust the cup lining component of their nests to reflect increasing ambient temperatures as spring progresses.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Chilean swallows (
   <span class="italic">Tachycineta meyeni</span>), there was a negative association between the number of feathers added to nests and the average daily ambient temperatures, which increased as spring progressed (Liljeström et al. 
   <a rid="b83" ref-type="bibr" href="#b83">2009</a>). The hatching success of the eggs was not associated the number of feathers at the start of laying or at the end of incubation, and there was no association between the number of feathers and the average weight of the nestlings at the prefledging stage. Consequently, the swallows make temporal adjustments to the number of feathers that they add to nests over the course of the breeding season (Liljeström et al. 
   <a rid="b83" ref-type="bibr" href="#b83">2009</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An observational study of long-tailed tits (
   <span class="italic">Aegithalos caudatus</span>) showed that the mass of feathers used as cup lining materials declined through the breeding season, but there was no seasonal decrease in nest insulation quality because of increasing ambient temperatures. Then, in an experimental study where feathers were added to experimental nests at an early stage of the lining phase of nest construction, the total mass of feathers in experimental nests was comparable to that in control nests, and there was no significant difference in the insulation quality of nests. The experimental provisioning of feathers at experimental nests meant that parents at experimental nests collected approximately 50% fewer feathers. This reduction in effort is insightful as there was no significant effect on the duration over which feathers were collected, suggesting that the seasonal decline in feather mass was due to long-tailed tits adjusting feather mass to environmental conditions. This also suggests that feathers were not a limiting resource (McGowan et al. 
   <a rid="b103" ref-type="bibr" href="#b103">2004</a>), which is consistent with a previous study that found that when a range of woodland passerine birds, including long-tailed tits and blue tits, were supplied with feathers, they were barely used as nest material (Hansell and Ruxton 
   <a rid="b57" ref-type="bibr" href="#b57">2002</a>). Therefore, these studies provide good evidence that nest design varies adaptively in relation to predictable temporal increases in ambient temperatures as spring advances, and an experimental study (McGowan et al. 
   <a rid="b103" ref-type="bibr" href="#b103">2004</a>) suggests that these patterns are not a function of the availability of feathers or time constraints).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Altitude</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One study has examined nest site selection and nest design in relation to decreasing ambient temperatures as altitude increases. On Hawaii, the nests of Common Amakihi (
   <span class="italic">Hemignathus virens virens</span>), which are small finches in the Hawaiian honeycreeper subfamily (Whittow and Berger 
   <a rid="b181" ref-type="bibr" href="#b181">1977</a>), were compared at two sites at different altitudes (Kern and van Riper 
   <a rid="b72" ref-type="bibr" href="#b72">1984</a>). Common Amakihi's breed during the wet season and so irrespective of altitude, all nests were located within tree canopies so that they were protected from the rain. However, nests at higher altitudes were more likely to be placed higher in the canopies and closer to the edge of trees than nests at lower altitudes, so that they would be warmed by radiant solar energy. Common Amakihi's breeding at higher altitudes also built nests with denser, but not thicker, walls that also contained more cup lining material. This resulted in them having higher insulation capacity, but being less porous and slower drying, than nests built by conspecifics at lower altitudes (Kern and van Riper 
   <a rid="b72" ref-type="bibr" href="#b72">1984</a>). This study provides good evidence that birds vary the design and structure of their nests in relation to decreasing ambient temperatures as altitude increases, but further studies are required to assess the generality of this trend.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Therefore, given that nest design varies adaptively in relation to predictable changes in temperature at small spatial scales, such as those found within a study area, then nest design should also be expected to vary adaptively over large spatial scales, such as with decreasing ambient temperatures as latitude increases.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Latitude</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An interspecific study of passerine birds in Europe demonstrated that those species which breed relatively early and hence, at lower ambient temperatures, were more likely to add feathers as nest lining material to their nests than later breeding species (Møller 
   <a rid="b110" ref-type="bibr" href="#b110">1984</a>). Meanwhile, an intraspecific study showed that citrine wagtails (
   <span class="italic">Motacilla citreola</span>) breeding at the northerly part of their breeding range lined their nests with feathers while their more southerly breeding conspecifics did not (Møller 
   <a rid="b110" ref-type="bibr" href="#b110">1984</a>). Other cup nesting birds also show latitudinal variation in nest composition. An examination of the nest structures of yellow warblers (
   <span class="italic">Dendroica petechia</span>) breeding in northern and southern Canada showed that birds breeding further north built larger, less porous nests that retained heat better but also absorbed more water and then took longer to dry than nests from the south (Briskie 
   <a rid="b16" ref-type="bibr" href="#b16">1995</a>; Rohwer and Law 
   <a rid="b145" ref-type="bibr" href="#b145">2010</a>). Also, American robin (
   <span class="italic">Turdus migratorius</span>), yellow warbler, and 
   <span class="italic">Carduelis</span> finches nests were heavier and had thicker nest walls in northern Canada than in southern Canada (Crossman et al. 
   <a rid="b30" ref-type="bibr" href="#b30">2011</a>). Patterns of nest site selection of northern oriole (
   <span class="italic">Icterus spp</span>) nests also varied with latitude. Nests in the north were built on thinner branches, presumably to make them less accessible to squirrels. Nests in the south are better protected from the sun as they have a smaller opening and more spacious than those further north (Schaeffer 
   <a rid="b149" ref-type="bibr" href="#b149">1976</a>). The nest insulatory properties of northern oriole nests also varied with latitude, being better insulated in the north than in the south (Schaeffer 
   <a rid="b150" ref-type="bibr" href="#b150">1980</a>). Elsewhere, common blackbirds living in cooler environments at higher latitudes within Great Britain built nests with thicker walls and consequently, greater insulatory properties, than conspecifics living in warmer environments at lower latitudes (Mainwaring et al. 
   <a rid="b99" ref-type="bibr" href="#b99">2014</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among hole nesting birds, the mass of the cup lining material and nest insulatory properties of blue tit and great tit nests decreased with increasing spring temperatures as latitude decreased in Great Britain (Mainwaring et al.

As spring temperatures increased with decreasing latitude, the mass of the nest base material did not vary in either species, while the mass of the cup lining material and nest insulatory properties decreased in both species. This suggests that in response to increasing temperatures, the breeding female reduces the mass of the cup lining material, thereby maintaining an appropriate microclimate for incubating and brooding (Mainwaring et al. 
   <a rid="b98" ref-type="bibr" href="#b98">2012</a>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, these results indicate that the decrease in the mass of the nest cup lining material in birds' nests may be counteracting increasing spring temperatures to create an appropriate microclimate for both parents and offspring. There are now several studies that report the fine-scale adjustment of nest cup lining material in response to ambient temperatures in birds (e.g., McGowan et al. 
   <a rid="b103" ref-type="bibr" href="#b103">2004</a>; Mainwaring and Hartley 
   <a rid="b93" ref-type="bibr" href="#b93">2008</a>; Britt and Deeming 
   <a rid="b17" ref-type="bibr" href="#b17">2011</a>), which is important as a recent study has shown that the nest microclimate has important consequences for the body condition of both parents and chicks in tree swallows (Peréz et al. 
   <a rid="b129" ref-type="bibr" href="#b129">2008</a>). Further research is required to investigate how nest construction reflects the thermoregulatory needs of the incubating adult. Moreover, nest lining material has been shown to have sexual (Sanz and García-Navas 
   <a rid="b146" ref-type="bibr" href="#b146">2011</a>) and other nonthermoregulatory (Mennerat et al. 
   <a rid="b107" ref-type="bibr" href="#b107">2009b</a>) functions, and further research could usefully examine the functionality of nest lining. To summarize, there is a reasonable amount of evidence to show that both hole nesting and open-cup nesting species systematically vary the design of their nests in response to large-scale latitudinal variation in ambient temperatures.
