  <p>Schematic illustration of phenological ‘mismatch’ taking great tits and their caterpillar food supply as example. The curves indicate frequency distributions of first eggs of clutches (blue), hatching (red) and caterpillar abundance (green). Food demands of great tit chicks are highest approximately 9 days after hatching indicated by the black arrow. In the upper panel describing a scenario before climate change, the birds' breeding is well-timed to the caterpillars, and chick demand coincides with caterpillar abundance. In the lower panel, the timing of both the great tits and the caterpillars has advanced – due to climate change – but the caterpillars have advanced twice as fast. This now has led to a ‘mismatch’ between the chick demands and the phenology of the caterpillars.</p>
