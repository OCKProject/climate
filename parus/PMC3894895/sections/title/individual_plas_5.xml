 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">‘Labile’ traits can be recorded several times in the same individual which allows the analyses of individual plasticity by modelling within-individual changes in response to the environment. Phenological traits, such as the seasonal timing of breeding or migration, are ‘labile’ traits when individuals breed or migrate in more than 1 year. Since recording individual data is comparably easy in birds, many studies analysed within-individual responses of avian breeding time (e.g. Nussey et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b81" href="#b81">2005</a>; Reed et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b98" href="#b98">2006</a>; Porlier et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b87" href="#b87">2012</a>) and migration time (Pulido 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b93" href="#b93">2007a</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b94" href="#b94">b</a>; Knudsen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b57" href="#b57">2011</a>), mainly in response to ambient temperature. A note of caution here is that although it seems straightforward to record timing of events, potential biases exist. For instance, many avian monitoring studies cannot identify a pair's identity before the parent's capture at the chick stage. Hence if the probability of failure in early stages of clutch initiation is high for early breeders, they will be observed as late rather than early breeders. The consequences of such biases on our estimation of plasticity, heritability and selection for phenological traits have never been explored.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The simplest form of a reaction norm is described by a linear regression of the response phenotype on the environmental variable known or thought to affect the analysed trait. Studies of individual plasticity commonly use this type of linear relationships implemented in mixed models (with individual identity as random effect). Individual variation in phenotypic reaction norms can be modelled by fitting the interaction between the environmental variable and the random effect individual identity (Henderson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" href="#b47">1982</a>; Pigliucci 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b85" href="#b85">2001</a>; Nussey et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b82" href="#b82">2007</a>). These models allow for estimation of individual variation in each of the two parameters describing reaction norms, the elevation and the slope, as well as the covariance between them. While this approach is conceptually straightforward, there are some technical details which can require special attention. For example, it is necessary to centre the environmental variable individually, that is, that the mean environment for every individual has a value of zero, to reliably disentangle within- from among-individual changes (Kreft et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b60" href="#b60">1995</a>). Another important factor is the number of repeated records per individual as this affects the precision with which individual reaction norms will be estimated. Simulation models imply that generally large data sets with total number of observations in the hundreds are necessary, but also that the optimal power is attained with a number of individuals to observations per individual ratio around 0.5 (e.g. 10 individuals with 20 observations each for a total of 200 observations, Martin et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b71" href="#b71">2011</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ‘choice’ of the environmental variable against which phenotypes are regressed can also severely affect conclusions about variation in individual reaction norms. If an environmental variable is chosen that is only weakly correlated to the true causal factor for within-individual variation, the degree of phenotypic plasticity will be underestimated. Since temperature is the primary environmental cue for plant phenology (e.g. Bradshaw and Holzapfel 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" href="#b11">2006</a>; Donnelly et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" href="#b26">2012</a>; Franks et al. this issue), it has been largely assumed that this should be also the case for the phenology of organisms at higher trophic levels, such as birds. However, it is now obvious that bird phenology depends on several cues that can be influenced by climate change (such as temperature) or not (such as photoperiod, Lambrechts et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b63" href="#b63">1997</a>) and that there is seldom an obvious measure of the climatic or weather conditions that causally affect a bird's phenological phenotype. In particular, although most birds breed earlier in warmer springs, there are a large number of possible measures of spring ‘warmness’. These will generally be correlated moderately or even (very) highly but which one is used as the environmental variable in a phenotypic plasticity analysis can strongly affect the results. For example, two studies analysed phenotypic plasticity in breeding time for the UK great tit population cited above, and depending on the period over which spring temperatures were averaged, individual variation in reaction norm slopes was present (Husby et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b51" href="#b51">2010</a>) or absent (Charmantier et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">2008</a>). Similarly, using very coarse-grained environmental variables which are probably only weakly correlated with the true causal factor will likely underestimate phenotypic plasticity and especially individual variation in reaction norms. This could be the case in Reed et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b98" href="#b98">2006</a>) study using the North-Atlantic-Oscillation Index, which summarizes climate variations across Western Europe and Eastern North America, in their analysis of breeding time in the common guillemot, 
  <span class="italic">Uria aalge</span> showing no individual variation in reaction norm slopes. A similar problem is likely also present in the study of Van Buskirk et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b119" href="#b119">2012</a>) which analysed spring arrival timing of 27 North American bird species. Individual phenotypic plasticity of spring arrival in response to temperatures could only explain 13–25% of the advancement in phenology observed over 46 years. However, if the temperature measure was ‘too coarse’ and hence an inappropriate environmental variable, individual plasticity estimates could be downwardly biased. Identifying the correct environmental variable is especially difficult in migratory species as they often cover large distances in little time and the most relevant spatial and temporal scales across which environmental variables affect timing of migration is unclear.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When fine-grained environmental variables are used in analyses of individual phenotypic plasticity for avian phenology, they are commonly daily mean temperatures averaged over certain fixed calendar dates, which limits the possibility to extrapolate to other systems. These fixed periods are identical in all years for a given population, for example, from 15 February to 25 April in Husby et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b51" href="#b51">2010</a>) for the UK great tit population, which means that the predictive value of this proxy will co-vary with the absolute phenological timing in birds. This can be especially problematic when temperatures averaged over fixed periods are used to forecast phenology outside the current temperature range. A solution to this is to model the daily probability that an individual will start breeding depending on the environmental conditions up until that day using survival models that allow for so-called time-dependent variables, such as, for example, the ‘proportional hazards model’ (Cox 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">1972</a>). This approach has so far been used to model phenotypic plasticity of timing of breeding, moult and migration in birds (Gienapp et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" href="#b33">2005</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" href="#b37">2010</a>; Bauer et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" href="#b4">2008</a>; van de Pol and Cockburn 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b120" href="#b120">2011</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another alternative to the use of average daily temperatures during fixed periods is the heat accumulation, that is, the temperature sums (in degree-days) above a threshold (e.g. 0°C) between a set start date (e.g. 1st January) and the phenological event of interest (e.g. Saino et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b106" href="#b106">2011</a>). If one were to apply this measure to an analysis of individual plasticity within populations, an interesting paradox may emerge where individual birds that are classically shown as being plastic in response to daily average temperatures would actually maintain the same relationship between their timing of breeding and the heat accumulation.
