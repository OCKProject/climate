  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many long-term individual monitoring studies of birds have offered the possibility to estimate the heritability of timing of breeding, and it is now well known that egg-laying dates are commonly heritable [e.g. 
   <span class="italic">h</span>² = 0.192 (SE = 0.036) in the collared flycatcher 
   <span class="italic">Ficedula albicollis</span>, Sheldon et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b111" href="#b111">2003</a>; 
   <span class="italic">h</span>² = 0.159 (SD = 0.059) in the great tit 
   <span class="italic">Parus major</span>, McCleery et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b72" href="#b72">2004</a>; and 
   <span class="italic">h</span>² = 0.145 in the common gull 
   <span class="italic">Larus canus</span>, Brommer and Rattiste 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" href="#b12">2008</a>] although two case studies have shown no significant heritability for female egg-laying dates (in the mute swan 
   <span class="italic">Cygnus olor</span>, Charmantier et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" href="#b17">2006</a>; and in the red-billed gull 
   <span class="italic">Larus novaehollandiae scopulinus</span>, Teplitsky et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b117" href="#b117">2010</a>). Similarly, a review of 12 avian studies (mostly laboratory based) showed that traits related to the timing of migration are commonly heritable, with a mean heritability of 0.34 (SD = 0.24) (Pulido 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b93" href="#b93">2007a</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b94" href="#b94">b</a>). More strikingly, experiments inducing artificial directional selection on migratory activity in the blackcap 
   <span class="italic">Sylvia atricapilla</span> induced a significant delay in the mean autumn departure date by the same order of magnitude than that predicted by the breeder's equation (Pulido et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b97" href="#b97">2001</a>), thereby confirming strong evolutionary potential for the timing of migration.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, previous investigations in avian populations show that timing of breeding and timing of migration are heritable in many species, and in the face of climate change they are classically under strong negative directional selection. However, demonstrating that an avian phenological trait is heritable and is under directional selection only suggests that there is potential for adaptive evolution, but is insufficient to conclude that an advance of the average population laying date or arrival date from migration can be attributed to evolutionary adaptation (e.g. Teplitsky et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b117" href="#b117">2010</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A review of the literature</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to assess the empirical evidence that supports individual plasticity versus microevolution as processes explaining changes in avian phenology (timing of breeding or timing of migration), we have reviewed the literature testing for one or both mechanisms. This review was based on an ISI Web of Science search using several combinations of key words for studies on breeding phenology (‘plasticity’+'phenology'+'bird', ‘evolution’+'phenology'+'bird', ‘evolution’+'laying date+'bird', ‘plasticity’+'laying date', ‘plasticity’+ ‘breeding time’+ ‘bird’, ‘evolution’ + ‘breeding time’+ ‘bird’ as of 01/04/2013, amounting to 863 records) and on migration phenology (‘evolution’ + ‘migration’ + ‘bird’, ‘plasticity’ + ‘migration’ + ‘bird’, 786 records). Table 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a> offers an overview of studies where individual data have been used to test for plasticity and/or microevolution in response to a climate variable, and in a way that matches our descriptions above. In particular, we did not include in this table the many studies that claimed to show plasticity while using population trends rather than individual reaction norms. Results were interpreted by ourselves, and hence, there might be some discrepancies between statements in the cited references and our own interpretation, for example when adaptive plasticity is claimed but fitness has not been (adequately) measured. If data from the same population were analysed in different papers, thereby providing complementary results on plasticity, evolution and selection, they appear on the same table line and all the references are mentioned.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Why so little evidence for an evolutionary response?</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is quite striking that compared to the very high number of hits in the ISI searches, studies of individual plasticity or microevolution of the timing of breeding and even more so the timing of migration, remain scarce (Table 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a>). There is however building evidence that birds from a range of taxa show a plastic advancement in their timing of migration and breeding, in response to warmer springs or summers. In the cases where selection analyses were conducted, they show that this advancement is overwhelmingly adaptive. In contrast, only three studies appear to have tested formally for an evolutionary genetic response to climate warming in the timing of breeding by exploring temporal trends in the breeding values of laying date, in a 23 year study of the collared flycatcher 
   <span class="italic">Ficedula albicollis</span> (Brommer et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" href="#b13">2005</a>), in a 31 year study of the great tit 
   <span class="italic">Parus major</span> (Gienapp et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">2006</a>) and in a 46 year study of the red-billed gull 
   <span class="italic">Larus novaehollandiae scopulinus</span> (Teplitsky et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b117" href="#b117">2010</a>). These three studies have found no significant advancement of the mean predicted breeding values for the timing of reproduction. We do not know of an equivalent study in the timing of migration; however, a significant micro-evolutionary change in the timing of autumn migration activity has been measured in response to artificial selection in captive blackcaps 
   <span class="italic">Sylvia atricapilla</span> (Pulido and Berthold 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b95" href="#b95">2003</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b96" href="#b96">2010</a>), along with an even stronger reduction in migratory activity. We could add here that several other papers, although not formally testing changes in breeding values, have shown that phenotypic changes in phenology could be explained entirely by individual plasticity (Charmantier et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">2008</a>). Hence, the evidence we have reviewed here points to the conclusion previously reached (Gienapp et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" href="#b35">2007</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" href="#b36">2008</a>; Sheldon 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b110" href="#b110">2010</a>) that we do not have any good evidence pointing to contemporary climate-change evolution in bird phenology, while there is ample evidence for strong individual plasticity in avian phenology (Table 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a>). However, it would be premature to interpret this lack of evidence as revealing that microevolutionary responses to climate change are rare; our assessment instead points towards a paucity of investigations, limiting the scope for generalizations to be made at this stage.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A detailed look at the references from the ISI searches shows that only 10% of studies on avian migration time that reported an advancement of timing were based on individual data (seven of 66, see Supporting information, 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Table S1</a>). This leads to the worrying conclusion that many studies claiming to support climate-driven evolutionary change do not even measure individual plasticity (e.g. Jonzen et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b56" href="#b56">2006</a>). The general deficiency of appropriate tests suggests that either longitudinal individual data allowing proper investigations are lacking, or that they have not been properly analysed. It is obvious that annual average phenological dates are easier to collect than individual data. However, Møller and Fiedler (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b76" href="#b76">2010</a>) have estimated that there exist more than 200 long-term (&gt;10 years) time series based on individually marked birds (most of them providing pedigrees), and maybe ten times this if data collected by amateurs were shared for data analysis. A great majority of these time series will include data on avian phenology. Hence, collective sharing of data in collaborative studies including experts in the analyses of microevolution, plasticity and selection could well soon trigger a multitude of new results and bring this field to a whole new scale.
