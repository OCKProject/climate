 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Besides our main goal of improving our knowledge as evolutionary biologists on population adaptive responses to climate change, we are increasingly under the requirement from decision makers to forecast future changes and to offer advice on conservation strategies. Understanding the respective roles of individual plasticity and evolutionary responses in the phenological changes observed is an initial crucial step in order to offer predictive scenarios (Jenouvrier 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b52" href="#b52">2013</a>), since as we have discussed, the two mechanisms act at different time-scales. However, a further essential step is to gauge the demographic consequences of adaptation or maladaptation by bridging the gap between evolutionary ecology and demography. Although this eco-evolutionary dynamics approach is at its infancy (see also recommendations in Reusch this issue), it should soon promote the possibility to predict possible effects of climate change on population dynamics, such as two recent studies modelling the contribution of phenotypic plasticity (Vedder et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b121" href="#b121">2013</a>) and phenological mismatch (Reed et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b100" href="#b100">2013a</a>), to population growth and persistence.
