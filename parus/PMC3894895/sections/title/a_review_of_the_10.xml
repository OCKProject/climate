 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A review of the literature</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to assess the empirical evidence that supports individual plasticity versus microevolution as processes explaining changes in avian phenology (timing of breeding or timing of migration), we have reviewed the literature testing for one or both mechanisms. This review was based on an ISI Web of Science search using several combinations of key words for studies on breeding phenology (‘plasticity’+'phenology'+'bird', ‘evolution’+'phenology'+'bird', ‘evolution’+'laying date+'bird', ‘plasticity’+'laying date', ‘plasticity’+ ‘breeding time’+ ‘bird’, ‘evolution’ + ‘breeding time’+ ‘bird’ as of 01/04/2013, amounting to 863 records) and on migration phenology (‘evolution’ + ‘migration’ + ‘bird’, ‘plasticity’ + ‘migration’ + ‘bird’, 786 records). Table 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a> offers an overview of studies where individual data have been used to test for plasticity and/or microevolution in response to a climate variable, and in a way that matches our descriptions above. In particular, we did not include in this table the many studies that claimed to show plasticity while using population trends rather than individual reaction norms. Results were interpreted by ourselves, and hence, there might be some discrepancies between statements in the cited references and our own interpretation, for example when adaptive plasticity is claimed but fitness has not been (adequately) measured. If data from the same population were analysed in different papers, thereby providing complementary results on plasticity, evolution and selection, they appear on the same table line and all the references are mentioned.
