 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change not only results in increased temperatures but also in more frequent extreme climatic events (Tebaldi et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b116" href="#b116">2007</a>). Hence, it is highly probable that birds are selected not only for earlier phenology but also for a fine-tuned adjustment in their phenology every year. In fact, developing a reaction norm perspective when investigating microevolutionary response to climate change might reveal that adaptation results mainly from a heritable change in individual reaction norms rather than in the mean phenotypic response. Several studies in Table 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a> have already attempted to measure the variation in reaction norm properties across individuals (
  <span class="italic">G</span> Ã— 
  <span class="italic">E</span> interactions when reaction norm show heritable variation), and selection acting on these properties (Brommer et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" href="#b13">2005</a>; Nussey et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b81" href="#b81">2005</a>; Reed et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b98" href="#b98">2006</a>; Wilson et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b128" href="#b128">2007</a>). Although considering variation in phenological plasticity adds computational complexity and requires large datasets with repeated individual data, it will most probably be an essential contribution to our understanding of how bird populations can adapt to the increasing weather variability.
