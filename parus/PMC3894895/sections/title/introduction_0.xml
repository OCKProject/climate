 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Changes in the phenology of spring events are among the most frequently reported responses to climate change across all trophic levels and all types of freshwater, terrestrial and marine environments (e.g. Parmesan and Yohe 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b83" href="#b83">2003</a>; Root et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b103" href="#b103">2003</a>; Thackeray et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b118" href="#b118">2010</a>). Thanks to the very long history of both scientific and public interest in ornithology, and the amenability of avian species to observation and capture, birds have contributed immensely to our knowledge on how animals are impacted by climate change. So far, this literature has been heavily focused on temperate species, while little is known on the response of tropical species. This strong bias will undoubtedly affect the conclusions we reach in this review. Most avian species and populations investigated have advanced their breeding and migration behaviours in the last decades (Møller et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b77" href="#b77">2010</a>; Knudsen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b57" href="#b57">2011</a>). This common advancement in phenology is generally attributed to a response of timing of breeding and migration to changes in weather. Indeed, many bird species breed or migrate earlier in warmer springs (reviews in Gordo 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b42" href="#b42">2007</a>; Lehikoinen and Sparks 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b66" href="#b66">2010</a>). Timing of migration is also affected by other environmental variables such as favourable tailwinds (Alerstam 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" href="#b1">1990</a>) or conditions at stop-over sites or wintering areas (Saino and Ambrosini 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b104" href="#b104">2008</a>), which can be affected by climate change partly independently of temperature. However, in the context of studying climate change, the large majority of studies have discussed the observed changes with a focus on increased temperatures.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phenological traits are generally expected to be closely related to individual fitness, especially in seasonal habitats such as temperate forests, where food availability is restricted to a short burst (Visser et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b125" href="#b125">2006</a>; Reed et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b101" href="#b101">2013b</a>). In these ecosystems, the seasonally changing environmental conditions set an ‘optimal time window’ for activities such as breeding, migrating or hibernating. This ‘optimal time window’ is determined by a variety of factors, of which the most relevant in the context of climate change are climatic factors and the phenology of other trophic levels (Visser and Both 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b124" href="#b124">2005</a>). Many food resources show a clear seasonal trend in abundance or suitability. For example, the abundance of caterpillars, an important prey for many passerines during their reproductive period, shows a pronounced and short peak in spring in temperate European forests (Visser et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b125" href="#b125">2006</a>). Prey fish species of seabirds can also show distinct abundance peaks, for example, caused by spawning migration, thereby affecting the breeding success of zooplanktivorous and piscivorous seabirds (Sims et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b113" href="#b113">2004</a>; Hipfner 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b49" href="#b49">2008</a>). Higher trophic level interactions can also affect optimal timing of important life history events. For example, the optimal time of migration in wader species depends partly on predation risk by birds of prey (e.g. Lank and Ydenberg 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b65" href="#b65">2003</a>). Another possible factor affecting optimal timing is the timing of conspecifics, for example, through competition for breeding territories (e.g. Sergio et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b108" href="#b108">2007</a>) or social benefits of synchronized reproduction (Hatchwell 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" href="#b46">1991</a>; Reed et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b98" href="#b98">2006</a>). Climatic factors can also directly affect the ‘optimal time window’ as cold spells in early spring can lead to mass mortality of early arriving migratory birds (Newton 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b80" href="#b80">2007</a>). Consequently, climatic variables can induce selection on spring phenology of birds either indirectly by affecting processes at lower or higher trophic levels, or more directly by influencing their survival probability. Hence, in temperate zone organisms relying on strong seasonal changes in the ecosystem, one would expect climate change to alter selection on phenology and generally to lead to directional selection for earlier breeding and migration.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In fact, as far back as the late-1970s, correlative and experimental studies have repeatedly shown that reproductive success declines over the course of the breeding season in a variety of avian species, translating into strong directional selection for early breeding (review in Verhulst and Nilsson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b122" href="#b122">2008</a>). While a similar relationship is expected for migration time, not least because of the expected link between migration and breeding phenologies, far fewer studies have quantified selection on migration time due to the much higher effort required to record individual data on migration time as well as reproductive success and survival. The existing, but limited, evidence indicates that directional selection on timing of arrival at the breeding grounds favouring early arriving individuals is also common (Bêty et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" href="#b7">2004</a>; Smith and Moore 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b114" href="#b114">2005</a>; Møller et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b77" href="#b77">2010</a>; Gienapp and Bregnballe 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">2012</a>; Arnaud et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" href="#b2">2013</a>). Note however that modelling work suggests that selection need not always favour earlier migration when competition for territories is strong, even if the food peak advances (Johansson and Jonzen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b54" href="#b54">2012</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, there is strong evidence across a range of bird taxa for selection favouring early migration and breeding activity, and a general expectation of intensified selection in the face of climate change. In accordance with this selection for advanced phenology, there is overwhelming evidence across many bird taxa, for earlier mean migration dates and earlier mean breeding dates at the population level. The question addressed in this review is whether this evidence can be attributed to evolutionary changes in response to the documented selection forces, or whether it results from individual plasticity, that is, the capacity of individuals to adjust their phenology according to environmental cues informative about lower and/or higher trophic level phenology. First, we will briefly outline why it is important to distinguish between plastic and microevolutionary responses.</p>
