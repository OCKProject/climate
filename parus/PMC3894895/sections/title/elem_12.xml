 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As outlined in the previous section, there is an overall critical lack of investigations on microevolutionary changes in bird phenology in response to climate change, similarly to what is found in other vertebrates (see Boutin and Lane this issue; Urban et al. this issue and Crozier and Hutchings this issue, for mammals, amphibians/reptiles and fish, respectively). However, in the case of birds, many studies cited in Table 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a> are based on available phenotypic and pedigree data that would allow such scrutiny. Hence, our first encouragement will be to get back to these data sets and test for evolutionary changes, following the latest statistical recommendations (Postma 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b88" href="#b88">2006</a>; Hadfield et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b44" href="#b44">2010</a>). We briefly list below some other exciting perspectives that we would prioritize to improve our knowledge on the underlying processes explaining the general advancement in observed bird phenology.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Maintaining high priority on obtaining more individual data</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While egg-laying dates are already commonly part of long-term monitoring programmes, a better understanding of evolutionary processes shaping variation in migration behaviour requires similar individual data (see Dittmann and Becker 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">2003</a> for an example of exact individual arrival dates in a long-term project). The rapid improvement and accessibility of satellite-tracking and geolocator devices (Gillespie 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" href="#b39">2001</a>; Wakefield et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b127" href="#b127">2009</a>) will soon allow researchers to record entire migration journeys in larger samples of birds, thus opening stimulating new possibilities on the study of individual variation in the various behaviours involved in the migration route and timing.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Developing multi-trait measures and analyses</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While this review focused on the timing of migration and breeding, climate change affects other important traits in birds, such as migration activity (Pulido and Berthold 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b96" href="#b96">2010</a>), the probability of laying multiple broods (Husby et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b50" href="#b50">2009</a>), intermittent breeding or the propensity to skip breeding altogether, (Cubaynes et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" href="#b23">2011</a>), body size (Teplitsky and Millien this issue) and survival (Grosbois et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" href="#b43">2006</a>). Since many of these traits interact at a phenotypic and possibly genetic level with avian phenology, for example, via life-history trade-offs, they should be involved as much as possible in both the data collection and analytical process.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Exploring evolution of plasticity</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change not only results in increased temperatures but also in more frequent extreme climatic events (Tebaldi et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b116" href="#b116">2007</a>). Hence, it is highly probable that birds are selected not only for earlier phenology but also for a fine-tuned adjustment in their phenology every year. In fact, developing a reaction norm perspective when investigating microevolutionary response to climate change might reveal that adaptation results mainly from a heritable change in individual reaction norms rather than in the mean phenotypic response. Several studies in Table 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a> have already attempted to measure the variation in reaction norm properties across individuals (
   <span class="italic">G</span> Ã— 
   <span class="italic">E</span> interactions when reaction norm show heritable variation), and selection acting on these properties (Brommer et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" href="#b13">2005</a>; Nussey et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b81" href="#b81">2005</a>; Reed et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b98" href="#b98">2006</a>; Wilson et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b128" href="#b128">2007</a>). Although considering variation in phenological plasticity adds computational complexity and requires large datasets with repeated individual data, it will most probably be an essential contribution to our understanding of how bird populations can adapt to the increasing weather variability.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Exploring responses across populations of the same species</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to their time-consuming nature, avian individual monitoring projects are often based on single study sites. However, the rare projects with comparisons across populations allow researchers to assess how generalizable single-population plasticity trends are (Porlier et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b87" href="#b87">2012</a>) but also to understand which factors drive differences in plasticity and evolution across a species range (Both et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" href="#b10">2006</a>). Since avian demographic responses to climate change are not uniform across species ranges (Jiguet et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b53" href="#b53">2010</a>) future studies should develop comparisons across the species thermal range. The study of populations at range-edge location may be of particular conservation value because they represent significant components of intraspecific biodiversity (Hardie and Hutchings 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b45" href="#b45">2010</a>) and potential sources of evolutionary innovation and persistence during rapid environmental change such as global warming (Sexton et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b109" href="#b109">2009</a>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Table 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a> shows a strong bias towards temperate insectivorous birds, while birds in many other ecosystems are completely unexplored because of lack of individual data. In particular, we know that some extreme areas such as the Arctic are showing strong signs of climate warming (Moritz et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b78" href="#b78">2002</a>) and previous studies have shown that Arctic birds can modulate the sensitivity of their hormonal response to local environmental conditions in order to fine-tune the onset of their very brief territoriality (Wingfield and Hunt 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b130" href="#b130">2002</a>). This provides grounds to predict that Arctic birds may display particularly strong plasticity.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Linking phenological changes to population demography</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Besides our main goal of improving our knowledge as evolutionary biologists on population adaptive responses to climate change, we are increasingly under the requirement from decision makers to forecast future changes and to offer advice on conservation strategies. Understanding the respective roles of individual plasticity and evolutionary responses in the phenological changes observed is an initial crucial step in order to offer predictive scenarios (Jenouvrier 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b52" href="#b52">2013</a>), since as we have discussed, the two mechanisms act at different time-scales. However, a further essential step is to gauge the demographic consequences of adaptation or maladaptation by bridging the gap between evolutionary ecology and demography. Although this eco-evolutionary dynamics approach is at its infancy (see also recommendations in Reusch this issue), it should soon promote the possibility to predict possible effects of climate change on population dynamics, such as two recent studies modelling the contribution of phenotypic plasticity (Vedder et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b121" href="#b121">2013</a>) and phenological mismatch (Reed et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b100" href="#b100">2013a</a>), to population growth and persistence.
