 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While egg-laying dates are already commonly part of long-term monitoring programmes, a better understanding of evolutionary processes shaping variation in migration behaviour requires similar individual data (see Dittmann and Becker 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">2003</a> for an example of exact individual arrival dates in a long-term project). The rapid improvement and accessibility of satellite-tracking and geolocator devices (Gillespie 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" href="#b39">2001</a>; Wakefield et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b127" href="#b127">2009</a>) will soon allow researchers to record entire migration journeys in larger samples of birds, thus opening stimulating new possibilities on the study of individual variation in the various behaviours involved in the migration route and timing.
