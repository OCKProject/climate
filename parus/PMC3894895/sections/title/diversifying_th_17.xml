  <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a> shows a strong bias towards temperate insectivorous birds, while birds in many other ecosystems are completely unexplored because of lack of individual data. In particular, we know that some extreme areas such as the Arctic are showing strong signs of climate warming (Moritz et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b78" href="#b78">2002</a>) and previous studies have shown that Arctic birds can modulate the sensitivity of their hormonal response to local environmental conditions in order to fine-tune the onset of their very brief territoriality (Wingfield and Hunt 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b130" href="#b130">2002</a>). This provides grounds to predict that Arctic birds may display particularly strong plasticity.
