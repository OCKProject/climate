 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Why so little evidence for an evolutionary response?</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is quite striking that compared to the very high number of hits in the ISI searches, studies of individual plasticity or microevolution of the timing of breeding and even more so the timing of migration, remain scarce (Table 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a>). There is however building evidence that birds from a range of taxa show a plastic advancement in their timing of migration and breeding, in response to warmer springs or summers. In the cases where selection analyses were conducted, they show that this advancement is overwhelmingly adaptive. In contrast, only three studies appear to have tested formally for an evolutionary genetic response to climate warming in the timing of breeding by exploring temporal trends in the breeding values of laying date, in a 23 year study of the collared flycatcher 
  <span class="italic">Ficedula albicollis</span> (Brommer et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" href="#b13">2005</a>), in a 31 year study of the great tit 
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span> (Gienapp et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">2006</a>) and in a 46 year study of the red-billed gull 
  <span class="italic">Larus novaehollandiae scopulinus</span> (Teplitsky et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b117" href="#b117">2010</a>). These three studies have found no significant advancement of the mean predicted breeding values for the timing of reproduction. We do not know of an equivalent study in the timing of migration; however, a significant micro-evolutionary change in the timing of autumn migration activity has been measured in response to artificial selection in captive blackcaps 
  <span class="italic">Sylvia atricapilla</span> (Pulido and Berthold 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b95" href="#b95">2003</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b96" href="#b96">2010</a>), along with an even stronger reduction in migratory activity. We could add here that several other papers, although not formally testing changes in breeding values, have shown that phenotypic changes in phenology could be explained entirely by individual plasticity (Charmantier et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">2008</a>). Hence, the evidence we have reviewed here points to the conclusion previously reached (Gienapp et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" href="#b35">2007</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" href="#b36">2008</a>; Sheldon 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b110" href="#b110">2010</a>) that we do not have any good evidence pointing to contemporary climate-change evolution in bird phenology, while there is ample evidence for strong individual plasticity in avian phenology (Table 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a>). However, it would be premature to interpret this lack of evidence as revealing that microevolutionary responses to climate change are rare; our assessment instead points towards a paucity of investigations, limiting the scope for generalizations to be made at this stage.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A detailed look at the references from the ISI searches shows that only 10% of studies on avian migration time that reported an advancement of timing were based on individual data (seven of 66, see Supporting information, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Table S1</a>). This leads to the worrying conclusion that many studies claiming to support climate-driven evolutionary change do not even measure individual plasticity (e.g. Jonzen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b56" href="#b56">2006</a>). The general deficiency of appropriate tests suggests that either longitudinal individual data allowing proper investigations are lacking, or that they have not been properly analysed. It is obvious that annual average phenological dates are easier to collect than individual data. However, MÃ¸ller and Fiedler (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b76" href="#b76">2010</a>) have estimated that there exist more than 200 long-term (&gt;10 years) time series based on individually marked birds (most of them providing pedigrees), and maybe ten times this if data collected by amateurs were shared for data analysis. A great majority of these time series will include data on avian phenology. Hence, collective sharing of data in collaborative studies including experts in the analyses of microevolution, plasticity and selection could well soon trigger a multitude of new results and bring this field to a whole new scale.
