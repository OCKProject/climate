 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While this review focused on the timing of migration and breeding, climate change affects other important traits in birds, such as migration activity (Pulido and Berthold 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b96" href="#b96">2010</a>), the probability of laying multiple broods (Husby et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b50" href="#b50">2009</a>), intermittent breeding or the propensity to skip breeding altogether, (Cubaynes et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" href="#b23">2011</a>), body size (Teplitsky and Millien this issue) and survival (Grosbois et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" href="#b43">2006</a>). Since many of these traits interact at a phenotypic and possibly genetic level with avian phenology, for example, via life-history trade-offs, they should be involved as much as possible in both the data collection and analytical process.
