 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phenotypic plasticity is defined as the ability of a genotype to produce different phenotypes in different environments (Pigliucci 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b85" href="#b85">2001</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b86" href="#b86">2005</a>). Many traits are phenotypically plastic and while ‘non-labile’ traits are stable during the life-time of an individual, for example, morphological traits which are influenced by conditions during ontogeny, ‘labile’ traits change repeatedly and can respond quickly to environmental conditions (e.g. behavioural or some life-history traits). Phenotypically plastic traits, and especially ‘labile’ traits, can hence respond very quickly to altered environmental conditions. This is especially obvious for phenology, the seasonal timing of life-cycle events (e.g. flowering, migration or breeding), where trait values (i.e. the date when these events occur) can vary by weeks from one year to the next.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Micro-evolutionary change as a response to selection acting on heritable traits is generally slower to change phenotypes than plasticity (Hendry and Kinnison 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b48" href="#b48">1999</a>), in particular because heritabilities estimated in natural populations are often moderate (Kruuk 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b61" href="#b61">2004</a>), and generation times can be on the order of several years. Consequently, phenotypic plasticity might be a better way to cope with environmental change as it can allow a faster tracking of the changing environment. As an illustrative example, a 47-year study of great tits 
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span> breeding in nest-boxes in the United Kingdom has shown that over this half century, the mean egg-laying date of female great tits has advanced by about 14 days (Charmantier et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">2008</a>). This is equivalent to the advance in caterpillar phenology on the same study site during the same period, resulting in a close matching of bird and prey phenology. Based on estimates of laying date heritability, and on the force of selection presently acting on this trait, quantitative genetic models predict that selection would need to be four times stronger than the selection measured, for microevolution to explain the advance observed in great tit breeding phenology. Or in other words, the 14 day advance would take two centuries if it relied on an evolutionary adaptation alone. This example illustrates the main ‘advantage’ of individual plasticity compared to adaptive evolution to track climate change effects: plasticity ‘allows’ more rapid changes, as well as tracking of annual fluctuations in the environment.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, for plasticity to remain efficient during an environmental change, it is required that the relationship between the environment that determines the trait (i.e. the ‘cue’), and the environment that determines fitness (i.e. the ‘selective environment’) remains the same during the selective process. When this is the case, the optimal reaction norm is not changed by environmental change. This however does not seem to be likely under continued climate change as the rate of climate change varies in space and time (Easterling 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" href="#b28">1997</a>; Luterbacher et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b69" href="#b69">2004</a>) and individuals typically experience more than one season or region (e.g. in migratory species). The possible unreliability of cues guiding the plastic response is one of the major limits to the benefits of plasticity, although the exploration of costs and limits of phenotypic plasticity is very limited compared to investigations of benefits (DeWitt et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">1998</a>). For example, great tits react to temperatures in early spring to time their breeding, that is, they use these temperatures as ‘cues’. However, their reproductive success depends on the occurrence of caterpillars later in the season when the chicks' food demands are highest, and the phenology of these caterpillars is determined by temperatures in late spring (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">1</a>, Visser et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b125" href="#b125">2006</a>; Visser 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b123" href="#b123">2008</a>). A differential change in these spring temperatures has occurred in the Netherlands, thereby altering the relationship between cue and optimum phenotype and leading to selection on the reaction norms (Nussey et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b81" href="#b81">2005</a>). Interestingly, even an equal rate of temperature increase in the two periods will lead to selection on the intercept of the birds' breeding time-reaction norm as the caterpillars respond more strongly to temperatures than the birds (T.E. Reed, P. Gienapp, and M.E. Visser, unpublished data).

   <p>Schematic illustration of phenological ‘mismatch’ taking great tits and their caterpillar food supply as example. The curves indicate frequency distributions of first eggs of clutches (blue), hatching (red) and caterpillar abundance (green). Food demands of great tit chicks are highest approximately 9 days after hatching indicated by the black arrow. In the upper panel describing a scenario before climate change, the birds' breeding is well-timed to the caterpillars, and chick demand coincides with caterpillar abundance. In the lower panel, the timing of both the great tits and the caterpillars has advanced – due to climate change – but the caterpillars have advanced twice as fast. This now has led to a ‘mismatch’ between the chick demands and the phenology of the caterpillars.</p>
