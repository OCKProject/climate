 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Disentangling evolutionary and phenotypically plastic changes can be done in a number of ways (see Merilä and Hendry this issue). Studying this in avian phenology poses special challenges but also offers certain advantages. In the following, we will scrutinize the approaches outlined by Merilä and Hendry (this issue, Table 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a>) for their applicability to study avian phenology in the context of adaptation to climate change.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The potential for evolutionary change in a population facing a drastic environmental modification such as climate change is related to the amount of standing genetic variation for important adaptive traits, and also to the strength of selection acting on these traits. Indeed, in a quantitative genetics framework, two key models have been used to predict the evolution of selected traits. First, the so-called ‘breeder's equation’ predicts the response to selection (
   <span class="italic">R</span>) based on estimations of heritability (
   <span class="italic">h</span>²) and the strength of selection (
   <span class="italic">S</span>, Falconer and Mackay 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" href="#b29">1996</a>): 
   <span class="italic">R</span> = 
   <span class="italic">h²S</span>. Ideally, this approach should be applied in a multivariate framework (the multivariate ‘Lande equation’), where the vector 
   <span class="italic">R</span> of responses in a set of traits depends on the 
   <span class="italic">G</span> matrix of additive genetic (co)variances for these traits and the selection gradients 
   <span class="italic">β</span>: 
   <span class="italic">R = G β</span> (Lande 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b64" href="#b64">1979</a>). Second, the Robertson-Price Identity relates the evolutionary change (
   <span class="italic">R)</span> to the genetic covariance of the focal trait (
   <span class="italic">z</span>) with relative fitness (
   <span class="italic">w</span>): 
   <span class="italic">R = σ</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">a</span>
   </sub>
   <span class="italic">(z,w)</span> (Robertson 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b102" href="#b102">1966</a>; Price 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b90" href="#b90">1970</a>). Data on individual phenotypes, individual fitness, and relatedness between individuals in the focal population (i.e. a pedigree) are essential prerequisites for these estimations. Quantitative genetic analyses such as the animal model rely on phenotypic resemblance among relatives to estimate quantitative genetic parameters, such as heritability or genetic correlations (Falconer and Mackay 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" href="#b29">1996</a>; Lynch and Walsh 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b70" href="#b70">1998</a>). When studying wild bird populations, controlled breeding is usually impossible, hence quantitative genetic analyses rely on observing or reconstructing relatedness between phenotyped individuals. ‘Classical’ approaches are parent–offspring regression or full- or half-sib analyses where the degree of phenotypic similarity between offspring and parents or sibling groups is used to estimate additive genetic (co)variances. Animal models are better-suited for the study of natural populations as they can make use of the phenotypic information of relatives via the pedigree (Wilson et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b129" href="#b129">2009</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to obtain individual data and assess heritability and selection, it is necessary to uniquely mark individuals, to follow them through their life-time (or at least a substantial part of it) and to reliably record the desired phenotypes, such as dates of initiation of breeding or dates of migration. Furthermore, it is also essential to link parents to their offspring to construct the pedigree. As birds can be easily individually marked by metal and coloured plastic leg-rings, and many avian species have extended brood care, in which often both parents take part, the necessary data for quantitative genetic analyses are comparably easily collected in birds. Several long-term studies have collected such data in some cases already for decades and they now offer a wealth of high-quality individual data suitable for sophisticated quantitative genetic analyses (Collins 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">2001</a>; Postma and Charmantier 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b89" href="#b89">2007</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In theory, the best way to test for microevolution in real time is to estimate the individual genetic values, or breeding values, for the studied trait, and explore the changes in the mean breeding values over time (example in Garant et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">2004</a>; review in Kruuk 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b61" href="#b61">2004</a>). In practice, however, the use of breeding values predicted from animal models can introduce serious biases in the analyses and conclusions reached regarding microevolution, because they do not always adequately reflect true breeding values. First, trends in predicted breeding values can mimic the observed phenotypic trend, even in the absence of a genetic change, if the phenotypic change over time is environmentally induced and this temporal variation is inadequately modelled (Postma 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b88" href="#b88">2006</a>). Second, predicted values are always associated with (often large) standard errors, and they are non-independent for individuals of the same population, hence statistical care should be invested in controlling for this uncertainty and non-independence (Hadfield et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b44" href="#b44">2010</a>). Overall, the use of breeding values to test for microevolution requires special statistical attention and caution (see e.g. Milot et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b75" href="#b75">2011</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Individual plasticity in nature</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">‘Labile’ traits can be recorded several times in the same individual which allows the analyses of individual plasticity by modelling within-individual changes in response to the environment. Phenological traits, such as the seasonal timing of breeding or migration, are ‘labile’ traits when individuals breed or migrate in more than 1 year. Since recording individual data is comparably easy in birds, many studies analysed within-individual responses of avian breeding time (e.g. Nussey et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b81" href="#b81">2005</a>; Reed et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b98" href="#b98">2006</a>; Porlier et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b87" href="#b87">2012</a>) and migration time (Pulido 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b93" href="#b93">2007a</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b94" href="#b94">b</a>; Knudsen et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b57" href="#b57">2011</a>), mainly in response to ambient temperature. A note of caution here is that although it seems straightforward to record timing of events, potential biases exist. For instance, many avian monitoring studies cannot identify a pair's identity before the parent's capture at the chick stage. Hence if the probability of failure in early stages of clutch initiation is high for early breeders, they will be observed as late rather than early breeders. The consequences of such biases on our estimation of plasticity, heritability and selection for phenological traits have never been explored.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The simplest form of a reaction norm is described by a linear regression of the response phenotype on the environmental variable known or thought to affect the analysed trait. Studies of individual plasticity commonly use this type of linear relationships implemented in mixed models (with individual identity as random effect). Individual variation in phenotypic reaction norms can be modelled by fitting the interaction between the environmental variable and the random effect individual identity (Henderson 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" href="#b47">1982</a>; Pigliucci 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b85" href="#b85">2001</a>; Nussey et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b82" href="#b82">2007</a>). These models allow for estimation of individual variation in each of the two parameters describing reaction norms, the elevation and the slope, as well as the covariance between them. While this approach is conceptually straightforward, there are some technical details which can require special attention. For example, it is necessary to centre the environmental variable individually, that is, that the mean environment for every individual has a value of zero, to reliably disentangle within- from among-individual changes (Kreft et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b60" href="#b60">1995</a>). Another important factor is the number of repeated records per individual as this affects the precision with which individual reaction norms will be estimated. Simulation models imply that generally large data sets with total number of observations in the hundreds are necessary, but also that the optimal power is attained with a number of individuals to observations per individual ratio around 0.5 (e.g. 10 individuals with 20 observations each for a total of 200 observations, Martin et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b71" href="#b71">2011</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ‘choice’ of the environmental variable against which phenotypes are regressed can also severely affect conclusions about variation in individual reaction norms. If an environmental variable is chosen that is only weakly correlated to the true causal factor for within-individual variation, the degree of phenotypic plasticity will be underestimated. Since temperature is the primary environmental cue for plant phenology (e.g. Bradshaw and Holzapfel 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" href="#b11">2006</a>; Donnelly et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" href="#b26">2012</a>; Franks et al. this issue), it has been largely assumed that this should be also the case for the phenology of organisms at higher trophic levels, such as birds. However, it is now obvious that bird phenology depends on several cues that can be influenced by climate change (such as temperature) or not (such as photoperiod, Lambrechts et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b63" href="#b63">1997</a>) and that there is seldom an obvious measure of the climatic or weather conditions that causally affect a bird's phenological phenotype. In particular, although most birds breed earlier in warmer springs, there are a large number of possible measures of spring ‘warmness’. These will generally be correlated moderately or even (very) highly but which one is used as the environmental variable in a phenotypic plasticity analysis can strongly affect the results. For example, two studies analysed phenotypic plasticity in breeding time for the UK great tit population cited above, and depending on the period over which spring temperatures were averaged, individual variation in reaction norm slopes was present (Husby et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b51" href="#b51">2010</a>) or absent (Charmantier et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">2008</a>). Similarly, using very coarse-grained environmental variables which are probably only weakly correlated with the true causal factor will likely underestimate phenotypic plasticity and especially individual variation in reaction norms. This could be the case in Reed et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b98" href="#b98">2006</a>) study using the North-Atlantic-Oscillation Index, which summarizes climate variations across Western Europe and Eastern North America, in their analysis of breeding time in the common guillemot, 
   <span class="italic">Uria aalge</span> showing no individual variation in reaction norm slopes. A similar problem is likely also present in the study of Van Buskirk et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b119" href="#b119">2012</a>) which analysed spring arrival timing of 27 North American bird species. Individual phenotypic plasticity of spring arrival in response to temperatures could only explain 13–25% of the advancement in phenology observed over 46 years. However, if the temperature measure was ‘too coarse’ and hence an inappropriate environmental variable, individual plasticity estimates could be downwardly biased. Identifying the correct environmental variable is especially difficult in migratory species as they often cover large distances in little time and the most relevant spatial and temporal scales across which environmental variables affect timing of migration is unclear.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When fine-grained environmental variables are used in analyses of individual phenotypic plasticity for avian phenology, they are commonly daily mean temperatures averaged over certain fixed calendar dates, which limits the possibility to extrapolate to other systems. These fixed periods are identical in all years for a given population, for example, from 15 February to 25 April in Husby et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b51" href="#b51">2010</a>) for the UK great tit population, which means that the predictive value of this proxy will co-vary with the absolute phenological timing in birds. This can be especially problematic when temperatures averaged over fixed periods are used to forecast phenology outside the current temperature range. A solution to this is to model the daily probability that an individual will start breeding depending on the environmental conditions up until that day using survival models that allow for so-called time-dependent variables, such as, for example, the ‘proportional hazards model’ (Cox 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">1972</a>). This approach has so far been used to model phenotypic plasticity of timing of breeding, moult and migration in birds (Gienapp et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" href="#b33">2005</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" href="#b37">2010</a>; Bauer et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" href="#b4">2008</a>; van de Pol and Cockburn 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b120" href="#b120">2011</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another alternative to the use of average daily temperatures during fixed periods is the heat accumulation, that is, the temperature sums (in degree-days) above a threshold (e.g. 0°C) between a set start date (e.g. 1st January) and the phenological event of interest (e.g. Saino et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b106" href="#b106">2011</a>). If one were to apply this measure to an analysis of individual plasticity within populations, an interesting paradox may emerge where individual birds that are classically shown as being plastic in response to daily average temperatures would actually maintain the same relationship between their timing of breeding and the heat accumulation.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fine-grained population responses</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even if no individual data are available, a detailed analysis of phenotypic responses to the environment at the population level can contribute to disentangling plastic from genetic responses. While in most studies data on timing of breeding (e.g. date of egg-laying) can be linked to individuals because birds can often be caught at the nest, this information is often lacking in data on timing of migration because these data often consist more traditionally of counts of migrating birds at a given location. As pointed out by Merilä and Hendry (this issue) population mean reaction norms can be a first step to test for genetic change in a similar way to analyses of individual phenotypic plasticity. The rationale of this approach is that year-to-year fluctuations in mean population phenology are generally too fast to be interpreted as evolutionary responses to annually fluctuating selection pressures. As in an analysis of individual plasticity, there are some technical points to be taken into account. For example, it is of utmost important to de-trend both the observed phenotypes and the environmental variable prior to analysis (or to use formal time-series analyses). Otherwise, a correlation between mean phenology and the tested environmental variable can arise simply because both change in a similar fashion with time. If the observed advancement in phenology can be fully explained by a change in the environmental variable, plasticity becomes a strong candidate to explain the observed change, yet only an individual analysis as described above can conclude on the presence, strength and variation in individual plasticity.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The opposite case, that is, lack of correlation between annual environmental changes and annual changes in mean population, cannot be taken as unequivocal evidence for genetic change because there are several alternative explanations. First, as pointed out above, using an environmental variable that is only weakly correlated to the true causal factor as a covariate in phenotypic plasticity analyses will underestimate the degree of plasticity and give a downwardly biased slope of the reaction norm. This problem is especially prominent in studies of migration time as migrating individuals can quickly cover large geographical areas, which makes it difficult to identify a single meaningful environmental variable. Second, plastic phenotypes are likely to be affected by more than one factor. Avian breeding time, for example, is not only affected by weather but also by other intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as the individuals' age and condition (e.g. Komdeur 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b58" href="#b58">1996</a>; Gonzalez-Solis et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" href="#b41">2004</a>; McCleery et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b73" href="#b73">2008</a>). Such factors that are either unidentified or cannot be included in the analysis might explain the decoupling between mean phenotypic change and measured environmental change. These issues will also apply to analyses of individual plasticity but due to the different statistical models used they are generally expected to be less problematic, not in the least because the higher quality data of individual-based studies allow including additional factors such as age.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other approaches</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Merilä and Hendry (this issue) have listed other approaches that allow plasticity and microevolution to be disentangled as processes underlying the observed changes attributable to climate change, yet several of these are difficult if not impossible to implement when focusing on avian phenology. Laboratory studies on avian breeding time are possible and have been conducted in temperature- and/or photoperiod-controlled aviaries to identify environmental cues on the timing of egg-laying (Lambrechts et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b63" href="#b63">1997</a>; Visser 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b123" href="#b123">2008</a>), as well as underlying physiological pathways involved (Visser et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b126" href="#b126">2010</a>). However, using temperature effects from such laboratory experiments to make predictions about phenotypically plastic responses to temperature in the wild is problematic due to the highly artificial conditions in the laboratory, such as 
   <span class="italic">ad libitum</span> food or confinement stress. Studying true timing of migration in the laboratory is obviously impossible but proxies for this, for example migratory restlessness, have been used in artificial selection experiments in the blackcap 
   <span class="italic">Sylvia atricapilla,</span> providing important insight in the potential for adaptive evolution in the timing of autumn migration (Pulido et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b97" href="#b97">2001</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Common garden experiments are a powerful tool to test for genetic differentiation across space, and have, for example, been used in birds to test whether populations vary in their response to photoperiod (e.g. Berthold and Querner 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" href="#b6">1981</a>; Silverin et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b112" href="#b112">1993</a>; Lambrechts et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b63" href="#b63">1997</a>). While common garden experiments are in theory equally well suited to test for genetic differentiation across time, by repeatedly testing the same population, this either requires long-term studies started a long time ago, or if started now, considerable long-term planning and effort. Consequently, contrarily to other taxa reviewed in this special issue (see in particular Collins et al., 2013) very few studies have used this approach in birds to test for genetic changes over time (but see an example in Pulido and Berthold 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b96" href="#b96">2010</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most obvious and direct way to test for genetic change is to assess changes at the molecular genetic level. This however requires good knowledge of the molecular genetic architecture of the avian migration and breeding traits. Important progress has been made recently in understanding the molecular basis for the circadian clock regulating daily rhythms in invertebrates and vertebrates (including birds, see e.g. Johnsen et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b55" href="#b55">2007</a>). However, attempts to relate breeding phenology (Liedvogel and Sheldon 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b67" href="#b67">2010</a>; Caprioli et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" href="#b16">2012</a>; Liedvogel et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b68" href="#b68">2012</a>) or migration phenology (Dor et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" href="#b27">2011</a>; Mueller et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b79" href="#b79">2011</a>) to 
   <span class="italic">Clock gene</span> polymorphism or other candidate genes have so far yielded little. Undoubtedly, genomic approaches provide exciting opportunities to test for evolutionary responses of phenology to climate change, yet at present the lack of consistent relationships across species prevents any generalization. Note also that although identifying candidate genes may be the most direct route to documenting genetic change, it might not contribute to determining how much of the change in phenotype through time was the result of genetic change (Merilä &amp; Hendry, this issue).
