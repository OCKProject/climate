 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even if no individual data are available, a detailed analysis of phenotypic responses to the environment at the population level can contribute to disentangling plastic from genetic responses. While in most studies data on timing of breeding (e.g. date of egg-laying) can be linked to individuals because birds can often be caught at the nest, this information is often lacking in data on timing of migration because these data often consist more traditionally of counts of migrating birds at a given location. As pointed out by Meril√§ and Hendry (this issue) population mean reaction norms can be a first step to test for genetic change in a similar way to analyses of individual phenotypic plasticity. The rationale of this approach is that year-to-year fluctuations in mean population phenology are generally too fast to be interpreted as evolutionary responses to annually fluctuating selection pressures. As in an analysis of individual plasticity, there are some technical points to be taken into account. For example, it is of utmost important to de-trend both the observed phenotypes and the environmental variable prior to analysis (or to use formal time-series analyses). Otherwise, a correlation between mean phenology and the tested environmental variable can arise simply because both change in a similar fashion with time. If the observed advancement in phenology can be fully explained by a change in the environmental variable, plasticity becomes a strong candidate to explain the observed change, yet only an individual analysis as described above can conclude on the presence, strength and variation in individual plasticity.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The opposite case, that is, lack of correlation between annual environmental changes and annual changes in mean population, cannot be taken as unequivocal evidence for genetic change because there are several alternative explanations. First, as pointed out above, using an environmental variable that is only weakly correlated to the true causal factor as a covariate in phenotypic plasticity analyses will underestimate the degree of plasticity and give a downwardly biased slope of the reaction norm. This problem is especially prominent in studies of migration time as migrating individuals can quickly cover large geographical areas, which makes it difficult to identify a single meaningful environmental variable. Second, plastic phenotypes are likely to be affected by more than one factor. Avian breeding time, for example, is not only affected by weather but also by other intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as the individuals' age and condition (e.g. Komdeur

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" href="#b41">2004</a>; McCleery et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b73" href="#b73">2008</a>). Such factors that are either unidentified or cannot be included in the analysis might explain the decoupling between mean phenotypic change and measured environmental change. These issues will also apply to analyses of individual plasticity but due to the different statistical models used they are generally expected to be less problematic, not in the least because the higher quality data of individual-based studies allow including additional factors such as age.
