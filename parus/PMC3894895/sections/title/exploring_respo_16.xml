 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to their time-consuming nature, avian individual monitoring projects are often based on single study sites. However, the rare projects with comparisons across populations allow researchers to assess how generalizable single-population plasticity trends are (Porlier et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b87" href="#b87">2012</a>) but also to understand which factors drive differences in plasticity and evolution across a species range (Both et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" href="#b10">2006</a>). Since avian demographic responses to climate change are not uniform across species ranges (Jiguet et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b53" href="#b53">2010</a>) future studies should develop comparisons across the species thermal range. The study of populations at range-edge location may be of particular conservation value because they represent significant components of intraspecific biodiversity (Hardie and Hutchings 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b45" href="#b45">2010</a>) and potential sources of evolutionary innovation and persistence during rapid environmental change such as global warming (Sexton et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b109" href="#b109">2009</a>).
