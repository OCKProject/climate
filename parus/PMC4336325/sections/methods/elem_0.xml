 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More than half of France is covered by agricultural land, with regional differences in terms of agroecosystems. Croplands and grasslands represent respectively about 66% and 34% of the French agricultural area [
  <a rid="pone.0117850.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref044">44</a>]. We used a typology of the major French agroecosystems (
  <a rid="pone.0117850.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0117850.g001">Fig. 1a</a>.), classified based on their structural and dynamic similarities, as reported by AND International [
  <a rid="pone.0117850.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref045">45</a>]. Agroecosystems are defined at the scale of Small Agricultural Regions (SAR), by the main use of the Utilized Agricultural Area (UAA) and the technical and economic orientations of farms. France is divided into 713 SAR according to homogeneous agricultural activities and practices, which range from 11 to 4413 km² (National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies, INSEE; 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.insee.fr" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.insee.fr</span>). The consistency of these territorial entities at both agro-ecological and economic levels makes them particularly well-suited for our statistical analyses and projected modeling [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used bird data from the French Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), a standardized monitoring program in which skilled volunteer ornithologists identify breeding birds by song or visual contact in spring [
   <a rid="pone.0117850.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref047">47</a>]. Each observer provides the name of a locality, and a 2 x 2 km square to be surveyed is randomly selected within a 10 km radius of this location (i.e. among 80 possible plots). Random selection ensures that surveyed habitats closely match the actual distribution of available habitats in France. In each square, the observer performs 10 point counts, 5 minutes each, separated by at least 300 m twice per spring with 4 to 6 weeks between observation sessions. Counts are repeated annually by the same observer at the same points, at approximately the same date (±7 days from April to mid-June) and the same time of day (±15 minutes). Among the common breeding species monitored by the scheme, we focused on those 34 species (
   <a rid="pone.0117850.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0117850.t001">Table 1</a>) classified as farmland specialists and habitat generalists [see 
   <a rid="pone.0117850.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref048">48</a>]. We considered BBS squares that were surveyed at least once between 2001 and 2009 and that included at least 5 of the 10 points located within farmland habitats, according to the habitat noted by the observers in the field [
   <a rid="pone.0117850.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref048">48</a>]. For a given point, the maximum count of the two annual visits is retained as the yearly relative abundance, except for three migrant species meadow pipit 
   <span class="italic">Anthus pratensis</span>, yellow wagtail 
   <span class="italic">Motacilla flava</span> and whinchat 
   <span class="italic">Saxicola rubetra</span>: for these species only counts from the second session were considered given that until early May there are still numerous migrating individuals on the move or late wintering birds (for meadow pipit). The species local relative abundances at the SAR level were obtained by summing the relative abundance of the points in each SAR, each year. The numbers of point counts made per SAR were incorporated into the analyses to account for differences in the regional sampling rate.

This flowchart shows how the different environmental drivers, and associated projections (P) derived from various scenarios (Sc), were integrated in our analysis through different methodological tools (M). We used existing scenarios (IPCC-SRES) to derive projections of future climate and land use, while we developed the farmland cover scenarios on the basis of expert judgment to derive projections of future land cover. The regional projections of the three main drivers were then integrated as predictors in a habitat model to forecast changes in breeding bird abundances within French agricultural regions.</p>

   <a rid="pone.0117850.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0117850.g002">Fig. 2</a>), relating presence—absence data to climatic variables across the species’ distribution. The presence-absence data-over the Western Palearctic- were obtained by geo-referencing and digitizing maps from the handbooks of the Birds of the Western Palearctic 2006 [
   <a rid="pone.0117850.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref049">49</a>]. The spatial resolution of presence/absence data was 0.5°. Temperature and precipitation are expected to impose direct or indirect constraints on bird distributions [

   <a rid="pone.0117850.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref052">52</a>]. So we used the following eight climatic variables in the niche models: (1) annual mean temperature; (2) mean temperature of the warmest month; (3) mean temperature of the coldest month; (4) temperature seasonality; (5) annual precipitation; (6) precipitation of the wettest month; (7) precipitation of the driest month; and (8) precipitation seasonality [
   <a rid="pone.0117850.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref028">28</a>]. The seasonality is the coefficient of variation of the monthly means. These variables were derived from the monthly mean temperatures and precipitation over the intervals 1961–1990 for the current climatic conditions (

Future climate projections for 2050 were derived from five general circulation models (BCM2, ECHAM5, HADCM3, MIROHIC3_2-HI, and MK3) and three different emission scenarios (SRES: A1B, B1, and A2, when available; Sc1 in 
   <a rid="pone.0117850.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0117850.g002">Fig. 2</a>). Because the future predictions were only available at a rough resolution, they were downscaled to the 0.5° resolution (following the method described in

To model species distributions, we used seven different modeling techniques implemented within the BIOMOD package [
   <a rid="pone.0117850.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref053">53</a>] in R: three regression methods (GLM, Generalized Linear Models; GAM, Generalized Additive Models, and MARS, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines), a recursive partitioning method (CTA, Classification Tree Analysis), and three machine-learning methods (ANN, Artificial Neural Networks; GBM, Generalized Boosted Models, and RF, Random Forests). In order to evaluate the predictive performance of the SDMs for each species, we used a random subset of 70% of the data to calibrate the model, and then used the remaining 30% for evaluation, using a threshold-independent method, the area under the relative operating characteristic curve (AUC) [
   <a rid="pone.0117850.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref054">54</a>]. The data subsetting approach was replicated five times and was the basis for calculating the mean AUC of the cross-validation (see 
   <a rid="pone.0117850.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0117850.s002">S1 Table</a>). The projections we used were obtained from models that used 100% of the available data. An ensemble forecast technique was then used to account for variability among distribution modeling techniques and climate models, in order to obtain the central tendency [

   <a rid="pone.0117850.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref055">55</a>]. Current and future consensus distributions were obtained by calculating the weighted mean distributions across SDMs (and the mean across GCMs and SREs): the seven models were ranked according to their predictive performance, and a decay of 1.6 gave the relative importance of the weight, producing respective weights of 0.38, 0.24, 0.15, 0.09, 0.06, 0.04, and 0.02 [

The outputs of these models, thereafter referred to as climatic suitability, are estimates of the probability of presence of a species given the climatic conditions at a 0.5° (50 x 50km) spatial resolution. From the modelled distributions, climatic suitability values were first extracted using a GIS (ArcGIS 9.3) by overlapping grid cells and SAR, and then averaged in each SAR weighted by the proportion of SAR included in grid cells.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We estimated the proportion of farmland habitats (P2 in 
   <a rid="pone.0117850.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0117850.g002">Fig. 2</a>) as the percentage of land area within each SAR covered by (1) herbaceous or cultivated pasture, (2) cultivated and managed areas and (3) mosaic cropland/natural vegetation. These land use variables were derived from 19 land cover types available in the IMAGE 2.4 model (M2 in

   <a rid="pone.0117850.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref040">40</a>]. The IMAGE 2.4 model is an Earth system model that includes the major feedback mechanisms in the biophysical system. It assumes population and macro-economy as key drivers to establish physical indicators for both the energy/industry system and the agriculture/land-use system for assessment of changes in land cover [
   <a rid="pone.0117850.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref040">40</a>]. This model is developed at a 0.5° resolution grid for all decades since 1960. To be consistent with current climatic variables, we used the average of the variables from 1960 to 1990 to obtain the current proportion of farmland habitats. Although land uses can have changed since this period, we expected the percentage covered by farmland to remain nearly the same, with land use changes at such large spatial scale happening slower than land cover data. Future land cover projections (for 2050) were obtained from the three SRES scenarios, A1B, A2, and B1 of the IMAGE 2.4 model [
   <a rid="pone.0117850.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref040">40</a>]. The future proportion of farmland habitats was obtained by averaging projected proportions from the three SRES scenarios. We downscaled those data at the scale of each SAR (
   <a rid="pone.0117850.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0117850.s001">S1 Fig</a>.), similarly to climatic suitability.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We considered a 0.5° resolution (~50x50km scale) for both climate and land use data and associated projections (no scenarios were available for these drivers at a finer spatial scale). However, we considered land cover scenarios and bird abundances at the PRA scale—because they are more tightly linked to local conditions in their realization of abundance. At the scale of the PRA, we considered a homogeneous realization of the scenario, with an average effect on bird populations.</p>

   <a rid="pone.0117850.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0117850.g002">Fig. 2</a>) are based on potential realistic land cover changes in the agricultural area within each region (SAR), i.e. changes in livestock farming and cropping patterns between 2000 (the base year for agricultural data) and 2050 (time horizon considered for each scenario). Changes in livestock farming and cropping patterns were here defined as changes in the share (%) of different crop and grassland categories (hereafter broadly referred as crops) within the UAA. Data used to develop farmland cover scenarios came from the national 2000 General Agricultural Census that recorded crop and grassland areas at the municipality scale (
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.agreste.agriculture.gouv.fr" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.agreste.agriculture.gouv.fr</span>). Data were aggregated and converted to the proportion of the UAA occupied within each SAR. We considered the following nine crops: permanent grassland, temporary grassland, cereals, grain maize, rapeseed, sunflower, corn fodder, proteaginous (peas, broad beans, lupine, etc.) and forage crops (sorghum, alfalfa, white clover, etc.). In a first step, we defined changes in main agroecosystems within SAR according to each scenario (
   <a rid="pone.0117850.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0117850.g001">Fig. 1</a>; see 
   <a rid="pone.0117850.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0117850.s012">S1 Text</a> for more details). In a second step, we estimated the variations in the proportions of crops within each SAR linked to the changes in the main agroecosystem. For each scenario, we calculated changes in proportions of crops using an optimization method (M3 in 
   <a rid="pone.0117850.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0117850.g002">Fig. 2</a>) taking various constraints into account (see

   <a rid="pone.0117850.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0117850.s005">S4</a> Tables). The resulting future crop proportions (P3 in 
   <a rid="pone.0117850.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0117850.g002">Fig. 2</a>) were then used to predict the impacts of the different scenarios on breeding bird abundances. National changes in crop proportions according to each farmland cover scenarios are given in 
   <a rid="pone.0117850.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0117850.s006">S5 Table</a>. Management practices (e.g. fertilizer input, yields, etc.) in the different crops were implicitly considered as it is dependent on the land cover scenario we applied. Indeed, as we did not have access to a regional scale product of sufficient resolution across the whole country, we did not integrate these practices in the models, making the assumption that our results are valid if the practices do not change between the current and the future.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We developed four future scenarios, namely 
   <span class="italic">‘status quo’</span>, 
   <span class="italic">‘biofuel’</span>, 
   <span class="italic">‘livestock extensification’</span> and 
   <span class="italic">‘extensification’</span>. The 
   <span class="italic">‘status quo’</span> scenario is considered as the reference case. Extensification means a strategy of reducing production costs or inputs leading to a reduction in output for an equivalent surface. The 
   <span class="italic">‘livestock extensification’</span> and 
   <span class="italic">‘extensification’</span> scenarios both promote the development of more extensive production systems—on livestock farming systems and both livestock farming and cropping systems, respectively—through appropriate changes in farmland cover (i.e. changes in proportions of crops). We chose these scenarios as a result from an analysis of documents submitted in support of the European Commission proposals for the CAP 2013–2020 [
   <a rid="pone.0117850.ref058" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref058">58</a>] and of case study documents [
   <a rid="pone.0117850.ref059" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref059">59</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0117850.ref060" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref060">60</a>]. They correspond to different combinations of market trends and agricultural policies, not explicitly described in this paper. Two of them (
   <span class="italic">‘biofuel’</span> and 
   <span class="italic">‘extensification’</span>) were done at two levels of implementation: national and regional. A national level means a spatially homogeneous policy implementation in all agricultural regions, regardless the type of their agro-ecosystem. Conversely, a regional level of implementation leads to spatially heterogeneous policies in the SAR, often ending in a specialization of agricultural territories. To account for these patterns, we thus developed six scenarios of farmland cover changes to further predict the potential impact of the evolution of agriculture on farmland birds: 
   <div list-type="bullet" class="list">
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>A 
      <span class="italic">‘status quo’</span> scenario, in which the percentage of grasslands continues to decrease in cover nationally, especially permanent grasslands, due to agricultural abandonment, overall intensification, and plowing up of pastures within farms. The dominance of cereals persists and the phenomenon of “grain-fed livestock” noted in the last 20 years, continues to increase at the expense of grass and other forage crops.
     </p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>A 
      <span class="italic">‘national biofuel’</span> scenario, which promotes the development of crops used for the production of biofuels based on a national policy implementation. In this scenario, we applied a national pattern of intensification typically associated with the development of bioenergy. This corresponds to an increase of cereal—oleaginous—proteaginous crops (COP) in most SAR, often at the expense of grasslands and forage crops.
     </p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>A 
      <span class="italic">‘regional biofuel’</span> scenario, with similar objectives and changes as in the preceding but based on a regional policy implementation. In this scenario, the increase in COP areas within arable areas (including mixed-farming areas) is balanced by an extensification in livestock areas mainly driven by the implementation of an extensive management of grasslands.
     </p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>A 
      <span class="italic">‘livestock extensification’</span> scenario, which promotes the extensification in livestock and mixed-farming areas, mainly by increasing grasslands and reducing forage maize, and status quo in arable areas (i.e. mimicking current cropping patterns).
     </p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>A 
      <span class="italic">‘national extensification’</span> scenario, which promotes the overall extensification in all French agricultural regions following a same national political framework. It first imposes a fixed minimum proportion of grasslands throughout the country. This increase in grasslands is balanced according to agricultural characteristics of each agro-ecosystem. Indeed, in livestock areas and mixed-farming areas it mimics a change in the implementation of agri-environmental schemes related to the development of sustainable practices such as an increase in pasture cover and a more extensive management of grasslands, accompanied by a decrease of forage crops (including maize). In arable areas, it corresponds to an overall decrease of COP to ensure a minimum of 5% of permanent grasslands, and also to a better balance of rotations with an introduction of proteaginous or “new” crops.
     </p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>A 
      <span class="italic">‘regional extensification’</span> scenario: extensification with a regional level of policy implementation. In arable and mixed-farming areas, it corresponds to an extensification of agricultural practices, resulting in an increase of area proportions dedicated to arable crops at the expense of grasslands. This is accompanied by a better balance of crop rotations and diversification of cropping systems (the primary crop should not exceed 45% of the agricultural area). The reduction of grasslands in arable and mixed-farming areas is partly offset by an extensification in grassland areas (i.e. livestock areas), corresponding to an increase of permanent grasslands surfaces at the expense of all other crops.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We evaluated the response of bird populations to the different farmland cover scenarios combined with changes in proportion of farmland habitats (land use change impact) and climatic suitability (climate change impact). With this aim, we tested several combinations of environmental changes. These were: (i) climate change only; (ii) changes in proportion of farmland habitats only; (iii) farmland cover scenarios only and (iv) farmland cover scenarios combined with only changes in proportion of farmland habitats (i.e. without climate change). All variables were included in these successive models, however all variables except those of interest (i.e., climate, proportion of farmland habitats, farmland cover or both farmland cover and proportion of farmland habitats) were kept at their current values. In order to focus on specific effects of agricultural changes on compare the different farmland cover scenarios, we further standardized the climate effect.</p>

To this purpose, we used generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) assuming a Poisson distribution of the data with a log link function. The abundance was considered as the dependent variable, whereas the climatic suitability, the proportion of farmland habitats and the nine crop proportions (permanent grassland, temporary grassland, cereals, grain maize, rapeseed, sunflower, corn fodder, proteaginous and forage crops) were defined as fixed effects. The number of farmland count points in the SAR was integrated as a covariate to account for the varying sampling effort (between SAR and between years within SAR).

   <a rid="pone.0117850.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0117850.s013">S2 Text</a> for further details). Overdispersion was calculated following the methods in Harding &amp; Hilbe [
   <a rid="pone.0117850.ref063" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref063">63</a>] for each species data set. We first measured the model fit by assessing the ‘variance explained’ by the GLMM model for each species using the method from Nakagawa &amp; Schielzeth [
   <a rid="pone.0117850.ref064" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref064">64</a>] to estimate R² for mixed-effects models. We also used the predictions derived from the GLMM models, based on half of the regional data (training data), to assess the predictive power of the models when applied to the other half (test data). The predictive power of the models was determined by plotting the predicted relative abundance for test data (according to the model calibrated with the training data) of each species against the observed relative abundance of each species per SAR per year, and then fitting a regression line with an intercept of zero and a slope of 1 (i.e., y = x), from which an

   </span> value was calculated. We did this for each of the 34 bird species.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model calibration was performed using test data representing only half of the regional data gathered to explain the relative abundances of the other half of sampled regions. We then derived a prediction of the current regional abundance of each bird species as a baseline for assessing the effect of the different scenarios, from the estimates of the model outputs using full datasets. Indeed, once the estimates of the coefficients were obtained for each predictor, we calculated the predicted current (RAcurrent) and future (RAfuture) regional abundances (log scale) using respectively current and projected values of climatic suitability, proportions of farmland habitats and crop proportions, from the set of models described above. After back-transformation, we calculated changes in a species regional abundance RA as: [RAfuture—RAcurrent]/[(RAcurrent + RAfuture)/2] [

   <a rid="pone.0117850.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0117850.s014">S3 Text</a>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, we examined differences between responses (mean changes in abundance) to farmland cover scenarios, and if they were related to species habitat specialization (farmland specialist vs. generalist). The latter was defined following Julliard et al. [
   <a rid="pone.0117850.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref048">48</a>] who quantified specialization of a given species by calculating the variation in its density among various habitat classes (provided by BBS observers). We further explored potential relationship between farmland specialists’ responses and their main habitat of specialization: grassland, cropland and mixed grass/crop lands. Based on Julliard et al. (2006) methodology, main habitat of farmland specialists was determined with the calculation of a species specialization index for grasslands (SSIg). The SSIg was computed as a weighted mean of species abundance among four sub-habitats of the farmland habitat: unimproved grasslands, improved grasslands, mixed grass/crop lands and croplands, weighting coefficient of these sub-habitat being 4, 3, 2 and 1, respectively. Species with highest SSIg values (SSIg &gt; 2.2) were considered as grassland birds, while species with lowest SSIg values (SSIg &lt; 1.8) were considered as cropland birds; remaining intermediate species were considered as mixed habitat farmland species (see 
   <a rid="pone.0117850.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0117850.t001">Table 1</a>). We used one sample Student’s t-tests to check if mean changes in abundance in response to farmland cover scenario were significantly different from the null hypothesis (i.e. mu = 0). Because all SAR differ in area and number of count points, changes in regional abundance were weighted by the ratio of the area of corresponding SAR on the number of count points in all analyses in order to obtain comparable measures across SARs. Standard deviations associated with weighted mean changes were computed following Cochran’s 1977 definition [
   <a rid="pone.0117850.ref066" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref066">66</a>]. We finally performed Tukey HSD (Honestly Significant Difference) tests, a single-step multiple comparison procedure, to check whether the mean changes in abundance, for each ‘farmland cover’ scenario and group of species with different SSI, were significantly different from each other. We performed all our statistical analyses using R [
   <a rid="pone.0117850.ref067" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref067">67</a>] and used ‘nlme’ package for mixed models [
