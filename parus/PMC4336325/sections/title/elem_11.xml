 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most of the predictive models fitted well to the data (averaged 
  <span class="italic">R²</span> across species was 61.5% ± 9.7). The model performed best for the Skylark (R² = 84%), while it had the lowest performance for the Grey Partridge (R² = 38%). Nevertheless, the correlations between the predicted and observed species abundances were significant for all species (results not shown). Our results show that the climatic scenario is expected to lead to more negative effects on bird abundances than under the land-use scenarios considered (see 
  <a rid="pone.0117850.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0117850.t002">Table 2</a>). However, the predicted mean changes in abundance of bird populations are lower when land use and farmland cover changes are added to climate changes than when climate change is considered solely (
  <a rid="pone.0117850.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0117850.t002">Table 2</a>). Although the average response of bird abundance over all farmland cover scenarios (combined to land use and climate changes) may not be significantly different from the mean response to the climate change only scenario (
  <a rid="pone.0117850.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0117850.t002">Table 2</a>), the 
  <a rid="pone.0117850.g003" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0117850.g003">Fig. 3a</a>. illustrates that most of the farmland cover scenarios, except the ‘status quo’ and the ‘global biofuel’, can mitigate the impact of climate change on the overall bird populations (the zero-line on the graph). Changes in farmland area—a nationwide 4% decrease—also lead to negative mean changes in abundance of bird population, but less severe than climate. The mean changes in bird population sizes vary significantly according to the farmland cover scenario considered (
  <a rid="pone.0117850.g003" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0117850.g003">Fig. 3a</a>) and according to species (
  <a rid="pone.0117850.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0117850.s007">S6 Table</a>). The 
  <span class="italic">‘status quo’</span> scenario has a significant negative impact (
  <span class="italic">t</span> = -3.66, 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-value &lt;0.001), relative to all other scenarios that have positive or null (for the 
  <span class="italic">‘global biofuel’</span> scenario) predicted impacts on bird populations. The mean changes in bird abundance are predicted to be the most positive with the three extensification scenarios (
  <a rid="pone.0117850.g003" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0117850.g003">Fig. 3a</a>; see 
  <a rid="pone.0117850.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0117850.s008">S7 Table</a> for significance), especially the 
  <span class="italic">‘livestock extensification’</span> scenario (
  <span class="italic">t</span> = 10.25, 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-value &lt;0.001), but we find no significant difference between these different scenarios of agricultural extensification (
