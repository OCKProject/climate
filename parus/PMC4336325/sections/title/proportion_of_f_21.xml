 <div class="title">Proportion of farmland habitats within each small agricultural region (SAR).</div>
 <p>(A) Current and (B) future distribution of farmland habitats in France. These values were derived from the IMAGE 2.4 model developed at a 0.5Â° resolution grid and were downscaled at the scale of each SAR. Regional proportion of farmland habitats were calculated as the percentage of land area covered by: herbaceous or cultivated pasture, cultivated and managed areas, and mosaic cropland/natural vegetation. Future proportion of farmland habitats (for 2050) were obtained by averaging projected proportions from the three SRES scenarios, A1B, A2, and B1 of the IMAGE 2.4 model.</p>
