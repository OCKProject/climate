 <div class="title">Predicted responses of bird populations to each farmland cover scenario.</div>
 <p>Mean (± SD) changes in regional abundance of A) all bird populations, B) farmland and generalist bird populations and C) grassland, cropland and mixed (grassland/cropland) bird populations according to each scenario of farmland cover changes (all combined to climate and land use change scenarios). Mean population changes correspond to the average of the changes in species regional abundance weighted by the ratio of the area of corresponding region (SAR) on the number of count points (see 
  <a rid="sec002" ref-type="sec" href="#sec002">Methods</a>). Mean population change under climate change alone constitutes the baseline reference and was fixed to 0. Significance of responses (from Student t-test) and significant differences between scenarios for each group of species (from Tukey HSD test) are given in
