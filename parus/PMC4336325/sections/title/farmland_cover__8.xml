 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Farmland cover scenarios (Sc2 in 
  <a rid="pone.0117850.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0117850.g002">Fig. 2</a>) are based on potential realistic land cover changes in the agricultural area within each region (SAR), i.e. changes in livestock farming and cropping patterns between 2000 (the base year for agricultural data) and 2050 (time horizon considered for each scenario). Changes in livestock farming and cropping patterns were here defined as changes in the share (%) of different crop and grassland categories (hereafter broadly referred as crops) within the UAA. Data used to develop farmland cover scenarios came from the national 2000 General Agricultural Census that recorded crop and grassland areas at the municipality scale (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.agreste.agriculture.gouv.fr" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.agreste.agriculture.gouv.fr</span>). Data were aggregated and converted to the proportion of the UAA occupied within each SAR. We considered the following nine crops: permanent grassland, temporary grassland, cereals, grain maize, rapeseed, sunflower, corn fodder, proteaginous (peas, broad beans, lupine, etc.) and forage crops (sorghum, alfalfa, white clover, etc.). In a first step, we defined changes in main agroecosystems within SAR according to each scenario (
  <a rid="pone.0117850.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0117850.g001">Fig. 1</a>; see 
  <a rid="pone.0117850.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0117850.s012">S1 Text</a> for more details). In a second step, we estimated the variations in the proportions of crops within each SAR linked to the changes in the main agroecosystem. For each scenario, we calculated changes in proportions of crops using an optimization method (M3 in 
  <a rid="pone.0117850.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0117850.g002">Fig. 2</a>) taking various constraints into account (see 
  <a rid="pone.0117850.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0117850.s012">S1 Text</a> and 
  <a rid="pone.0117850.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0117850.s004">S3</a> and 
  <a rid="pone.0117850.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0117850.s005">S4</a> Tables). The resulting future crop proportions (P3 in 
  <a rid="pone.0117850.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0117850.g002">Fig. 2</a>) were then used to predict the impacts of the different scenarios on breeding bird abundances. National changes in crop proportions according to each farmland cover scenarios are given in 
  <a rid="pone.0117850.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0117850.s006">S5 Table</a>. Management practices (e.g. fertilizer input, yields, etc.) in the different crops were implicitly considered as it is dependent on the land cover scenario we applied. Indeed, as we did not have access to a regional scale product of sufficient resolution across the whole country, we did not integrate these practices in the models, making the assumption that our results are valid if the practices do not change between the current and the future.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We developed four future scenarios, namely 
  <span class="italic">‘status quo’</span>, 
  <span class="italic">‘biofuel’</span>, 
  <span class="italic">‘livestock extensification’</span> and 
  <span class="italic">‘extensification’</span>. The 
  <span class="italic">‘status quo’</span> scenario is considered as the reference case. Extensification means a strategy of reducing production costs or inputs leading to a reduction in output for an equivalent surface. The 
  <span class="italic">‘livestock extensification’</span> and 
  <span class="italic">‘extensification’</span> scenarios both promote the development of more extensive production systems—on livestock farming systems and both livestock farming and cropping systems, respectively—through appropriate changes in farmland cover (i.e. changes in proportions of crops). We chose these scenarios as a result from an analysis of documents submitted in support of the European Commission proposals for the CAP 2013–2020 [
  <a rid="pone.0117850.ref058" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref058">58</a>] and of case study documents [
  <a rid="pone.0117850.ref059" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref059">59</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0117850.ref060" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref060">60</a>]. They correspond to different combinations of market trends and agricultural policies, not explicitly described in this paper. Two of them (
  <span class="italic">‘biofuel’</span> and 
  <span class="italic">‘extensification’</span>) were done at two levels of implementation: national and regional. A national level means a spatially homogeneous policy implementation in all agricultural regions, regardless the type of their agro-ecosystem. Conversely, a regional level of implementation leads to spatially heterogeneous policies in the SAR, often ending in a specialization of agricultural territories. To account for these patterns, we thus developed six scenarios of farmland cover changes to further predict the potential impact of the evolution of agriculture on farmland birds: 
  <div list-type="bullet" class="list">
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>A 
     <span class="italic">‘status quo’</span> scenario, in which the percentage of grasslands continues to decrease in cover nationally, especially permanent grasslands, due to agricultural abandonment, overall intensification, and plowing up of pastures within farms. The dominance of cereals persists and the phenomenon of “grain-fed livestock” noted in the last 20 years, continues to increase at the expense of grass and other forage crops.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>A 
     <span class="italic">‘national biofuel’</span> scenario, which promotes the development of crops used for the production of biofuels based on a national policy implementation. In this scenario, we applied a national pattern of intensification typically associated with the development of bioenergy. This corresponds to an increase of cereal—oleaginous—proteaginous crops (COP) in most SAR, often at the expense of grasslands and forage crops.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>A 
     <span class="italic">‘regional biofuel’</span> scenario, with similar objectives and changes as in the preceding but based on a regional policy implementation. In this scenario, the increase in COP areas within arable areas (including mixed-farming areas) is balanced by an extensification in livestock areas mainly driven by the implementation of an extensive management of grasslands.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>A 
     <span class="italic">‘livestock extensification’</span> scenario, which promotes the extensification in livestock and mixed-farming areas, mainly by increasing grasslands and reducing forage maize, and status quo in arable areas (i.e. mimicking current cropping patterns).
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>A 
     <span class="italic">‘national extensification’</span> scenario, which promotes the overall extensification in all French agricultural regions following a same national political framework. It first imposes a fixed minimum proportion of grasslands throughout the country. This increase in grasslands is balanced according to agricultural characteristics of each agro-ecosystem. Indeed, in livestock areas and mixed-farming areas it mimics a change in the implementation of agri-environmental schemes related to the development of sustainable practices such as an increase in pasture cover and a more extensive management of grasslands, accompanied by a decrease of forage crops (including maize). In arable areas, it corresponds to an overall decrease of COP to ensure a minimum of 5% of permanent grasslands, and also to a better balance of rotations with an introduction of proteaginous or “new” crops.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>A 
     <span class="italic">‘regional extensification’</span> scenario: extensification with a regional level of policy implementation. In arable and mixed-farming areas, it corresponds to an extensification of agricultural practices, resulting in an increase of area proportions dedicated to arable crops at the expense of grasslands. This is accompanied by a better balance of crop rotations and diversification of cropping systems (the primary crop should not exceed 45% of the agricultural area). The reduction of grasslands in arable and mixed-farming areas is partly offset by an extensification in grassland areas (i.e. livestock areas), corresponding to an increase of permanent grasslands surfaces at the expense of all other crops.
