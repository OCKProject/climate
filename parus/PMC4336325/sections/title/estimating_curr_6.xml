 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Values of current (1961–1990 time period) and future (2050) climatic suitability (P1 in 
  <a rid="pone.0117850.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0117850.g002">Fig. 2</a>) of a species across its whole range were obtained through species distribution modeling techniques (M1 in 
  <a rid="pone.0117850.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0117850.g002">Fig. 2</a>), relating presence—absence data to climatic variables across the species’ distribution. The presence-absence data-over the Western Palearctic- were obtained by geo-referencing and digitizing maps from the handbooks of the Birds of the Western Palearctic 2006 [
  <a rid="pone.0117850.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref049">49</a>]. The spatial resolution of presence/absence data was 0.5°. Temperature and precipitation are expected to impose direct or indirect constraints on bird distributions [

  <a rid="pone.0117850.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref052">52</a>]. So we used the following eight climatic variables in the niche models: (1) annual mean temperature; (2) mean temperature of the warmest month; (3) mean temperature of the coldest month; (4) temperature seasonality; (5) annual precipitation; (6) precipitation of the wettest month; (7) precipitation of the driest month; and (8) precipitation seasonality [
  <a rid="pone.0117850.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref028">28</a>]. The seasonality is the coefficient of variation of the monthly means. These variables were derived from the monthly mean temperatures and precipitation over the intervals 1961–1990 for the current climatic conditions (

Future climate projections for 2050 were derived from five general circulation models (BCM2, ECHAM5, HADCM3, MIROHIC3_2-HI, and MK3) and three different emission scenarios (SRES: A1B, B1, and A2, when available; Sc1 in 
  <a rid="pone.0117850.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0117850.g002">Fig. 2</a>). Because the future predictions were only available at a rough resolution, they were downscaled to the 0.5° resolution (following the method described in 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.worldclim.org/downscaling" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.worldclim.org/downscaling</span>). To model species distributions, we used seven different modeling techniques implemented within the BIOMOD package [
  <a rid="pone.0117850.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref053">53</a>] in R: three regression methods (GLM, Generalized Linear Models; GAM, Generalized Additive Models, and MARS, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines), a recursive partitioning method (CTA, Classification Tree Analysis), and three machine-learning methods (ANN, Artificial Neural Networks; GBM, Generalized Boosted Models, and RF, Random Forests). In order to evaluate the predictive performance of the SDMs for each species, we used a random subset of 70% of the data to calibrate the model, and then used the remaining 30% for evaluation, using a threshold-independent method, the area under the relative operating characteristic curve (AUC) [
  <a rid="pone.0117850.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref054">54</a>]. The data subsetting approach was replicated five times and was the basis for calculating the mean AUC of the cross-validation (see 
  <a rid="pone.0117850.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0117850.s002">S1 Table</a>). The projections we used were obtained from models that used 100% of the available data. An ensemble forecast technique was then used to account for variability among distribution modeling techniques and climate models, in order to obtain the central tendency [

  <a rid="pone.0117850.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref055">55</a>]. Current and future consensus distributions were obtained by calculating the weighted mean distributions across SDMs (and the mean across GCMs and SREs): the seven models were ranked according to their predictive performance, and a decay of 1.6 gave the relative importance of the weight, producing respective weights of 0.38, 0.24, 0.15, 0.09, 0.06, 0.04, and 0.02 [

  <a rid="pone.0117850.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref057">57</a>]. The outputs of these models, thereafter referred to as climatic suitability, are estimates of the probability of presence of a species given the climatic conditions at a 0.5° (50 x 50km) spatial resolution. From the modelled distributions, climatic suitability values were first extracted using a GIS (ArcGIS 9.3) by overlapping grid cells and SAR, and then averaged in each SAR weighted by the proportion of SAR included in grid cells.
