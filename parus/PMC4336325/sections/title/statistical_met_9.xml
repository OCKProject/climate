 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We evaluated the response of bird populations to the different farmland cover scenarios combined with changes in proportion of farmland habitats (land use change impact) and climatic suitability (climate change impact). With this aim, we tested several combinations of environmental changes. These were: (i) climate change only; (ii) changes in proportion of farmland habitats only; (iii) farmland cover scenarios only and (iv) farmland cover scenarios combined with only changes in proportion of farmland habitats (i.e. without climate change). All variables were included in these successive models, however all variables except those of interest (i.e., climate, proportion of farmland habitats, farmland cover or both farmland cover and proportion of farmland habitats) were kept at their current values. In order to focus on specific effects of agricultural changes on compare the different farmland cover scenarios, we further standardized the climate effect.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a first step, we developed a calibration model, based on a habitat association model (M4 in 
  <a rid="pone.0117850.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0117850.g002">Fig. 2</a>), to estimate the variations in regional relative species abundances according to the proportions of farmland habitat and farmland cover (i.e. crops), and their climatic suitability in each SAR. To this purpose, we used generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) assuming a Poisson distribution of the data with a log link function. The abundance was considered as the dependent variable, whereas the climatic suitability, the proportion of farmland habitats and the nine crop proportions (permanent grassland, temporary grassland, cereals, grain maize, rapeseed, sunflower, corn fodder, proteaginous and forage crops) were defined as fixed effects. The number of farmland count points in the SAR was integrated as a covariate to account for the varying sampling effort (between SAR and between years within SAR). The fixed-effect structure is as follows:

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Independently of the observation effort, counts were suspected not to be independent according to the SAR and the year they were carried out. Therefore, these two variables (‘SAR’ and ‘Year’) were specified as random effects in the model. There were signs of overdispersion for several species, so we added an observation-level random effect to the corresponding species models [
  <a rid="pone.0117850.ref061" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref061">61</a>]. Fitting a log-normal Poisson model (with “observational level random effects") is one of the most common alternatives to deal with overdispersion [
  <a rid="pone.0117850.ref062" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref062">62</a>] (see 
  <a rid="pone.0117850.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0117850.s013">S2 Text</a> for further details). Overdispersion was calculated following the methods in Harding &amp; Hilbe [
  <a rid="pone.0117850.ref063" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref063">63</a>] for each species data set. We first measured the model fit by assessing the ‘variance explained’ by the GLMM model for each species using the method from Nakagawa &amp; Schielzeth [
  <a rid="pone.0117850.ref064" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref064">64</a>] to estimate R² for mixed-effects models. We also used the predictions derived from the GLMM models, based on half of the regional data (training data), to assess the predictive power of the models when applied to the other half (test data). The predictive power of the models was determined by plotting the predicted relative abundance for test data (according to the model calibrated with the training data) of each species against the observed relative abundance of each species per SAR per year, and then fitting a regression line with an intercept of zero and a slope of 1 (i.e., y = x), from which an 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </span> value was calculated. We did this for each of the 34 bird species.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model calibration was performed using test data representing only half of the regional data gathered to explain the relative abundances of the other half of sampled regions. We then derived a prediction of the current regional abundance of each bird species as a baseline for assessing the effect of the different scenarios, from the estimates of the model outputs using full datasets. Indeed, once the estimates of the coefficients were obtained for each predictor, we calculated the predicted current (RAcurrent) and future (RAfuture) regional abundances (log scale) using respectively current and projected values of climatic suitability, proportions of farmland habitats and crop proportions, from the set of models described above. After back-transformation, we calculated changes in a species regional abundance RA as: [RAfuture—RAcurrent]/[(RAcurrent + RAfuture)/2] [
  <a rid="pone.0117850.ref065" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref065">65</a>] (see details in 
  <a rid="pone.0117850.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0117850.s014">S3 Text</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, we examined differences between responses (mean changes in abundance) to farmland cover scenarios, and if they were related to species habitat specialization (farmland specialist vs. generalist). The latter was defined following Julliard et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0117850.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref048">48</a>] who quantified specialization of a given species by calculating the variation in its density among various habitat classes (provided by BBS observers). We further explored potential relationship between farmland specialists’ responses and their main habitat of specialization: grassland, cropland and mixed grass/crop lands. Based on Julliard et al. (2006) methodology, main habitat of farmland specialists was determined with the calculation of a species specialization index for grasslands (SSIg). The SSIg was computed as a weighted mean of species abundance among four sub-habitats of the farmland habitat: unimproved grasslands, improved grasslands, mixed grass/crop lands and croplands, weighting coefficient of these sub-habitat being 4, 3, 2 and 1, respectively. Species with highest SSIg values (SSIg &gt; 2.2) were considered as grassland birds, while species with lowest SSIg values (SSIg &lt; 1.8) were considered as cropland birds; remaining intermediate species were considered as mixed habitat farmland species (see 
  <a rid="pone.0117850.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0117850.t001">Table 1</a>). We used one sample Student’s t-tests to check if mean changes in abundance in response to farmland cover scenario were significantly different from the null hypothesis (i.e. mu = 0). Because all SAR differ in area and number of count points, changes in regional abundance were weighted by the ratio of the area of corresponding SAR on the number of count points in all analyses in order to obtain comparable measures across SARs. Standard deviations associated with weighted mean changes were computed following Cochran’s 1977 definition [
  <a rid="pone.0117850.ref066" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref066">66</a>]. We finally performed Tukey HSD (Honestly Significant Difference) tests, a single-step multiple comparison procedure, to check whether the mean changes in abundance, for each ‘farmland cover’ scenario and group of species with different SSI, were significantly different from each other. We performed all our statistical analyses using R [
  <a rid="pone.0117850.ref067" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref067">67</a>] and used ‘nlme’ package for mixed models [
  <a rid="pone.0117850.ref068" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref068">68</a>].
