 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We estimated the proportion of farmland habitats (P2 in 
  <a rid="pone.0117850.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0117850.g002">Fig. 2</a>) as the percentage of land area within each SAR covered by (1) herbaceous or cultivated pasture, (2) cultivated and managed areas and (3) mosaic cropland/natural vegetation. These land use variables were derived from 19 land cover types available in the IMAGE 2.4 model (M2 in

  <a rid="pone.0117850.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref040">40</a>]. The IMAGE 2.4 model is an Earth system model that includes the major feedback mechanisms in the biophysical system. It assumes population and macro-economy as key drivers to establish physical indicators for both the energy/industry system and the agriculture/land-use system for assessment of changes in land cover [
  <a rid="pone.0117850.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref040">40</a>]. This model is developed at a 0.5° resolution grid for all decades since 1960. To be consistent with current climatic variables, we used the average of the variables from 1960 to 1990 to obtain the current proportion of farmland habitats. Although land uses can have changed since this period, we expected the percentage covered by farmland to remain nearly the same, with land use changes at such large spatial scale happening slower than land cover data. Future land cover projections (for 2050) were obtained from the three SRES scenarios, A1B, A2, and B1 of the IMAGE 2.4 model [
  <a rid="pone.0117850.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0117850.ref040">40</a>]. The future proportion of farmland habitats was obtained by averaging projected proportions from the three SRES scenarios. We downscaled those data at the scale of each SAR (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We considered a 0.5° resolution (~50x50km scale) for both climate and land use data and associated projections (no scenarios were available for these drivers at a finer spatial scale). However, we considered land cover scenarios and bird abundances at the PRA scale—because they are more tightly linked to local conditions in their realization of abundance. At the scale of the PRA, we considered a homogeneous realization of the scenario, with an average effect on bird populations.</p>
