  <a rid="evl3103-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#evl3103-bib-0043">2018</a>) at Edinburgh Genomics (Edinburgh, United Kingdom). Axiom Analysis Suite 1.1 was used for SNP calling following the Affymetrix best practices workflow. Total of 32,716 SNPs located on unassigned reads, that is without known genomic position, and on the Z chromosome were excluded. Altogether 503,199 SNPs passed initial quality control. From these, 248 nonpolymorphic SNPs were excluded. SNPs were not filtered for Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium or minor allele frequency.
