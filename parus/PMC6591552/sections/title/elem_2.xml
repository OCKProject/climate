  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our “training population,” that is the set of individuals for which phenotypes and genotypes are recorded, consisted of several long‐term study populations of wild great tits (
   <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) in the Southern part of the Veluwe area close to Arnhem (52° 00′ N, 5° 50′ E, the Netherlands). These populations are located in close vicinity (max. distance: 5 km) within a large contiguous woodland area. Great tits are small passerines that breed in natural cavities but readily accept artificial nest boxes. In all study populations nest boxes are supplied in overabundance so that almost all great tits breed in the supplied nest boxes. Nest‐boxes are checked weekly for signs of nest building and clutch initiation starting in the beginning of April. When a nest with eggs is found, the date of the first egg laid (hereafter egg‐laying date) is back‐calculated on the assumption that one egg is laid per day. All nestlings are ringed with standard aluminium bird rings at an age of seven days. Adults are caught in the nest boxes during the chick feeding period and identified by their rings or ringed if still unringed. This allowed the construction of a pedigree based on this observational data. In the recent decades adults and chicks have also been blood‐sampled at capture. Blood samples were stored in either 1 mL Cell Lysis Solution (Gentra Puregene Kit, Qiagen, USA) or Queens buffer (Seutin et al.

Axiom Analysis Suite 1.1 was used for SNP calling following the Affymetrix best practices workflow. Total of 32,716 SNPs located on unassigned reads, that is without known genomic position, and on the Z chromosome were excluded. Altogether 503,199 SNPs passed initial quality control. From these, 248 nonpolymorphic SNPs were excluded. SNPs were not filtered for Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium or minor allele frequency.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CALCULATION OF GEBVs</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are two conceptually different ways to calculate genomic breeding values (GEBVs). In so‐called “whole genome regression” phenotypes are regressed simultaneously against all markers and the GEBV is calculated as the sum of all estimated marker effects multiplied with the corresponding genotypes (de los Campos et al. 
   <a rid="evl3103-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#evl3103-bib-0018">2013</a>). However, the fact that the number of estimated parameters, the marker effects, exceeds the number of observations prevents the use of “simple” least‐squares multiple regression and instead variable selection or shrinkage estimation procedures need to be used. Various approaches as, for example, ridge regression (Hoerl and Kennard 
   <a rid="evl3103-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#evl3103-bib-0041">1970</a>), LASSO (Tibshirani 
   <a rid="evl3103-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" href="#evl3103-bib-0068">1996</a>) or Bayesian methods with various priors (e.g., Gianola 
   <a rid="evl3103-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#evl3103-bib-0023">2013</a>) have been proposed and used. The other approach is replacing the pedigree‐based relatedness matrix in an animal model by the marker‐based relatedness matrix (VanRaden 
   <a rid="evl3103-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" href="#evl3103-bib-0071">2008</a>; Yang et al. 
   <a rid="evl3103-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" href="#evl3103-bib-0079">2010</a>), generally known as GBLUP. While conceptually very different, this approach can be shown to be mathematically identical to ridge regression or a Bayesian approach with a Gaussian distribution of marker effects. Generally, the accuracies of GEBVs that can be obtained with these different approaches are comparable (e.g., Hayes et al. 
   <a rid="evl3103-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#evl3103-bib-0036">2009a</a>; Daetwyler et al. 
   <a rid="evl3103-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#evl3103-bib-0017">2010</a>; Gao et al. 
   <a rid="evl3103-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#evl3103-bib-0020">2013</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We here calculated GEBVs using the GBLUP approach. The marker‐based or “genomic” relatedness matrix (GRM) was calculated using the pairwise relatedness estimators of VanRaden (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">VALIDATION OF GEBVs</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the “validation” step a subset of individuals that have both phenotypes and genotypes are excluded from the training population, and their precorrected phenotypes (see above) are regressed against the GEBVs predicted from their genotypes. The correlation between the GEBVs and phenotypes of these individuals is used to compute the accuracy of the GEBVs, which is defined as the correlation between the true and the estimated breeding values. Since the true breeding values are not known, phenotypes (P) that were precorrected for all fixed effects and averaged per individual are used instead:

    </div>
   </div>, which is achieved if the accuracy is 1, that is when GEBV are equal to the true breeding values. To allow comparison of the accuracy obtained using different numbers of SNPs we used the 
   <span class="italic">h</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> obtained from the VanRaden model with all SNPs for scaling. For this comparison, we could hence equally well have used the correlation between phenotype and GEBV but choose to present the (identically scaled) accuracies to minimize potential confusion.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since the standard error of the calculated accuracy depends on the size of the set of individuals excluded from the training population (Daetwyler et al. 
   <a rid="evl3103-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#evl3103-bib-0016">2013</a>), we followed a modified “leave‐one‐out” approach. In this approach each individual is in turn excluded from the training population, that is in practice its phenotype is set to missing and the standard GBLUP model is run. This means that this individual's GEBV is predicted based on all phenotypes except its own. To reduce computation time, we here did not exclude each individual separately from the training population but instead excluded 20 individuals at once, which reduced computation time by a factor 20. We randomly excluded 20 individuals from the training population, predicted their GEBVs and then selected the next 20 individuals (each individual was only excluded once) until all individuals were excluded once and their GEBVs predicted. When GEBVs for all individuals had been predicted, the GEBVs were correlated with the individuals’ phenotypes. 95% confidence intervals were obtained by bootstrapping. The 1000 bootstrap samples were obtained by randomly drawing—with replacement—2015 observations from the data. We also report the (approximate) standard errors of the accuracy and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the GEBVs. The standard error was based on the sampling variance of a correlation coefficient calculated as the square root of the sampling variance divided by the square root of the heritability. The RMSE was calculated as the square root of the mean squared difference between an individual's phenotype and its GEBV estimated including the individual's phenotype. The scripts that were used to run the validation analyses are available as Supplementary Material.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since our data are from a natural population, there is some relatedness structure in the sampled individuals. Out of the 2015 individuals included in the analysis more than half (1520) had no known relatives within the genotyped individuals. This may be partly due to parents not being captured but overall capture rates of breeding adult individuals are at least 90%. Based on the recorded pedigree information, there were 185 individuals related as full‐sibs, 79 individuals related as maternal half‐sibs and 80 individuals related as paternal half‐sibs in the pedigree. Overall mean pairwise pedigree‐based relatedness was 0.00033.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test the effect of the number of SNPs used to estimate relatedness we reran our analysis for subsets of 1000, 50,000, 100,000, 250,000, and 400,000 SNPs. For 100 replicates the corresponding number of SNPs was sampled randomly from the total number of SNPs, the GRM calculated using the VanRaden‐estimator, and GEBVs predicted using the approach described above for each random sample. That is, for the first replicate the phenotypes of the first 20 individuals were excluded and their GEBVs predicted, for the second replicate the phenotypes of the next 20 individuals were excluded and their GEBVs predicted and so forth.</p>
