 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our “training population,” that is the set of individuals for which phenotypes and genotypes are recorded, consisted of several long‐term study populations of wild great tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) in the Southern part of the Veluwe area close to Arnhem (52° 00′ N, 5° 50′ E, the Netherlands). These populations are located in close vicinity (max. distance: 5 km) within a large contiguous woodland area. Great tits are small passerines that breed in natural cavities but readily accept artificial nest boxes. In all study populations nest boxes are supplied in overabundance so that almost all great tits breed in the supplied nest boxes. Nest‐boxes are checked weekly for signs of nest building and clutch initiation starting in the beginning of April. When a nest with eggs is found, the date of the first egg laid (hereafter egg‐laying date) is back‐calculated on the assumption that one egg is laid per day. All nestlings are ringed with standard aluminium bird rings at an age of seven days. Adults are caught in the nest boxes during the chick feeding period and identified by their rings or ringed if still unringed. This allowed the construction of a pedigree based on this observational data. In the recent decades adults and chicks have also been blood‐sampled at capture. Blood samples were stored in either 1 mL Cell Lysis Solution (Gentra Puregene Kit, Qiagen, USA) or Queens buffer (Seutin et al.
