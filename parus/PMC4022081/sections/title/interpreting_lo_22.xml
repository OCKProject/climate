 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on previous studies of NO, a key regulator of immune function and a non-specific pathogen destroyer [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B75" href="#B75">75</a>], we anticipated that (i) NO levels before wounding would be low and approximately equivalent, representing a baseline circulating NO titer, and (ii) that higher levels would be observed after wounding, reflecting the NO burst triggered by an immune challenge ([
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B33" href="#B33">33</a>]; reviewed in [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B34" href="#B34">34</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B35" href="#B35">35</a>]). However, neither of these predictions was met. Instead, we recorded an overall decrease in NO levels in most individuals from pre- to post-wound, regardless of treatment or family group, which is in direct opposition to previous studies in mammals documenting a post-immune challenge increase in NO levels ([
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B33" href="#B33">33</a>]; reviewed in [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B34" href="#B34">34</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B35" href="#B35">35</a>]). Unfortunately, because we did not have a non-wounded control group to control for variability in NO related to age or time, our methodological limitations restrict the interpretation of these findings. It is possible that we mistimed our post-biopsy blood collection (though missing peak NO levels does not explain the observed reduction in NO levels from pre- to post-wounding) or that some aspect of the procedure itself caused the unexpected drop in NO. As such, additional work is required to determine the appropriate time course over which to measure NO burst in squamates and the underlying causes of the observed post-wounding decreases in plasma NO levels.
