 <p>Photographs illustrating chameleon biopsy (a) and wound-healing at six days (b) and ten days (c) following the biopsy. Original photographs also contained a ruler for scale, which allowed us to calculate wound size after tracing wound outlines (yellow line in b and c) in ImageJ. Note, original wound size was calculated as the outer circumference of the biopsy and was not influenced by slight bleeding noticeable on the right side of the biopsy (a).</p>
