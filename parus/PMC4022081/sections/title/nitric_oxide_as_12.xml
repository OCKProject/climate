 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We analyzed the change in NO during the course of each wounding to measure the magnitude of the chameleon innate immune response [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B55" href="#B55">55</a>]. We collected blood immediately before wounding (and anesthetization) and two days after wounding, in an attempt to sample animals near the peak of the NO burst (as determined by [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B34" href="#B34">34</a>] in mammals), and stored 50 μL of the plasma fraction at -80°C until NO assays could be performed. The NO assay was conducted as described by Butler and McGraw [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B56" href="#B56">56</a>], adapted from [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B55" href="#B55">55</a>]. We first deproteinized 15 μL of plasma in 40 μL of zinc sulfate (75 mM) and 50 μL of sodium hydroxide (55 mM), then centrifuged the samples for 10 min at 16,000 RPM. We combined 80 μL of the supernatant with 80 μL of glycine buffer (pH 9.7) before adding two activated cadmium granules and vortexing the samples for 15 min. Next, we combined 120 μL of supernatant with 120 μL of Greiss reagent (Sigma G4410-10G) before vortexing for another 15 min. Finally, we transferred 200 μL of each sample into a 96-well plate and used an iMark Microplate Reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, UK) to measure the absorbance of each well at λ = 540 nm. Using the standard curves run with each assay, we converted absorbance values to concentrations of plasma NO.
