  <sub>2</sub> had a significant influence on wound healing rate (rmANOVA:

  <sub>0</sub> all chameleons exhibited an approximately linear trend in wound area reduction, whereas for X
  <sub>1</sub> and X
  <sub>2</sub> we detected a biphasic healing pattern (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">6</a>). Additionally, the initial slope for reduction in wound size was steeper (more negative) for X
  <sub>1</sub> and X
  <sub>2</sub>, indicating faster primary wound healing following these biopsies. (see Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">6</a> legend for additional details). Additionally, 
  <span class="italic">post hoc</span> analyses revealed the following relationships between mass and wound size within family on either Day 6 or Day 10 of wound-healing; Family B showed a trend toward a positive relationship between mass and wound size on Day 10 during both X
