   <p>Wet and dry masses of arthropods collected in July 2011 in LaBelle, FL, USA. Dry masses were obtained after overnight desiccation in a drying oven. The carotenoid content of these arthropods was determined via extraction and HPLC analysis and used to calculate the carotenoid supplementation dose administered to captive veiled chameleons (

   <p>Photographs illustrating chameleon biopsy (a) and wound-healing at six days (b) and ten days (c) following the biopsy. Original photographs also contained a ruler for scale, which allowed us to calculate wound size after tracing wound outlines (yellow line in b and c) in ImageJ. Note, original wound size was calculated as the outer circumference of the biopsy and was not influenced by slight bleeding noticeable on the right side of the biopsy (a).</p>
