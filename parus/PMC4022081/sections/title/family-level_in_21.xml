 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During development, family A became significantly more massive than family B in Week 12, a relationship that continued throughout the duration of the study. Unfortunately, this difference resulted in the nesting of body mass within family as well as housing arrangement (all family A cages were positioned higher than family B cages), which confounded our interpretations of all significant family effects that we uncovered. As such, differences between family groups could have arisen due to genetic or early developmental differences (e.g., in growth rate [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B64" href="#B64">64</a>]), effects of differing height on microenvironment conditions (e.g., lighting, temperature, humidity [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B65" href="#B65">65</a>]), body mass-mediated differences [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B66" href="#B66">66</a>], or some interaction among these factors.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the primary differences we found between families was that supplemented members of family B always circulated significantly higher carotenoid levels than supplemented members of family A, and this can reasonably be explained by the phenomenon of dose-dilution as a function of body mass [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B57" href="#B57">57</a>]. Specifically, a given volume of carotenoids will be more diluted in larger-bodied animals than in those with smaller bodies. That differences between supplemented individuals arose as a result of differences in body mass is further supported by the fact that there were no differences in carotenoid circulation between families before supplementation (at the time when there was no family-based difference in mass) but that such differences existed during three of the four sampling periods after family masses became significantly different (with the fourth sampling period exhibiting the same, albeit non-significant, trend).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To examine performance of the developing humoral arm of the innate immune system, we recorded agglutination and lysis titers at multiple time points during development. We found that agglutination and lysis performance increased as the chameleons aged, but family A’s agglutination and lysis scores were generally higher than family B’s. However, differences in body mass between families did not likely drive the pattern for agglutination, as 
  <span class="italic">post hoc</span> analyses did not reveal any intrafamilial relationships between agglutination and lysis titers and mass. Given that the proteins that constitute the humoral branch of the innate immune system (i.e., antibodies and the complement system [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B24" href="#B24">24</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B67" href="#B67">67</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B68" href="#B68">68</a>]) are encoded by germ-line genes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B68" href="#B68">68</a>], it is possible that genetic differences drove the observed family difference in these aspects of innate immunity. However, we are unable to test if these family-level differences arose as a result of genetic effects or differences in cage height.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Families A and B had nearly equivalent agglutination and lysis scores by the end of the study (Week 20; Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">5</a>), a convergence that began in Week 14. Though these chameleons may not have reached full adult size by the end of this study [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B46" href="#B46">46</a>], it is possible that, as they progressed into advanced developmental stages, Family A’s immune system was down-regulated, as they approached sexual maturity and began investing in reproductive characters (
  <span class="italic">cf.</span> the trade-off model described by [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B69" href="#B69">69</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B70" href="#B70">70</a>]). Similar trade-offs between reproduction and immune system activity have been documented in great tits 
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>[
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B71" href="#B71">71</a>], crickets 
  <span class="italic">Gryllus texensis</span>[
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B72" href="#B72">72</a>], ruffs 
  <span class="italic">Philomachus pugnax</span>[
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B73" href="#B73">73</a>], tree lizards 
  <span class="italic">Urosaurus ornatus</span>[
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B6" href="#B6">6</a>], and black guillemots 
  <span class="italic">Cepphus grylle</span>[
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B74" href="#B74">74</a>]. However, because other variables were correlated with family, a convergence in lysis/agglutination scores due to sexual maturation is just one possibility, and interactions between age and genetic effects or rearing environment may have also influenced the changes in agglutination and lysis scores over time.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Experimental wounding is a biologically relevant immune challenge, and multiple aspects of the immune response can be quantified following the biopsy, making this procedure a valuable tool in investigations of immune system function [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B30" href="#B30">30</a>]. Although carotenoid supplementation had no effect on wound-healing in our study, the family of origin had a significant effect on wound size at biopsy X
  <sub>2</sub>. Specifically, members of family A had consistently smaller wound areas in response to biopsy X
  <sub>2</sub> than those of family B, though no differences between families were detected for biopsies X
  <sub>0</sub> or X
  <sub>1</sub>. Oddly, for biopsy X
  <sub>2</sub>, wound size differed between the two families at all time points, including D
  <sub>0</sub>. Thus, the intial difference in wound size likely contributed to the observed differences at D
  <sub>6</sub> and D
  <sub>10</sub> (i.e. healing rate between the two families was similar). Because we used a standardized biopsy procedure with all chameleons, differences in wound area at D
  <sub>0</sub> are paradoxical, but might represent a difference in the acute response to trauma (e.g. tissue contractility). Independent of the wound size differences seen in response to biopsy X
  <sub>2</sub>, it is interesting to note that the pattern of wound healing changed from a linear reduction in wound area over time for biopsy X
  <sub>0</sub> (prior to supplementation) to a more biphasic healing trajectory in the subsequent (X
  <sub>1</sub> and X
  <sub>2</sub>) biopsies where healing rate was slower between D
  <sub>6</sub> and D
  <sub>10</sub> than it was between D
  <sub>0</sub> and D
  <sub>6</sub>. Furthermore, the initial reduction in wound area size was greater (steeper, more negative slope) for biopsies X
  <sub>1</sub> and X
  <sub>2</sub>. Because there were no effects of carotenoid supplementation on wound healing rate, these changes in healing rate may reflect an increased ability to deal with a wound of a given size as the chameleons grow, perhaps because the size of the wound relative to the size of the chameleons was less as the chameleons aged and grew. Additional work is required to determine whether these changes in healing trajectory are linked to age, size, sexual maturation, or some combination of these factors.
