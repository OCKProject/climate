   <span class="bold">Circulating carotenoid concentrations measured in growing male veiled chameleons during development.</span> Before supplementation, there were no significant differences in circulating carotenoid levels among groups. After supplementation began, carotenoid-supplemented individuals had significantly elevated circulating carotenoid concentrations compared to the non-supplemented group. Within carotenoid-supplemented individuals, members of family B always had significantly higher carotenoid titers once supplementation began; however, no such pattern was detected between non-supplemented groups, which circulated barely detectable levels of carotenoids throughout the study. Bar heights represent mean values with standard errors calculated from raw data.
