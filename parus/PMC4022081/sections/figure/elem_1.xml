   <span class="bold">Timeline of carotenoid supplementation, blood collection, and dermal biopsies during our study.</span> During Week 4 of the study, blood was collected from all individuals to establish initial values for circulating carotenoid, agglutination, and lysis titers prior to supplementation (
   <span class="italic">Blood Collection 1</span>). Additionally, biopsy X
   <sub>0</sub> was performed during Week 4 of the study to determine the post-wounding time points with the greatest variation in wound area (to focus subsequent wound healing analyses). In Week 8 of the study, carotenoid supplementation commenced. Every three weeks during the supplementation period, blood was collected to measure circulating carotenoid levels and agglutination and lysis titers (
   <span class="italic">Blood Collections 2-5</span>). At weeks 14 and 20 of the study, we biopsied (X
   <sub>1</sub>, X
   <sub>2</sub>) the chameleons to evaluate wound healing. Wound healing rates were determined by measuring wound area from photographs taken immediately after biopsies, and on days 6 and 10 after wounding. Furthermore, we evaluated circulating nitric oxide levels by collecting blood samples immediately before, and again two days, after each biopsy.
