   <span class="bold">Weekly body masses of growing veiled chameleons during development.</span> Measurements for all groups were taken at the same times, but data points are slightly offset for ease of interpretation. The vertical dashed line (at Week 8 of the study) represents the onset of carotenoid supplementation. All chameleons were provided with the same number of food items each day. Family A was significantly more massive than Family B at Week 1 and from Week 12 through Week 22 of the study. Points represent mean values with standard errors calculated from raw data.
