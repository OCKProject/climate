   <span class="bold">Wound area of juvenile veiled chameleons immediately (D</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="bold">0</span>
   </sub>
   <span class="bold">), six (D</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="bold">6</span>
   </sub>
   <span class="bold">), and ten (D</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="bold">10</span>
   </sub>
   <span class="bold">) days after a standardized dermal biopsy.</span> Throughout the course of the study, the chameleons were biopsied three times: once prior to carotenoid supplementation (
   <span class="bold">a:</span> Biopsy X
   <sub>0</sub>) and twice during supplementation in Weeks 14 and 20 of the study (
   <span class="bold">b:</span> Biopsy X
   <sub>1</sub> and 
   <span class="bold">c:</span> Biopsy X
   <sub>2</sub>, respectively). 
   <span class="bold">a)</span> During X
   <sub>0</sub>, there was no significant effect of family, treatment, or their interaction (repeated measures: all 
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>1,14</sub> &lt; 0.97, all 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &gt; 0.182; mixed model: all 
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>1,30</sub> &lt; 1.94, all 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &gt; 0.17). Wound size decreased over time (from D
   <sub>0</sub> to D
   <sub>6</sub> to D
   <sub>10</sub>) during X
   <sub>0</sub> (repeated measures: 
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>2,28</sub> = 36.74, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.0001; mixed model: 
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>2,30</sub> = 41.42, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.0001). 
   <span class="bold">b)</span> During X
   <sub>1</sub>, there was no significant effect of treatment, family, or their interaction on wound healing rate (repeated measures: all 
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>1,12</sub> &lt; 0.86, all 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &gt; 0.37; mixed model: all 
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>1,28</sub> &lt; 1.82, all 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &gt; 0.19). Again, wound size decreased over time (D
   <sub>0</sub>, D
   <sub>6</sub>, D
   <sub>10</sub>) during X
   <sub>1</sub> (repeated measures: 
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>2,24</sub> = 55.04, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.0001; mixed model: 
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>2,28</sub> = 58.79, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.0001). 
   <span class="bold">c)</span> In contrast to X
   <sub>0</sub> and X
   <sub>1</sub>, during X
   <sub>2</sub> there was a significant effect of family of origin on wound size (repeated measures: 
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>1,15</sub> = 10.60, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.005; mixed model: 
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>1,30</sub> = 10.60, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.0028), though again wound size decreased over time (D
   <sub>0</sub>, D
   <sub>6</sub>, D
   <sub>10</sub>; repeated measures: 
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>2,30</sub> = 96.51, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt;0.0001; mixed model: 
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>2,30</sub> = 96.51, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt;0.0001). Specifically, family A had consistently smaller wounds than family B on all measurement days (D
   <sub>0</sub>, D
   <sub>6</sub>, and D
   <sub>10</sub>) during X
   <sub>2</sub>. Points represent mean values with standard errors calculated from raw data.
