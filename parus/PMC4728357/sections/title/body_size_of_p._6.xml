 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to see how the body size of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> varies between the three mainland samples and whether island birds differ from them, we use the SW Swedish measurements as reference values, against which we contrast data from each of the 11 remaining sampling places. Two of them lie on the Swedish mainland (SC South-Central and SE Sweden), one lies on the Danish mainland Jylland and eight are on different islands.

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F1" href="#BIO013839F1">Fig. 1</a> gives a quick overview of the results. The bar diagrams show how much birds at the respective locality differ in linear dimensions from birds in SW Sweden. Each bar shows the difference as averaged across three primary measurements of the wing, leg and bill, respectively.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The difference in wing dimensions, shown by the left bar W, was calculated by first finding the amount, expressed in per cent of the SW Swedish value, by which birds from the respective locality differs from the SW Swedish sample in each of the three wing measurements (wing area)
  <span class="sup">0.5</span>, wing span and hand-wing length. We then took the average value of these three percentages. Similarly, the local deviation from the SW Swedish measurements of the leg, shown by the middle bar L, is the average of the percentage differences in tibiotarsus length, tarsus ‘short’ length and foot length. And the local deviation from the SW Swedish measurements of the bill, shown by the right bar B, is the average of the percentage differences in bill length, width and height.

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F3" href="#BIO013839F3">Fig. 3</a> is similar to 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F1" href="#BIO013839F1">Fig. 1</a>. But while each bar in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F1" href="#BIO013839F1">Fig. 1</a> represents the average difference across three measurements, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F3" href="#BIO013839F3">Fig. 3</a> shows how much each one of 11 morphological measurements of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> from each of 11 sampling places differs from the reference sample from SW Sweden.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The measurements are very similar between the three sampling places on the Swedish mainland (

  <span class="italic">P. ater</span>, 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus and P. montanus</span> coexist – like on the Swedish mainland – 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> is the same small size as conspecifics on the SW Swedish mainland (

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F3" href="#BIO013839F3">Fig. 3</a>, left diagram in second row). But on all six islands from which both 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> are absent, 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> is significantly larger in wing, leg and bill dimensions than its conspecifics on the SW Swedish mainland. Compared with conspecifics in SW Sweden, 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> is also larger on the Danish mainland Jylland, where it coexists with 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span>, and on the island of Öland, where it coexists with 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> (
