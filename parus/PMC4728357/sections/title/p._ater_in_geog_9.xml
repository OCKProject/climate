 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> is substantially larger on each of the six islands Gotska Sandön, Gotland, Bornholm, Sjælland, Anholt and Læsø – all of which lack 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatu</span>s and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus –</span> than on the Swedish mainland, where 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> coexists with 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatu</span>s and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus.</span> The amount by which 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> on the islands differs from mainland conspecifics varies between body parts and also between the islands (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F3" href="#BIO013839F3">Fig. 3</a>). The maximum size difference recorded for a single trait between island and mainland first-year birds is 8% for a wing dimension, 10% for a leg dimension and 9% for a bill dimension (

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each of the six independent island-mainland comparisons involves 12 measures of body size (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB2" href="#BIO013839TB2">Tables 2</a>-
  <a ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB4" href="#BIO013839TB4">4</a>; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F3" href="#BIO013839F3">Fig. 3</a>, showing 11 measurements because tarsus ‘long’ is omitted). Of the resulting 72 comparisons of primary measurements between island and mainland birds, 56 differ in the expected direction at the 0.001 significance level, two at the 0.01 level and six at the 0.05 level, whereas eight comparisons do not reach statistical significance. The latter are body mass, wing area, bill depth and tail length of adult birds on Gotska Sandön; bill depth and tail length of juveniles on Jylland; bill depth of juveniles on Anholt; and tail length of juveniles on Læsø. It is noteworthy that there is not a single local mean measurement of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> that is significantly smaller on any of the six islands than on the Swedish mainland (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB2" href="#BIO013839TB2">Tables 2</a>-
  <a ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB4" href="#BIO013839TB4">4</a>; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F3" href="#BIO013839F3">Fig. 3</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because each measurement is a measure of body size, the various dimensions of an individual bird are strongly correlated. Taken together, however, the data firmly establish that the overall body size of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> is significantly larger on the islands than on the Swedish mainland. As an additional point, the probability that a size change would occur towards larger birds on all six islands independently, and due to random events only, is 0.5
  <span class="sup">6</span>=0.016, a significant result in itself.

  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and

  <span class="italic">P. ater</span>, 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span>. The reason for calculating average values across 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> as well as across 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span>, 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> in sympatry on the Swedish mainland is that natural selection might drive 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> in those directions on islands where 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> are lacking.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several of the measurements of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span>, calculated as means across the six islands G. Sandön through to Læsø, are very similar to the three-tit means, calculated across 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span>, 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> in sympatry on the Swedish mainland. The respective means are: 62.9 vs 63.0 mm for the hand-wing; 25.10 vs 25.23 for tibiotarsus; 16.98 vs 17.13 for tarsus ‘short’; 9.94 vs 9.92 for bill length; 3.92 vs 3.92 for bill width; and 3.65 vs 3.73 for bill depth (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB2" href="#BIO013839TB2">Tables 2</a>-
  <a ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB4" href="#BIO013839TB4">4</a>). So, on the six islands, from which 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> are totally lacking, 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> has increased in size and is near the mean size as calculated across 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span>, 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> in sympatry on the Swedish mainland.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another study, performed three years after we had completed our fieldwork, compared the size of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> between the island of Gotland and an area near Uppsala on the mainland of east-central Sweden. The only dimension measured was the length of tarsus. It was 5.9% longer in adult males (mean 19.13 mm) and 5.6% longer in adult females (mean 18.72 mm) on the island of Gotland than on the mainland (
  <a rid="BIO013839C5" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C5">Alatalo and Gustafsson, 1988</a>). These results are in good agreement with the differences that we recorded for the ‘long’ tarsus of first-year birds (not separated by sex). In our 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB3" href="#BIO013839TB3">Table 3</a>, the tarsus length of first-year birds on Gotland exceeds that of mainland birds from SW, SE and SC Sweden by 6.0%, 6.6% and 7.1%, respectively.
