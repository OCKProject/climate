 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the thermoneutral zone of a warm-blooded animal there is no metabolic energy cost for thermoregulation. But below it, metabolic heat must be generated to maintain body temperature. For the same insulation and temperature gradient across the body surface, the rate of heat loss is proportional to body surface area. Among geometrically similar animals, area is proportional to volume
  <span class="sup">2/3</span> so the rate of heat loss from an entire animal increases in proportion to mass
  <span class="sup">2/3</span>. But the rate of heat loss per unit body mass decreases with increasing body size as mass
  <span class="sup">2/3</span>/mass=mass
  <span class="sup">−1/3</span>. So, heat loss per unit body mass is larger the smaller the animal. Selection for reduced mass-specific metabolic costs for thermoregulation in temperate and cold regions therefore favours large body sizes. This is a likely explanation for the intraspecific trend of increasing body size among some warm-blooded vertebrates in colder parts of their distribution range – known as Bergmann's ecogeographical rule (

  <a rid="BIO013839C51" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C51">Mayr, 1965</a>). Another explanation is that the size trend arises because large animals have better fasting ability, which is particularly advantageous in cold and seasonal environments with periods of food scarcity (
  <a rid="BIO013839C54" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C54">Murphy, 1985</a>). Either way, selection for large size must be strongest in winter.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the islands where 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> occurs but 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> are absent, the winter climate is considerably milder than on the Swedish mainland, except that Gotland is like the mainland (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F5" href="#BIO013839F5">Fig. 5</a>). If reduction of mass-specific energy costs for thermoregulation in winter were important, mainland birds would be larger than their island conspecifics. But body mass and all linear measurements of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> are smaller on the Swedish mainland than on the islands where 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> are lacking (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F1" href="#BIO013839F1">Figs 1</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F3" href="#BIO013839F3">3</a>). And on the island of Åland, where all three species coexist, 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> is the same small size as on the Swedish mainland even though Åland is the coldest among the islands (except for Gotska Sandön in May) and colder in all seasons than the Swedish mainland (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F1" href="#BIO013839F1">Figs 1</a>, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F3" href="#BIO013839F3">3</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F5" href="#BIO013839F5">5</a>). So, climate cannot explain the large size of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> on the islands.

     <span class="bold">Comparisons of mean monthly temperatures at the 12 places where we measured tits.</span> The diagram at top left shows the actual mean monthly temperature in degree centigrade at the reference locality in SW Sweden, averaged over each of two partly overlapping 30-year periods, 1931–1960 and 1951–1980. The other diagrams show local deviations from the mean monthly temperatures recorded in SW Sweden during the period 1931–1960. The vertical bars to the right of the top left diagram show the mean yearly temperature in SW Sweden for the two 30-year periods. Bars to the right of the other diagrams show local deviations from the mean yearly reference temperature in SW Sweden. Temperature was recorded at meteorological stations near the respective sampling place. Data were obtained from The Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute, Norrköping, for the periods 1931–60 and 1951–80; The Danish Meteorological Institute, Copenhagen, for the period 1931–60; and The Finnish Meteorological Institute, Helsinki, regarding the island of Åland for the period 1951–80.
