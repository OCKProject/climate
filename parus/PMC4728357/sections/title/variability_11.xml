 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Small populations tend to show reduced genetic and phenotypic variability due to accidental loss of alleles by genetic drift (

  <a rid="BIO013839C26" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C26">Grant and Grant, 2008</a>). The populations studied here differ enormously in size. Anholt is the smallest island and based on the coniferous forest size we estimate its 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> population to be 200 individuals whereas Gotland, which is the largest island, harbours 80,000 (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The coefficient of variation, defined as the standard deviation expressed in per cent of the mean, was calculated for all measurements of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> listed in

  <a ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB4" href="#BIO013839TB4">4</a>. It mostly lies between 2 and 4%. The variance of measurements in the sample from SW Sweden was used as a reference against which we tested the variance of each of the other samples (variance-ratio 
  <span class="italic">F</span>-test). There is no trend in the size of the coefficient of variation between island and mainland birds or between small and large populations. In particular, the coefficients of variation in the very small population of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> on the island of Anholt are not any different from the large populations on Gotland and the Swedish mainland. So, the small Anholt population seems not to have lost phenotypic variability.
