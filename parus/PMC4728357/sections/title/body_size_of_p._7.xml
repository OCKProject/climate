 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among all measurements of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> in the samples from SW, SE and SC Sweden, it is only the body weight of birds in SE Sweden that differs statistically by being about 4.4% lower than in the SW and SC Swedish samples (
  <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;0.02). But because body mass varies with food supply and time of day – as detailed below – a mass difference of this magnitude may not be a reliable measure of overall body size.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Apart from this deviation, there is great homogeneity among all the other measurements of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> from the Swedish mainland (

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F3" href="#BIO013839F3">Fig. 3</a>). Therefore, and because mainland birds belong to the same uniform and cohesive population, we added together the samples from SW, SE and SC Sweden into a combined mainland sample consisting of 45 juvenile and 16 adult birds. Each measurement in the pooled mainland sample was obtained by averaging across the three sub-samples, weighted in proportion to their respective size. The nine samples from localities off the Swedish mainland were then tested statistically, one at a time, against this unified mainland sample (Mann–Whitney 
  <span class="italic">U</span>-test). The statistical analyses are based on juvenile birds except for the Gotska Sandön sample, which only contains adults that we compare with adults from the mainland.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This comparison differs from the previous one (
