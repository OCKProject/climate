 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A field study in pine forest 
  <span class="italic">Pinus</span> spp. in the eastern Pyrenees showed that 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> foraged mainly in the canopy periphery under snow-free conditions (
  <a rid="BIO013839C14" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C14">Brotons, 1997</a>), just like it does on the Swedish mainland. But when there is snow, the distal branch parts became less accessible. It then shifted to the inner parts of trees, using trunks and thick branches as the main foraging space. This change of foraging sites was associated with a shift to less energy-demanding locomotion modes (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Small body size furthers manoeuvrability and cuts costs of the energy-expensive locomotion modes that are required in the canopy periphery. But when snow forces 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> to forage on the inner tree parts, where it can use easy locomotion modes, selection for a small body size is relaxed. During the snowy period, the balance between conflicting selection pressures therefore shifts temporarily towards a larger body size (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F4" href="#BIO013839F4">Fig. 4</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Swedish mainland and the islands Åland, Gotska Sandön and Gotland have longer snow periods than Bornholm, Sjælland, Anholt and Læsø (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB7" href="#BIO013839TB7">Table 7</a>). A large body size should therefore be more favoured in the former places. But 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> is small on the Swedish mainland and the island of Åland, where also 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> occur, and large on the other islands, all of which lack 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span>. This is contrary to expectations based on the length of the snowy season so differences in snow cover cannot explain the large size of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> on the islands.
