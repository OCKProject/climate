 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because populations of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> are smaller on the islands than on the mainland, there is a higher risk of inbreeding on the islands. Inbreeding will tend to increase homozygosity and the expression of recessive deleterious alleles, potentially leading to inbreeding depression and reduced vigour (
  <a rid="BIO013839C24" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C24">Falconer, 1983</a>). If body size were at all affected it would likely shift towards smaller rather than bigger – contrary to the case on the islands. A study of a wild population of another passerine bird, the collared flycatcher 
  <span class="italic">Ficedula albicollis</span>, showed that inbreeding caused a significant reduction in fledgling skeletal size and in post-fledgling juvenile survival (
  <a rid="BIO013839C46" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C46">Kruuk et al., 2002</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another argument against inbreeding as a cause for the increased size of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> relates to differences in population size between islands. Gotland is the largest island, Anholt the smallest, and the area of coniferous forest on them is 1147 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> and 3.0 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>, respectively (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB6" href="#BIO013839TB6">Table 6</a>). If population size is taken to be proportional to the area of coniferous forest, there would be 400 times more individuals of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> on Gotland than on Anholt. The number is estimated to be about 80,000 on Gotland (
  <a rid="BIO013839C64" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C64">SOF, 1990</a>) so there would be about 200 on Anholt. Another census on Gotland estimated the population density of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> to 90–110 individuals per km
  <span class="sup">2</span> of pine-dominated forest in January-February (Appendix in 
  <a rid="BIO013839C8" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C8">Alatalo et al., 1986</a>). Estimates based on these numbers give similar results, namely 100,000–126,000 individuals on Gotland and 270–330 on Anholt. But although the population is 400 times larger on Gotland than on Anholt, 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> is the same size on both islands.
