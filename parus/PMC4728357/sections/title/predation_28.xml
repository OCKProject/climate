 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When tits forage in the canopy periphery, they are exposed to high predation risk, whereas foraging closer to the trunk gives structural protection from raptors and day-hunting owls (
  <a rid="BIO013839C21" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C21">Ekman, 1986</a>; 
  <a rid="BIO013839C47" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C47">Kullberg, 1995</a>; 
  <a rid="BIO013839C25" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C25">Götmark and Post, 1996</a>). Therefore, if predation pressure differs between islands and the mainland, island tits might change their use of foraging zones in trees. And that entails a shift in locomotion mode, which in turn may alter selection on body size.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here follows a review of predation on coniferous forest tits and how predators influence their foraging behaviour and thence the selection on morphology. We focus on raptors and a day-hunting owl whose hunting success depends on where in trees their prey is. Night-hunting owls and nest predators are thus left out.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A study in SW Sweden found that the sparrowhawk 
  <span class="italic">Accipiter nisus</span> takes few coniferous forest tits in winter but preys more on them in summer (Table 2 in 
  <a rid="BIO013839C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C20">Ekman, 1984</a>). Another study, performed in summer in SW Sweden, compared the proportion of different bird species in the diet of 
  <span class="italic">A. nisus</span> with their relative abundance in the local bird community. The hawk took somewhat fewer 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> than expected whereas the proportion of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> in its diet was much lower than expected from their relative abundance on the hawks' hunting grounds (
  <a rid="BIO013839C25" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C25">Götmark and Post, 1996</a>). 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> forage in relatively predator-safe tree parts, which may explain their low frequency in the hawk diet. But the still lower predation rate on 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> runs counter to expectations based on its use of exposed foraging sites.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The pygmy owl 
  <span class="italic">Glaucidium passerinum</span> hunts by day and is responsible for a considerable proportion of the winter mortality of 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> in SW Sweden (
  <a rid="BIO013839C23" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C23">Ekman et al., 1981</a>; 
  <a rid="BIO013839C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C20">Ekman, 1984</a>, 
  <a rid="BIO013839C21" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C21">1986</a>). In a study area where 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> were individually colour-banded, the tits were very sedentary in winter and did not leave the territory of their respective flock. Any disappearance from the winter territory in the period November-March was therefore attributed to mortality. Among those that disappeared, 19% of the number of 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 24% of 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> were found – and identified by their rings – in regurgitated pellets in winter roosting holes of 
  <span class="italic">G. passerinum</span> (Table 5 in 
  <a rid="BIO013839C44" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C44">Jansson et al., 1981</a>). These predation rates are probably underestimates because the remains of some prey must have been missed.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When 
  <span class="italic">G. passerinum</span> hunts birds, it strikes from above, launching the attack from perches that are higher up than the focal prey (
  <a rid="BIO013839C47" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C47">Kullberg, 1995</a>). Therefore, predation risk is greater in the low and outer parts of a tree than higher up or in cover from branches and twigs in the inner tree zones (
  <a rid="BIO013839C21" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C21">Ekman, 1986</a>; 
  <a rid="BIO013839C47" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C47">Kullberg, 1995</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a study in SW Sweden, the proportion of various bird species in the diet of 
  <span class="italic">G. passerinum</span> was compared with their relative abundance in the local habitat. 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span>, which forages near the trunk, was preyed upon about as expected from its relative abundance, whereas 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span>, which forages farther out, was preyed upon more than expected and 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> even more so, which is in accord with its use of exposed foraging sites (Table 2 in 
  <a rid="BIO013839C21" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C21">Ekman, 1986</a>). A survey of six field studies in Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia likewise showed that 
  <span class="italic">G. passerinum</span> preys consistently more heavily on 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> and 
  <span class="italic">R. regulus</span> and less on 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> than expected from their relative abundance in the local bird community (
  <a rid="BIO013839C67" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C67">Suhonen et al., 1993</a>). Empirical results thus confirm that 
  <span class="italic">G. passerinum</span> takes disproportionately many 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> – as expected in view of its exposed foraging sites – whereas 
  <span class="italic">A. nisus</span> unexpectedly takes disproportionately few 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> (see above; 
  <a rid="BIO013839C25" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C25">Götmark and Post, 1996</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Predation by 
  <span class="italic">G. passerinum</span> has been shown to determine the choice of foraging sites by tits to various extents depending on the availability of small rodents, which are preferred prey of the owl. In one winter when rodent populations were at a peak level in Finland, voles and shrews 
  <span class="italic">Sorex</span> spp. together made up 98% and birds 2% of the diet of 
  <span class="italic">G. passerinum</span>. In the next winter, the rodent populations had crashed and rodent trap-catches dropped to 0.6% of the value in the previous winter, from 32 to 0.2 captured individuals per 100 trap-nights. At this rodent population low, 
  <span class="italic">G. passerinum</span> switched to eating birds, after which 40% of its winter diet consisted of rodents and shrews while birds made up 60%. Following this huge shift in the owl's diet, 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> responded behaviourally and foraged less on the outer, exposed regions of spruce trees and more often on the inner parts of branches (
  <a rid="BIO013839C65" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C65">Suhonen, 1993</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> are claimed to be socially dominant over 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> and to exclude it from their foraging zones, which leaves it to forage in the risky outer canopy (
  <a rid="BIO013839C41" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C41">Hogstad, 1978</a>; 
  <a rid="BIO013839C6" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C6">Alatalo and Moreno, 1987</a>;

  <a rid="BIO013839C65" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C65">Suhonen, 1993</a>). Rank order has been observed to determine feeding site partitioning also at the intraspecific level. In 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span>, dominant adults expel subordinate first-year birds from the upper tree regions in winter, leaving them to forage lower in trees where they are more vulnerable to predation (
  <a rid="BIO013839C22" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C22">Ekman and Askenmo, 1984</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <a ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB7" href="#BIO013839TB7">Table 7</a> shows the distribution of potential predators on 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span>. The hobby 
  <span class="italic">Falco subbuteo</span> is specialised on open-air hunting and the goshawk 
  <span class="italic">Accipiter gentilis</span> mostly takes large prey, so both have little impact on tits. 
  <span class="italic">A. nisus</span> is a breeding resident on the mainland of Denmark, Norway and Sweden and on all islands except Anholt. 
  <span class="italic">G. passerinum</span> is a breeding resident on the mainland of Norway, Sweden and Finland. It has also been recorded on the island of Åland (
  <a rid="BIO013839C37" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C37">Haila, 1981</a>; 
  <a rid="BIO013839C48" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C48">Kullberg and Ekman, 2000</a>), but the population density is low there and its breeding status uncertain (The Finnish Breeding Bird Atlas). It is absent from all the other islands as well as from the Danish mainland Jylland.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The islands have different numbers of resident raptor species (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB7" href="#BIO013839TB7">Table 7</a>). There are three on Gotska Sandön and Gotland, two on Sjælland, one on Bornholm and Læsø and none on Anholt. And yet, 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> has increased in size to a similar extent on all six islands (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F1" href="#BIO013839F1">Figs 1</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F3" href="#BIO013839F3">3</a>; 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB2" href="#BIO013839TB2">Tables 2</a>-
  <a ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB4" href="#BIO013839TB4">4</a>). So, the large size of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> on the islands is not driven by predation. But its body size on the mainland might be influenced indirectly by predators in so far as they affect niche partitioning among tits to the effect that 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> forage in the safer inner tree regions. By force of their putative dominance, they may expel 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> from the inner parts, leaving it to forage in the exposed tree periphery (
  <a rid="BIO013839C41" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C41">Hogstad, 1978</a>; 
  <a rid="BIO013839C6" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C6">Alatalo and Moreno, 1987</a>;

  <a rid="BIO013839C65" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C65">Suhonen, 1993</a>). Once there, it is subject to selection for agility and a small body size.
