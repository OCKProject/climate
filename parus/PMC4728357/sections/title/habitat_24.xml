 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span>, the absence of 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> from the islands is the most important habitat difference from the Swedish mainland. Other than that, island habitats are often considered to be impoverished in relation to their mainland counterparts, implying that the abundance and diversity of food items are less on islands (
  <a rid="BIO013839C50" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C50">Lack, 1976</a>). If that were to affect body size, island birds might be smaller than mainland conspecifics due to direct effects on the phenotype during the nestling period, or because of evolutionary adaptation to poor food conditions. But 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> is instead larger on the islands.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Island forests might have characteristics that favour a large body size in 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span>. But forest structure and tree species composition vary considerably between islands and there is no forest feature that is shared by all islands and distinguishes them from the mainland. As an example, the forest is 100% pine 
  <span class="italic">Pinus silvestris</span> on Gotska Sandön, whereas spruce 
  <span class="italic">Picea</span> spp. and 
  <span class="italic">Abies</span> spp. make up 77% of the forests on Bornholm (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB6" href="#BIO013839TB6">Table 6</a>). Yet 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> is about the same size on both islands. The possibility that some feature of planted forests on the islands of Bornholm, Anholt and Læsø underlies the large body size is refuted by the fact that 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> is as large also on the islands of Gotska Sandön and Gotland, the forests of which are indigenous and natural.
