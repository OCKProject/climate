 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Founder effect</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This refers to the reduction of genetic variation that occurs when a population is established by a small number of pioneers. When there are few individuals in a colonizing group, random processes increase the likelihood that the group brings with it a skewed gene sample that is not representative of the parent population. This may contribute to evolutionary divergence.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> is sedentary the whole year round but performs irruptive migrations at irregular intervals. The islands were most likely colonized by mainland birds that took part in such irruptions. But the probability is only 0.5
  <span class="sup">8</span>=0.004 that all eight places, from which one or two congeners are absent, were colonized by larger than average-sized mainland birds by chance alone. So random founder events cannot account for the large size of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> in all eight places.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We will now look at the size of present-day migrants of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater.</span> Judging by observations during an autumn irruption in 1990, migrants consist almost exclusively of juveniles. On that occasion, 716 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> were netted and ringed at Falsterbo Bird Observatory and all of them were first-year birds (Lennart Karlsson, personal communication).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The hand-wing and the tarsus of first-year birds on southbound autumn migration were measured by staff ornithologists at the Falsterbo Bird Observatory, who used the measuring technique described in the methods section herein. Hand-wing length of migrants was remarkably similar between samples in different years. The average length was 61.26 mm (s.d. 1.62) for 273 migrating 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> measured in September and October 1982-1986 (Göran Walinder, personal communication) and 61.23 mm (s.d. 1.51) for 180 birds measured in September and October 1990 (Lennart Karlsson, personal communication). This gives an overall average of 61.25 mm for migrants. The hand-wing length of resident first-year birds that we measured on the mainland was 60.9 mm in SW Sweden, 61.0 mm in SE Sweden and 61.3 mm in SC Sweden, with an average of 61.0 mm for the pooled mainland sample (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB2" href="#BIO013839TB2">Table 2</a>). Residents in SC Sweden thus had a longer hand-wing than migrants. But the hand-wing in the pooled mainland sample is 0.4% shorter than in migrants (61.0 vs 61.25 mm). By contrast, hand-wing length of island birds exceeds that of mainland residents by up to 4.3% (63.6 on Bornholm vs 61.0 mm on the mainland; 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB2" href="#BIO013839TB2">Table 2</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The average length of the tarsus was 18.60 mm (s.d. 0.59) in the 180 autumn migrants measured in 1990 (Lennart Karlsson, personal communication). The tarsus length of resident first-year birds that we measured on the mainland was 18.4 mm in SW Sweden, 18.3 mm in SE Sweden and 18.2 mm in SC Sweden (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB3" href="#BIO013839TB3">Table 3</a>), with an overall average of 18.34 mm for mainland birds. So, the tarsus was 1.4% longer in migrants than in mainland residents (18.60 vs 18.34 mm). This is a small difference as compared, for example, with the 6.3% that separate birds on the island of Gotland from mainland residents (19.5 mm vs 18.34; 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB3" href="#BIO013839TB3">Table 3</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, judging by the wing and tarsus measurements of present-day migrants, the islands were not colonized by big immigrants arriving from the mainland without further size change. The size of present-day migrants instead suggests that island colonizers were similar in size to mainland residents and that a size increase came about by local evolutionary adaptation following colonization.</p>
