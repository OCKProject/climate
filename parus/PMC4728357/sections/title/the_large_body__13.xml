 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two cross-fostering experiments have been done to find out whether the large size of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> on the islands has a genetic basis. The switch occurred at the egg-stage and involved entire clutches in both experiments. In the first case, eggs were exchanged between nests on the island of Anholt and nests in an area 50 km east of Gothenburg in south-western Sweden (R.Å.N. and Raimo Neergaard-Thörgersen, unpublished). In the other, eggs were exchanged between nests in the southern part of the island of Gotland and nests in an area near the city of Uppsala in east-central Sweden (

  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> on the islands is genetically determined and not due to environmental effects on the phenotype.
