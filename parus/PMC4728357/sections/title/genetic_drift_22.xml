 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This is divergence of allele frequencies and associated phenotype traits between separated populations through random processes. It is distinct from any divergence already present due to founder effects. Genetic drift arises from random survival and random allele sampling during reproduction and is more likely to result in accidental loss of alleles the smaller the population. It is distinct from divergence due to local adaptation by natural selection.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A random change of body size is equally likely in either direction. Therefore, the increased size of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> in all eight places studied has a probability of independent, random occurrence of 0.5
  <span class="sup">8</span>=0.004. In addition to the size changes in the predicted direction, also the magnitude of increase is in accord with predictions. Therefore, genetic drift can be ruled out as a cause for the consistent increase in body size.
