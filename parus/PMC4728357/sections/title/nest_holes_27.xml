 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If nest holes are in short supply, large individuals would get a competitive advantage. At a field site in Belgium, the mean size of 
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span> showed a decreasing trend in the period 1962â€“1975. This was concomitant with the provision of an abundance of nest boxes. Therefore, the progressive reduction in body size during this period was interpreted to be the result of relaxed competition for nest holes, whereby big individuals lost some of their advantage (

  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> nests readily in holes under tree roots and stones, so it is unlikely that there is a shortage of nest holes either on the mainland or on the islands.
