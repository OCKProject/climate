 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among the three 
  <span class="italic">Parus</span> species that coexist in coniferous forests in Scandinavia, 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> (9.4 g) is the smallest, 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> (11.0 g) comes next and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> (11.5 g) is largest (mass of first-year birds from the Swedish mainland; 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB2" href="#BIO013839TB2">Table 2</a>). Selection for efficiency and energy economy leads to coadaptation between the body size and the specific feeding sites, body postures and locomotion modes used during foraging (

  <a rid="BIO013839C33" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C33">Haftorn, 1956c</a>; 
  <a rid="BIO013839C49" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C49">Lack, 1971</a>; 
  <a rid="BIO013839C56" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C56">Norberg, 1979</a>; 
  <a rid="BIO013839C52" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C52">Moreno and Carrascal, 1993</a>). Locomotor agility and flight manoeuvrability show a strong inverse relationship with body size (
  <a rid="BIO013839C10" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C10">Andersson and Norberg, 1981</a>). A small body size will therefore be more strongly selected for the more often that mechanically demanding foraging postures and energetically expensive locomotion modes are used during foraging. In places where 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> is geographically isolated from its larger congeneric competitors, it has taken over their more accessible foraging sites in trees and adopted their less demanding foraging behaviour (
  <a rid="BIO013839C9" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C9">Alerstam, et al., 1974</a>; 
  <a rid="BIO013839C7" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C7">Alatalo, et al., 1985</a>: 
  <a rid="BIO013839C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C29">Gustafsson 1988</a>). The new selection regime should shift the balance between opposing selection forces towards a larger body size.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In suitable habitat on the Swedish mainland, the population density is about 14 individuals per km
  <span class="sup">2</span> for 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span>, 10 for 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 16 for 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> (
  <a rid="BIO013839C71" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C71">Ulfstrand and Högstedt, 1976</a>; 
  <a rid="BIO013839C64" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C64">SOF, 1990</a>). So the ecological space per unit forest area is about equally wide for each species. In geographic isolation on islands, 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> therefore has access to three similarly sized niche spaces, two of which are those of the larger absentees. 
  <span class="italic">Our first a priori prediction is that on all six islands, from which</span> P. cristatus 
  <span class="italic">and</span> P. montanus 
  <span class="italic">are absent,</span> P. ater 
  <span class="italic">is larger than its conspecifics on the Swedish mainland and near the average size as taken across</span> P. ater
  <span class="italic">,</span> P. cristatus 
  <span class="italic">and</span> P. montanus 
  <span class="italic">in sympatry on the Swedish mainland.</span>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In two other places, 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> co-occurs with one coniferous forest tit – with 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> on the Swedish island of Öland and with 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> on the Danish mainland Jylland. But we have no information about population densities of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> or its co-existing congener either on Öland or Jylland, except that 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> occurs ‘scantily’ on Öland (
  <a rid="BIO013839C64" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C64">SOF, 1990</a>; 
  <a rid="BIO013839C48" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C48">Kullberg and Ekman, 2000</a>). Therefore, we cannot estimate what share of the single vacant resource that 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> might procure. But because the vacant niche space is smaller than on the six islands where 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> is alone, selection for a larger body size, suited to exploit the widened niche, should be relatively weak. 
  <span class="italic">Our second prediction therefore is that</span> P. ater 
  <span class="italic">has increased in size also in these two localities but not as much as on the six islands where it is isolated from both</span> P. cristatus 
  <span class="italic">and</span> P. montanus
  <span class="italic">.</span>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We included the Finnish island of Åland, located in the Baltic Sea, as a control island. It was colonized by 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> as late as in the 1930s (
  <a rid="BIO013839C38" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C38">Haila et al., 1979</a>) and now stands out from the other islands by harbouring all three coniferous forest tit species – like the Swedish mainland. 
  <span class="italic">Our third prediction is that</span> P. ater 
  <span class="italic">is the same small size on the island of Åland as on the Swedish mainland.</span>
