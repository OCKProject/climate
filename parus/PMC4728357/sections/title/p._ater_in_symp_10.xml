  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> in sympatry with one competitor in two places
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> co-occurs with 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> on the Danish peninsula Jylland and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> co-occurs with 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> on the island of Öland. But we have no data on the population density of 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> on Jylland or of 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> on Öland, except that 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> occurs scantily on Öland (

  <a rid="BIO013839C48" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C48">Kullberg and Ekman, 2000</a>). So we do not know how strong interspecific competition that 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> is exposed to in these two places.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the absence of only one of the two larger coniferous forest congeners, 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> is nonetheless larger in both places than on the Swedish mainland where it coexists with both 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F1" href="#BIO013839F1">Figs 1</a>, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F3" href="#BIO013839F3">3</a>;

  <a ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB4" href="#BIO013839TB4">4</a>). The comparison of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> from the Swedish mainland with conspecifics from Jylland and Öland involves 12 measures of body size. Of the resulting 24 comparisons, 17 show statistically significant differences in the expected direction, whereas 7 do not. The latter are wing area, bill depth and tail length of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> on Jylland; and body mass, wing area, bill depth and tail length of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> on Öland. But there is not a single local mean measurement of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> that is smaller in any of these two places than on the Swedish mainland (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB2" href="#BIO013839TB2">Tables 2</a>-
  <a ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB4" href="#BIO013839TB4">4</a>; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F3" href="#BIO013839F3">Fig. 3</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Neither in Jylland nor on Öland does the overall size of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> reach the size attained on any of the six islands, from which both 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> are absent. This is as predicted because the niche space of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> is narrower on Öland and Jylland, both places of which offer only one vacant niche – that of one absentee – that may be divided up by the two species present. But on the six islands, where 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> is alone, there are two vacant foraging niches – those of the two absent congeners – that can be added in their entirety to the foraging space of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span>. Inclusion by 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> of the foraging sites of the absentees entails adoption of their less demanding locomotion modes, which relaxes selection for manoeuvrability and a small size.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The probability is 0.5
  <span class="sup">8</span>=0.004 that a size change would occur towards larger birds independently, and at random, on all six islands where 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> is alone, as well as on Jylland and Öland where one competing congener is lacking. And except for the change of body size in the predicted direction in all eight places, where it was expected to happen, also the magnitude of the size increase is as anticipated.
