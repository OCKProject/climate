  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> in sympatry with 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> on the island of Åland
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The island of Åland is included as a control because it is comparable to the other six islands except that it harbours all three tit species – like the Swedish mainland. Among 12 measurements of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span>, the body mass and tibiotarsus length are significantly larger on Åland than on the Swedish mainland (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB2" href="#BIO013839TB2">Tables 2</a>-
  <a ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB4" href="#BIO013839TB4">4</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the mainland, the body mass averages 9.35 g for juveniles and 9.34 g for adults, whereas juveniles on the Åland island weigh 9.80 g and adults 9.46 g (
  <span class="italic">n</span>=5). This is 0.45 g and 4.8% respectively 0.12 g and 1.3% more than for mainland birds. In general, such small differences in body mass may not be reliable measures of body size because they can be due to different feeding conditions and different times of day for weighing. In a study in Norway, the daily mass increase of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> amounted to 9.8-10.6% (
  <a rid="BIO013839C34" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C34">Haftorn, 1992</a>), which is twice the difference between mainland and Åland birds. As noted above, body mass seems to be decoupled from the other size measures also among 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> from SE Sweden (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F3" href="#BIO013839F3">Fig. 3</a>; 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB2" href="#BIO013839TB2">Tables 2</a>-
  <a ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB4" href="#BIO013839TB4">4</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The difference in tibiotarsus length is small. On Åland, the average length is 24.4 mm for juveniles and 23.9 mm for adults (
  <span class="italic">n</span>=5) vs 24.1 mm both for juveniles and adults on the Swedish mainland. So the tibiotarsus is actually shorter in adults on Åland. And wing area, wingspan and bill depth are smaller in juvenile birds on Åland than on the Swedish mainland, whereas the other measurements are very similar between Åland and the Swedish mainland (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F2" href="#BIO013839F2">Fig. 2</a>; 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB2" href="#BIO013839TB2">Tables 2</a>-
  <a ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB4" href="#BIO013839TB4">4</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Taken together, the measurements show that 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> is the same small size on Åland as on the Swedish mainland (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB2" href="#BIO013839TB2">Tables 2</a>-
  <a ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB4" href="#BIO013839TB4">4</a>; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F1" href="#BIO013839F1">Figs 1</a>, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F3" href="#BIO013839F3">3</a>). This is expected since 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> coexists with 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> on Åland – like on the Swedish mainland – entailing similar interspecific competition.
