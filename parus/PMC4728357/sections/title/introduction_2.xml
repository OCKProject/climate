 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adaptation to local conditions is a key process in the evolution of biological diversity. Here we explore whether reduced interspecific competition in island populations of the coal tit 
  <span class="italic">Parus ater</span> has brought about any evolutionary change in ecologically important aspects of morphology.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We follow the nomenclature of 
  <a rid="BIO013839C17" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C17">Dickinson (2003)</a> with regard to the genus 
  <span class="italic">Parus</span>. The mainland of Sweden and Norway south of latitude 61°N, covered by the map in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F1" href="#BIO013839F1">Fig. 1</a>, is inhabited by six 
  <span class="italic">Parus</span> species. Three of them, the coal tit 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span>, the crested tit 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and the willow tit 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> are strictly confined to coniferous forest, which is their preferred habitat, except that 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> also inhabits the alpine birch zone (
  <span class="italic">Betula spp.</span>) in northernmost Scandinavia (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ecologically important aspects of morphology, and in particular the overall body size, are co-adapted with the characteristic feeding sites, body postures and locomotion modes used by the respective tit species during foraging (

  <a rid="BIO013839C52" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C52">Moreno and Carrascal, 1993</a>). When 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> coexists with its larger congeners, it occupies peripheral foraging sites in trees, which requires excellent manoeuvrability and energy-expensive locomotion modes. For mechanical and aerodynamic reasons, small birds have better locomotor capacity and lower energy costs for locomotion than larger ones (
  <a rid="BIO013839C10" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C10">Andersson and Norberg, 1981</a>), so small size is favoured in sympatry.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the island of Gotland, where 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> are naturally absent, 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> has extended its foraging niche and exploits also the inner tree zones that are normally used by the absentees (
  <a rid="BIO013839C9" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C9">Alerstam et al., 1974</a>; 
  <a rid="BIO013839C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C29">Gustafsson, 1988</a>). Partial niche takeover occurred also in experimental forest plots on the mainland of east-central Sweden; after the population density of 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> had been experimentally reduced by more than 50%, their foraging zones in the inner canopy parts were used more frequently by 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> and 
  <span class="italic">R. regulus</span> (
  <a rid="BIO013839C7" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C7">Alatalo et al., 1985</a>). And an aviary experiment, which tested 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> against each other, showed that when 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> tits were removed, 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> turned to exploiting also the characteristic foraging sites of 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> in the inner tree parts (
  <a rid="BIO013839C6" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C6">Alatalo and Moreno, 1987</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because competitors are absent from Gotland, 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> has access to a wider food base, which has enabled it to increase its population density and make up numerically for the two absent species (
  <a rid="BIO013839C9" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C9">Alerstam et al., 1974</a>; 
  <a rid="BIO013839C8" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C8">Alatalo et al., 1986</a>). This probably leads to enhanced intraspecific interference competition with concomitant selection for large body size. And the takeover by 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> of the foraging sites of the absentees entails adoption of their easier and less demanding locomotion modes. Selection for manoeuvrability and a small body size is thus relaxed when 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> is geographically isolated from 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span>. Therefore, any evolutionary shift in body size, which might occur in 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> because of relaxed interspecific competition and ensuing niche enlargement, should be towards a larger size.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here we test this 
  <span class="italic">a priori</span> hypothesis by comparing 11 morphological measurements that we collected from living specimens of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> on the Swedish mainland and on six islands where 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> are naturally absent. The island populations serve as six independent replicates.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results reported here are based on fieldwork that we performed in the four consecutive years 1979–1982. A study, done subsequent to the completion of our fieldwork, compared the size of a single trait – the tarsus length – of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> between the island of Gotland and an area near Uppsala on the mainland of east-central Sweden (
  <a rid="BIO013839C5" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C5">Alatalo and Gustafsson, 1988</a>). Birds on Gotland had longer tarsi than mainland birds and the large size was shown to be genetically determined.
