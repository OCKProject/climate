  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> when 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> are absent
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We will now examine how the absence of 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> from the islands influences niche width and foraging behaviour of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> and the selection acting on it. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F4" href="#BIO013839F4">Fig. 4</a> shows some ecological factors that are likely to determine the difference in body size of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> between the mainland and islands. We distinguish between forces that select for a large size – acting rightwards in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F4" href="#BIO013839F4">Fig. 4</a> – and those that select for a small size – acting leftwards – and evaluate their relative strengths on the mainland and the islands.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The population density of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> has been determined on the island of Gotland, where 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> are naturally absent. In the winter months December-February, 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> occurred at 5-15 times higher densities in forests of 
  <span class="italic">Pinus silvestris</span> on Gotland than in forests dominated by 
  <span class="italic">Picea abies</span> on the mainland of southern Sweden (
  <a rid="BIO013839C9" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C9">Alerstam et al., 1974</a>). The high population density of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> on Gotland was confirmed in a later study. In the winter months January-February, there were 90-110 individuals per km
  <span class="sup">2</span> on Gotland vs 20 per km
  <span class="sup">2</span> on the mainland of east-central Sweden, a difference by a factor 5 (Appendix in 
  <a rid="BIO013839C8" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C8">Alatalo et al., 1986</a>). 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> thus compensates numerically for the two absent species on Gotland and reaches a population density that is similar to the combined density of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span>, 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> on the Swedish mainland (
  <a rid="BIO013839C9" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C9">Alerstam et al., 1974</a>; 
  <a rid="BIO013839C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C29">Gustafsson, 1988</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On Gotland, 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> has expanded its niche width and exploits the foraging sites used elsewhere by the two absent species (
  <a rid="BIO013839C9" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C9">Alerstam et al., 1974</a>; 
  <a rid="BIO013839C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C29">Gustafsson, 1988</a>). And in a mainland study area near the city of Uppsala in east-central Sweden, 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> expanded its foraging niche in a similar way after the number of 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> had been experimentally reduced by more than 50% (
  <a rid="BIO013839C7" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C7">Alatalo et al., 1985</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The niche expansion of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> enlarges its food base so the associated increase in population density need not necessarily strengthen intraspecific competition for food. But the increased population density likely intensifies behavioural interference competition. This, in turn, should select for a large body size (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F4" href="#BIO013839F4">Fig. 4</a>, point 1).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Body size is also related to feeding site selection and locomotor modes during foraging. 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> are specialized to forage on the middle and proximal parts of branches and on tree trunks, and their large size is probably an adaptation for this. There are pronounced differences in feeding site selection and foraging behaviour of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> between, on the one hand, the island of Åland and the Swedish mainland and, on the other hand, the island of Gotland. In coexistence with 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> on the island of Åland and on the mainland (near the city of Uppsala in east-central Sweden), 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> foraged almost exclusively in the needle-carrying parts of pine trees, spending 90% of its foraging time there and 10% on twigs. In allopatry on Gotland, however, 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> spent only 24% among needled twigs, but 29% on needle-free twigs, 40% on thick parts of branches and 7% on the trunk of 
  <span class="italic">Pinus silvestris</span> (Fig. 1 and appendix in 
  <a rid="BIO013839C8" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C8">Alatalo et al., 1986</a>; Fig. 1 in 
  <a rid="BIO013839C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C29">Gustafsson, 1988</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A partial niche takeover occurred also in experimental forest plots on the mainland of east-central Sweden. After the density of 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> had been experimentally reduced by more than 50%, 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> and 
  <span class="italic">R. regulus</span> increased their foraging rate in the inner canopy parts, which is the foraging zone of the two population-reduced species (
  <a rid="BIO013839C7" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C7">Alatalo et al., 1985</a>). And an aviary experiment, which tested 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> against each other, showed that when 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> tits were removed, 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> turned to exploiting also the characteristic foraging sites of 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> in the inner tree parts (
  <a rid="BIO013839C6" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C6">Alatalo and Moreno, 1987</a>). In all these cases, 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> shifted from foraging predominantly on the peripheral twigs and needles to foraging also on the middle and basal branch parts and on the trunk.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The increased use of the inner tree regions by 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> when 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> are absent gives more opportunity for obtaining food by pecking and tearing in bark and wood. These activities are favoured by a large body size, which is therefore selected for in 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> on the islands (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F4" href="#BIO013839F4">Fig. 4</a>, point 2).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the mainland, 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> made frequent short flights in the tree periphery, hovered occasionally and often hung underneath slender and pliant twigs, activities that require good manoeuvrability and are expensive in energy. But on Gotland, it mostly moved by hops on top of branches in an upright position (Appendix in 
  <a rid="BIO013839C8" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C8">Alatalo et al., 1986</a>; Fig. 1 in 
  <a rid="BIO013839C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C29">Gustafsson, 1988</a>). The shift to foraging more frequently in the inner parts of trees on Gotland is thus associated with a change to easier and less energy-expensive postures and locomotion modes.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Niche differentiation with respect to body size occurs also at the intraspecific level between different-sized individuals of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span>. In isolation from 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> on Gotland, large individuals of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> often used the inner parts of trees whereas small individuals foraged more in the needle-carrying outer regions (
  <a rid="BIO013839C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C29">Gustafsson, 1988</a>). Five size measures – tarsus length, bill length, length of the first secondary wing feather, hand-wing length and tail length – were correlated with body mass, and tarsus length was a particularly reliable measure of body size. The range of size variation was 18.6–20.1 mm for tarsus length and 9.0–11.1 g for body mass (read from Fig. 5B and C in 
  <a rid="BIO013839C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C29">Gustafsson, 1988</a>). So, it was within these limited ranges of variation that a body-size-related niche differentiation was observed among 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> on Gotland. This intraspecific differentiation of feeding sites among different-sized individuals of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> mirrors the interspecific body-size-related feeding site differentiation that occurs among 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span>, 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> where they coexist on the Swedish mainland. It emphasizes the tight association between body size and foraging zone in trees.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Flight manoeuvrability and general agility increase with decreasing body size for aerodynamic and mechanical reasons (
  <a rid="BIO013839C10" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C10">Andersson and Norberg, 1981</a>). And the energy cost of locomotion decreases with decreasing body mass. During short flights within trees, birds often do not attain the maximum-range cruising speed at which energy cost per unit distance is minimized. At slower speeds, energy cost goes up more the lower the speed, peaking at hovering (
  <a rid="BIO013839C60" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C60">Pennycuick, 2008</a>). In addition, short flights in tree canopies contain a disproportionately large proportion of energy-expensive manoeuvres, such as take-off and landing and twists and turns for negotiating obstacles in the cluttered canopy space. In an experimental study of 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span>, kept in aviaries that only permitted short flights, the energy cost for flight, measured with the doubly-labelled water technique, was 27–32% higher than that calculated for direct flight at normal cruising speed (
  <a rid="BIO013839C15" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C15">Carlson and Moreno, 1992</a>). So, flight within tree canopies is energetically very expensive.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the mainland, 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> flies more frequently while foraging than do 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> (
  <a rid="BIO013839C53" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C53">Moreno et al., 1988</a>). To see how that affects energy expenditure, the daily field metabolic rate was measured in 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span>, 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> under natural conditions, using the doubly-labelled water technique. The measurements were made on free-ranging birds when temperatures were below freezing in mid-winter (December-January) in a forest near Uppsala in east-central Sweden. The daily metabolic rate turned out to be a higher multiple of the basal metabolic rate in 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> than in 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus.</span> It was 2.89× BMR for 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> and 2.22× BMR for each of the other two, a difference by a factor 1.3 (
  <a rid="BIO013839C53" ref-type="bibr" href="#BIO013839C53">Moreno et al., 1988</a>). The difference is obviously a consequence of the more frequent use of energy-demanding locomotion modes, like flight, by 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the mainland, small size is therefore particularly important to 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> for keeping down energy costs for locomotion (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F4" href="#BIO013839F4">Fig. 4</a>, point 4). But because a lower proportion of the foraging time is spent in the canopy periphery on the islands, selection for a small body size must be weaker there than on the mainland (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F4" href="#BIO013839F4">Fig. 4</a>, point 3-5). In addition, a small size is favoured more when foraging in the tight spaces in the meshwork of twigs and needles in the periphery of the tree canopy than when foraging in less cluttered spaces near the trunk (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F4" href="#BIO013839F4">Fig. 4</a>, point 5).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conclude that the evolutionary increase in body size of 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span> on the islands is due ultimately to the absence of 
  <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. montanus</span>. It was likely brought about by the combination of intensified selection for a large size, due to increased intraspecific interference competition following niche expansion and population increase, and weakened selection for a small size following a shift to easier foraging modes on the islands (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F4" href="#BIO013839F4">Fig. 4</a>). Other selection forces on body size are discussed under ‘Alternative explanations’. But they act in the opposite direction to the evolutionary change that has actually taken place and therefore cannot explain it. Their effect is obviously overridden by the selection forces reviewed above.
