   <span class="bold">Map of southern Sweden and adjacent islands showing the location of 12 sampling places and Falsterbo Bird Observatory.</span> The map reaches north to latitude 61°N, whereas the coniferous forest tits 
   <span class="italic">P. ater</span> (
   <span class="italic">P.a.</span>), 
   <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> (
   <span class="italic">P.c.</span>) and 
   <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> (
   <span class="italic">P.m.</span>) coexist on the Swedish mainland up to about 63°N. Measurements of 
   <span class="italic">P. ater</span> in SW Sweden are used as reference values. Black bars show by how many percent 
   <span class="italic">P. ater</span> at each of the 11 other places differs from 
   <span class="italic">P. ater</span> in SW Sweden. Each bar represents an average difference as calculated across three measurements. The left bar (W) shows the average of the percentage difference from the SW Swedish birds in (wing area)
   <span class="sup">0.5</span>, wing span and hand-wing length. The middle bar (L) shows the average percentage difference across tibiotarsus, tarsus ‘short’ and foot. And the right bar (B) shows the average percentage difference across bill length, width and height. As indicated at the graphs, 
   <span class="italic">P. ater</span> coexists with 
   <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> and 
   <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> on the Swedish mainland and the Finnish island of Åland. And 
   <span class="italic">P. ater</span> is the same size in these places. The larger competitors 
   <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
   <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> are absent from the islands Gotska Sandön, Gotland, Bornholm, Sjælland, Anholt and Læsø. And an evolutionary increase of the body size of 
   <span class="italic">P. ater</span> has taken place on all six islands. 
   <span class="italic">P. ater</span> coexists with 
   <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> on the Danish penisnsula Jylland and with 
   <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> on the island of Öland
   <span class="italic">.</span> The size of 
   <span class="italic">P. ater</span> has increased also in these places, but not as much as where both 
   <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> and 
   <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> are absent. The inset at top left shows how much 
   <span class="italic">P. montanus</span> and 
   <span class="italic">P. cristatus</span> from SW and SE Sweden differs from the reference values for 
   <span class="italic">P. ater</span> in SW Sweden.
