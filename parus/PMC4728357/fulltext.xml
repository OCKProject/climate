The large size is genetically determined, as ascertained by clutch exchange experiments between island and mainland nests. We conclude that the increased size of <italic>P. ater</italic> in places where it is geographically isolated from its larger congeners is the result of evolutionary adaptation, due ultimately to relaxed interspecific competition. On the islands, <italic>P. ater</italic> has evolved into a medium-sized generalist, with selection pressures likely governed by the following causal relationships. When competitors are lacking, <italic>P. ater</italic> takes over the foraging space of the absentees. The enlarged food base allows higher population densities, which intensifies intraspecific interference competition. This, in turn, selects for increased body size. When <italic>P. ater</italic> coexists with its larger congeners, it occupies peripheral foraging sites in trees, which requires excellent manoeuvrability and energy-expensive locomotion modes. Reduction of body size increases locomotor capacity for mechanical and aerodynamic reasons and lowers energy consumption, so small size is favoured in sympatry. But in geographic isolation, <italic>P. ater</italic> exploits the tree periphery less and the inner tree regions more, and it also adopts the easier locomotion modes of the absent species. Therefore, selection for manoeuvrability and a small body size is relaxed. The new selection regime shifts the balance between opposing selection forces towards a larger body size. We were able to test 11 alternative hypotheses and available evidence conclusively eliminates them all. As a result, here, evolution could be predicted regarding both direction and amount of change.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="precis"><p><bold>Summary:</bold> On six widely separated Scandinavian islands, an enlarged food base and intraspecific competition has caused the coal tit <italic>Parus ater</italic> to evolve morphologically in the direction of two absent competitors.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>KEY WORDS</title><kwd>Parus ater</kwd><kwd>Character release</kwd><kwd>Coal tit</kwd><kwd>Competition</kwd><kwd>Evolution</kwd><kwd>Evolution on islands</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Adaptation to local conditions is a key process in the evolution of biological diversity.

When <italic>P. ater</italic> coexists with its larger congeners, it occupies peripheral foraging sites in trees, which requires excellent manoeuvrability and energy-expensive locomotion modes. For mechanical and aerodynamic reasons, small birds have better locomotor capacity and lower energy costs for locomotion than larger ones (<xref rid="BIO013839C10" ref-type="bibr">Andersson and Norberg, 1981</xref>), so small size is favoured in sympatry.</p><p>On the island of Gotland, where <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> are naturally absent, <italic>P. ater</italic> has extended its foraging niche and exploits also the inner tree zones that are normally used by the absentees (<xref rid="BIO013839C9" ref-type="bibr">Alerstam et al., 1974</xref>; <xref rid="BIO013839C29" ref-type="bibr">Gustafsson, 1988</xref>). Partial niche takeover occurred also in experimental forest plots on the mainland of east-central Sweden; after the population density of <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> had been experimentally reduced by more than 50%, their foraging zones in the inner canopy parts were used more frequently by <italic>P. ater</italic> and <italic>R. regulus</italic> (<xref rid="BIO013839C7" ref-type="bibr">Alatalo et al., 1985</xref>). And an aviary experiment, which tested <italic>P. ater</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> against each other, showed that when <italic>P. montanus</italic> tits were removed, <italic>P. ater</italic> turned to exploiting also the characteristic foraging sites of <italic>P. montanus</italic> in the inner tree parts (<xref rid="BIO013839C6" ref-type="bibr">Alatalo and Moreno, 1987</xref>).</p><p>Because competitors are absent from Gotland, <italic>P. ater</italic> has access to a wider food base, which has enabled it to increase its population density and make up numerically for the two absent species (<xref rid="BIO013839C9" ref-type="bibr">Alerstam et al., 1974</xref>; <xref rid="BIO013839C8" ref-type="bibr">Alatalo et al., 1986</xref>). This probably leads to enhanced intraspecific interference competition with concomitant selection for large body size. And the takeover by <italic>P. ater</italic> of the foraging sites of the absentees entails adoption of their easier and less demanding locomotion modes. Selection for manoeuvrability and a small body size is thus relaxed when <italic>P. ater</italic> is geographically isolated from <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic>. Therefore, any evolutionary shift in body size, which might occur in <italic>P. ater</italic> because of relaxed interspecific competition and ensuing niche enlargement, should be towards a larger size.</p><p>Here we test this <italic>a priori</italic> hypothesis by comparing 11 morphological measurements that we collected from living specimens of <italic>P. ater</italic> on the Swedish mainland and on six islands where <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> are naturally absent. The island populations serve as six independent replicates.</p><p>The results reported here are based on fieldwork that we performed in the four consecutive years 1979&#x02013;1982. A study, done subsequent to the completion of our fieldwork, compared the size of a single trait &#x02013; the tarsus length &#x02013; of <italic>P. ater</italic> between the island of Gotland and an area near Uppsala on the mainland of east-central Sweden (<xref rid="BIO013839C5" ref-type="bibr">Alatalo and Gustafsson, 1988</xref>). Birds on Gotland had longer tarsi than mainland birds and the large size was shown to be genetically determined.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>HYPOTHESIS AND PREDICTIONS</title><p>Among the three <italic>Parus</italic> species that coexist in coniferous forests in Scandinavia, <italic>P. ater</italic> (9.4&#x02005;g) is the smallest, <italic>P. cristatus</italic> (11.0&#x02005;g) comes next and <italic>P. montanus</italic> (11.5&#x02005;g) is largest (mass of first-year birds from the Swedish mainland; <xref ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB2">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>). Selection for efficiency and energy economy leads to coadaptation between the body size and the specific feeding sites, body postures and locomotion modes used during foraging (<xref rid="BIO013839C59" ref-type="bibr">Palmgren, 1932</xref>; <xref rid="BIO013839C33" ref-type="bibr">Haftorn, 1956c</xref>; <xref rid="BIO013839C49" ref-type="bibr">Lack, 1971</xref>; <xref rid="BIO013839C56" ref-type="bibr">Norberg, 1979</xref>; <xref rid="BIO013839C52" ref-type="bibr">Moreno and Carrascal, 1993</xref>). Locomotor agility and flight manoeuvrability show a strong inverse relationship with body size (<xref rid="BIO013839C10" ref-type="bibr">Andersson and Norberg, 1981</xref>). A small body size will therefore be more strongly selected for the more often that mechanically demanding foraging postures and energetically expensive locomotion modes are used during foraging. In places where <italic>P. ater</italic> is geographically isolated from its larger congeneric competitors, it has taken over their more accessible foraging sites in trees and adopted their less demanding foraging behaviour (<xref rid="BIO013839C9" ref-type="bibr">Alerstam, et al., 1974</xref>; <xref rid="BIO013839C7" ref-type="bibr">Alatalo, et al., 1985</xref>: <xref rid="BIO013839C29" ref-type="bibr">Gustafsson 1988</xref>). The new selection regime should shift the balance between opposing selection forces towards a larger body size.
<table-wrap id="BIO013839TB2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;2.</label><caption><p><bold>Body mass and wing dimensions of <italic>P. ater</italic></bold></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="biolopen-4-013839-i2"/></table-wrap></p><p>In suitable habitat on the Swedish mainland, the population density is about 14 individuals per km<sup>2</sup> for <italic>P. ater</italic>, 10 for <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and 16 for <italic>P. montanus</italic> (<xref rid="BIO013839C71" ref-type="bibr">Ulfstrand and H&#x000f6;gstedt, 1976</xref>; <xref rid="BIO013839C64" ref-type="bibr">SOF, 1990</xref>). So the ecological space per unit forest area is about equally wide for each species. In geographic isolation on islands, <italic>P. ater</italic> therefore has access to three similarly sized niche spaces, two of which are those of the larger absentees. <italic>Our first a priori prediction is that on all six islands, from which</italic> P. cristatus <italic>and</italic> P. montanus <italic>are absent,</italic> P. ater <italic>is larger than its conspecifics on the Swedish mainland and near the average size as taken across</italic> P. ater<italic>,</italic> P. cristatus <italic>and</italic> P. montanus <italic>in sympatry on the Swedish mainland.</italic></p><p>In two other places, <italic>P. ater</italic> co-occurs with one coniferous forest tit &#x02013; with <italic>P. montanus</italic> on the Swedish island of &#x000d6;land and with <italic>P. cristatus</italic> on the Danish mainland Jylland. But we have no information about population densities of <italic>P. ater</italic> or its co-existing congener either on &#x000d6;land or Jylland, except that <italic>P. montanus</italic> occurs &#x02018;scantily&#x02019; on &#x000d6;land (<xref rid="BIO013839C64" ref-type="bibr">SOF, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="BIO013839C48" ref-type="bibr">Kullberg and Ekman, 2000</xref>). Therefore, we cannot estimate what share of the single vacant resource that <italic>P. ater</italic> might procure. But because the vacant niche space is smaller than on the six islands where <italic>P. ater</italic> is alone, selection for a larger body size, suited to exploit the widened niche, should be relatively weak. <italic>Our second prediction therefore is that</italic> P. ater <italic>has increased in size also in these two localities but not as much as on the six islands where it is isolated from both</italic> P. cristatus <italic>and</italic> P. montanus<italic>.</italic></p><p>We included the Finnish island of &#x000c5;land, located in the Baltic Sea, as a control island.

Therefore, the higher wing loading in <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> is largely a scale effect of their larger body size. But it is noteworthy that even though <italic>P. ater</italic> is larger on the islands than on the mainland the wing loading is not higher in island birds, so in this respect there is no convergence on <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB5">Table&#x000a0;5</xref>).</p><p>The proportion that the hand-wing makes up of the wing span is 1% smaller in <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and 1.5% smaller in <italic>P. montanus</italic> than in mainland <italic>P. ater</italic>, but it is identical between mainland and island <italic>P. ater.</italic> And the wing aspect ratio is similar between <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and mainland <italic>P. ater</italic>, whereas it is 2.6% smaller in <italic>P. montanus</italic> than in mainland <italic>P. ater</italic>. But the aspect ratio of <italic>P. ater</italic>, as averaged across the six islands, is equal to that of mainland <italic>P. ater.</italic> So, wing shape of <italic>P. ater</italic> has not changed on the islands.</p><p>The ratio between tarsus and tibiotarsus is 1&#x02013;3.3% larger on the islands of Gotska Sand&#x000f6;n (ad, 0.776) and Gotland (juv, 0.777) than in mainland conspecifics (ad, 0.767; juv 0.762), so on these islands <italic>P. ater</italic> approaches the leg shape of <italic>P. cristatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB5">Table&#x000a0;5</xref>).

This is in close agreement with the ratios 0.762 and 0.767, respectively, for the unified mainland sample (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB5">Table&#x000a0;5</xref>). What is more, the tarsus/tibiotarsus ratio of mainland <italic>P. ater</italic> is similar to the mean ratio taken across <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> in allopatry on the Swedish mainland.

But it is stouter in <italic>P. montanus</italic>, being both deeper and wider and in both respects differs from <italic>P. cristatus</italic> at the 0.001 significance level.

So, when each of the depth/length and width/length bill ratios is averaged across <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic>, the mean across-species ratios are 0.376 and 0.396, respectively, which is strikingly similar to the corresponding ratios 0.376 and 0.393 of <italic>P. ater</italic> on the mainland (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB5">Table&#x000a0;5</xref>). Therefore, there is no obvious direction in which bill shape of <italic>P. ater</italic> might be expected to evolve on islands in the absence of <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic>.</p><p>But there are a few local deviations in bill shape. On the island of Anholt, the depth/length ratio of the bill of <italic>P. ater</italic> stands out by being 6.1% lower in juveniles and 8.1% lower in adults than in mainland conspecifics. In this respect, <italic>P. ater</italic> on Anholt has converged on the bill shape of mainland <italic>P. cristatus</italic> to the extent that they are almost identical; the bill's depth/length ratio of <italic>P. ater</italic> on Anholt is 0.353 in juveniles (<italic>n</italic>=11) and 0.350 in adults (<italic>n</italic>=3) vs 0.354 (<italic>n</italic>=8) and 0.360 (<italic>n</italic>=3), respectively, in <italic>P. cristatus</italic> on the mainland (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB5">Table&#x000a0;5</xref>).

But the width/length ratio for <italic>P. ater</italic>, again averaged across the six islands (juv 0.393; ad 0.389), is exactly identical to the average for mainland <italic>P. ater</italic> (juv 0.393; ad 0.389) and very similar to the average ratio taken across <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> (juv 0.396; ad 0.388) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB5">Table&#x000a0;5</xref>).</p><p>The depth/width ratio of the bill of <italic>P. ater</italic> is 6.6% lower in juveniles from Anholt (0.895) and 7.8% lower in adults from Gotska Sand&#x000f6;n (0.904) than in conspecifics on the Swedish mainland (0.958 for juveniles and 0.980 for adults). These island deviations are in the direction of <italic>P. montanus</italic> (0.933).</p><p>There are thus occasional differences in body proportions of <italic>P. ater</italic> between some of the islands and the Swedish mainland.

The lack of consistency between islands suggests the deviations are due to fortuitous founder differences or random drift. But the shape differences could also be the result of evolutionary adaptation in different directions on different islands owing to habitat differences.</p></sec><sec id="s3i"><title>The large body size of <italic>P. ater</italic> on islands is genetically determined</title><p>Two cross-fostering experiments have been done to find out whether the large size of <italic>P. ater</italic> on the islands has a genetic basis.

In the first case, eggs were exchanged between nests on the island of Anholt and nests in an area 50&#x02005;km east of Gothenburg in south-western Sweden (R.&#x000c5;.N. and Raimo Neergaard-Th&#x000f6;rgersen, unpublished). In the other, eggs were exchanged between nests in the southern part of the island of Gotland and nests in an area near the city of Uppsala in east-central Sweden (<xref rid="BIO013839C5" ref-type="bibr">Alatalo and Gustafsson, 1988</xref>). Both experiments show conclusively that the enlarged body size of <italic>P. ater</italic> on the islands is genetically determined and not due to environmental effects on the phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s3j"><title>Adaptation in island <italic>P. ater</italic> in the presence of gene flow</title><p>Body size is determined by several selection forces, some of which act in opposite directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>). The direction and strength of selection are determined by environmental conditions and behaviour and depend on the current body size. When body size has reached its optimal value, the conflicting selection forces balance out. But if conditions are different in a newly colonized area, directional selection sets in and acts to shift body size towards a new optimum. While a trait is in the process of responding to a recent selection force, the gap becomes progressively narrower between the current state and the optimum. But the strength of directional selection diminishes as the phenotype nears its optimal state, which is therefore approached asymptotically and ever more slowly.

Arrow length in each pair indicates presumed relative selection strengths in sympatry and allopatry, respectively. Conditions on the left side act to increase body size and they gain in importance in allopatry on the islands. Those on the right side act to reduce body size and they lose significance on the islands. When <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> are absent, <italic>P. ater</italic> takes over the vacant space, which creates a new selection regime. The widened food base permits a higher population density. It probably increases intraspecific, interference competition, which in turn selects for a large body size. And the take-over of foraging sites on the inner parts of branches and on the trunk, normally occupied by <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic>, gives more opportunity for obtaining food by pecking and tearing, which selects for a large size. In sympatry on the mainland, <italic>P. ater</italic> forages mainly in the canopy periphery, which requires high manoeuvrability and is expensive in energy. A low body mass improves manoeuvrability and reduces energy costs for locomotion and, in addition, facilitates access to tight spaces in the canopy periphery. The frequent use of outer branch parts by <italic>P. ater</italic> on the mainland therefore selects for a small body size. But when <italic>P. ater</italic> exploits the foraging sites of the absentees on the islands, it cuts down on its use of the canopy periphery, which relaxes selection for a small body size. Conflicting selection forces therefore cancel out at a larger body size of <italic>P. ater</italic> on the islands than on the mainland where it coexists with <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="biolopen-4-013839-g4"/></fig></p><p>Adaptive evolution on the islands will also be slowed by gene flow from the mainland population due to the occasional arrival of immigrants and ensuing interbreeding events. And adaptation comes to an end when the strength of directional selection has dropped to the level where it is offset by the rate of inflow of those genes that are selected against. In the presence of gene flow, adaptation therefore ceases before the optimal state is reached. The higher the rate of gene flow the wider the gap between the attainable character state and the optimal state. For these reasons, the locally optimal body size of <italic>P. ater</italic> may not be attained on the islands.</p><p><italic>P. ater</italic> is a permanent resident the whole year through within its range on the mainland of Norway, Sweden and Finland as well as on the islands.

In the winter months December-February, <italic>P. ater</italic> occurred at 5-15 times higher densities in forests of <italic>Pinus silvestris</italic> on Gotland than in forests dominated by <italic>Picea abies</italic> on the mainland of southern Sweden (<xref rid="BIO013839C9" ref-type="bibr">Alerstam et al., 1974</xref>). The high population density of <italic>P. ater</italic> on Gotland was confirmed in a later study. In the winter months January-February, there were 90-110 individuals per km<sup>2</sup> on Gotland vs 20 per km<sup>2</sup> on the mainland of east-central Sweden, a difference by a factor 5 (Appendix in <xref rid="BIO013839C8" ref-type="bibr">Alatalo et al., 1986</xref>). <italic>P. ater</italic> thus compensates numerically for the two absent species on Gotland and reaches a population density that is similar to the combined density of <italic>P. ater</italic>, <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> on the Swedish mainland (<xref rid="BIO013839C9" ref-type="bibr">Alerstam et al., 1974</xref>; <xref rid="BIO013839C29" ref-type="bibr">Gustafsson, 1988</xref>).</p><p>On Gotland, <italic>P. ater</italic> has expanded its niche width and exploits the foraging sites used elsewhere by the two absent species (<xref rid="BIO013839C9" ref-type="bibr">Alerstam et al., 1974</xref>; <xref rid="BIO013839C29" ref-type="bibr">Gustafsson, 1988</xref>). And in a mainland study area near the city of Uppsala in east-central Sweden, <italic>P. ater</italic> expanded its foraging niche in a similar way after the number of <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> had been experimentally reduced by more than 50% (<xref rid="BIO013839C7" ref-type="bibr">Alatalo et al., 1985</xref>).</p><p>The niche expansion of <italic>P. ater</italic> enlarges its food base so the associated increase in population density need not necessarily strengthen intraspecific competition for food. But the increased population density likely intensifies behavioural interference competition. This, in turn, should select for a large body size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>, point 1).</p><p>Body size is also related to feeding site selection and locomotor modes during foraging. <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> are specialized to forage on the middle and proximal parts of branches and on tree trunks, and their large size is probably an adaptation for this. There are pronounced differences in feeding site selection and foraging behaviour of <italic>P. ater</italic> between, on the one hand, the island of &#x000c5;land and the Swedish mainland and, on the other hand, the island of Gotland. In coexistence with <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> on the island of &#x000c5;land and on the mainland (near the city of Uppsala in east-central Sweden), <italic>P. ater</italic> foraged almost exclusively in the needle-carrying parts of pine trees, spending 90% of its foraging time there and 10% on twigs. In allopatry on Gotland, however, <italic>P. ater</italic> spent only 24% among needled twigs, but 29% on needle-free twigs, 40% on thick parts of branches and 7% on the trunk of <italic>Pinus silvestris</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;1 and appendix in <xref rid="BIO013839C8" ref-type="bibr">Alatalo et al., 1986</xref>; Fig.&#x000a0;1 in <xref rid="BIO013839C29" ref-type="bibr">Gustafsson, 1988</xref>).</p><p>A partial niche takeover occurred also in experimental forest plots on the mainland of east-central Sweden. After the density of <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> had been experimentally reduced by more than 50%, <italic>P. ater</italic> and <italic>R. regulus</italic> increased their foraging rate in the inner canopy parts, which is the foraging zone of the two population-reduced species (<xref rid="BIO013839C7" ref-type="bibr">Alatalo et al., 1985</xref>). And an aviary experiment, which tested <italic>P. ater</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> against each other, showed that when <italic>P. montanus</italic> tits were removed, <italic>P. ater</italic> turned to exploiting also the characteristic foraging sites of <italic>P. montanus</italic> in the inner tree parts (<xref rid="BIO013839C6" ref-type="bibr">Alatalo and Moreno, 1987</xref>). In all these cases, <italic>P. ater</italic> shifted from foraging predominantly on the peripheral twigs and needles to foraging also on the middle and basal branch parts and on the trunk.</p><p>The increased use of the inner tree regions by <italic>P. ater</italic> when <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> are absent gives more opportunity for obtaining food by pecking and tearing in bark and wood. These activities are favoured by a large body size, which is therefore selected for in <italic>P. ater</italic> on the islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>, point 2).</p><p>On the mainland, <italic>P. ater</italic> made frequent short flights in the tree periphery, hovered occasionally and often hung underneath slender and pliant twigs, activities that require good manoeuvrability and are expensive in energy. But on Gotland, it mostly moved by hops on top of branches in an upright position (Appendix in <xref rid="BIO013839C8" ref-type="bibr">Alatalo et al., 1986</xref>; Fig.&#x000a0;1 in <xref rid="BIO013839C29" ref-type="bibr">Gustafsson, 1988</xref>). The shift to foraging more frequently in the inner parts of trees on Gotland is thus associated with a change to easier and less energy-expensive postures and locomotion modes.</p><p>Niche differentiation with respect to body size occurs also at the intraspecific level between different-sized individuals of <italic>P. ater</italic>. In isolation from <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> on Gotland, large individuals of <italic>P. ater</italic> often used the inner parts of trees whereas small individuals foraged more in the needle-carrying outer regions (<xref rid="BIO013839C29" ref-type="bibr">Gustafsson, 1988</xref>). Five size measures &#x02013; tarsus length, bill length, length of the first secondary wing feather, hand-wing length and tail length &#x02013; were correlated with body mass, and tarsus length was a particularly reliable measure of body size. The range of size variation was 18.6&#x02013;20.1&#x02005;mm for tarsus length and 9.0&#x02013;11.1&#x02005;g for body mass (read from Fig.&#x000a0;5B and C in <xref rid="BIO013839C29" ref-type="bibr">Gustafsson, 1988</xref>). So, it was within these limited ranges of variation that a body-size-related niche differentiation was observed among <italic>P. ater</italic> on Gotland. This intraspecific differentiation of feeding sites among different-sized individuals of <italic>P. ater</italic> mirrors the interspecific body-size-related feeding site differentiation that occurs among <italic>P. ater</italic>, <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> where they coexist on the Swedish mainland. It emphasizes the tight association between body size and foraging zone in trees.</p><p>Flight manoeuvrability and general agility increase with decreasing body size for aerodynamic and mechanical reasons (<xref rid="BIO013839C10" ref-type="bibr">Andersson and Norberg, 1981</xref>). And the energy cost of locomotion decreases with decreasing body mass. During short flights within trees, birds often do not attain the maximum-range cruising speed at which energy cost per unit distance is minimized. At slower speeds, energy cost goes up more the lower the speed, peaking at hovering (<xref rid="BIO013839C60" ref-type="bibr">Pennycuick, 2008</xref>). In addition, short flights in tree canopies contain a disproportionately large proportion of energy-expensive manoeuvres, such as take-off and landing and twists and turns for negotiating obstacles in the cluttered canopy space. In an experimental study of <italic>P. montanus</italic>, kept in aviaries that only permitted short flights, the energy cost for flight, measured with the doubly-labelled water technique, was 27&#x02013;32% higher than that calculated for direct flight at normal cruising speed (<xref rid="BIO013839C15" ref-type="bibr">Carlson and Moreno, 1992</xref>). So, flight within tree canopies is energetically very expensive.</p><p>On the mainland, <italic>P. ater</italic> flies more frequently while foraging than do <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> (<xref rid="BIO013839C53" ref-type="bibr">Moreno et al., 1988</xref>). To see how that affects energy expenditure, the daily field metabolic rate was measured in <italic>P. ater</italic>, <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> under natural conditions, using the doubly-labelled water technique. The measurements were made on free-ranging birds when temperatures were below freezing in mid-winter (December-January) in a forest near Uppsala in east-central Sweden.

The difference is obviously a consequence of the more frequent use of energy-demanding locomotion modes, like flight, by <italic>P. ater</italic>.</p><p>On the mainland, small size is therefore particularly important to <italic>P. ater</italic> for keeping down energy costs for locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>, point 4). But because a lower proportion of the foraging time is spent in the canopy periphery on the islands, selection for a small body size must be weaker there than on the mainland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>, point 3-5). In addition, a small size is favoured more when foraging in the tight spaces in the meshwork of twigs and needles in the periphery of the tree canopy than when foraging in less cluttered spaces near the trunk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>, point 5).</p><p>We conclude that the evolutionary increase in body size of <italic>P. ater</italic> on the islands is due ultimately to the absence of <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic>. It was likely brought about by the combination of intensified selection for a large size, due to increased intraspecific interference competition following niche expansion and population increase, and weakened selection for a small size following a shift to easier foraging modes on the islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>). Other selection forces on body size are discussed under &#x02018;Alternative explanations&#x02019;. But they act in the opposite direction to the evolutionary change that has actually taken place and therefore cannot explain it.

Therefore, we refer to results for <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> in the following. We emphasize field studies done in the Nordic countries because their climate and forest habitat are similar to those of the islands and therefore present similar conditions for population regulation.</p><p>Predation by tits causes considerable reduction of their food in winter. In two field experiments in SW Sweden, branches of <italic>Picea abies</italic> were enclosed with nets to prevent birds from foraging on them throughout the winter. In one of the experiments, run in the period October to March, the exclosure reduced spider mortality from 57% on unprotected branches to 34% on protected branches, suggesting that birds consumed 23% of the spiders present in autumn (<xref rid="BIO013839C11" ref-type="bibr">Askenmo et al., 1977</xref>). In the other experiment, the exclosure reduced overwinter mortality of small spiders from 90% on unprotected branches to 75% on protected, indicating that birds consumed 15% of the small spiders present in autumn. For large spiders, mortality was reduced from 85% on unprotected branches to 46% on protected, indicating that birds consumed 39% of the large spiders present in autumn (Table&#x000a0;2 in <xref rid="BIO013839C27" ref-type="bibr">Gunnarsson, 1983</xref>). The higher disappearance rate of spiders from unprotected branches was attributed to predation by <italic>P. ater</italic>, <italic>P. cristatus</italic>, <italic>P. montanus</italic> and <italic>R. regulus</italic>.</p><p>Because birds themselves reduce prey density, bird mortality due to starvation acts in a density-dependent way. It has been shown experimentally that energy stress is the main cause of winter mortality among <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic>. After experimental provisioning of extra food in autumn and winter in SW Sweden, winter survival almost doubled during the period November to March, from 39% to 76% for <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and from 45% to 82% for <italic>P. montanus</italic> (Table&#x000a0;4 in <xref rid="BIO013839C44" ref-type="bibr">Jansson et al., 1981</xref>).</p><p>At the same study site in SW Sweden, population density of <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> was experimentally reduced locally in autumn. For <italic>P. montanus</italic>, winter survival in the low-density experimental population increased to 100% whereas survival rate was 68% by April in a normal-density control population. This outcome demonstrates that winter losses are density-dependent and that there is significant intraspecific competition between flock members (<xref rid="BIO013839C23" ref-type="bibr">Ekman et al., 1981</xref>). Another study in SW Sweden, based on year-round monitoring of a population of marked individuals of <italic>P. montanus</italic> over six years, showed that survival is strongly density-dependent among first-year birds in late winter. Mortality in winter is driven by competition for non-renewable food (<xref rid="BIO013839C20" ref-type="bibr">Ekman, 1984</xref>).</p><p><italic>Parus cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> are considered to be dominant over <italic>P. ater</italic> and to monopolize their species-characteristic feeding sites in the interior of tree canopies, thus preventing <italic>P. ater</italic> from foraging there (<xref rid="BIO013839C41" ref-type="bibr">Hogstad, 1978</xref>; <xref rid="BIO013839C6" ref-type="bibr">Alatalo and Moreno, 1987</xref>; <xref rid="BIO013839C66" ref-type="bibr">Suhonen et al., 1992</xref><xref rid="BIO013839C67" ref-type="bibr">, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="BIO013839C65" ref-type="bibr">Suhonen, 1993</xref>; but see <xref rid="BIO013839C35" ref-type="bibr">Haftorn, 1993</xref>). There is also some overlap in feeding sites between <italic>P. ater</italic>, <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic>, so in the shared space they reduce each other's food resources directly.</p><p>The clearest demonstration that <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> restrict the foraging niche of <italic>P. ater</italic> comes from the fact that <italic>P. ater</italic> extends it foraging space in their absence. On the mainland, where all three coexist, <italic>P. ater</italic> forages predominantly on the peripheral twigs and needles, but in the absence of <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> it shifts to foraging also on the middle and basal branch parts and the trunk, places that are normally used by the absentees (see review in the foregoing section on selection for a large body size).</p><p><italic>Regulus regulus</italic> occurs together with <italic>P. ater</italic> in coniferous forests on the Swedish mainland as well as on all the islands, so there is no mainland-island difference in competition between the two (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB1">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). They use much the same foraging zones in trees (<xref rid="BIO013839C33" ref-type="bibr">Haftorn, 1956c</xref>) and overlap in diet. <italic>P. ater</italic> eats arthropods and seeds (<xref rid="BIO013839C33" ref-type="bibr">Haftorn, 1956c</xref>) whereas <italic>R. regulus</italic> only eats arthropods all year round, including very small items like Collembola (<xref rid="BIO013839C70" ref-type="bibr">Thaler, 1973</xref>; <xref rid="BIO013839C42" ref-type="bibr">Hogstad, 1984</xref>). <italic>P. ater</italic> is socially dominant over <italic>R. regulus</italic> and often takes over its feeding site by supplanting attacks (R.&#x000c5;.N., personal observation). <italic>Certhia familiaris</italic> occurs in coniferous forest on the mainland and on all the islands except Anholt and L&#x000e6;s&#x000f8; (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB1">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). It forages almost entirely on tree trunks and therefore interferes little with <italic>P. ater</italic>.</p><p>In conclusion, food is a limiting factor that brings about population regulation in winter. The process is density-dependent because the rate of food depletion increases with increasing population density and feeds back to the individual in terms of food scarcity. Winter is also the season when <italic>P. ater</italic> occurs together with <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> in mixed-species foraging flocks, which is conducive to interspecific competition. Regardless of whether <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> restrict the foraging space of <italic>P. ater</italic> physically, or if they reduce food in their foraging zones to levels at which it is not profitable for <italic>P. ater</italic> to forage, they compete by reducing food accessibility for it. In addition, they reduce food for <italic>P. ater</italic> directly in the overlapping parts of their respective foraging space. Since winter is the season when population regulation mostly takes place, it is also then that selection on behaviour and morphology is the strongest. Because <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> cause <italic>P. ater</italic> to forage predominantly in the tree periphery during winter, interspecific competition maintains selection for a small body size of <italic>P. ater</italic> in sympatry on the mainland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3m"><title>Alternative explanations</title><p>We think that the genetically determined increase in body size of <italic>P. ater</italic> on the islands is the result of adaptive evolution in response to the absence of competition from <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic>.

The islands were most likely colonized by mainland birds that took part in such irruptions. But the probability is only 0.5<sup>8</sup>=0.004 that all eight places, from which one or two congeners are absent, were colonized by larger than average-sized mainland birds by chance alone. So random founder events cannot account for the large size of <italic>P. ater</italic> in all eight places.</p><p>We will now look at the size of present-day migrants of <italic>P. ater.</italic> Judging by observations during an autumn irruption in 1990, migrants consist almost exclusively of juveniles. On that occasion, 716 <italic>P. ater</italic> were netted and ringed at Falsterbo Bird Observatory and all of them were first-year birds (Lennart Karlsson, personal communication).</p><p>The hand-wing and the tarsus of first-year birds on southbound autumn migration were measured by staff ornithologists at the Falsterbo Bird Observatory, who used the measuring technique described in the methods section herein. Hand-wing length of migrants was remarkably similar between samples in different years. The average length was 61.26&#x02005;mm (s.d. 1.62) for 273 migrating <italic>P. ater</italic> measured in September and October 1982-1986 (G&#x000f6;ran Walinder, personal communication) and 61.23&#x02005;mm (s.d. 1.51) for 180 birds measured in September and October 1990 (Lennart Karlsson, personal communication). This gives an overall average of 61.25&#x02005;mm for migrants. The hand-wing length of resident first-year birds that we measured on the mainland was 60.9&#x02005;mm in SW Sweden, 61.0&#x02005;mm in SE Sweden and 61.3&#x02005;mm in SC Sweden, with an average of 61.0&#x02005;mm for the pooled mainland sample (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB2">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>). Residents in SC Sweden thus had a longer hand-wing than migrants. But the hand-wing in the pooled mainland sample is 0.4% shorter than in migrants (61.0 vs 61.25&#x02005;mm). By contrast, hand-wing length of island birds exceeds that of mainland residents by up to 4.3% (63.6 on Bornholm vs 61.0&#x02005;mm on the mainland; <xref ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB2">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>).</p><p>The average length of the tarsus was 18.60&#x02005;mm (s.d. 0.59) in the 180 autumn migrants measured in 1990 (Lennart Karlsson, personal communication). The tarsus length of resident first-year birds that we measured on the mainland was 18.4&#x02005;mm in SW Sweden, 18.3&#x02005;mm in SE Sweden and 18.2&#x02005;mm in SC Sweden (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB3">Table&#x000a0;3</xref>), with an overall average of 18.34&#x02005;mm for mainland birds. So, the tarsus was 1.4% longer in migrants than in mainland residents (18.60 vs 18.34&#x02005;mm). This is a small difference as compared, for example, with the 6.3% that separate birds on the island of Gotland from mainland residents (19.5&#x02005;mm vs 18.34; <xref ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB3">Table&#x000a0;3</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, judging by the wing and tarsus measurements of present-day migrants, the islands were not colonized by big immigrants arriving from the mainland without further size change. The size of present-day migrants instead suggests that island colonizers were similar in size to mainland residents and that a size increase came about by local evolutionary adaptation following colonization.</p></sec><sec id="s3m5"><label>5.</label><title>Genetic drift</title><p>This is divergence of allele frequencies and associated phenotype traits between separated populations through random processes.

Therefore, genetic drift can be ruled out as a cause for the consistent increase in body size.</p></sec><sec id="s3m6"><label>6.</label><title>Inbreeding</title><p>Because populations of <italic>P. ater</italic> are smaller on the islands than on the mainland, there is a higher risk of inbreeding on the islands. Inbreeding will tend to increase homozygosity and the expression of recessive deleterious alleles, potentially leading to inbreeding depression and reduced vigour (<xref rid="BIO013839C24" ref-type="bibr">Falconer, 1983</xref>). If body size were at all affected it would likely shift towards smaller rather than bigger &#x02013; contrary to the case on the islands. A study of a wild population of another passerine bird, the collared flycatcher <italic>Ficedula albicollis</italic>, showed that inbreeding caused a significant reduction in fledgling skeletal size and in post-fledgling juvenile survival (<xref rid="BIO013839C46" ref-type="bibr">Kruuk et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Another argument against inbreeding as a cause for the increased size of <italic>P. ater</italic> relates to differences in population size between islands. Gotland is the largest island, Anholt the smallest, and the area of coniferous forest on them is 1147&#x02005;km<sup>2</sup> and 3.0&#x02005;km<sup>2</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB6">Table&#x000a0;6</xref>). If population size is taken to be proportional to the area of coniferous forest, there would be 400 times more individuals of <italic>P. ater</italic> on Gotland than on Anholt. The number is estimated to be about 80,000 on Gotland (<xref rid="BIO013839C64" ref-type="bibr">SOF, 1990</xref>) so there would be about 200 on Anholt. Another census on Gotland estimated the population density of <italic>P. ater</italic> to 90&#x02013;110 individuals per km<sup>2</sup> of pine-dominated forest in January-February (Appendix in <xref rid="BIO013839C8" ref-type="bibr">Alatalo et al., 1986</xref>). Estimates based on these numbers give similar results, namely 100,000&#x02013;126,000 individuals on Gotland and 270&#x02013;330 on Anholt. But although the population is 400 times larger on Gotland than on Anholt, <italic>P. ater</italic> is the same size on both islands.

If that were to affect body size, island birds might be smaller than mainland conspecifics due to direct effects on the phenotype during the nestling period, or because of evolutionary adaptation to poor food conditions. But <italic>P. ater</italic> is instead larger on the islands.</p><p>Island forests might have characteristics that favour a large body size in <italic>P. ater</italic>. But forest structure and tree species composition vary considerably between islands and there is no forest feature that is shared by all islands and distinguishes them from the mainland.

But below it, metabolic heat must be generated to maintain body temperature. For the same insulation and temperature gradient across the body surface, the rate of heat loss is proportional to body surface area. Among geometrically similar animals, area is proportional to volume<sup>2/3</sup> so the rate of heat loss from an entire animal increases in proportion to mass<sup>2/3</sup>. But the rate of heat loss per unit body mass decreases with increasing body size as mass<sup>2/3</sup>/mass=mass<sup>&#x02212;1/3</sup>. So, heat loss per unit body mass is larger the smaller the animal. Selection for reduced mass-specific metabolic costs for thermoregulation in temperate and cold regions therefore favours large body sizes. This is a likely explanation for the intraspecific trend of increasing body size among some warm-blooded vertebrates in colder parts of their distribution range &#x02013; known as Bergmann's ecogeographical rule (<xref rid="BIO013839C12" ref-type="bibr">Bergmann, 1847</xref>; <xref rid="BIO013839C51" ref-type="bibr">Mayr, 1965</xref>). Another explanation is that the size trend arises because large animals have better fasting ability, which is particularly advantageous in cold and seasonal environments with periods of food scarcity (<xref rid="BIO013839C54" ref-type="bibr">Murphy, 1985</xref>). Either way, selection for large size must be strongest in winter.</p><p>On the islands where <italic>P. ater</italic> occurs but <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> are absent, the winter climate is considerably milder than on the Swedish mainland, except that Gotland is like the mainland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F5">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>). If reduction of mass-specific energy costs for thermoregulation in winter were important, mainland birds would be larger than their island conspecifics.

A large body size should therefore be more favoured in the former places. But <italic>P. ater</italic> is small on the Swedish mainland and the island of &#x000c5;land, where also <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> occur, and large on the other islands, all of which lack <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic>. This is contrary to expectations based on the length of the snowy season so differences in snow cover cannot explain the large size of <italic>P. ater</italic> on the islands.

At a field site in Belgium, the mean size of <italic>Parus major</italic> showed a decreasing trend in the period 1962&#x02013;1975. This was concomitant with the provision of an abundance of nest boxes. Therefore, the progressive reduction in body size during this period was interpreted to be the result of relaxed competition for nest holes, whereby big individuals lost some of their advantage (<xref rid="BIO013839C16" ref-type="bibr">Dhondt et al., 1979</xref>). But apart from using tree holes, <italic>P. ater</italic> nests readily in holes under tree roots and stones, so it is unlikely that there is a shortage of nest holes either on the mainland or on the islands.</p></sec><sec id="s3m11"><label>11.</label><title>Predation</title><p>When tits forage in the canopy periphery, they are exposed to high predation risk, whereas foraging closer to the trunk gives structural protection from raptors and day-hunting owls (<xref rid="BIO013839C21" ref-type="bibr">Ekman, 1986</xref>; <xref rid="BIO013839C47" ref-type="bibr">Kullberg, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="BIO013839C25" ref-type="bibr">G&#x000f6;tmark and Post, 1996</xref>). Therefore, if predation pressure differs between islands and the mainland, island tits might change their use of foraging zones in trees. And that entails a shift in locomotion mode, which in turn may alter selection on body size.</p><p>Here follows a review of predation on coniferous forest tits and how predators influence their foraging behaviour and thence the selection on morphology. We focus on raptors and a day-hunting owl whose hunting success depends on where in trees their prey is. Night-hunting owls and nest predators are thus left out.</p><p>A study in SW Sweden found that the sparrowhawk <italic>Accipiter nisus</italic> takes few coniferous forest tits in winter but preys more on them in summer (Table&#x000a0;2 in <xref rid="BIO013839C20" ref-type="bibr">Ekman, 1984</xref>). Another study, performed in summer in SW Sweden, compared the proportion of different bird species in the diet of <italic>A. nisus</italic> with their relative abundance in the local bird community. The hawk took somewhat fewer <italic>P. montanus</italic> than expected whereas the proportion of <italic>P. ater</italic> and <italic>P. cristatus</italic> in its diet was much lower than expected from their relative abundance on the hawks' hunting grounds (<xref rid="BIO013839C25" ref-type="bibr">G&#x000f6;tmark and Post, 1996</xref>). <italic>P. montanus</italic> and <italic>P. cristatus</italic> forage in relatively predator-safe tree parts, which may explain their low frequency in the hawk diet. But the still lower predation rate on <italic>P. ater</italic> runs counter to expectations based on its use of exposed foraging sites.</p><p>The pygmy owl <italic>Glaucidium passerinum</italic> hunts by day and is responsible for a considerable proportion of the winter mortality of <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> in SW Sweden (<xref rid="BIO013839C23" ref-type="bibr">Ekman et al., 1981</xref>; <xref rid="BIO013839C20" ref-type="bibr">Ekman, 1984</xref>, <xref rid="BIO013839C21" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>). In a study area where <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> were individually colour-banded, the tits were very sedentary in winter and did not leave the territory of their respective flock. Any disappearance from the winter territory in the period November-March was therefore attributed to mortality. Among those that disappeared, 19% of the number of <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and 24% of <italic>P. montanus</italic> were found &#x02013; and identified by their rings &#x02013; in regurgitated pellets in winter roosting holes of <italic>G. passerinum</italic> (Table&#x000a0;5 in <xref rid="BIO013839C44" ref-type="bibr">Jansson et al., 1981</xref>). These predation rates are probably underestimates because the remains of some prey must have been missed.</p><p>When <italic>G. passerinum</italic> hunts birds, it strikes from above, launching the attack from perches that are higher up than the focal prey (<xref rid="BIO013839C47" ref-type="bibr">Kullberg, 1995</xref>). Therefore, predation risk is greater in the low and outer parts of a tree than higher up or in cover from branches and twigs in the inner tree zones (<xref rid="BIO013839C21" ref-type="bibr">Ekman, 1986</xref>; <xref rid="BIO013839C47" ref-type="bibr">Kullberg, 1995</xref>).</p><p>In a study in SW Sweden, the proportion of various bird species in the diet of <italic>G. passerinum</italic> was compared with their relative abundance in the local habitat. <italic>P. montanus</italic>, which forages near the trunk, was preyed upon about as expected from its relative abundance, whereas <italic>P. cristatus</italic>, which forages farther out, was preyed upon more than expected and <italic>P. ater</italic> even more so, which is in accord with its use of exposed foraging sites (Table&#x000a0;2 in <xref rid="BIO013839C21" ref-type="bibr">Ekman, 1986</xref>). A survey of six field studies in Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia likewise showed that <italic>G. passerinum</italic> preys consistently more heavily on <italic>P. ater</italic> and <italic>R. regulus</italic> and less on <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> than expected from their relative abundance in the local bird community (<xref rid="BIO013839C67" ref-type="bibr">Suhonen et al., 1993</xref>). Empirical results thus confirm that <italic>G. passerinum</italic> takes disproportionately many <italic>P. ater</italic> &#x02013; as expected in view of its exposed foraging sites &#x02013; whereas <italic>A. nisus</italic> unexpectedly takes disproportionately few <italic>P. ater</italic> (see above; <xref rid="BIO013839C25" ref-type="bibr">G&#x000f6;tmark and Post, 1996</xref>).</p><p>Predation by <italic>G. passerinum</italic> has been shown to determine the choice of foraging sites by tits to various extents depending on the availability of small rodents, which are preferred prey of the owl. In one winter when rodent populations were at a peak level in Finland, voles and shrews <italic>Sorex</italic> spp. together made up 98% and birds 2% of the diet of <italic>G. passerinum</italic>. In the next winter, the rodent populations had crashed and rodent trap-catches dropped to 0.6% of the value in the previous winter, from 32 to 0.2 captured individuals per 100 trap-nights. At this rodent population low, <italic>G. passerinum</italic> switched to eating birds, after which 40% of its winter diet consisted of rodents and shrews while birds made up 60%. Following this huge shift in the owl's diet, <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> responded behaviourally and foraged less on the outer, exposed regions of spruce trees and more often on the inner parts of branches (<xref rid="BIO013839C65" ref-type="bibr">Suhonen, 1993</xref>).</p><p><italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> are claimed to be socially dominant over <italic>P. ater</italic> and to exclude it from their foraging zones, which leaves it to forage in the risky outer canopy (<xref rid="BIO013839C41" ref-type="bibr">Hogstad, 1978</xref>; <xref rid="BIO013839C6" ref-type="bibr">Alatalo and Moreno, 1987</xref>; <xref rid="BIO013839C67" ref-type="bibr">Suhonen et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="BIO013839C65" ref-type="bibr">Suhonen, 1993</xref>). Rank order has been observed to determine feeding site partitioning also at the intraspecific level. In <italic>P. montanus</italic>, dominant adults expel subordinate first-year birds from the upper tree regions in winter, leaving them to forage lower in trees where they are more vulnerable to predation (<xref rid="BIO013839C22" ref-type="bibr">Ekman and Askenmo, 1984</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB7">Table&#x000a0;7</xref> shows the distribution of potential predators on <italic>P. ater</italic>. The hobby <italic>Falco subbuteo</italic> is specialised on open-air hunting and the goshawk <italic>Accipiter gentilis</italic> mostly takes large prey, so both have little impact on tits. <italic>A. nisus</italic> is a breeding resident on the mainland of Denmark, Norway and Sweden and on all islands except Anholt. <italic>G. passerinum</italic> is a breeding resident on the mainland of Norway, Sweden and Finland. It has also been recorded on the island of &#x000c5;land (<xref rid="BIO013839C37" ref-type="bibr">Haila, 1981</xref>; <xref rid="BIO013839C48" ref-type="bibr">Kullberg and Ekman, 2000</xref>), but the population density is low there and its breeding status uncertain (The Finnish Breeding Bird Atlas). It is absent from all the other islands as well as from the Danish mainland Jylland.</p><p>The islands have different numbers of resident raptor species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB7">Table&#x000a0;7</xref>). There are three on Gotska Sand&#x000f6;n and Gotland, two on Sj&#x000e6;lland, one on Bornholm and L&#x000e6;s&#x000f8; and none on Anholt. And yet, <italic>P. ater</italic> has increased in size to a similar extent on all six islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F1">Figs&#x000a0;1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F3">3</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB2">Tables&#x000a0;2</xref>-<xref ref-type="table" rid="BIO013839TB4">4</xref>). So, the large size of <italic>P. ater</italic> on the islands is not driven by predation. But its body size on the mainland might be influenced indirectly by predators in so far as they affect niche partitioning among tits to the effect that <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> forage in the safer inner tree regions. By force of their putative dominance, they may expel <italic>P. ater</italic> from the inner parts, leaving it to forage in the exposed tree periphery (<xref rid="BIO013839C41" ref-type="bibr">Hogstad, 1978</xref>; <xref rid="BIO013839C6" ref-type="bibr">Alatalo and Moreno, 1987</xref>; <xref rid="BIO013839C67" ref-type="bibr">Suhonen et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="BIO013839C65" ref-type="bibr">Suhonen, 1993</xref>). Once there, it is subject to selection for agility and a small body size.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s4"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>None of the alternative explanations is supported, so our <italic>a priori</italic> hypothesis is upheld. Because the large size of <italic>P. ater</italic> on the islands is genetically determined, we conclude that it is the result of evolutionary adaptation, due ultimately to the local absence of the larger competitors <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus.</italic> Judging by the wide geographical separation of the islands, the large size cannot be the result of a single, local, evolutionary event, followed by dispersal to the other islands. Instead, the size increase must have evolved independently on separate islands after colonization.</p><p>The enlarged body size has probably evolved because when <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> are absent, <italic>P. ater</italic> takes over the vacant niche space in the inner tree parts. The takeover is promoted (1) by food in the vacant space (2) and by the absence of competition with the ordinary niche holders. The extended niche space enables <italic>P. ater</italic> to reach high population densities on the islands. Because the food base is widened, competition for food may not increase, but intraspecific interference competition is likely to increase, which strengthens selection for a large body size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>). And as indicated by the large size of <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic>, which mostly forage on the thick parts of branches, a large body is better adapted to places where food can be obtained by pecking and tearing in bark and wood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>).</p><p>In sympatry with <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> on the Swedish mainland, <italic>P. ater</italic> forages predominantly in the outer tree parts. Foraging on the fine and pliant distal twigs in the tree periphery requires frequent hanging underneath branches and many short flights and hovering bouts. For mechanical and aerodynamic reasons a small body size improves agility and manoeuvrability and reduces energy cost of locomotion. Selection therefore favours a small size in <italic>P. ater</italic> on the mainland.</p><p>But when <italic>P. ater</italic> exploits the vacant foraging sites of <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> on the islands, it also adopts their easier foraging techniques and locomotion modes, which reduces demands for manoeuvrability and power output. In addition, after widening its foraging zone in trees, <italic>P. ater</italic> cuts down on its exploitation rate of the canopy periphery, where high manoeuvrability and energy-expensive locomotion modes are required. Selection for a small body size is therefore reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>).</p><p>On the six islands where <italic>P. ater</italic> occurs alone, it is near the average size as calculated across <italic>P. ater</italic>, <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> in sympatry on the Swedish mainland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F1">Figs&#x000a0;1</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F3">3</xref>). So, in the absence of the two larger competitors, <italic>P. ater</italic> has evolved in the direction of the absentees on the six islands and become a medium-sized generalist.</p><p>In two other places, <italic>P. ater</italic> coexists with one coniferous forest congener &#x02013; with <italic>P. montanus</italic> on the island of &#x000d6;land and with <italic>P. cristatus</italic> on the Danish peninsula Jylland. <italic>P. ater</italic> is larger in both places than on the Swedish mainland. But the size increase is less on &#x000d6;land and Jylland than on the six islands from which <italic>P. cristatus</italic> as well as <italic>P. montanus</italic> are absent.</p><p>The body size of <italic>P. ater</italic> is enlarged in all eight places where it was expected. So here, evolution of local adaptation could be predicted both regarding direction (qualitatively) and the amount of change (quantitatively). And it has taken place independently and in parallel in geographically separated places (repeatability). The large size has evolved within the last 100&#x02005;years on the four islands Bornholm, Sj&#x000e6;lland, Anholt and L&#x000e6;s&#x000f8; because the coniferous forest habitat required by <italic>P. ater</italic> was totally lacking before then.</p><p>A corollary of the niche extension and evolutionary size increase in <italic>P. ater</italic> when it is geographically isolated from <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic>, is that when all three coexist, <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> obviously exclude <italic>P. ater</italic> from the inner tree zones, either by virtue of being larger and socially dominant or by reducing food to levels at which it is not profitable for <italic>P. ater</italic> to forage. It leaves <italic>P. ater</italic> to exploit the tree periphery, which requires high manoeuvrability and agility. This keeps up selection for a small body size of <italic>P. ater</italic> on the mainland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>).</p><p>Predators may play an indirect role in maintaining the small size of mainland <italic>P. ater</italic> in so far as they influence niche partitioning among tits to the effect that <italic>P. cristatus</italic> and <italic>P. montanus</italic> forage in the safer inner tree parts from where they drive <italic>P. ater</italic> into the tree periphery where small size is selected for.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s5"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>We measured birds at the 12 places shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>.

It was performed between August 9 and October 8 in all years and in all places except for the island of Gotska Sand&#x000f6;n, where we were during the breeding period in June, measuring adult birds only. We used song playback and mist-nets to capture birds. They were measured immediately at the capture site and were then set free. At each locality, we shifted net positions repeatedly in order to sample from different flocks. Between 8 and 37 living specimens of <italic>P. ater</italic> were measured at each of the 12 sampling localities shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>.

The young fledge in late June so all growth has ceased long before our fieldwork started in August.</p><p>First-year birds greatly outnumber adults in our autumn samples. Therefore, and because wing and tail feathers do not reach adult size until the summer moult in the second calendar year (<xref rid="BIO013839C69" ref-type="bibr">Svensson, 1992</xref>), we use only first-year birds in all comparisons except where otherwise stated.

First-year birds are easy to tell from adults by plumage (<xref rid="BIO013839C69" ref-type="bibr">Svensson, 1992</xref>). But there is no external character that permits reliable sexing, so the sexes are pooled in each age category.

The other linear measurements were taken with a plastic dial calliper rule, read to the nearest 0.1&#x02005;mm. Wing area was measured from photographs taken of birds with outstretched wings as described below. We projected an enlarged image onto paper, draw the wing outline and measured wing area with a polar compensating planimeter. We made three planimeter tracings of the same drawing of each individual and calculated the average area.</p><p>We collaborated on all fieldwork. But to eliminate variation due to possible differences in measuring technique, one of us made all measurements in the field whereas the other measured all wing areas from photographs. Whenever uncertainty arose how to round off a reading, we counteracted unintentional bias by consistently rounding in the opposite direction to that expected from our working hypothesis.</p><p><italic>Body mass</italic>: We weighed most birds within one hour of capture. But in a few cases, weighing was delayed for up to two hours due to the handling of a large catch.</p><p><italic>Wing area</italic>: Wing area is the area of both wings and the portion of body in between as projected onto the wing-chord plane. In flight, the reduced pressure over the wings is retained over the body portion between the wings so it is part of the lift-producing area. We measured wing areas from photographs taken in dorsal view, perpendicular to the wing chord plane, of birds held against a board with a scale. We held the wings by the wrist and extended them moderately as they are judged to be in mid-downstroke. We also rotated the handwings forward to straighten and align the leading edges of the wings and spread the flight feathers evenly but without disrupting their natural backward and ventral curvature.</p><p><italic>(Wing area)<sup>0.5</sup></italic>: Among geometrically similar animals, areas increase as a representative length squared, so areas in different sized animals cannot be directly compared with linear measurements.

The square root of wing area is not listed in any table and is used only to calculate a compound measure of wing linear size for the diagrams in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO013839F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>.</p><p><italic>Wing span</italic>: The bird was placed on its back and the wings were stretched moderately as described under &#x02018;wing area&#x02019;.

In <italic>P. ater</italic>, this distal measuring point coincides with the outer edge of the last complete scale on the dorsal side of the tarsometatarsus, used in the previous measurement.
