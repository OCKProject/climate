 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Transport of already infected ticks is an obvious mechanism of transporting tick-borne pathogens by birds, as most tick-borne pathogens survive transstadially, i.e., from larvae to nymphs, and from nymphs to adults. This is shown for 
  <span class="italic">Anaplasma marginale</span> (Stich et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B69" href="#B69">1989</a>), 
  <span class="italic">Babesia divergens</span> (Bonnet et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B8" href="#B8">2007</a>), 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia burgdorferi</span> sensu lato (Bellet-Edimo et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B6" href="#B6">2005</a>) and TBEV, and is indeed a prerequisite for being a tick-borne pathogen (Randolph, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B61" href="#B61">2011</a>). However, the transstadial survival may not be 100%, as some data indicate that 
  <span class="italic">B. afzelii</span> can disappear from 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> (Matuschka and Spielman, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B48" href="#B48">1992</a>) and 
  <span class="italic">B. burgdorferi</span> s.s. from 
  <span class="italic">I. scapularis</span> (Ogden et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B53" href="#B53">2008</a>) that are feeding on birds in Europe and North America respectively. Corresponding to this, Hasle et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B34" href="#B34">2010</a>) found that engorged ticks had a lower prevalence, i.e., odds ratio 0.24 (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.004), of 
  <span class="italic">B. afzelii</span> than unengorged ticks from birds. To spread a pathogen, a later stadium of the tick would have to parasitize a host that can mediate further transmission. Adult 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> parasitize animals of the size of cats and larger (Jaenson et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B41" href="#B41">1994</a>), while small rodents and birds are the main reservoirs for the 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp. most common in Europe (Kurtenbach et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B44" href="#B44">2002</a>). Therefore, when fully engorged, 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span>-infected nymphs molt to adult stage, it is not obvious that they can spread the pathogen further. However, although not very efficient, transovarial transmission is described for Babesia (Bonnet et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B8" href="#B8">2007</a>), Borrelia (Bellet-Edimo et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B6" href="#B6">2005</a>) and TBEV (Danielová and Holubová, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B13" href="#B13">1991</a>), which means that infected larvae can be transported by birds, and then molt to infected nymphs. Likewise, adult ticks may produce infected offspring after arrival on a new place, by transovarial transmission.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Human pathogens can also be transported by ticks that normally don't bite humans, as is shown for 
  <span class="italic">I. uriae</span> (Olsen et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B57" href="#B57">1995b</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the case of TBEV, the virus is thought to be maintained in nature mainly by transmission through co-feeding on small rodents, as infected nymphs spread the virus to co-feeding larvae (Labuda and Randolph, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B45" href="#B45">1999</a>). It is almost exclusively nymphs and larvae of 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> that can be transported by birds (Jaenson et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B41" href="#B41">1994</a>; Hasle et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B33" href="#B33">2009</a>). As the bird host would be the first host for the feeding larvae, they would not carry TBEV before entering the bird unless the virus is transmitted transovarially. Infected nymphs would proceed to adult stage after feeding, and would not feed on small rodents. Therefore, the TBEV-infected ticks transported by birds would be a dead-end for maintaining the TBEV in nature, without transovarial transmission. Assuming transovarial transmission, the TBEV could be seeded by birds to new areas if the climate, vegetation and hosts are suitable for the natural TBEV-cycle. In Norway, the first cases of TBE were notified in Southern Norway in 1998. Since then there has been an increase in annual cases, to the present 10–15 cases per year. A very relevant question would be why this has not happened before. The answer may well be that it has happened before, but that the conditions necessary for maintaining the fragile cycle of TBEV (Randolph and Rogers, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B62" href="#B62">2000</a>) in the nature have not been present before. The distribution of TBEV in Scandinavia is discontinuous, with at least 300 km of land distance from the endemic areas in Sweden (Båhuslän) to the Agder counties in Norway, while crossing the Skagerrak or Kattegat sea is a three to five hours flight for small passerine birds. It is difficult to find another explanation for this discontinuous distribution than transport via birds. This is the closest we can come to a proof that birds have seeded a tick-borne infection to a new area.

  <span class="italic">Babesia venatorum</span> is an emerging tick-borne human disease in Europe. The first findings of this parasite in Norway have been on four nymphs of 
  <span class="italic">Ixodes ricinus</span> brought to Norway by birds (Hasle et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B35" href="#B35">2011</a>). 
  <span class="italic">B. venatorum</span> is a primarily a roe deer parasite (Duh et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B16" href="#B16">2005</a>), and adult 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> readily feed on roe deer. Therefore, birds could effectively import and spread this parasite.
