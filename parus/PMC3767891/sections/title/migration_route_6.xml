 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Knowledge of the bird migration routes is crucial for understanding the possible impact of birds as spreaders of ticks and tick-borne pathogens. For instance, the main direction of migration in Europe is NE/SW for the 
  <span class="italic">Turdus</span> spp., 
  <span class="italic">E. rubecula, Phoenicurus phoenicurus, Prunella modularis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Troglodytes troglodytes</span> (Gjershaug et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B27" href="#B27">1994</a>; Bruderer, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B9" href="#B9">1997</a>; Fransson and Hall-Karlsson, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B23" href="#B23">2008</a>), which are all species with a high prevalence of tick infestation (Hasle et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B33" href="#B33">2009</a>; Marsot et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B47" href="#B47">2012</a>). These species would be unlikely to transport the TBEV from Central to North-West Europe, but could possibly transport this virus from Central to South-West Europe. On the other hand, species that migrate along a more N/S direction across the Alps, like 
  <span class="italic">Sylvia curruca, S. communis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">S. atricapilla</span>, or NW/SE, like 
  <span class="italic">Motacilla alba</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Luscinia svecica</span> (Gjershaug et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B27" href="#B27">1994</a>; Fransson and Hall-Karlsson, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B23" href="#B23">2008</a>) could potentially cross the Skagerrak sea and transport ticks carrying TBEV from the TBE-endemic areas in Central Europe to Norway and Sweden. During NW migration 
  <span class="italic">Motacilla alba</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Luscinia svecica</span> may pass areas endemic for 
  <span class="italic">Ixodes persulcatus</span> before reaching Sweden, and could, theoretically, introduce this tick species to Sweden, as the climate in Sweden would be suitable for 
  <span class="italic">I. persulcatus</span>. However, the ecological 
  <span class="italic">niche</span> is already occupied, by 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">I. persulcatus</span> would therefore be unlikely to colonize Sweden, even if they were brought there by birds. On the other hand, to bring this speculation further, if they can be transported past areas occupied by 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> it could still remain a possibility for colonization of 
  <span class="italic">I. persulcatus</span> in Sweden. 
  <span class="italic">I. persulcatus</span> survives extreme winter temperatures in Siberia, and could possibly do that in Scandinavia as well. The findings of 
  <span class="italic">I. persulcatus</span> and human cases with S-TBEV in Kokkola (N63°50′ E23°07′), Finland, several hundred kilometres from the known western distribution range of 
  <span class="italic">I. persulcatus</span> (Jääskeläinen et al., 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B43a" href="#B43a">2006</a>), suggests long distance transport by birds.
