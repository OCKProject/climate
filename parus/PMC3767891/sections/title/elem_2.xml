 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Birds can potentially transport tick-borne pathogens by transport of infected ticks. In addition, the birds may act as amplifying host by being infected with tick-borne pathogens that can infect their parasitizing ticks, which can transmit the pathogens to subsequent hosts, or by hosting co-feeding ticks, i.e., ticks that feed near each other on the same host, when pathogens may pass from one tick to the other.</p>
 <sec class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Transport of infected ticks</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Transport of already infected ticks is an obvious mechanism of transporting tick-borne pathogens by birds, as most tick-borne pathogens survive transstadially, i.e., from larvae to nymphs, and from nymphs to adults. This is shown for 
   <span class="italic">Anaplasma marginale</span> (Stich et al., 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B69" href="#B69">1989</a>), 
   <span class="italic">Babesia divergens</span> (Bonnet et al., 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B8" href="#B8">2007</a>), 
   <span class="italic">Borrelia burgdorferi</span> sensu lato (Bellet-Edimo et al., 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B6" href="#B6">2005</a>) and TBEV, and is indeed a prerequisite for being a tick-borne pathogen (Randolph, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B61" href="#B61">2011</a>). However, the transstadial survival may not be 100%, as some data indicate that 
   <span class="italic">B. afzelii</span> can disappear from 
   <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> (Matuschka and Spielman, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B48" href="#B48">1992</a>) and 
   <span class="italic">B. burgdorferi</span> s.s. from 
   <span class="italic">I. scapularis</span> (Ogden et al., 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B53" href="#B53">2008</a>) that are feeding on birds in Europe and North America respectively. Corresponding to this, Hasle et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B34" href="#B34">2010</a>) found that engorged ticks had a lower prevalence, i.e., odds ratio 0.24 (
   <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.004), of 
   <span class="italic">B. afzelii</span> than unengorged ticks from birds. To spread a pathogen, a later stadium of the tick would have to parasitize a host that can mediate further transmission. Adult 
   <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> parasitize animals of the size of cats and larger (Jaenson et al., 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B41" href="#B41">1994</a>), while small rodents and birds are the main reservoirs for the 
   <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spp. most common in Europe (Kurtenbach et al., 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B44" href="#B44">2002</a>). Therefore, when fully engorged, 
   <span class="italic">Borrelia</span>-infected nymphs molt to adult stage, it is not obvious that they can spread the pathogen further. However, although not very efficient, transovarial transmission is described for Babesia (Bonnet et al., 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B8" href="#B8">2007</a>), Borrelia (Bellet-Edimo et al., 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B6" href="#B6">2005</a>) and TBEV (Danielová and Holubová, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B13" href="#B13">1991</a>), which means that infected larvae can be transported by birds, and then molt to infected nymphs. Likewise, adult ticks may produce infected offspring after arrival on a new place, by transovarial transmission.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Human pathogens can also be transported by ticks that normally don't bite humans, as is shown for 
   <span class="italic">I. uriae</span> (Olsen et al., 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B57" href="#B57">1995b</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the case of TBEV, the virus is thought to be maintained in nature mainly by transmission through co-feeding on small rodents, as infected nymphs spread the virus to co-feeding larvae (Labuda and Randolph, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B45" href="#B45">1999</a>). It is almost exclusively nymphs and larvae of 
   <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> that can be transported by birds (Jaenson et al., 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B41" href="#B41">1994</a>; Hasle et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B33" href="#B33">2009</a>). As the bird host would be the first host for the feeding larvae, they would not carry TBEV before entering the bird unless the virus is transmitted transovarially. Infected nymphs would proceed to adult stage after feeding, and would not feed on small rodents. Therefore, the TBEV-infected ticks transported by birds would be a dead-end for maintaining the TBEV in nature, without transovarial transmission. Assuming transovarial transmission, the TBEV could be seeded by birds to new areas if the climate, vegetation and hosts are suitable for the natural TBEV-cycle. In Norway, the first cases of TBE were notified in Southern Norway in 1998. Since then there has been an increase in annual cases, to the present 10–15 cases per year. A very relevant question would be why this has not happened before. The answer may well be that it has happened before, but that the conditions necessary for maintaining the fragile cycle of TBEV (Randolph and Rogers, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B62" href="#B62">2000</a>) in the nature have not been present before. The distribution of TBEV in Scandinavia is discontinuous, with at least 300 km of land distance from the endemic areas in Sweden (Båhuslän) to the Agder counties in Norway, while crossing the Skagerrak or Kattegat sea is a three to five hours flight for small passerine birds. It is difficult to find another explanation for this discontinuous distribution than transport via birds. This is the closest we can come to a proof that birds have seeded a tick-borne infection to a new area.

   <span class="italic">Babesia venatorum</span> is an emerging tick-borne human disease in Europe. The first findings of this parasite in Norway have been on four nymphs of 
   <span class="italic">Ixodes ricinus</span> brought to Norway by birds (Hasle et al., 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B35" href="#B35">2011</a>). 
   <span class="italic">B. venatorum</span> is a primarily a roe deer parasite (Duh et al., 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B16" href="#B16">2005</a>), and adult 
   <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> readily feed on roe deer. Therefore, birds could effectively import and spread this parasite.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Birds can be infected by different genuses of Anaplasmataceae, i.e., 
   <span class="italic">Anaplasma phagocytophilum</span> (de la Fuente et al., 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B15" href="#B15">2005</a>), 
   <span class="italic">Rickettsia rickettsia</span> (Lundgren et al.,

   <span class="italic">Coxiella burneti</span> (Babudieri and Moscovici, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B4" href="#B4">1952</a>). We have not found any experimental data confirming that birds infected by the Anaplasmataceae can transfer these pathogens to ticks. The 
   <span class="italic">Babesia</span> spp. appears to be host specific, at least to the class, and some of them to one species (Peirce, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B58" href="#B58">2000</a>), no mammal 
   <span class="italic">Babesia</span> sp. has been found infecting birds. Some species of

   <span class="italic">B. garinii</span>, 
   <span class="italic">B. valaisiana</span>, 
   <span class="italic">B. turdi</span> (Gylfe et al.,

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B63" href="#B63">2000</a>) and 
   <span class="italic">B. burgdorferi</span> s.s. (Anderson and Magnarelli, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B3" href="#B3">1984</a>; Anderson et al., 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B2" href="#B2">1986</a>), but probably not 
   <span class="italic">B. afzelii</span> (Kurtenbach et al., 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B44" href="#B44">2002</a>), although this notion has been challenged by the findings of Franke et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B22" href="#B22">2010</a>). Hasle et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B34" href="#B34">2010</a>) found an odds ratio for 
   <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infection of 4.3 for ticks parasitizing the 
   <span class="italic">Turdus</span> spp., i.e. 3.5 for 
   <span class="italic">B. garinii</span> and 30.3 for 
   <span class="italic">B. valaisiana</span>. This indicates that the 
   <span class="italic">Turdus</span> spp. are more susceptible for infection with these 
   <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> genospecies than other birds, and that the ticks got the pathogen during feeding on the bird. Thus, the 
   <span class="italic">Turdus</span> spp., apart from being likely to carry ticks, were more likely to carry 
   <span class="italic">Borrelia</span>-infected ticks than other bird genera. Therefore, the 
   <span class="italic">Turdus</span> spp., especially the blackbird, may be important in the spreading and hosting of 
   <span class="italic">B. garinii</span>, which is the main agent for neuroborreliosis (van Dam et al., 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B71" href="#B71">1993</a>; Balmelli and Piffaretti, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B5" href="#B5">1995</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 
   <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> species causing tick-borne relapsing fever are transmitted by soft ticks, 
   <span class="italic">Ornithodorus</span> spp., which have a different biology from the 
   <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span>-like ticks in that they live in nests and burrows and have a feeding time of just a few minutes Johnson and Golighty (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B42" href="#B42">2000</a>). These ticks would not be prone to long-range transport by birds, but the birds may contract the 
   <span class="italic">Borrelia</span>, which can be transmitted further, as suggested for 
   <span class="italic">Borrelia hermsii</span>, by (Schwan et al.,

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Transfer of pathogens through co-feeding</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Transmission of a tick-borne pathogen through co-feeding has been demonstrated for the tick-borne encephalitis-virus (TBEV) on 
   <span class="italic">Myodes glareolus</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Apodemus sylvaticus</span> (Labuda and Randolph, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B45" href="#B45">1999</a>), but no data exists for such transmission of TBEV on birds. In Waldenström et al.'s material (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B72" href="#B72">2007</a>) they found three TBEV-positive 
   <span class="italic">I. ricinius</span>, one nymph and two larvae, on one individual European robin, 
   <span class="italic">Erithacus rubecula</span>, which strongly suggests that the bird either was viremic or that transmission through co-feeding did occur.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Also, for 
   <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> this mechanism has been suggested for mammals. Gern and Rais (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B25" href="#B25">1996</a>) demonstrated transmission of 
   <span class="italic">B. burgdorferi</span> between co-feeding 
   <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> on AKR/N mice in the laboratory. By using a generalized linear model (GLM) Hasle et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B34" href="#B34">2010</a>) found that ticks that were co-feeding on birds with ticks infected with one genospecies of 
   <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> had an increased probability of being infected with the same genospecies. A tick co-feeding with another tick with 
   <span class="italic">B. afzelii</span> had an odds ratio of 3.9. If the statement that birds cannot be infected with 
   <span class="italic">B. afzelii</span> is correct, this is an indication that non-systemic transmission between co-feeding ticks has occurred. For 
   <span class="italic">B. valaisiana</span> the odds ratio for ticks co-feeding with other ticks with 
   <span class="italic">B. valaisiana</span> was 760, compared to the average prevalence. The latter could partly be explained by the effect of feeding on the 
   <span class="italic">Turdus</span> spp., and by systemic infection of the bird. Geller et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B24" href="#B24">2013</a>) found the same strain of 
   <span class="italic">B. afzelii</span> (PGau) on two 
   <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> nymphs that were feeding on the same Great tit (
   <span class="italic">Parus major</span>), a finding that suggests transmission through co-feeding.
