 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study was conducted on publicly accessible land owned by Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust, who were aware that the study was being undertaken. No specific permissions were required to access the land or to undertake the study. Dormice are a protected species in the UK, requiring a handling license if they are being disturbed, however, no dormice were handled during the collection of habitat data for this study: these data were collected during winter when dormice were hibernating, thus ensuring that dormice were not disturbed. Occupancy data were collected before the study began, as part of a national monitoring programme, by trained volunteers with dormouse handling licenses. Dormice were put back inside their respective nestboxes promptly after the necessary data were recorded. No dormice were harmed during this procedure. licenses were granted only after volunteers had proven that they could handle dormice safely without harming them. For the purpose of this study, the lead author (RLW) also obtained a dormouse handling license issued by Natural England to undertake the work (license number 20121036); the conditions of this license were observed at all times.
