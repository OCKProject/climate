  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>–
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">7</a>]. Most nest-building birds, for example, invest considerable time and energy choosing their nest-site because certain sites greatly influence reproductive success [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the UK, a lack of appropriate woodland management and habitat fragmentation has resulted in the reduction of suitable habitat for dormice, at the edge of their range, leading to extirpations [
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>]. As a result, and despite legal protection, dormouse distribution has reduced by more than half since the 19
  <span class="sup">th</span> century, and the species is now of conservation concern in the UK [
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>]. Dormouse nesting ecology is difficult to study because dormice are cryptic, nocturnal and arboreal; their natural nests are difficult to locate as they are usually concealed in thick foliage or in tree cavities, and may be as high as 15 m in the canopy [
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>,
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">19</a>]. This makes studies relying on natural nest-sites logistically challenging, or even misleading, because of the high risk of not finding nests [
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>]. Nestbox occupation data provide an opportunity to estimate relative abundance and distribution of dormice with minimal labour [
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">21</a>]. Dormice are found in nestboxes from mid-May to October, and are known to use them across their range, thereby allowing the comparison of findings across similar studies [
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>]. Nestboxes also benefit dormouse conservation. Bright and Morris [
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>] conducted a radio-tracking survey and found that artificial nestboxes were by far the most frequently used nest-sites compared to natural nests. They argued that, where nestboxes are present, almost the whole population would use them, and providing nestboxes appeared to double the number of dormice present in an area [
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>]. Some cavity-nesting bird species such as blue and great tits are known to use artificial nestboxes almost exclusively when they are available, and numerous studies have benefited from the study of these species in nestboxes [
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>]. As dormice also readily breed in nestboxes [
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">24</a>], this also allows the study of their breeding ecology. Both male and female dormice use nestboxes, and they can be found either singly or in groups of two or more (e.g. male-female breeding pairs, groups of juveniles, mothers with litters) and this fluctuates depending on the time of year. Dormice can have several litters per year, although exact numbers of litters and young per litter differ across their range [
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>] (note that two litters per year were commonly found in some nestboxes at the present study site; one in early summer and one in the autumn). Any findings that relate habitat features to nestbox preference or breeding success in nestboxes could therefore easily be used in an applied sense (e.g. changing nestbox location) and may have more immediate conservation implications than findings relating to habitat features in natural nest-sites (because these cannot be moved), although factors influencing the selection of natural and artificial sites may not be identical.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is a growing focus on long-term volunteer-collected datasets in ecology [
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">25</a>,
  <a rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26">26</a>] because volunteer-run programmes provide large quantities of data at minimal cost [
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">27</a>,
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">28</a>]. Deploying a team of volunteers can also save substantial amounts of time compared to using professional ecologists [
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">27</a>]. In the UK, many conservation organisations rely heavily on volunteers to collect data (e.g. the British Trust for Ornithology BTO, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds RSPB, the People’s Trust for Endangered Species PTES, the Mammal Society, the Marine Conservation Society, the Wildlife Trusts and the Bat Conservation Trust), however, volunteer-collected data are often questioned because they lack the rigour and precision of scientific studies (e.g. [
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">29</a>]).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The dormouse is a popular and charismatic species in the UK. Currently, over 1,000 volunteers participate in the National Dormouse Monitoring Programme (NDMP) run jointly by the PTES and Natural England. These volunteers have been submitting records since 1988, and in 2011, there were 305 sites involved in the scheme (with some annual variation – S. Sharafi, PTES, pers. comm.). Volunteers are required to check nestboxes at a site at least twice a year (May/June and Sept/Oct) to monitor evidence of dormouse occupation. The records are analysed by the PTES to estimate national trends in dormouse numbers and distribution.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Understanding breeding dormouse population nestbox requirements is crucial if nestboxes are to be maximally effective for conservation. Using long-term (18-year) volunteer-collected data collected as part of the NDMP, this study: (1) tests whether dormice actively choose (rather than randomly occupy) nestboxes; (2) examines some of the biotic and abiotic factors responsible for this selection; and (3) provides recommendations on using large volunteer datasets, discussing the attributes and limitations such datasets present.</p>
