 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study demonstrates three main points. Firstly, dormice actively select nestboxes, a point often overlooked or impossible to test in habitat selection studies (e.g. [
  <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">36</a>,
  <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">38</a>]). Secondly, a suite of habitat factors can explain a considerable degree of this nestbox selection, which could inform the placement of nestboxes for the purpose of dormouse research and conservation. Thirdly, volunteers can collect useful data on dormouse nestbox occupation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several of the factors included as candidate variables in the model influenced dormouse nestbox selection, together explaining 28% of variability in occupancy. The most influential factor was the distance from the edge of the wood, which may be due to edge effects (such as increased predation or competition [
  <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">39</a>]), although some nestboxes were occupied despite being close to the wood edge and the presence of potential dormouse predators was not recorded in this study (for example, corvid birds are potential predators of dormice in edge habitats – see 
  <a rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40">40</a>. As Midger Wood is a small wood (9 ha), it is not possible to determine at what point distance to the edge of the wood would cease to be important, for example, in a much larger wood. Additionally, the shape of the woodland might affect the importance of the distance to edge variable on dormouse nestbox selection, since this affects the edge:interior ratio. The influence of edge effects on nest-site selection has been studied mainly in avian populations [
  <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">41</a>] and there are currently no studies on its effect on dormice, although edge effect influences in smaller woods have been proposed [
  <a rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42">42</a>]. Contradictory results show that dormice readily occupied nest tubes on the fringe of dense scrub in Dorset (S. Eden, pers. comm.), possibly because these were less favoured by competing small mammals (note: nest tubes consist of a length of corrugated plastic tubing and square in section containing a sliding wooden tray [
  <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">43</a>]). There may be very different selection pressures influencing populations across different habitats.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since dormice selected nestboxes on thinner trees in this study, it may be that larger trees supported more natural nest-sites such as cavities or dense foliage in the canopy. There is much contention as to whether dormice prefer to use nestboxes or natural nest-sites and factors vary greatly in different habitats. In young woodlands, hedgerows and scrub, dormice may favour unenclosed natural nest-sites (e.g. woven into bramble) over tree hollows or artificial nest-sites [
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">16</a>,
  <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">44</a>], although in diverse, low-growing woodlands, radio-tracked dormice preferred nestboxes over natural nest-sites [
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>]. In coppice-with-standards woodland, radio-tracked dormice spent the majority of time either in nestboxes (34% of dormouse tracking days) or in natural tree hollows (41%) and far less time in natural nests in bramble (8%) [
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">19</a>]. Juškaitis [
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>] found that dormouse nestbox occupation was negatively, but weakly, correlated with tree crown density; the positive relationship with canopy clumpiness found in this study might be due to similar reasons, as gaps in the canopy would mean fewer arboreal routes, which may cause dormice to descend to nestboxes. High canopy clumpiness meant that there were areas of dense cover but also large gaps that let through direct sunlight, which would benefit the plant species that dormice use for food and nest material. It is still unclear how selection for natural nest-sites interacts with nestbox selection mechanisms, and this would be an interesting area for further investigation. Note that studies into natural nest-sites in woodland are facilitated by radio-tracking, and this is unlikely to be feasible using NDMP volunteers due to the legislation surrounding fitting radio-tracking devices to dormice, and the prohibitive costs involved. Nestboxes therefore remain a more practical way of studying dormice with the help of volunteers.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The presence of certain plant species influenced dormouse nestbox selection: dormice were positively correlated with oak and honeysuckle, and negatively correlated with ferns, sycamore and hawthorn. Food sources influence nestbox selection, as dormice rarely travel further than 100 m from their nests but require a diversity of food sources to ensure that food is available continuously throughout the active season [
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>,
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>]. Honeysuckle and oak are important food sources [
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>,
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>,
  <a rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45">45</a>,
  <a rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46">46</a>], with honeysuckle also forming an important component of dormouse nests in Midger Wood [
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">30</a>]. It is therefore unsurprising that these plant species are important explanatory variables in the final models. The presence of ferns is characteristic of dark and damp areas [
  <a rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47">47</a>], which may be avoided by dormice. The negative relationship with sycamore is unlikely to be biologically meaningful as this species was only present near three nestboxes (these never contained dormice, and this is the reason for its statistical inclusion in the stepwise regression).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The lack of competition between dormice and other nestbox inhabitants was of particular interest in this study because competition for nestboxes occurs in other studies (e.g. [
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>,
  <a rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48">48</a>]). Although the lack of competition between birds and dormice agreed with the findings of Morris et al. [
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">24</a>]), years in which dormice occupied more nestboxes generally coincided with years in which birds occupied fewer nestboxes, implying that larger scale effects such as population fluctuations might influence nestbox occupancy. The amount of volunteer-collected data available on birds and dormice might provide an opportunity to investigate this relationship further.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The remaining variability in our study might be explained by chance, variables that were not measured as part of this study (e.g. climate, predators, parasites, pathogens etc), or by dormouse learning and previous experience. Indeed, Marsh and Morris [
  <a rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49">49</a>] found that boxes favoured by dormice in one year tended to be reselected by them in the following year; however, since individuals were not individually marked for identification at the study site, it was not possible to investigate this. Furthermore, since our study only investigated one small woodland in the UK, it is possible that the results may be site and size specific, and further exploration would be needed to elucidate the generality of the results. The temporal span of the dataset was 18 years, and some of the explanatory factors may have changed over this time despite consistent management by GWT. The influence of parasites and predators on dormouse nestbox selection would be an interesting topic for future study, but as this would require annual records of the relevant variables, it was not possible to examine this here using a historical dataset.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using volunteer-collected data has both advantages and disadvantages. Alongside the usual benefits of saving time and money compared to recruiting professionals [e.g. 27, 28], a key advantage of this volunteer-collected dataset was its longevity; this can also be an important attribute of useful volunteer-collected data [
  <a rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50">50</a>]. Additionally, volunteers surveyed the nestboxes monthly from April to November, the highest recommended number of nestbox checks in a year [
  <a rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51">51</a>]. As a result of this, the dataset was large (&gt;30,000 data points: 97 boxes * 6 months * 18 years * 3 species – dormice, small mammals and birds), which reduced the chance of a type II error.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Volunteer-collected data also has indirect benefits. For example, volunteers also monitored any issues at the site (e.g. fallen trees across footpaths) and reported these back to GWT, thus facilitating the overall management of the site. Most of the regular volunteers at Midger Wood were members of GWT, providing financial support through their memberships and therefore contributing to the cost of managing the site as well as collecting data. Newman et al. [
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">27</a>] found that at least 30% of their volunteers joined conservation organisations after they had volunteered on their project. Meaningful interactions with the natural world also have the potential to enhance human wellbeing and quality of life [
  <a rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52">52</a>,
  <a rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53">53</a>] and volunteers who participated in mammal surveying projects gained fulfilment and knowledge [
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">27</a>]. When asked, volunteers at Midger Wood stated that they gained enjoyment from monitoring the nestboxes and some had been participating in dormouse surveys at the site for 18 years.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The volunteer dataset did, however, present some analytical challenges. Although nestbox occupancy data were collected regularly and followed the majority of NDMP guidelines, volunteers did not collect any habitat data, despite habitat data being requested at 5-year intervals for the NDMP. These habitat data would have proved extremely useful in the present study. Habitat characteristics were measured by the authors at the end of an 18-year period, and we were aware that some of these would have changed during this time. A careful analysis and a consideration of variables that may have changed resulted in useful trends being identified. Some nestbox records were difficult to interpret and, if they could not be confirmed, they had to be discarded from the dataset (&lt;5% of the records). There was a certain degree of variability in the records that made computerising the dataset time-consuming (e.g. a record of “*DORMOUSE*” was described as an unoccupied dormouse nest at the bottom of the recording form, not the presence of a dormouse as suggested). Exact records (i.e. how nestbox contents were recorded on the form) were variable between different people despite using the same data recording forms, and this issue increased with the fluctuating number of volunteers.</p>
