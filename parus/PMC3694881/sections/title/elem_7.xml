 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Occupation of nestboxes was relatively low, with an average of 7.3% of boxes occupied in any given year (S.D. = 3.3, minimum 2%, maximum 13%). Occupation of nestboxes was not random (Z = 5.07, n = 97, p &lt; 0.01), indicating active nestbox selection. The final stepwise-reduced model was highly significant (F
  <sub>8,88</sub> = 5.68, p &lt; 0.01) and the suite of habitat variables entered explained 28% of variability in dormouse occupancy (adjusted r
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.28) (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2">Table 2)</a>. It is important to note that the stepwise approach creates a best-fit model of numerous predictor variables in a multivariate framework, balancing model explanatory power and parsimony. Overall, this model is highly significant, and all explanatory variables in the model are important in achieving the overall significance and R
  <span class="sup">2</span> value, and warrant further discussion. Not all explanatory variables are independently significant in this final model (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2">Table 2)</a> since many of these are important in association with other variables (i.e. there is no simple univariate relationship). The most important factor determining occupancy was the distance from the wood edge. This was a positive correlation, indicating that dormice preferred nestboxes towards the centre of the wood. There was a negative relationship between occupancy and the circumference of the nestbox tree; smaller trees were associated more strongly with nestbox use than larger trees. There was also a negative relationship with the presence of ferns. Presence of oak and canopy clumpiness, as well as the number of trees and the presence of hawthorn were also important factors in the final best-fit model.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The stepwise regression also showed that there was a positive relationship between dormouse occupancy and bird nests (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab2" href="#tab2">Table 2)</a>, indicating: (1) no evidence of competition in the study population and (2) that nestboxes were selected on the basis of similar, or at least closely correlated, variables. When bird nests and dormouse occupancy were further examined for all nestboxes within years, a relatively strong significant negative correlation was found (r
  <sub>s</sub> = -0.56; n = 18; p = 0.016), implying potential competition or mutual exclusion on a yearly basis (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067986-g001" href="#pone-0067986-g001">Figure 1)</a>. Comparison of the observed percentage of occupation of each nestbox in a given year by birds, dormice or both showed no significant difference to calculated expected values where dormouse and bird occupation were calculated independently of one another (χ
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.01; df = 3; p &gt; 0.99), hence, there was no evidence of competition between birds and dormice at this site.

  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.28, Wald = 0.83, p &lt; 0.01). Distance from the edge of the wood remained the most significant explanatory variable (p &lt; 0.01), followed by canopy clumpiness (p = 0.03). Ferns, honeysuckle and sycamore were also important in the final best-fit model (
