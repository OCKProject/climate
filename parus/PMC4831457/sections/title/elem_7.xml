 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each gene, raw fluorescence values of all individuals, including all technical replicates and controls, were compiled into a single data file. Initial mRNA quantities (
  <span class="italic">N</span>
  <sub>0</sub>) were estimated using a regression‐based procedure implemented in LinRegPCR (Ramakers et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0063">2003</a>; Ruijter et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0066">2013</a>). Replicate 
  <span class="italic">N</span>
  <sub>0</sub> values of each candidate gene were standardized relative to the geometric mean of 
  <span class="italic">N</span>
  <sub>0</sub> values for all technical replicates of reference genes for a given individual (Vandesompele et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0081">2002</a>). Standardized data were then screened for outliers: technical replicates greater than two standard deviations from their corresponding family‐by‐treatment mean were flagged and removed – on average, outlier removal resulted in the loss of a single data point (i.e. individual) per gene in the final data set (range 0–3). Following standardization and outlier removal, technical replicates were averaged by individual.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To evaluate effects of temperature and/or sex on candidate gene transcription, and to estimate additive genetic variance (
  <span class="italic">V</span>
  <sub>A</sub>) for transcription, we analysed data under a pedigree‐weighted, mixed effects model (i.e. the animal model) implemented in the R package ‘MCMCglmm’ (Hadfield 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0027">2010</a>). In order to evaluate the significance of additive genetic variance for transcription, we ran two nested models: a minimal/null model including only random variation among rearing tanks, and a second model which also included ‘animal’ variance (
  <span class="italic">V</span>
  <sub>A</sub>); both models included coefficients describing fixed effects of temperature treatment, sex and their interaction. To ensure convergence and sufficient mixing, models were run for 25 000 000 iterations comprising an initial burn‐in of 20 000 000 iterations and a sampling chain of 5 000 000 iterations. To reduce autocorrelation of estimates, each 5000th point of the Markov chain was sampled, yielding a total of 1000 posterior estimates of model parameters. Model (i.e. 
  <span class="italic">V</span>
  <sub>A</sub>) significance was evaluated based on the deviance information criterion (DIC); significance of fixed effects was determined by profiling the posterior distributions of estimated coefficients.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As mRNA extraction necessitated lethal sampling, individuals could not be sampled in multiple environments, thereby precluding the possibility of estimating additive genetic variance for transcriptional plasticity. However, to evaluate the potential for genetic variance in plasticity (V
  <sub>G × E</sub>), we ran two additional nested models: a model including broad‐sense genetic variance in mean transcription (i.e. variation among families in the intercept coefficient; V
  <sub>G</sub>), and a model including broad‐sense (i.e. among family) variation in the temperature (i.e. slope) coefficient. Both models also included random variation among rearing tanks and were fully parameterized for all fixed effects. Models were run with a burn‐in of 500 000 iterations, followed by an additional 500 000 iterations from which each 500th point was sampled. Significance of V
  <sub>G × E</sub> was determined by contrasting the DIC score against both the V
  <sub>G</sub> and previous ‘null’ models.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inferring functional/adaptive value</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a tentative first inference into the potential adaptive value of variation in the candidate genes, we explored their functional relationships with a subset of genes previously identified as putatively under selection in a natural thermal gradient. In a companion paper, Smith et al. (unpublished) explored genomewide SNP variation along the latitudinal range of 
   <span class="italic">M. duboulayi</span> and observed 1141 loci putatively under climate‐mediated selection, as identified via outlier analysis using Bayescan (Foll and Gaggiotti 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0022">2008</a>). We first conducted a distant homology BLAST scan (gap opening and extension penalties 5 and 2; match/mismatch scores of 2 and −3; minimum percentage sequence identity 75) of the 93‐bp sequences of these outliers against the zebrafish genome (GRCz10; accessed July 28, 2015), reducing the data set to 411 annotated genes. We then used the BioMart package to retrieve identifiers (e.g. ENTREZ/NCBI accessions, official gene symbols) for use in subsequent analyses (Durinck et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0018">2005</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We queried the KEGG database to identify all known molecular pathways in zebrafish comprising a co‐occurrence of at least one of the 12 candidate genes assayed for transcription and one of the annotated outlier genes (Kanehisa and Goto 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0040">2000</a>; Kanehisa et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0041">2014</a>). Additionally, we performed a functional enrichment analysis and clustering of the two gene lists based on biological process and molecular function ontologies using DAVID (Huang et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0036">2007</a>; Sherman et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0072">2007</a>). Finally, we identified potential protein–protein interactions between members of each gene set by querying the STRING database (v10; accessed August 3, 2015; Snel et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0075">2000</a>; Szklarczyk et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0077">2015</a>). For each of the 12 candidate genes, we identified all known and predicted protein–protein interactions with the ‘highest’ confidence score (0.900). From this list, we identified 23 from the 411 genes putatively under selection and plotted their interaction network with the 12 candidate genes.
