 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At approximately 6 months of age, individuals from each family were assigned randomly, and in equal proportions, to one of two groups: a control representing current mean summer temperatures (21°C), and the projected mean 2070 summer temperature (31°C) for the Brisbane River region (Meehl et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0050">2007</a>; Reisinger et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0064">2014</a>). It should be noted that this projected summer temperature is below the upper thermal critical maximum (CT
  <sub>MAX</sub> = 38°C; SD = 0.39) of 
  <span class="italic">M. duboulayi</span> (Beheregaray, unpublished data), empirically estimated for Brisbane River rainbowfish following the method of Becker and Genoway (
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0003">1979</a>). Individuals from each temperature group were also randomly assigned to one of 19 replicate tanks. For the 31°C treatment, temperature was increased by 2°C per day until the experimental temperature was achieved. Tanks were monitored daily for signs of stress or disease associated with the higher temperature. Fish were then maintained for 80 days to approximate the typical duration of summer temperatures in the Brisbane River region.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the end of the treatment period, fish were sacrificed using AQUI‐S
  <span class="sup">®</span> solution and dissected to remove their livers for immediate RNA extraction. Although increased temperature has been shown to differentially induce transcription changes in different tissue types, we selected liver due to previous research specifically linking this tissue type to heat stress responses (Smith et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0074">2013</a>). The final data set contained 108 individuals (60 females &amp; 48 males), assigned in approximately equal proportions to control (21°C: 26 females; 21 males) and treatment (31°C: 34 females; 27 males) groups. Nineteen families were present, 16 of which were related as paternal half‐sibs, spawned from 19 dams and 11 sires. Family size ranged from one to 16 individuals (median = 5). All families comprised of six or fewer individuals had multiple, related individuals in a corresponding half‐sib family; the three families with no half‐sib relations contained from six to 14 individuals.
