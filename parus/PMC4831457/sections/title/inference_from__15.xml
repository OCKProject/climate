 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although function alone does not imply fitness, it does contribute to whole organism performance, and so may help to inform our understanding of the targets of selection (Dalziel et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0013">2009</a>). Many of the candidate genes are known to be directly involved in pathways associated with oxidative stress (e.g. 
  <span class="italic">gstr</span>; Hermes‐Lima and Zenteno‐Savín 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0031">2002</a>) and the regulation of metabolism (e.g. nr1d4b; Desvergne et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0015">2006</a>), both physiological processes likely to be affected by a warming thermal environment. And whilst new analyses suggest that mRNA levels might be a far better predictor of protein abundance than previously believed (Li and Biggin 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0045">2015</a>), increased protein production is not necessarily equivalent to increased functional activity (Feder and Walser 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0021">2005</a>). However, in evolved/steady‐state comparisons, transcriptional variation can correspond remarkably well to differences in enzyme activity (Nikinmaa et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0055">2013</a>). Given the extensive acclimation period of this study, we are likely safe to assume that current transcriptional data are reflective of steady‐state levels typical of summer conditions, both current and projected. As such, it is plausible that a degree of functional significance is captured in these data and that the most likely candidates in the physiologically mediated function/fitness nexus should be found at the functional intersection with genes under selection in the wild.
