 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sixty adult 
  <span class="italic">M. duboulayi</span> were collected using bait traps from a location in the upper reaches of the Brisbane River near the township of Fernvale (27°26′37.39″S, 152°40′12.76″E). The Brisbane River population was targeted because it is abundant compared with several 
  <span class="italic">M. duboulayi</span> found in smaller rivers and is centrally located along the north–south range of the species in eastern Australia. In addition, a landscape genomic study of 
  <span class="italic">M. duboulayi</span> based on over 17 000 SNPs screened in 22 populations from across the species range (Smith et al. unpublished) indicates that Brisbane River rainbowfish are part of a large representative group of populations locally adapted to climate‐related variables (hottest maximum and coldest minimum temperatures, run‐off, quarterly rainfall and annual radiation).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fish were transported by air to the Animal House and Aquaculture facility at Flinders University in Adelaide and allowed to acclimate for 6 months. During the acclimation period, fish were maintained in single sex tanks (12 fish/100L) at 21°C under conditions of 12 h light/12 h dark. They were fed once daily on a mixture of blood worms and fish pellets. After 6 months, photoperiod was changed to a cycle of 14 h light/10 h dark to induce breeding behaviour. When fish began exhibiting nuptial coloration and gravidity, 11 mating groups of a single male and two females were selected at random and transferred to breeding tanks. Breeding tanks were 100L volume and contained ‘spawning mops’ as artificial substrate for egg deposition. Mops were removed daily in the morning and were transferred to corresponding rearing tanks. Breeding was conducted over a 4‐month period from June to October 2012. Larvae were then reared in separate, 100‐L family‐rearing tanks at 21°C under a photoperiod of 12 h light/12 h dark and fed daily, initially with rotifers and later with blood worms and fish pellets.</p>
