 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Clarifying the roles of phenotypic plasticity (environmentally induced response) and microevolution (genetic response) in scenarios of environmental change is a major research priority (Hoffmann and Willi 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0033">2008</a>; Merilä and Hendry 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0052">2014</a>). Whilst under certain conditions plasticity can be adaptive (Gotthard and Nylin 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0026">1995</a>; Ghalambor et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0023">2007</a>), genetic responses are generally a requisite for long‐term persistence to predicted climate changes (Bradshaw and Holzapfel 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0005">2006</a>). Moreover, the potential for an evolved response requires demonstration of heritable variation in traits affecting individual performance under new environmental conditions (Gienapp et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0025">2008</a>; Charmantier and Gienapp 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0008">2014</a>). We can draw two conclusions from our long‐term common‐garden experiment of functional responses to predicted climate change with the Australian rainbowfish 
  <span class="italic">M. duboulayi</span>. The first is that increases in seasonal austral summer temperature projected under a high emissions scenario are likely to have a significant effect on the transcriptional profiles of this subtropical rainbowfish. The second is that even in the face of significant temperature effects, there is a variation in both transcription and the transcriptional response to increased temperatures. Most importantly, this variation has an underlying genetic basis and, as such, might allow for an evolved response.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additive genetic variance and adaptive potential</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Perhaps more important than confirmation of the transcriptional effects of projected temperature increases, this study adds to the growing body of evidence that transcriptional variance has an underlying heritable basis. Much of the previous work in the field has been dominated by studies designed to identify quantitative trait loci responsible for transcriptional variation (eQTL, Gibson and Weir 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0024">2005</a>; Skelly et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0073">2009</a>). Whilst this line of enquiry has provided many valuable insights into the regulatory nature of gene expression, classical pedigree‐based analyses of variance components may provide more reliable estimates of the fraction of transcriptional variance due to additive genetic effects (discussed in Leder et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0044">2015</a>). Thus, not only is this a highly cost‐effective approach to understanding the genetics of transcriptional variance, but also it has the potential to yield more accurate estimates of the parameters required to predict a response to changing selection pressures. Yet to date surprisingly few studies investigating the transcriptional effects of changing environmental stressors have taken such a pedigree‐based approach (though see Côté et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0011">2007</a>; Roberge et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0065">2007</a>; Debes et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0014">2012</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although this study does provide requisite proof of genetic variation, at present we do not know how transcriptional variance in these candidate genes might affect fitness. In fact, the general importance of transcriptional variance as a contributor to fitness remains a point of contention (Feder and Walser 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0021">2005</a>; Evans 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0019">2015</a>). Given the difficulty of quantifying fitness, it is perhaps unsurprising that few studies have attempted to integrate fitness metrics into the analysis of transcriptional variation in wild vertebrate models (but see McCairns and Bernatchez 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0048">2010</a>). Nevertheless, we may infer that some contributions to fitness must be conferred given the signatures of selection observed in transcriptional variation in natural populations. For example, stickleback populations inhabiting a broad latitudinal gradient in northern Europe show signatures of directional selection in nearly 16% of all transcripts, with many enriched for functional groups associated with temperature stress (Leder et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0044">2015</a>). Likewise, 22% of transcripts assayed in killifish adapted to a steep temperature gradient along the coast of eastern North America also show evidence of selection (Whitehead and Crawford 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0084" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0084">2006</a>). These studies demonstrate that transcriptional variation can clearly respond to selection and aid in the adaptation to divergent thermal environments. However, establishing a direct link to fitness remains an important next step if we are to understand its role in 
   <span class="italic">M. duboulayi</span>'s adaptive potential in a changing thermal environment.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inference from predicted functional associations</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although function alone does not imply fitness, it does contribute to whole organism performance, and so may help to inform our understanding of the targets of selection (Dalziel et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0013">2009</a>). Many of the candidate genes are known to be directly involved in pathways associated with oxidative stress (e.g. 
   <span class="italic">gstr</span>; Hermes‐Lima and Zenteno‐Savín 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0031">2002</a>) and the regulation of metabolism (e.g. nr1d4b; Desvergne et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0015">2006</a>), both physiological processes likely to be affected by a warming thermal environment. And whilst new analyses suggest that mRNA levels might be a far better predictor of protein abundance than previously believed (Li and Biggin 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0045">2015</a>), increased protein production is not necessarily equivalent to increased functional activity (Feder and Walser 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0021">2005</a>). However, in evolved/steady‐state comparisons, transcriptional variation can correspond remarkably well to differences in enzyme activity (Nikinmaa et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0055">2013</a>). Given the extensive acclimation period of this study, we are likely safe to assume that current transcriptional data are reflective of steady‐state levels typical of summer conditions, both current and projected. As such, it is plausible that a degree of functional significance is captured in these data and that the most likely candidates in the physiologically mediated function/fitness nexus should be found at the functional intersection with genes under selection in the wild.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A role for plasticity?</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All genes exhibited significant heritability for transcription. Although the proportion of total phenotypic variance explained by additive genetic effects was moderate (Table 
   <a rid="eva12363-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#eva12363-tbl-0002">2</a>), estimates are similar to that observed in various taxa (reviewed in Leder et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0044">2015</a>). Whether these are too low to effectively respond to selection exerted by increasing temperature remains an open question. For example, in UK populations of the great tit (
   <span class="italic">Parus major</span>), heritability for breeding time is similarly modest (
   <span class="italic">h</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.16), and insufficient to account for shifts which appear to track environmentally induced changes in an important prey item's phenology (Charmantier et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0009">2008</a>). In this example, plasticity in breeding time appears to have facilitated the shift. Given the labile nature of transcription, this raises the possibility of plasticity also facilitating a shift towards new optima beyond the limits of existing genetic variation.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plasticity in the form of acclimation seems an unlikely long‐term strategy. Indeed, species with an evolutionary history in highly variable thermal environments (i.e. those frequently adjusting/acclimating to changing conditions) may currently exist within their tolerance limits for physiological stress (Tomanek 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0078">2010</a>), and so may have limited plastic acclimation potential beyond this to meet additional physiological challenges imposed by climate change. The view with respect to transcriptional plasticity is also ambiguous. For example, a comparison of acute versus chronic (3 weeks) thermal stress in the bald notothen (
   <span class="italic">Pagothenia borchgrevinki</span>) revealed that mRNA levels of genes associated with ROS scavenging were increased in acute exposure but did not differ between control and chronic exposure; most critically, chronically exposed fish showed significantly higher levels of oxidative damage (Almroth et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0002">2015</a>). It should be noted, however, that this observation comes from a highly stenothermal species, a group which may lack a typical heat‐shock response (Tomanek 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0078">2010</a>). In contrast, brown trout (
   <span class="italic">Salmo trutta</span>) sampled from different thermal environments exhibit patterns of G × E for transcription suggestive of either a role for plasticity during adaptation to different temperatures, or the evolution of plasticity within them (Meier et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0051">2014</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One possible caveat to the role of transcriptional plasticity in adaptation, however, may be seen in the yeast model. Although studied in the context of nutritional environmental quality and not temperature, significant G × E for transcription was largely restricted to genes unlikely to have unique essential functions, for example paralogous genes (Landry et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0043">2006</a>). If this observation also holds true for other taxa, this might limit the number and/or types of genes with adequate heritable plasticity. One likely candidate, however, remains the PPAR pathway. Transcriptional regulation via PPARs (e.g. 
   <span class="italic">pparab</span>) may play a role in acclimation to both temperature and nutritional stress (Seebacher et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0070">2010</a>). In freshwater sticklebacks, plasticity in the transcription of 
   <span class="italic">pparaa</span> (a 
   <span class="italic">pparab</span> paralogue) is thought to have played a role in the colonization of a broader range of thermal environments than experienced by the ancestral population (Morris et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0053">2014</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In all cases, for plasticity to play a meaningful role in adaptation to a changing environment, it must move the phenotype towards the new fitness peak and it should be heritable (Gotthard and Nylin 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0026">1995</a>; Ghalambor et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0023">2007</a>). In subtropical rainbowfish, differences in temperature reaction norms indicate considerable variation in the potential response to increasing temperature (Fig. S1). Likewise, the relatively wide‐ranging posterior density intervals for certain families can be interpreted as a proxy for plasticity in the classical sense (i.e. the ability of a given genotype to produce a range of phenotypes in different environments). Moreover, we suggest that significant variation among families in the slope coefficient for nine of the twelve candidate genes is representative of broad‐sense heritability for plasticity. As such, if plasticity itself becomes an important determinant of fitness, there may be sufficient genetic variation upon which selection might act. Given that increased temperature variations are also a feature of most projections for the region (Reisinger et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0064">2014</a>), such potential for adaptive plasticity may play an important role in the persistence of 
   <span class="italic">M. duboulayi</span> along the east coast of Australia.

 <sec id="eva12363-sec-0017" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Acclimation time influences transcription pattern</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For many candidate genes, the transcriptional response to a season‐length duration of increased temperature showed patterns similar to those exhibited following short‐term (i.e. 14d) exposure (Smith et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0074">2013</a>). Three in particular (
   <span class="italic">hmgcs1</span>,
   <span class="italic"> nr1d4b</span> &amp; 
   <span class="italic">nsdhl</span>) were not only consistent between studies of 
   <span class="italic">M. duboulayi</span>, but also with respect to observations in threespine stickleback (
   <span class="italic">Gasterosteus aculeatus</span>) subjected to an acute temperature stress (Leder et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0044">2015</a>). That the range of fold‐change values observed among these studies was also remarkably similar would suggest that these genes may play a general role in the thermal stress response and/or thermal acclimation in teleost fishes – indeed increased liver transcription of 
   <span class="italic">hmgcs1</span> has also been reported in zebrafish (
   <span class="italic">Danio rerio</span>) exhibiting metabolic and oxidative stress (Hugo et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0037">2012</a>; Zhang et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0087" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0087">2012</a>; Tsedensodnom et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0079">2013</a>), both conditions associated with thermal stress. Similarly, two other candidate genes (
   <span class="italic">gstr</span> &amp; 
   <span class="italic">uqcrc2b</span>) were consistently upregulated in this and the previous study of 
   <span class="italic">M. duboulayi</span>. However, seven of the twelve genes studied exhibited patterns of transcription opposite of that inferred by transfrag quantitation of RNA‐Seq data.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the preponderance of transcription differences between sexes, and the fact that only males were assayed in the previous RNA‐Seq study, sex‐specific patterns are one potential explanation for observed discrepancies. However, only 
   <span class="italic">tmx2b</span> and 
   <span class="italic">hsp90aa1.2</span> show sufficient variability (i.e. overlapping posterior density intervals; Fig. 
   <a rid="eva12363-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12363-fig-0001">1</a>A and K) from which biased sampling might potentially suggest increased transcription in response to temperature, as observed previously. Moreover, although males show a trend towards increased 
   <span class="italic">hsp90aa1.2</span> transcription, this is neither significant (Table 
   <a rid="eva12363-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#eva12363-tbl-0001">1</a>) nor within an order of magnitude of the degree of fold change previously reported (ca. 140×). Conversely, threespine sticklebacks have been shown to exhibit a ca. 10‐fold increase of 
   <span class="italic">hsp90aa1.2</span> in liver tissue immediately following a temperature increase (Leder et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0044">2015</a>). Likewise, killifish (
   <span class="italic">Austrofundulus limnaeus</span>) show levels of 
   <span class="italic">hsp90α</span> induction that appear to increase over the first 24 h of thermal treatment, but maintain a relatively constant level of upregulation over a 14‐d period (Podrabsky and Somero 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0059">2004</a>). The common element between these experiments and previous observations in 
   <span class="italic">M. duboulayi</span> is the relatively short duration of exposure, likely occurring within a window of physiological stress/disruption of homeostasis. In contrast, current observations were made on fish likely acclimated to the increased temperature.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Acclimation time is known to affect the expression of a suite of physiological traits (Schulte et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0068">2011</a>; Healy and Schulte 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0029">2012</a>), and molecular responses to thermal challenge are no exception. With respect to mRNA transcription, expression is dependent not only upon acclimation time, but also the degree of thermal change experienced (Currie and Schulte 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0012">2014</a>). Whilst the common, immediate response to increased temperature involves initiation of a stress response, there appears to be considerable variability in the length of time required for homeostasis to be re‐established. For many temperate‐zone fishes, including both stenothermal and eurythermal species, transcriptome‐wide patterns of expression have been observed at steady state within a 4‐week acclimation period (Vornanen et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0083">2005</a>; Logan and Somero 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0046">2010</a>). In contrast, transcriptional patterns consistent with those of acute thermal stress persist in zebrafish following 4 weeks of exposure to elevated temperatures (Vergauwen et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0082" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0082">2010</a>). Little is known about the duration and/or periodicity of the molecular response to thermal stress in 
   <span class="italic">M. duboulayi</span> specifically; as such, we can only assume that transcript levels following 80 days of acclimation to experimental temperatures are at steady state. Irrespective, given the choice of experimental temperatures, these observations are likely to capture some elements of the transcriptional mechanisms underlying acclimatization to future summer seasons.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It should also be noted that previous observations were made on wild‐caught fish. Although acclimated to control temperature for 1 month prior to experimentation, it is unknown to what extent experimental individuals may have experienced different temperatures when inhabiting a naturally heterogeneous thermal environment. Temperature variation during embryonic development can have a significant impact on thermal acclimation potential and the transcriptomic response of adult fish to thermal stress (Schaefer and Ryan 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0067">2006</a>; Scott and Johnston 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0069">2012</a>). Thus, discrepancies could merely reflect differences between fish reared under fluctuating versus constant temperatures during a critical developmental stage. Whilst this may open reasonable debate regarding the extent to which observations on model animals reared under artificially homogeneous conditions can be extrapolated to wild populations, we would re‐iterate that this is outweighed by a significant advantage: the ability to disentangle environmental and genetic sources of variation.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, this study provides a tangible example that can be added to the debate surrounding adaptive evolution in response to climate change. Evidence of heritability in candidate gene expression, in addition to broad‐sense genetic variation in transcriptional plasticity, speaks to the potential for an adaptive response to future increases in environmental temperature. Additionally, molecular pathways of candidate genes were found to co‐occur with genes putatively under climate‐mediated selection in wild 
   <span class="italic">M. duboulayi</span> populations. Such findings are essential to meaningful discussions of adaptive change, but are sorely lacking in many studies of climate change adaptation. Although establishing a direct link between transcriptional variation and fitness remains essential if we are to understand its role in 
   <span class="italic">M. duboulayi</span>'s adaptive potential in a changing thermal environment, our study represents important first steps towards that end.
