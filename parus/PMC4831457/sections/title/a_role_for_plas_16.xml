 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All genes exhibited significant heritability for transcription. Although the proportion of total phenotypic variance explained by additive genetic effects was moderate (Table 
  <a rid="eva12363-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#eva12363-tbl-0002">2</a>), estimates are similar to that observed in various taxa (reviewed in Leder et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0044">2015</a>). Whether these are too low to effectively respond to selection exerted by increasing temperature remains an open question. For example, in UK populations of the great tit (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>), heritability for breeding time is similarly modest (
  <span class="italic">h</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.16), and insufficient to account for shifts which appear to track environmentally induced changes in an important prey item's phenology (Charmantier et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0009">2008</a>). In this example, plasticity in breeding time appears to have facilitated the shift. Given the labile nature of transcription, this raises the possibility of plasticity also facilitating a shift towards new optima beyond the limits of existing genetic variation.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plasticity in the form of acclimation seems an unlikely long‐term strategy. Indeed, species with an evolutionary history in highly variable thermal environments (i.e. those frequently adjusting/acclimating to changing conditions) may currently exist within their tolerance limits for physiological stress (Tomanek 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0078">2010</a>), and so may have limited plastic acclimation potential beyond this to meet additional physiological challenges imposed by climate change. The view with respect to transcriptional plasticity is also ambiguous. For example, a comparison of acute versus chronic (3 weeks) thermal stress in the bald notothen (
  <span class="italic">Pagothenia borchgrevinki</span>) revealed that mRNA levels of genes associated with ROS scavenging were increased in acute exposure but did not differ between control and chronic exposure; most critically, chronically exposed fish showed significantly higher levels of oxidative damage (Almroth et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0002">2015</a>). It should be noted, however, that this observation comes from a highly stenothermal species, a group which may lack a typical heat‐shock response (Tomanek 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0078">2010</a>). In contrast, brown trout (
  <span class="italic">Salmo trutta</span>) sampled from different thermal environments exhibit patterns of G × E for transcription suggestive of either a role for plasticity during adaptation to different temperatures, or the evolution of plasticity within them (Meier et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0051">2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One possible caveat to the role of transcriptional plasticity in adaptation, however, may be seen in the yeast model. Although studied in the context of nutritional environmental quality and not temperature, significant G × E for transcription was largely restricted to genes unlikely to have unique essential functions, for example paralogous genes (Landry et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0043">2006</a>). If this observation also holds true for other taxa, this might limit the number and/or types of genes with adequate heritable plasticity. One likely candidate, however, remains the PPAR pathway. Transcriptional regulation via PPARs (e.g. 
  <span class="italic">pparab</span>) may play a role in acclimation to both temperature and nutritional stress (Seebacher et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0070">2010</a>). In freshwater sticklebacks, plasticity in the transcription of 
  <span class="italic">pparaa</span> (a 
  <span class="italic">pparab</span> paralogue) is thought to have played a role in the colonization of a broader range of thermal environments than experienced by the ancestral population (Morris et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0053">2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In all cases, for plasticity to play a meaningful role in adaptation to a changing environment, it must move the phenotype towards the new fitness peak and it should be heritable (Gotthard and Nylin 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0026">1995</a>; Ghalambor et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0023">2007</a>). In subtropical rainbowfish, differences in temperature reaction norms indicate considerable variation in the potential response to increasing temperature (Fig. S1). Likewise, the relatively wide‐ranging posterior density intervals for certain families can be interpreted as a proxy for plasticity in the classical sense (i.e. the ability of a given genotype to produce a range of phenotypes in different environments). Moreover, we suggest that significant variation among families in the slope coefficient for nine of the twelve candidate genes is representative of broad‐sense heritability for plasticity. As such, if plasticity itself becomes an important determinant of fitness, there may be sufficient genetic variation upon which selection might act. Given that increased temperature variations are also a feature of most projections for the region (Reisinger et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0064">2014</a>), such potential for adaptive plasticity may play an important role in the persistence of
