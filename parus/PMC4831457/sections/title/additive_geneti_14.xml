 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Perhaps more important than confirmation of the transcriptional effects of projected temperature increases, this study adds to the growing body of evidence that transcriptional variance has an underlying heritable basis. Much of the previous work in the field has been dominated by studies designed to identify quantitative trait loci responsible for transcriptional variation (eQTL, Gibson and Weir 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0024">2005</a>; Skelly et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0073">2009</a>). Whilst this line of enquiry has provided many valuable insights into the regulatory nature of gene expression, classical pedigree‐based analyses of variance components may provide more reliable estimates of the fraction of transcriptional variance due to additive genetic effects (discussed in Leder et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0044">2015</a>). Thus, not only is this a highly cost‐effective approach to understanding the genetics of transcriptional variance, but also it has the potential to yield more accurate estimates of the parameters required to predict a response to changing selection pressures. Yet to date surprisingly few studies investigating the transcriptional effects of changing environmental stressors have taken such a pedigree‐based approach (though see Côté et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0011">2007</a>; Roberge et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0065">2007</a>; Debes et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0014">2012</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although this study does provide requisite proof of genetic variation, at present we do not know how transcriptional variance in these candidate genes might affect fitness. In fact, the general importance of transcriptional variance as a contributor to fitness remains a point of contention (Feder and Walser 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0021">2005</a>; Evans 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0019">2015</a>). Given the difficulty of quantifying fitness, it is perhaps unsurprising that few studies have attempted to integrate fitness metrics into the analysis of transcriptional variation in wild vertebrate models (but see McCairns and Bernatchez 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0048">2010</a>). Nevertheless, we may infer that some contributions to fitness must be conferred given the signatures of selection observed in transcriptional variation in natural populations. For example, stickleback populations inhabiting a broad latitudinal gradient in northern Europe show signatures of directional selection in nearly 16% of all transcripts, with many enriched for functional groups associated with temperature stress (Leder et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0044">2015</a>). Likewise, 22% of transcripts assayed in killifish adapted to a steep temperature gradient along the coast of eastern North America also show evidence of selection (Whitehead and Crawford 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0084" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0084">2006</a>). These studies demonstrate that transcriptional variation can clearly respond to selection and aid in the adaptation to divergent thermal environments. However, establishing a direct link to fitness remains an important next step if we are to understand its role in
