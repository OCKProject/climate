 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Global climate change poses many threats to biodiversity, but for ectotherms, the associated impacts affecting temperature niche may be particularly problematic (Pearson et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0058">2014</a>). Given pronounced intracontinental temperature increases (Diffenbaugh and Field 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0016">2013</a>), and the influence of localized climatic effects on their thermal properties (Caissie 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0006">2006</a>), inland and coastal freshwaters may be especially vulnerable to temperature increases. Indeed, freshwater habitats and their biota are among the most threatened by environmental change (Dudgeon et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0017">2006</a>), a concern highlighted in the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report (Settele et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0071">2014</a>). All freshwater fishes are ectotherms, and thus, metabolically sensitive to environmental temperature. How they are likely to respond to the challenges associated with global climate change is in many ways dependent upon the effects of new environmental inputs on essential physiological processes (Helmuth 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0030">2009</a>; Chown et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0010">2010</a>; Hofmann and Todgham 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0034">2010</a>). Within the context of population‐level responses to global climate change, adaptation and phenotypic plasticity are often cited as potential means of species persistence. Yet, few studies present empirical data essential to understanding whether either of these represents viable mechanisms. Critically absent from the discussion are demonstrations of a genetic basis for traits likely to influence fitness in the changed environments (Gienapp et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0025">2008</a>; Charmantier and Gienapp 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0008">2014</a>; Merilä and Hendry 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0052">2014</a>). Moreover, despite a perceived ubiquity of biological adaptation in nature, evidence of the potential to genetically adapt to climate change is scarce and ambiguous (Bradshaw and Holzapfel 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0005">2006</a>; Hoffmann and Sgrò 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0032">2011</a>; Merilä and Hendry 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0052">2014</a>). This is particularly so in aquatic organisms from the southern hemisphere, which are largely under‐represented in climate change research (Chambers et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0007">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Acclimatization – acclimation within the context of a controlled, laboratory setting – is a compensatory change in physiological processes in response to environmental change (Willmer et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0085" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0085">2005</a>) and represents a form of phenotypic plasticity. Transcriptional mechanisms appear to play a key role in acclimation to environmentally induced stressors across broad taxonomic groups (López‐Maury et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0047">2008</a>), and in the regulation of metabolism (Desvergne et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0015">2006</a>). For ectothermic species such as fishes, the latter is also highly relevant with respect to changes in the thermal environment. In many fish species, acclimation can increase threshold temperatures for induction of the cellular stress response and upper thermal tolerance (Fangue et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0020">2011</a>; Currie and Schulte 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0012">2014</a>). However, this may come at the cost of increased resting metabolic rate and related long‐term fitness consequences (Pörtner et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0061">2006</a>; Pörtner and Knust 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0060">2007</a>; Muñoz et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0054">2012</a>). Conversely, interindividual variation in the thermal response may be reflective of genetic variability in the underlying physiological processes. Yet, whilst a genetic basis to functional biology is frequently assumed in the literature, estimates of heritability for variation in physiological processes are scarce, especially in fishes (Chown et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0010">2010</a>). This is particularly problematic with respect to forecasting the effects of climate change, as any adaptive response is dependent upon the degree of additive genetic variation underlying organisms’ thermal physiology. If we are to address these issues in a rigorous manner, we require ecologically relevant models that are also amenable to multigenerational experimentation.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rainbowfishes (Melanotaeniidae) are a diverse (ca. 81 species) and monophyletic group endemic to Australia and New Guinea (Unmack et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0080">2013</a>). They inhabit a diverse range of freshwater habitats, being found almost everywhere that freshwater is present in Australia (Allen 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0001">1989</a>; McGuigan et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0049">2000</a>; Unmack et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0080">2013</a>). Despite their broad geographic distribution and abundance, they are nonmigratory, typically with small home ranges and strong microhabitat preferences (Hurwood and Hughes 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0038">2001</a>; Hattori and Warburton 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0028">2003</a>). In addition, many rainbowfish taxa have radiated relatively recently (McGuigan et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0049">2000</a>), especially the lineages endemic to Australia (Unmack et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0080">2013</a>). Given their close evolutionary relationships, strong metapopulation structures and diverse habitat preferences, these fishes represent a powerful field model for the study of local adaptation. Most species also display key attributes of a valuable laboratory model. They are small (ca. 3–9 cm), sexually dimorphic, easy to maintain and breed in captivity (they are very popular aquarium fishes), are highly fecund (between 150 and 1600 eggs) and have a short generation time, reproducing annually in the wild and at the age of 3 months in the laboratory (Pusey et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0062">2001</a>; Holdway et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0035">2008</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The crimson‐spotted rainbowfish (
  <span class="italic">Melanotaenia duboulayi</span>) is an Australian subtropical species found in vegetated streams over a relatively broad latitudinal range in coastal drainages east of the Great Dividing Range (ca. 31.4°S to 21.4°S; Allen 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0001">1989</a>). Temperatures along this distribution have been rising steadily, and high CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions projections may produce temperature as high as 10°C warmer by 2070 in the worst affected waterbodies (Meehl et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0050">2007</a>; Reisinger et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0064">2014</a>). Contemporary mean summer temperatures (ca. 21°C) are below the preferred temperature (26°C) for 
  <span class="italic">M. duboulayi</span> tested in a thermal gradient (King and Warburton 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0042">2007</a>). However, projected 2070 temperatures are expected to exceed the species preference and may approach levels near its critical thermal temperature (Patra et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0057">2007</a>; Beheregaray, unpublished data). Additionally, wild‐caught 
  <span class="italic">M. duboulayi</span> exhibit substantial plastic regulatory responses to temperature stress. In a short‐term transcriptomics (RNA‐Seq) experiment, Smith et al. (
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0074">2013</a>) identified and annotated 614 upregulated and 349 downregulated genes in relation to predicted summer temperatures for 2070. These include a suite of heat‐shock genes that responded sharply to increased temperatures, and genes related to regulation of metabolic functions and developmental processes that showed mid‐range changes in expression (Smith et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0074">2013</a>). Thus, the availability of excellent candidate genes for climatic adaptation, coupled with the species’ life history attributes, makes 
  <span class="italic">M. duboulayi</span> an ideal aquatic study system to assess molecular footprints of adaptive resilience to climate change.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we assess the adaptive potential to climate change of the subtropical Australian rainbowfish 
  <span class="italic">M. duboulayi</span>, focusing on a genetically healthy population that is centrally located along the climatically heterogeneous latitudinal range of the species. Specifically, we use the 
  <span class="italic">M. duboulayi</span> system to examine the effects of long‐term acclimation to increased temperature on the transcription of candidate genes which are differentially expressed in response to thermal stress, including a test for sex‐specific differences in this response. We hypothesize that there is a heritable basis underlying the variable transcriptional responses revealed during earlier experiments that used short‐term exposure to temperature treatments mimicking contemporary and future climate. Critically, we employ a reciprocal common‐garden design and incorporate information on the pedigree of experimental animals, to estimate both narrow‐sense heritability of transcription and broad‐sense genetic variation for its plasticity. Additionally, we test for functional associations with candidate genes inferred to be under temperature‐mediated selection in the wild (identified in a companion study) as a preliminary exploration of the potential adaptive value of transcriptional variation.
