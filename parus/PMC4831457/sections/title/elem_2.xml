   <span class="italic">M. duboulayi</span> were collected using bait traps from a location in the upper reaches of the Brisbane River near the township of Fernvale (27°26′37.39″S, 152°40′12.76″E). The Brisbane River population was targeted because it is abundant compared with several 
   <span class="italic">M. duboulayi</span> found in smaller rivers and is centrally located along the north–south range of the species in eastern Australia. In addition, a landscape genomic study of 
   <span class="italic">M. duboulayi</span> based on over 17 000 SNPs screened in 22 populations from across the species range (Smith et al. unpublished) indicates that Brisbane River rainbowfish are part of a large representative group of populations locally adapted to climate‐related variables (hottest maximum and coldest minimum temperatures, run‐off, quarterly rainfall and annual radiation).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fish were transported by air to the Animal House and Aquaculture facility at Flinders University in Adelaide and allowed to acclimate for 6 months. During the acclimation period, fish were maintained in single sex tanks (12 fish/100L) at 21°C under conditions of 12 h light/12 h dark. They were fed once daily on a mixture of blood worms and fish pellets. After 6 months, photoperiod was changed to a cycle of 14 h light/10 h dark to induce breeding behaviour. When fish began exhibiting nuptial coloration and gravidity, 11 mating groups of a single male and two females were selected at random and transferred to breeding tanks. Breeding tanks were 100L volume and contained ‘spawning mops’ as artificial substrate for egg deposition. Mops were removed daily in the morning and were transferred to corresponding rearing tanks. Breeding was conducted over a 4‐month period from June to October 2012. Larvae were then reared in separate, 100‐L family‐rearing tanks at 21°C under a photoperiod of 12 h light/12 h dark and fed daily, initially with rotifers and later with blood worms and fish pellets.</p>

   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0004">2000</a>). Microsatellite fragments were scored using GENEMAPPER 4.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), and scoring error evaluated using MICRO‐CHECKER (van Oosterhout et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0056">2004</a>). As breeding tanks contained only a single male, offspring paternity was known; maternity was inferred from resulting genotype of offspring and parents using COLONY (version 2.0.5.8; Jones and Wang

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At approximately 6 months of age, individuals from each family were assigned randomly, and in equal proportions, to one of two groups: a control representing current mean summer temperatures (21°C), and the projected mean 2070 summer temperature (31°C) for the Brisbane River region (Meehl et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0050">2007</a>; Reisinger et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0064">2014</a>). It should be noted that this projected summer temperature is below the upper thermal critical maximum (CT
   <sub>MAX</sub> = 38°C; SD = 0.39) of 
   <span class="italic">M. duboulayi</span> (Beheregaray, unpublished data), empirically estimated for Brisbane River rainbowfish following the method of Becker and Genoway (
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0003">1979</a>). Individuals from each temperature group were also randomly assigned to one of 19 replicate tanks. For the 31°C treatment, temperature was increased by 2°C per day until the experimental temperature was achieved. Tanks were monitored daily for signs of stress or disease associated with the higher temperature. Fish were then maintained for 80 days to approximate the typical duration of summer temperatures in the Brisbane River region.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the end of the treatment period, fish were sacrificed using AQUI‐S
   <span class="sup">®</span> solution and dissected to remove their livers for immediate RNA extraction. Although increased temperature has been shown to differentially induce transcription changes in different tissue types, we selected liver due to previous research specifically linking this tissue type to heat stress responses (Smith et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0074">2013</a>). The final data set contained 108 individuals (60 females &amp; 48 males), assigned in approximately equal proportions to control (21°C: 26 females; 21 males) and treatment (31°C: 34 females; 27 males) groups. Nineteen families were present, 16 of which were related as paternal half‐sibs, spawned from 19 dams and 11 sires. Family size ranged from one to 16 individuals (median = 5). All families comprised of six or fewer individuals had multiple, related individuals in a corresponding half‐sib family; the three families with no half‐sib relations contained from six to 14 individuals.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Total RNA was extracted from liver tissue using the Ambion Magmax
   <span class="sup">™</span>‐96 total RNA isolation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), following Smith et al. (
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0074">2013</a>). RNA quality and concentration were measured using a Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer, then diluted to a standardized concentration (10 ng/μL). Each dilution was checked for DNA contamination by PCR amplification of a housekeeping gene using the SensiFAST SYBR Hi‐ROX kit (Bioline, London, UK), followed by electrophoresis on agarose gel. Samples exhibiting amplified DNA were treated with DNase MAX Kit (MO BIO) for a second time. Finally, we used random primers and the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) for cDNA synthesis, following manufacturer's protocols.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Primers were designed to amplify twelve candidate genes that are putatively differentially expressed in response to thermal stress (Smith et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0074">2013</a>) – primer sequences and related information can be found in Table S1. Most importantly, candidate genes are believed to play a role in biological processes associated with a response to thermal challenge (e.g. oxidation reduction, metabolism, regulation of transcription; see Table S2). Candidates included homologues for the following zebrafish (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Quantitative PCR was performed in 96‐well plates on a StepOnePlus Real‐Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems), using a SYBR Green reporter. Reactions contained 1 μL of diluted cDNA (10 ng/μL), 5 μL of 2× SensiFAST SYBR Hi‐ROX (Bioline), 0.05 μ

Thermal cycles consisted of an initial denaturation step (95°C; 2 min), and 40 cycles of denaturation (95°C; 3 s), annealing (60°C; 10 s) and extension (72°C; 10 s). This was followed by a melt curve cycle of 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 1 min and 95°C for 15 s. A single gene was amplified for a given 96‐well plate that also comprised: three negative controls; a fourfold serial dilution of a positive control, also in triplicate; three technical replicates for 30 experimental animals.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each gene, raw fluorescence values of all individuals, including all technical replicates and controls, were compiled into a single data file. Initial mRNA quantities (
   <span class="italic">N</span>
   <sub>0</sub>) were estimated using a regression‐based procedure implemented in LinRegPCR (Ramakers et al. 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0063">2003</a>; Ruijter et al.

   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0081">2002</a>). Standardized data were then screened for outliers: technical replicates greater than two standard deviations from their corresponding family‐by‐treatment mean were flagged and removed – on average, outlier removal resulted in the loss of a single data point (i.e. individual) per gene in the final data set (range 0–3). Following standardization and outlier removal, technical replicates were averaged by individual.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To evaluate effects of temperature and/or sex on candidate gene transcription, and to estimate additive genetic variance (
   <span class="italic">V</span>
   <sub>A</sub>) for transcription, we analysed data under a pedigree‐weighted, mixed effects model (i.e. the animal model) implemented in the R package ‘MCMCglmm’ (Hadfield 
   <a rid="eva12363-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0027">2010</a>). In order to evaluate the significance of additive genetic variance for transcription, we ran two nested models: a minimal/null model including only random variation among rearing tanks, and a second model which also included ‘animal’ variance (
   <span class="italic">V</span>
   <sub>A</sub>); both models included coefficients describing fixed effects of temperature treatment, sex and their interaction. To ensure convergence and sufficient mixing, models were run for 25 000 000 iterations comprising an initial burn‐in of 20 000 000 iterations and a sampling chain of 5 000 000 iterations. To reduce autocorrelation of estimates, each 5000th point of the Markov chain was sampled, yielding a total of 1000 posterior estimates of model parameters. Model (i.e. 
   <span class="italic">V</span>
   <sub>A</sub>) significance was evaluated based on the deviance information criterion (DIC); significance of fixed effects was determined by profiling the posterior distributions of estimated coefficients.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As mRNA extraction necessitated lethal sampling, individuals could not be sampled in multiple environments, thereby precluding the possibility of estimating additive genetic variance for transcriptional plasticity. However, to evaluate the potential for genetic variance in plasticity (V
   <sub>G × E</sub>), we ran two additional nested models: a model including broad‐sense genetic variance in mean transcription (i.e. variation among families in the intercept coefficient; V
   <sub>G</sub>), and a model including broad‐sense (i.e. among family) variation in the temperature (i.e. slope) coefficient. Both models also included random variation among rearing tanks and were fully parameterized for all fixed effects. Models were run with a burn‐in of 500 000 iterations, followed by an additional 500 000 iterations from which each 500th point was sampled. Significance of V
   <sub>G × E</sub> was determined by contrasting the DIC score against both the V
   <sub>G</sub> and previous ‘null’ models.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a tentative first inference into the potential adaptive value of variation in the candidate genes, we explored their functional relationships with a subset of genes previously identified as putatively under selection in a natural thermal gradient. In a companion paper, Smith et al. (unpublished) explored genomewide SNP variation along the latitudinal range of 
    <span class="italic">M. duboulayi</span> and observed 1141 loci putatively under climate‐mediated selection, as identified via outlier analysis using Bayescan (Foll and Gaggiotti 
    <a rid="eva12363-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0022">2008</a>). We first conducted a distant homology BLAST scan (gap opening and extension penalties 5 and 2; match/mismatch scores of 2 and −3; minimum percentage sequence identity 75) of the 93‐bp sequences of these outliers against the zebrafish genome (GRCz10; accessed July 28, 2015), reducing the data set to 411 annotated genes. We then used the BioMart package to retrieve identifiers (e.g. ENTREZ/NCBI accessions, official gene symbols) for use in subsequent analyses (Durinck et al. 
    <a rid="eva12363-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0018">2005</a>).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We queried the KEGG database to identify all known molecular pathways in zebrafish comprising a co‐occurrence of at least one of the 12 candidate genes assayed for transcription and one of the annotated outlier genes (Kanehisa and Goto

    <a rid="eva12363-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0072">2007</a>). Finally, we identified potential protein–protein interactions between members of each gene set by querying the STRING database (v10; accessed August 3, 2015; Snel et al.

    <a rid="eva12363-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0077">2015</a>). For each of the 12 candidate genes, we identified all known and predicted protein–protein interactions with the ‘highest’ confidence score (0.900). From this list, we identified 23 from the 411 genes putatively under selection and plotted their interaction network with the 12 candidate genes.
