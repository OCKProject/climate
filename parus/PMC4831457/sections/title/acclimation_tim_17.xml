 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For many candidate genes, the transcriptional response to a season‐length duration of increased temperature showed patterns similar to those exhibited following short‐term (i.e. 14d) exposure (Smith et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0074">2013</a>). Three in particular (
  <span class="italic">hmgcs1</span>,
  <span class="italic"> nr1d4b</span> &amp; 
  <span class="italic">nsdhl</span>) were not only consistent between studies of 
  <span class="italic">M. duboulayi</span>, but also with respect to observations in threespine stickleback (
  <span class="italic">Gasterosteus aculeatus</span>) subjected to an acute temperature stress (Leder et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0044">2015</a>). That the range of fold‐change values observed among these studies was also remarkably similar would suggest that these genes may play a general role in the thermal stress response and/or thermal acclimation in teleost fishes – indeed increased liver transcription of 
  <span class="italic">hmgcs1</span> has also been reported in zebrafish (
  <span class="italic">Danio rerio</span>) exhibiting metabolic and oxidative stress (Hugo et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0037">2012</a>; Zhang et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0087" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0087">2012</a>; Tsedensodnom et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0079">2013</a>), both conditions associated with thermal stress. Similarly, two other candidate genes (
  <span class="italic">gstr</span> &amp; 
  <span class="italic">uqcrc2b</span>) were consistently upregulated in this and the previous study of 
  <span class="italic">M. duboulayi</span>. However, seven of the twelve genes studied exhibited patterns of transcription opposite of that inferred by transfrag quantitation of RNA‐Seq data.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the preponderance of transcription differences between sexes, and the fact that only males were assayed in the previous RNA‐Seq study, sex‐specific patterns are one potential explanation for observed discrepancies. However, only 
  <span class="italic">tmx2b</span> and 
  <span class="italic">hsp90aa1.2</span> show sufficient variability (i.e. overlapping posterior density intervals; Fig. 
  <a rid="eva12363-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12363-fig-0001">1</a>A and K) from which biased sampling might potentially suggest increased transcription in response to temperature, as observed previously. Moreover, although males show a trend towards increased 
  <span class="italic">hsp90aa1.2</span> transcription, this is neither significant (Table 
  <a rid="eva12363-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#eva12363-tbl-0001">1</a>) nor within an order of magnitude of the degree of fold change previously reported (ca. 140×). Conversely, threespine sticklebacks have been shown to exhibit a ca. 10‐fold increase of 
  <span class="italic">hsp90aa1.2</span> in liver tissue immediately following a temperature increase (Leder et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0044">2015</a>). Likewise, killifish (
  <span class="italic">Austrofundulus limnaeus</span>) show levels of 
  <span class="italic">hsp90α</span> induction that appear to increase over the first 24 h of thermal treatment, but maintain a relatively constant level of upregulation over a 14‐d period (Podrabsky and Somero 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0059">2004</a>). The common element between these experiments and previous observations in 
  <span class="italic">M. duboulayi</span> is the relatively short duration of exposure, likely occurring within a window of physiological stress/disruption of homeostasis. In contrast, current observations were made on fish likely acclimated to the increased temperature.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Acclimation time is known to affect the expression of a suite of physiological traits (Schulte et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0068">2011</a>; Healy and Schulte 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0029">2012</a>), and molecular responses to thermal challenge are no exception. With respect to mRNA transcription, expression is dependent not only upon acclimation time, but also the degree of thermal change experienced (Currie and Schulte 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0012">2014</a>). Whilst the common, immediate response to increased temperature involves initiation of a stress response, there appears to be considerable variability in the length of time required for homeostasis to be re‐established. For many temperate‐zone fishes, including both stenothermal and eurythermal species, transcriptome‐wide patterns of expression have been observed at steady state within a 4‐week acclimation period (Vornanen et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0083">2005</a>; Logan and Somero 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0046">2010</a>). In contrast, transcriptional patterns consistent with those of acute thermal stress persist in zebrafish following 4 weeks of exposure to elevated temperatures (Vergauwen et al. 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0082" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0082">2010</a>). Little is known about the duration and/or periodicity of the molecular response to thermal stress in 
  <span class="italic">M. duboulayi</span> specifically; as such, we can only assume that transcript levels following 80 days of acclimation to experimental temperatures are at steady state. Irrespective, given the choice of experimental temperatures, these observations are likely to capture some elements of the transcriptional mechanisms underlying acclimatization to future summer seasons.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It should also be noted that previous observations were made on wild‐caught fish. Although acclimated to control temperature for 1 month prior to experimentation, it is unknown to what extent experimental individuals may have experienced different temperatures when inhabiting a naturally heterogeneous thermal environment. Temperature variation during embryonic development can have a significant impact on thermal acclimation potential and the transcriptomic response of adult fish to thermal stress (Schaefer and Ryan 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0067">2006</a>; Scott and Johnston 
  <a rid="eva12363-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12363-bib-0069">2012</a>). Thus, discrepancies could merely reflect differences between fish reared under fluctuating versus constant temperatures during a critical developmental stage. Whilst this may open reasonable debate regarding the extent to which observations on model animals reared under artificially homogeneous conditions can be extrapolated to wild populations, we would re‐iterate that this is outweighed by a significant advantage: the ability to disentangle environmental and genetic sources of variation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, this study provides a tangible example that can be added to the debate surrounding adaptive evolution in response to climate change. Evidence of heritability in candidate gene expression, in addition to broad‐sense genetic variation in transcriptional plasticity, speaks to the potential for an adaptive response to future increases in environmental temperature. Additionally, molecular pathways of candidate genes were found to co‐occur with genes putatively under climate‐mediated selection in wild 
  <span class="italic">M. duboulayi</span> populations. Such findings are essential to meaningful discussions of adaptive change, but are sorely lacking in many studies of climate change adaptation. Although establishing a direct link between transcriptional variation and fitness remains essential if we are to understand its role in 
  <span class="italic">M. duboulayi</span>'s adaptive potential in a changing thermal environment, our study represents important first steps towards that end.
