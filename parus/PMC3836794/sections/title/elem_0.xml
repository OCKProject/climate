 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Patterns of geographic isolation during the Pleistocene in temperate areas have allowed behavioral, ecological, and genetic divergence among geographically isolated populations in a range of taxa [
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">1</a>,
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>]. However, panmixia is often found within highly mobile vertebrate populations, despite presumed geographic barriers to dispersal and divergent migratory pathways [
  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">3</a>–
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>]. While geographic barriers are instrumental in the formation of initial reproductive isolation, further isolating barriers are needed for continued genetic divergence in the face of gene flow, for example in the case of secondary contact between previously isolated populations at contact zones [
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">6</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Migratory divides represent the locations at which populations maintain divergent migratory routes, often originating during periods of allopatry, but can also evolve into hybrid zones as a result of secondary contact and interbreeding between populations [
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">7</a>]. If isolating barriers are sufficiently strong to maintain some degree of reproductive isolation between divergent populations, the level of genetic divergence among populations with distinct migratory routes may be high [
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">8</a>]. However, migratory divides are also known to be leaky barriers to gene flow, despite divergent migratory routes utilized by organisms, such as those found in migratory butterflies [
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">9</a>] and birds [
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>,
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>]. Where interbreeding does occur between different migrant types, it is hypothesized that migratory divides can also represent hybrid zones maintained by selection against hybrids as a form of reproductive isolation [
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>–
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">14</a>]. While migratory behavior does not appear to be a strong isolation barrier, it is among the best examples of a mechanism promoting adaptive microevolution [
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">15</a>,
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">16</a>]. For example, assortative mating based upon allochronic spring arrival to the breeding grounds can facilitate adaptive microevolution in passerines and promote genetic divergence within sympatric breeding populations [
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>–
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>] . 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Blackcap (
  <span class="italic">Sylvia atricapilla</span>) is a common European passerine and serves as a model species to study the evolution of migratory behavior because it spans the full spectrum of migratory distances (from sedentary to long-distance migrations) and migratory orientations. Several migratory traits have been shown to be under genetic control in Blackcaps, including timing of migration, direction, and duration/length of migration [
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">21</a>–
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">24</a>], while moderate-to-high heritabilities have been found for some of these traits in both wild and experimental populations [
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">15</a>,
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>]. In central Europe, Blackcaps exhibit a southwest/southeast (SW/SE) migratory divide resulting from the geographic isolation of potential glacial refugia in the Iberian Peninsula and Balkan Peninsula during the Pleistocene, followed by post-glacial expansion [
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">21</a>,
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">25</a>–
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">27</a>]. Weak but significant genetic structure in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been found to occur between Blackcap populations sampled on opposing sides of this divide [
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">28</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As recently as during the latter half of the last century, a portion of SW migrant Blackcaps shifted their autumn migration route to the northwest (NW), overwintering on the British Isles. It has been hypothesized by Helbig [
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">27</a>] that these NW migrants originated from within the SW/SE contact zone. Currently a novel northwest/southwest (NW/SW) migratory polymorphism exists where these different migrants breed sympatrically in southern Germany [
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">29</a>]. This change in orientation has facilitated rapid morphological, behavioral, and genetic divergence between migrants from different wintering grounds and may promote assortative mating as an isolating barrier in sympatry [
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>,
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>,
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>,
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">30</a>]. In this study, we investigate genetic variation in 12 populations of wild Blackcaps using 14 polymorphic microsatellite loci. Sampling sites spanned both the historical SW/SE migratory divide in central Europe and the novel NW/SW migratory polymorphism present in southern Germany (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081365-g001" href="#pone-0081365-g001">Figure 1</a>). By simultaneously characterizing levels of neutral genetic differentiation across the SW/SE migratory divide as well as the NW/SW polymorphism, we investigated two competing hypotheses: 1) if the migratory divide represents an adequate isolating barrier, genetic divergence between SW and SE migrants should be detectable (as found in [
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">28</a>]) and, given the long history of this divide, would be larger than that found at the novel NW/SW migratory polymorphism; 2) if the migratory divide is an incomplete barrier to gene flow, levels of genetic divergence should be lower across the SW/SE migratory divide (as found in other European passerines, [
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>,
  <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">31</a>]) compared to the novel NW/SW migratory polymorphism experiencing rapid, adaptive divergence in sympatry [
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>,
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>,
