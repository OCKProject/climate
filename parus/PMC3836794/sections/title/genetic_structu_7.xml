  <sub>ST</sub> values estimated with Arlequin v3.5.1.3 [
  <a rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46">46</a>] were found to be highly correlated with 
  <span class="italic">D</span>
  <sub>est</sub> values (Kendall’s tau = 0.637, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.0001) and so, we report only 
  <span class="italic">D</span>
  <sub>est</sub> values hereafter. Locus Syl10 has been shown to deviate from HWE in a previous study [
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>]. We included this marker in our dataset as it has been proven to be highly variable. However, we ran 
  <span class="italic">D</span>
  <sub>est</sub> analyses including and excluding this marker for all comparisons and found that 
  <span class="italic">D</span>
  <sub>est</sub> values were highly correlated between analyses (Kendall’s tau = 0.842, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.0001). Wilcoxon Sum Rank tests were implemented to investigate the independence of the distributions of 
  <span class="italic">D</span>
  <sub>est</sub> values within and among migratory orientations; the Uebersyren NW migrant identified via claw 
  <span class="italic">δ</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span>H was excluded from these analyzes.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Isolation-by-distance among Blackcap populations was explored with Mantel tests using Isolation by Distance Web Service v3.23 [
  <a rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47">47</a>] to investigate the relationship between geographic distance and genetic distance: Euclidean geographic distance among all 12 populations was calculated with the R package “fossil” [
  <a rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48">48</a>], pairwise genetic distance between populations was calculated as 
  <span class="italic">D</span>
  <sub>est</sub> /(1- D
  <sub>est</sub>) following Slatkin [49], and 10,000 randomizations were implemented. Additional Mantel tests were run for only those populations west of the SW/SE migratory divide and those populations east of the divide to investigate differential effects of isolation-by-distance on either side of the SW/SE divide.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relationship between genetic distance and longitudinal geographic distance was investigated between Blackcap populations located on opposing sides of the SW/SE migratory divide, which was approximated at 13°E (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081365-g001" href="#pone-0081365-g001">Figure 1</a>); we acknowledge that the contact zone between SW and SE migrants is potentially a broad, diffuse zone where migrants come into contact and here use this precise position as an approximate zone center (consistent with Blackcap ring recovery data [
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">25</a>–
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">27</a>,
  <a rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50">50</a>]) for analytical purposes only. The latitude of each population was set to zero and the Euclidean (longitudinal) distance between populations was calculated with the R package “fossil” [
  <a rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48">48</a>]. Spearman-Rank correlations were used to explore the relationship between genetic distance and longitudinal geographic distance between populations. To determine if the relationship between genetic distance and geographic distance was significantly different from random, measures of geographic distance were resampled 10,000x and tested against pairwise genetic distances with Spearman rank correlations. True 
  <span class="italic">rho</span> values determined for genetic distance vs. geographic distance were then compared to confidence intervals constructed from random distributions to determine significance of true values. Statistical analyses were conducted with R statistical computing environment [
  <a rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51">51</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Genetic structure was further investigated from genotype data using a MCMC model-based clustering method implemented with STRUCTURE software v2.3.4 [
  <a rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52">52</a>]. The most likely number of genetic clusters (
  <span class="italic">K</span>) was assessed assuming admixture and locprior of the individual populations and five iterations were run per 
  <span class="italic">K</span> (Burn-in: 100,000; Repetitions: 500,000).
