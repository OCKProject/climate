  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">35</a>]). We investigated the effect of hierarchical structuring on the partitioning of genetic differentiation by categorizing individuals by migratory orientation, migratory distance, and the population level (in decreasing hierarchical order) using the R package “HierFstat” [
  <a rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53">53</a>]. Here, the population level was nested within the level of migratory distance, and migratory distance was nested within the migratory direction level (population/distance/direction); the effect of each level was tested with 10,000 permutations to determine the level of significance of this structuring. Hierarchy A categorizes the Norwegian population (Os) with a SW migratory direction, while Hierarchy B categorizes the same population with a SE migratory direction. The Uebersyren NW migrant identified via claw
