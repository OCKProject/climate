These results indicate the underlying genetic structure among populations is more complex than simply classifying populations into three migratory orientations and three migratory distances. HierFstat analysis was additionally repeated by categorizing the Norwegian population (Os) as SE migrants (as opposed to SW migrants), but similarly resulted in weak genetic structure; marginally better support for underlying genetic structure was found by categorizing this population as SW migrants (i.e. slightly higher
