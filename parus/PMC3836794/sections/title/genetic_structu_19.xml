 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, genetic differentiation across all the sampled populations was low and Bayesian clustering, pairwise comparisons and hierarchical analyses all failed to show consistent, significant genetic structure among populations corresponding to different migratory behaviors. A positive relationship was found between genetic distance and (longitudinal) geographic distance of population pairs of Blackcaps located on opposing sides of the SW/SE migratory divide. This result is consistent with the historical isolation of western and eastern breeding populations in Europe previously restricted to potential glacial refugia on the Iberian and Balkan peninsulas, respectively [

  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">7</a>,
  <a rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54">54</a>]. Despite this observed relationship between genetic and geographic distance, the only SW/SE pairwise 
  <span class="italic">D</span>
  <sub>est</sub> comparison found to be significantly differentiated was between Ub and Km (over 2000km apart). Such results indicate a lack of neutral genetic divergence between populations of SW and SE migrants and, in fact, many populations within/near the approximated SW/SE contact zone cannot be differentiated with our marker set. We suggest therefore that the SW/SE migratory divide is an ineffective barrier to neutral gene flow across this zone of contact. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although isolation-by-distance appears to be maintained among eastern populations, this pattern is not found among western populations and is potentially confounded by the occurrence of sympatrically-breeding populations of NW and SW migrants (as observed in Freiburg, DE). Indeed, NW vs. SW 
  <span class="italic">D</span>
  <sub>est</sub> comparisons were found to significantly differ from SW vs. SE comparisons, confirming beliefs that different dynamics of genetic divergence occur with the NW/SW migratory polymorphism and across the SW/SE migratory divide. In southern Germany (i.e. Freiburg), weak, albeit significant, genetic differentiation was found between NW and SW migrants breeding sympatrically, corroborating results of a previous study by Rolshausen et al. [
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>], who suggest that only low levels of genetic divergence may be needed to maintain differences in migratory behavior. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The low nuclear genetic differentiation found across the SW/SE migratory divide in the Blackcap is consistent with similar patterns found across migratory divides in Eurasian Reed Warblers (
  <span class="italic">Acrocephalus scirpaceus</span>) in central Europe [
  <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">31</a>] and Willow Warblers (
  <span class="italic">Phylloscopus trochilus</span>) in Scandinavia [
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>]. A lack of neutral genetic differentiation was similarly found across the Red-billed Quelea (
  <span class="italic">Quelea quelea</span>) migratory divide in Africa [
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>] and between populations of Black-throated Blue Warblers (
  <span class="italic">Setophaga caerulescens</span>) with different migratory routes in North America [
  <a rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55">55</a>]. In addition, complete introgression has recently occurred between populations of Savi’s Warblers (
  <span class="italic">Locustella luscinioides</span>) in Iberia despite Pleistocene divergence and long periods of geographic isolation between populations [
  <a rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56">56</a>]. Without sufficient contemporary reproductive barriers it thus seems that interbreeding often occurs across migratory divides, regardless of historical geographic divergence between populations. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Potentially, NW migrant Blackcaps may also contribute to breeding populations in other areas in central Europe (e.g. in upper Austria, see 
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">27</a>,
  <a rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57">57</a> and Czech/Slovak Republics, see 
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">35</a>). Our pairwise 
  <span class="italic">D</span>
  <sub>est</sub> comparisons suggest the Fr
  <sub>NW</sub> population is most genetically similar to the Kf population (i.e. the least genetic distance was found among Fr
  <sub>NW</sub> comparisons). This would support the hypothesized origination of NW migrants from within the SW/SE contact zone, first proposed by Helbig [
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">27</a>] from observations of hand-raised Blackcaps from Linz, AU (~25km SW of Kefermarkt) orienting SW-NW directions (mean 268°) during the autumn migratory period. Alternatively, since our 
  <span class="italic">δ</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span>H assignment method did not indicate a presence of NW migrants in the Kefermarkt population, this result may indicate that the location of the Blackcap migratory divide has shifted eastward; the low genetic divergence found between Fr
  <sub>NW</sub> vs. Vn supports this hypothesis, potentially being driven by the expansion of SW migrants into eastern European populations, as proposed previously by Wesołowski [
  <a rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58">58</a>]. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Isolation-by-distance (IBD) was found to be non-significant among the 11 breeding populations (after excluding Sevilla). However, patterns of IBD differed on either side of the SW/SE migratory divide: significant IBD was evident among eastern populations (with greater levels pairwise genetic divergence), but not among western populations (with lower levels of pairwise genetic divergence); this result is consistent with the genetic structure of Blackcap mtDNA by Pérez-Tris et al. [
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">28</a>], who found no relationship between genetic and geographic distance among western continental populations (although results may be influenced by the different sets of populations sampled in each study). The relationships between geographic and genetic distance were similarly found to contrast among populations of Eurasian Reed Warblers (
  <span class="italic">Acrocephalus scirpaceus</span>) located on opposing sides of their migratory divide in central Europe [
  <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">31</a>]. Such contradictory patterns geographically spanning migratory divides may be indicative of different ecological and/or evolutionary dynamics acting on opposing sides of migratory divides in central Europe. Unlike that found for eastern Blackcap populations, the lack of IBD demonstrated among western Blackcap populations (i.e. both SW and NW migrants) suggests a mechanism other than geographic isolation may be promoting genetic divergence among western Blackcap populations in the face of gene flow.
