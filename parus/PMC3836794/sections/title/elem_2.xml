  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Samples from the Schwäbische Alb (Münsingen) and Freiburg have been collected under field work and animal experiment permits granted by the responsible state environmental offices of Baden-Württemberg (RPT Tierversuch-Nr. 1056 and 55-8853.17/0, respectively). Samples collected in Kefermarkt, Austria were approved from the district Freistadt permit Nr. N10-75-2010. Sampling in Rybachy (Russia) was performed under the license from Kaliningrad Regional Agency for Protection, Reproduction and Use of Animal World and Forests. Trapping and sampling permits in Spain were granted by the Consejería de Medio Ambiente of the government of Andalucía and in Bulgaria under permit N243/1.03.2010 from Bulgarian Ministry of Environment and Waters. </p>

Individuals captured in Sevilla, Spain (Sv) during the non-breeding season (January) were determined to be overwintering, short-distance migrants based on two lines of evidence: 1) Sevilla birds had relatively short wings compared to other breeding populations in central Europe, thus travelled a shorter distance during migration, and 2) they were found to be genetically differentiated (at microsatellite loci) from resident Spanish Blackcaps identified in a previous study [
   <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>]. The remaining 11 sites were sampled during the breeding season (
   <a rid="pone-0081365-t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone-0081365-t001">Table 1</a>). While we assume most to be breeding individuals (supported by our ringing data (data not shown)), we cannot rule out that some spring migrants may have been caught as well. All birds captured at a single sampling site were considered as populations in the following analyses.

Mastercycler Gradient Thermocyclers (Eppendorf GmbH, Hamburg Germany) were used to run PCR under the following conditions: initial denaturing at 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 20 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s (decreased by 0.5°C per cycle), and 72°C for 45 s, followed by 15 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 50°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 45 s with a final extension of 72°C for 3 min. Forward primers were labeled with FAM or HEX florescent dyes (Applied Biosystems), PCR products were genotyped on an ABI3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems), and genotypes were analyzed with PeakScanner v1.0 software (Applied Biosystems).

Spearman-Rank correlations were used to explore the relationship between genetic distance and longitudinal geographic distance between populations.
