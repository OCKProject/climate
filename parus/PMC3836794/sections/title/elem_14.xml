 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By exploring the relationship between genetic distance and the longitudinal geographic distance of population pairs located on opposing sides of the SW/SE divide, a strong, positive correlation was evident (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081365-g004" href="#pone-0081365-g004">Figure 4</a>, rho = 0.467 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.005). The least genetic distance was found between populations near the center of the SW/SE divide (approximated at 13°E) and genetic distance increased significantly with increased geographic distance between populations. For example, all pairwise 
  <span class="italic">D</span>
  <sub>est</sub> comparisons between Münsingen (Mn), Kefermarkt (Kf), and Vienna (Vn) were found to be non-significant and for the majority of these estimates (5/6 comparisons) 
  <span class="italic">D</span>
  <sub>est</sub> = 0, indicating a lack of genetic differentiation between these populations near the center of the zone (
  <a rid="pone-0081365-t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone-0081365-t002">Table 2</a>). Permuting the geographic distances between populations determined that the true 
  <span class="italic">rho</span> values for genetic distance vs. geographic distance lie outside the confidence interval generated from randomly-sampled 
  <span class="italic">rho</span> values (95% CI: -0.337 - 0.333), affirming the observed relationship between genetic and geographic distance is not a random effect. A positive relationship between pairwise genetic distance vs. geographic distance was also apparent after excluding the non-breeding Sevilla population (rho = 0.377, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.040).
