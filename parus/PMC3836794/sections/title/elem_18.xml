  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Genetic structure among Blackcap populations</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, genetic differentiation across all the sampled populations was low and Bayesian clustering, pairwise comparisons and hierarchical analyses all failed to show consistent, significant genetic structure among populations corresponding to different migratory behaviors. A positive relationship was found between genetic distance and (longitudinal) geographic distance of population pairs of Blackcaps located on opposing sides of the SW/SE migratory divide. This result is consistent with the historical isolation of western and eastern breeding populations in Europe previously restricted to potential glacial refugia on the Iberian and Balkan peninsulas, respectively [
   <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>,
   <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">7</a>,
   <a rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54">54</a>]. Despite this observed relationship between genetic and geographic distance, the only SW/SE pairwise 
   <span class="italic">D</span>
   <sub>est</sub> comparison found to be significantly differentiated was between Ub and Km (over 2000km apart). Such results indicate a lack of neutral genetic divergence between populations of SW and SE migrants and, in fact, many populations within/near the approximated SW/SE contact zone cannot be differentiated with our marker set. We suggest therefore that the SW/SE migratory divide is an ineffective barrier to neutral gene flow across this zone of contact. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although isolation-by-distance appears to be maintained among eastern populations, this pattern is not found among western populations and is potentially confounded by the occurrence of sympatrically-breeding populations of NW and SW migrants (as observed in Freiburg, DE). Indeed, NW vs. SW 
   <span class="italic">D</span>
   <sub>est</sub> comparisons were found to significantly differ from SW vs. SE comparisons, confirming beliefs that different dynamics of genetic divergence occur with the NW/SW migratory polymorphism and across the SW/SE migratory divide. In southern Germany (i.e. Freiburg), weak, albeit significant, genetic differentiation was found between NW and SW migrants breeding sympatrically, corroborating results of a previous study by Rolshausen et al. [
   <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>], who suggest that only low levels of genetic divergence may be needed to maintain differences in migratory behavior. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The low nuclear genetic differentiation found across the SW/SE migratory divide in the Blackcap is consistent with similar patterns found across migratory divides in Eurasian Reed Warblers (
   <span class="italic">Acrocephalus scirpaceus</span>) in central Europe [
   <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">31</a>] and Willow Warblers (
   <span class="italic">Phylloscopus trochilus</span>) in Scandinavia [
   <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>]. A lack of neutral genetic differentiation was similarly found across the Red-billed Quelea (
   <span class="italic">Quelea quelea</span>) migratory divide in Africa [
   <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>] and between populations of Black-throated Blue Warblers (
   <span class="italic">Setophaga caerulescens</span>) with different migratory routes in North America [
   <a rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55">55</a>]. In addition, complete introgression has recently occurred between populations of Savi’s Warblers (
   <span class="italic">Locustella luscinioides</span>) in Iberia despite Pleistocene divergence and long periods of geographic isolation between populations [
   <a rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56">56</a>]. Without sufficient contemporary reproductive barriers it thus seems that interbreeding often occurs across migratory divides, regardless of historical geographic divergence between populations. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Potentially, NW migrant Blackcaps may also contribute to breeding populations in other areas in central Europe (e.g. in upper Austria, see 
   <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">27</a>,
   <a rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57">57</a> and Czech/Slovak Republics, see 
   <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">35</a>). Our pairwise 
   <span class="italic">D</span>
   <sub>est</sub> comparisons suggest the Fr
   <sub>NW</sub> population is most genetically similar to the Kf population (i.e. the least genetic distance was found among Fr
   <sub>NW</sub> comparisons). This would support the hypothesized origination of NW migrants from within the SW/SE contact zone, first proposed by Helbig [
   <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">27</a>] from observations of hand-raised Blackcaps from Linz, AU (~25km SW of Kefermarkt) orienting SW-NW directions (mean 268°) during the autumn migratory period. Alternatively, since our 
   <span class="italic">δ</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span>H assignment method did not indicate a presence of NW migrants in the Kefermarkt population, this result may indicate that the location of the Blackcap migratory divide has shifted eastward; the low genetic divergence found between Fr
   <sub>NW</sub> vs. Vn supports this hypothesis, potentially being driven by the expansion of SW migrants into eastern European populations, as proposed previously by Wesołowski [
   <a rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58">58</a>]. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Isolation-by-distance (IBD) was found to be non-significant among the 11 breeding populations (after excluding Sevilla). However, patterns of IBD differed on either side of the SW/SE migratory divide: significant IBD was evident among eastern populations (with greater levels pairwise genetic divergence), but not among western populations (with lower levels of pairwise genetic divergence); this result is consistent with the genetic structure of Blackcap mtDNA by Pérez-Tris et al. [
   <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">28</a>], who found no relationship between genetic and geographic distance among western continental populations (although results may be influenced by the different sets of populations sampled in each study). The relationships between geographic and genetic distance were similarly found to contrast among populations of Eurasian Reed Warblers (
   <span class="italic">Acrocephalus scirpaceus</span>) located on opposing sides of their migratory divide in central Europe [
   <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">31</a>]. Such contradictory patterns geographically spanning migratory divides may be indicative of different ecological and/or evolutionary dynamics acting on opposing sides of migratory divides in central Europe. Unlike that found for eastern Blackcap populations, the lack of IBD demonstrated among western Blackcap populations (i.e. both SW and NW migrants) suggests a mechanism other than geographic isolation may be promoting genetic divergence among western Blackcap populations in the face of gene flow.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mechanisms promoting / preventing genetic divergence</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results provide little evidence that the historical migratory divide in central Europe provides sufficient reproductive isolation to influence mating preferences based on migratory orientation in the Blackcap. Rather, it appears that interbreeding between SW and SE migrants (and potentially also NW migrants) results in high levels of gene flow across the migratory divide where populations come into contact. Asymmetrical gene flow across the SW/SE migratory divide (i.e. SW migrant Blackcaps outcompeting SE migrants) has been argued to be responsible for recent demographic changes at Polish breeding grounds (e.g. advanced arrival time and increased population size)[
   <a rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58">58</a>]; interbreeding between Blackcaps with different migratory strategies could therefore potentially occur across an even larger area, resulting not in a divide 
   <span class="italic">per se</span>, but a gradual transition between migratory orientations across central Europe. Our results indicate an absence of NW migrants in the Białowieża population (from isotope analysis), but cannot exclude the occurrence of SW migrants occurring at this location. In fact, low levels of genetic divergence are found between Białowieża Blackcaps and several SW migrant populations (Ub, Fr
   <sub>SW</sub>, Mn) as well as SE migrant populations (Kf, Vn, Ry), suggesting Białowieża birds are genetically similar to many other European population due to introgression. Additionally, the distribution of claw 
   <span class="italic">δ</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span>H from Białowieża birds is roughly consistent with the 
   <span class="italic">δ</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span>H distribution of Freiburg SW migrants (although we are unable to distinguish SW from SE migrants based solely on claw 
   <span class="italic">δ</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span>H). Our results, together with those of Wesołowski [
   <a rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58">58</a>], may provide evidence for either an eastward shift in the geographic position of the divide/contact zone (i.e. asymmetrical hybridization) or a widening of the zone in both east and west directions (i.e. symmetrical hybridization) [
   <a rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" href="#B59">59</a>,
   <a rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" href="#B60">60</a>]. While further studies are needed to better characterize the dynamics of this zone, movement of the SW/SE contact zone remains plausible for Blackcaps.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recent studies are now utilizing geolocators to record the annual cycle of long-distance passerine migrants, including migratory routes, durations, and strategies [
   <a rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" href="#B61">61</a>,
   <a rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62">62</a>], as for example in the Swainson’s Thrush (
   <span class="italic">Catharus ustulatus</span>) where the existence of a migratory divide in North America has been found [
   <a rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63">63</a>]. At this narrow migratory divide, low frequencies of Swainson’s Thrush hybrids may be suggestive of post-mating isolation, while evidence for pre-mating isolation (e.g. ecological selection and difference in arrival time) indicates an important role for reinforcement in the maintenance of this hybrid zone which spans a migratory divide [
   <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">14</a>,
   <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">19</a>]. Similarly, in Blackcaps both pre- and post-mating isolating mechanisms may likely influence genetic divergence among populations. Crosses between SW and SE migrant Blackcaps produced viable F1 hybrids with intermediate (southerly) orientations [
   <a rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" href="#B64">64</a>], but wild-caught Blackcaps from the center of the contact zone (Linz, AT) were found to orient SW-NW (mean 268°) suggesting selection against S-SE orientations (and thus selection against hybrid or SE x SE pairings) at this location [
   <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">27</a>]. Still, 58% of Blackcaps ringed in the Czech Republic and Slovakia were recovered at SE locations during the non-breeding period [
   <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">35</a>]. Nevertheless, within the SW/SE contact zone, female preference for males with SE orientations could be responsible for eastward introgression of SW migrant Blackcaps into eastern breeding populations (e.g. Poland) [
   <a rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58">58</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rapid genetic divergence between sympatric NW and SW migrant Blackcaps may be promoted by pre-mating isolation. Temporal isolation in spring arrival to breeding grounds in southern Germany has been documented between NW and SW migrants [
   <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>,
   <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>,
   <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">30</a>] and presents also an effective isolating mechanism among Swainson’s Thrushes breeding in North America [
   <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">19</a>]. Such phenological changes can be further affected by global climate change which is impacting the phenology of migratory birds and influencing the advancement of spring migration and arrival to the breeding grounds [
   <a rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58">58</a>,
   <a rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" href="#B65">65</a>,
   <a rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" href="#B66">66</a>]. It remains unclear however, if such temporal divergence is locally adaptive in sympatry only, or if NW and SW migrants reflect significant divergence also in allopatry.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We not only find evidence of significant genetic differentiation between NW and SW migrant Blackcaps in sympatry, but NW migrants were significantly differentiated from other populations of SW migrants in western Europe. The observed divergence between NW and SW migrants may be the consequence of a founder effect resulting from a small number of genetically distinct individuals initially establishing the NW migratory route. Allopatric genetic differentiation demonstrated between Fr
   <sub>NW</sub> and SW migrants (i.e. Sv and Ub) may indicate that such divergence is not locally adaptive, but that this polymorphism has evolved repeatedly, independent of adaptive pressures on the breeding ground. The behavioral, morphological, and genetic traits observed to be diverging in the Blackcap may be part of a ‘migratory syndrome’ or ‘migratory gene package’ in this species whereby a suite of correlated traits that evolve together are targeted by correlational selection [
   <a rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67">67</a>–
   <a rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" href="#B69">69</a>]. Whether such syndromes are common and generalized among migratory birds may be debatable [
   <a rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" href="#B70">70</a>], but provide an exciting frontier to explore. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although our Bayesian clustering and hierarchical analyses failed to find significant genetic structure among populations corresponding to the different migratory behaviors investigated, significant (but weak) genetic structure in mtDNA was found among eastern (including SE migrants) and western Blackcap populations (including SW and NW migrants) in a previous study (although only two eastern populations were considered)[
   <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">28</a>]. Maternally-inherited mtDNA is less likely to introgress across a contact zone than autosomal DNA [
   <a rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" href="#B71">71</a>], and reflects only uni-parental gene flow which limits interpretation among populations with highly dynamic migratory behaviors. Migratory orientation may instead be controlled by very few genes [
   <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>,
   <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">24</a>], and the possibility that one or few of microsatellite loci used in our study are linked to functional loci cannot be ruled out, though we did not find any evidence using outlier detection methods (data not shown). Although microsatellites were found to be undifferentiated across the Willow Warbler migratory divide, two AFLPs were shown to exhibit clinal variation corresponding to phenotypic differences [
   <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>]. Developing large sets of genetic markers spanning the entire genome and searching for informative markers associated with migratory behavior will provide better resolution in the genetic variation and structure of recently divergent populations, such as the Blackcap [
   <a rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" href="#B69">69</a>]. Furthermore, combining molecular and stable isotope markers (e.g. see 
   <a rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" href="#B72">72</a>) with data obtained from ring recoveries and geolocators may greatly improve the spatial resolution of species’ movements and thus provide a better understanding of the ecology and evolution of migratory divides.
