  <p>Comparisons within NW, SW, SE migratory orientations are shown as open bars and comparisons among NW, SW, SE migratory orientations are shown as shaded bars. Within SW orientations, 
   <span class="italic">D
    <sub>est</sub>
   </span> comparisons did not differ from comparisons within SE orientations (Wilcoxon test 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &gt; 0.05). NW vs. SW comparisons were found to have significantly higher 
   <span class="italic">D</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">est</span>
   </sub> values than SW vs. SE comparisons (Wilcoxon test 
   <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.013). Remaining comparisons among groups were non-significant (
   <span class="italic">P</span> &gt; 0.05). Width of bar is proportional to sample size.
