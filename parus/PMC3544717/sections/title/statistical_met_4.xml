 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We tested for spatial density dependence using generalised linear model (GLM) analysis of the proportion of predated galls as a function of gall densities per shoot (log(x+1) transformed) using R 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-R1">[35]</a> with quasibinomial errors to correct for under-dispersion and a logit link function

  <a rid="pone.0053959-Logan1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Logan1">[37]</a>. Separate analyses were carried out at each of three spatial levels, and for each site. First, we examined patterns across shoots (nested within branches within trees). Second, we examined patterns across branches (nested within trees), using mean gall densities and predation rates across shoots within branches to avoid pseudoreplication. Third, we examined patterns across trees, using mean gall densities and predation rates across branches to avoid pseudoreplication. Dunrobin, site 8, was excluded from further statistical analyses because predation of galls was only detected on one shoot. Model terms were tested for significance on deletion and all models were inspected for heteroscedasticity and normality of errors

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Use of separate GLM models for each level in a spatial hierarchy in this way allows us to estimate slopes across sampled units at each level. However, averaging to control for pseudo-replication is sometimes seen as too conservative and the use of mixed models that only estimate variances for the structural factors have become common. We therefore also analysed our data using mixed models to assure ourselves that our results are not unduly influenced by using either method. Mixed effect model analyses were carried out using the R package glmer, library lme4, using the structural variables tree and branch as nested random effects and shoot gall densities as the fixed effect. As the results of the two approaches were very similar, we present the results of the GLMs with quasibinomial errors as the more conservative approach, and highlight the different mixed effect model results as necessary.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analysis of gall predation rates over five weeks at Puttenham Common used the same twin approach of GLM’s and mixed effect modelling. Each approach was applied separately to the data for each of the five sampling events, with GLM’s fitted separately to each level in the spatial hierarchy of shoots within branches, branches within trees, and trees within a sampling event.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because our GLM analyses address patterns at three different spatial scales in the data from each sampling site, the issue of significance threshold adjustment for multiple tests needs to be considered. Though threshold significance (alpha) values are routinely adjusted under such circumstances, the application of such procedures remains an area of active debate 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Nakagawa1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Nakagawa1">[38]</a>. Commonly applied corrections (such as Bonferroni) can be overly conservative and increase the risk of making a type II error. We therefore present the results of our analyses both with unadjusted threshold significance levels (i.e. p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.01) and indicate those that remain significant after the Dunn-Šidák adjustment for three tests 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Quinn1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Quinn1">[39]</a> of the p&lt;0.05 threshold to p&lt;0.017. We used the Dunn-Šidák rather than the Bonferroni correction as this approach slightly improves the power for each comparison
