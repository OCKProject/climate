  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We collected data in 1995 from eight UK locations (see

   <a rid="pone.0053959-Schnrogge5" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Schnrogge5">[34]</a> whose tree stands and cynipid communities are detailed by Schönrogge

   <a rid="pone.0053959-Schnrogge3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Schnrogge3">[16]</a>. All sites were visited with landowner permission, and no permits for sampling were required. Samples were collected in mid-late April, at an appropriate time to capture all developing galls prior to the ejection of emerged galls by developing buds. At each site we selected 12 
   <span class="italic">Q. cerris</span> trees at random or, if fewer than 12 were present, sampled all available trees. We pruned 15 branches (defined as 4 years’ growth following Schönrogge 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="pone.0053959-Schnrogge3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Schnrogge3">[16]</a>) from each tree, collected haphazardly from all aspects and heights up to 8.0 m. From each branch, we randomly selected six shoots (defined as one year’s growth, identified by ring scars on the bark, following Schönrogge 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>
   <a rid="pone.0053959-Schnrogge3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Schnrogge3">[16]</a>). The sexual generation bud galls of all three 
   <span class="italic">Andricus</span> species are conical and small enough that only the tip of a mature gall is visible above the bud scales of the closed buds on 
   <span class="italic">Q. cerris</span>. To reveal gall density and fate we dissected 
   <span class="underline">all</span> buds on each sampled shoot in the lab under a dissecting microscope (a total of 11,100 shoots, 33,440 buds and 3,474 galls). Since young galls of the three study species are available simultaneously, contain very similarly-sized larvae and are morphologically indistinguishable, we treated all three species as a single resource. On the basis of adults dissected from galls, we know that in all surveys &gt;50% of the galls were

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Galls attacked by birds show ragged removal of the gall apex, rather than the smooth apertures made by emerging insects. Though we could easily identify galls attacked by birds, we do not attempt to distinguish between galls opened by different bird species.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In spring 2006, we collected additional data at one location (Puttenham Common; 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053959-g001" href="#pone-0053959-g001">Fig. 1</a>) to allow analysis of temporal patterns of bird predation within a single season. We sampled as above the same twelve 
   <span class="italic">Q. cerris</span> trees each week for five weeks from March 25, over which period the galls matured and the adults emerged. To identify probable bird species attacking alien galls at this site in this season, we observed six Turkey oaks for one hour in each of weeks 2–5. We observed 72 gall predation incidents by a total of seven bird species. Seventy-five percent involved tits, predominantly blue tits (
   <span class="italic">Parus caeruleus</span>, 55%) and great tits (
   <span class="italic">Parus major</span>, 18%). Other birds observed were Long-tailed tits (
   <span class="italic">Aegithalos caudatus</span> (L.), 1.4%), robins (
   <span class="italic">Erithacus rubecula</span> (L.), 11.1%), song thrushes (
   <span class="italic">Turdus philomelos</span> Brehm, 5.5%), blackbirds (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistical Methods</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We tested for spatial density dependence using generalised linear model (GLM) analysis of the proportion of predated galls as a function of gall densities per shoot (log(x+1) transformed) using R 
   <a rid="pone.0053959-R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-R1">[35]</a> with quasibinomial errors to correct for under-dispersion and a logit link function 
   <a rid="pone.0053959-Crawley1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Crawley1">[36]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0053959-Logan1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Logan1">[37]</a>. Separate analyses were carried out at each of three spatial levels, and for each site. First, we examined patterns across shoots (nested within branches within trees). Second, we examined patterns across branches (nested within trees), using mean gall densities and predation rates across shoots within branches to avoid pseudoreplication. Third, we examined patterns across trees, using mean gall densities and predation rates across branches to avoid pseudoreplication. Dunrobin, site 8, was excluded from further statistical analyses because predation of galls was only detected on one shoot. Model terms were tested for significance on deletion and all models were inspected for heteroscedasticity and normality of errors 
   <a rid="pone.0053959-Crawley1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Crawley1">[36]</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Use of separate GLM models for each level in a spatial hierarchy in this way allows us to estimate slopes across sampled units at each level. However, averaging to control for pseudo-replication is sometimes seen as too conservative and the use of mixed models that only estimate variances for the structural factors have become common. We therefore also analysed our data using mixed models to assure ourselves that our results are not unduly influenced by using either method. Mixed effect model analyses were carried out using the R package glmer, library lme4, using the structural variables tree and branch as nested random effects and shoot gall densities as the fixed effect. As the results of the two approaches were very similar, we present the results of the GLMs with quasibinomial errors as the more conservative approach, and highlight the different mixed effect model results as necessary.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analysis of gall predation rates over five weeks at Puttenham Common used the same twin approach of GLM’s and mixed effect modelling. Each approach was applied separately to the data for each of the five sampling events, with GLM’s fitted separately to each level in the spatial hierarchy of shoots within branches, branches within trees, and trees within a sampling event.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because our GLM analyses address patterns at three different spatial scales in the data from each sampling site, the issue of significance threshold adjustment for multiple tests needs to be considered. Though threshold significance (alpha) values are routinely adjusted under such circumstances, the application of such procedures remains an area of active debate 
   <a rid="pone.0053959-Nakagawa1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Nakagawa1">[38]</a>. Commonly applied corrections (such as Bonferroni) can be overly conservative and increase the risk of making a type II error. We therefore present the results of our analyses both with unadjusted threshold significance levels (i.e. p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.01) and indicate those that remain significant after the Dunn-Šidák adjustment for three tests 
   <a rid="pone.0053959-Quinn1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Quinn1">[39]</a> of the p&lt;0.05 threshold to p&lt;0.017. We used the Dunn-Šidák rather than the Bonferroni correction as this approach slightly improves the power for each comparison 
   <a rid="pone.0053959-Quinn1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Quinn1">[39]</a>. Means are given ± standard error.
