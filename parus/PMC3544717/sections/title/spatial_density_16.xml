 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results show that at the scale of trees within sites, two of seven study sites showing bird predation of alien 
  <span class="italic">Andricus</span> galls also show significant positive spatial density dependence. This parallels previous studies of birds foraging on native prey that show birds to recruit to rewarding patches at this spatial scale

  <a rid="pone.0053959-NaefDaenzer3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-NaefDaenzer3">[42]</a>. This sensitivity to prey density shows that even though we do not know the caloric contribution of gallwasps to bird diets, galls are important enough to influence bird foraging behaviour in the early spring. Few alternative protein-rich foods are available at this time

  <a rid="pone.0053959-Suhonen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Suhonen1">[24]</a> and because both adult survival 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Jansson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Jansson1">[17]</a> and breeding success 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Lambrechts1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Lambrechts1">[26]</a> correlate with pre-breeding adult condition, exploitation of any additional accessible resource is to be expected. Importance of alien gallwasps as a food source is underlined by continuing signatures of positive density dependence across the first three weeks and the fifth week of our five-week sampling period in 2006. We suggest that the observed decline in gall predation rates over the 5 week period may indicate declining dependence on (and hence sensitivity to) this resource as it becomes less abundant 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-NaefDaenzer1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-NaefDaenzer1">[23]</a>. Alternative foods that become increasingly available through May include the Turkey oak catkin galls of two other invaders, 
  <span class="italic">Andricus quercuscalicis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">A. grossulariae</span>, which can reach densities of a million galls/tree

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Variation in prey density among trees – and hence spatial patterns in bird foraging -may be driven by bottom-up influences of host oaks on gall densities. Previous work has shown that some trees support consistently higher densities of a given cynipid gall than others 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Hails1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Hails1">[4]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Askew1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Askew1">[43]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Egan1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Egan1">[45]</a>, and evidence is growing that such variation is associated with oak genotype 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Eliason1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Eliason1">[46]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Ito1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Ito1">[47]</a>. Successful gall induction requires oviposition into host plant tissues at appropriate levels of development, and at least some between-tree variation in gall densities is due to between-tree variation in phenology 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Askew1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Askew1">[43]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Crawley2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Crawley2">[44]</a>. It is thus possible that once local bird populations have discovered how to exploit alien galls on Turkey oak, they may also learn which trees are consistently more rewarding than others. Bottom-up impacts of host tree genotype on trophic interactions between birds and their insect prey have been demonstrated in other systems 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Smith1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Smith1">[48]</a>.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found no consistent evidence of density dependence at spatial scales within trees. Hails and Crawley 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Hails1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Hails1">[4]</a> studied predation rates on the catkin galls of another invading oak gallwasp, 
  <span class="italic">Andricus quercuscalicis,</span> on Turkey oak in Britain. In experimental treatments involving enhanced gall densities they detected consistently positive spatial density dependence of bird predation at four spatial scales within trees, from within individual catkins to within twigs representing two years of growth. However, at field densities the signs of density dependence at such spatial scales varied within individual trees 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Hails1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Hails1">[4]</a>, paralleling the lack of consistency at similar spatial scales in our data and in other studies on bird predation of concealed insect prey 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Heads1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Heads1">[27]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Connor1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Connor1">[28]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Connor2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Connor2">[32]</a>. The lack of negative density dependence within branches suggests that at this spatial scale birds have no difficulty in exploiting the highest gall densities they encountered.
