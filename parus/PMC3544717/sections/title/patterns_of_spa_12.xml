 <div class="title">Patterns of spatial density dependence through time.</div>
 <p>The figure shows patterns in density dependence among trees over five weeks starting with the last week of March 2006 at Puttenham Common (site 2, Fig. 1). Significance levels are indicated by superscripts as follows: ns non significant; * p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01, *** p&lt;0.001. p = 0.05 is equivalent to p = 0.017 after Dunn-Šidàk adjustment (
