 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Understanding the interactions between alien species and native communities is central to understanding the ecological consequences of species range expansions. Biological invasions often disrupt existing networks of biotic interaction among species, with impacts on native species ranging from negative (reduced population densities, extinction) to positive (e.g. through provision of novel food sources

  <a rid="pone.0053959-Skorka1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Skorka1">[3]</a>. Many aspects of this process have been investigated using natural systems comprising invading herbivorous insects and their parasitoid natural enemies 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Hails1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Hails1">[4]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Schnrogge2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Schnrogge2">[10]</a>. In general, however, far less is known about the impact of invading insects on native vertebrate predators, in part because this is often much harder to quantify.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here we examine predation by native U.K. insectivorous birds on a group of invading insect herbivores associated with an introduced oak – the Turkey oak, 
  <span class="italic">Quercus cerris</span>. The invaders are 
  <span class="italic">Andricus</span> wasps (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae) whose lifecycle involves alternation between a sexual generation that galls Turkey oak and an asexual generation that galls native oaks (
  <span class="italic">Q. petraea</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Q. robur</span>). These gallwasps have invaded the UK and northwestern Europe from southern central Europe and the Levant following human dispersal of Turkey oak from Italy and the Balkans 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Schnrogge2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Schnrogge2">[10]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Stone2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Stone2">[12]</a>. While recruitment of parasitoid natural enemies to these invaders has been studied in considerable detail 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Schnrogge1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Schnrogge1">[9]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Schnrogge2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Schnrogge2">[10]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Hails2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Hails2">[13]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Hayward1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Hayward1">[14]</a>, much less is known of the development of trophic links with native birds. Native gallwasps are known to be important components in the diets of insectivorous birds in Britain 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Betts1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Betts1">[15]</a>, particularly blue tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus caeruleus</span> L.) and great tits (
  <span class="italic">P. major</span> L.). and the sexual generation galls of another invader (
  <span class="italic">Andricus quercuscalicis</span>) are known to have been systematically exploited by native birds in one UK location 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Hails1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Hails1">[4]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here we examine bird predation of three further invading 
  <span class="italic">Andricus</span> gallwasps (
  <span class="italic">Andricus kollari</span> (Hartig, 1843), 
  <span class="italic">A. lignicolus</span> (Hartig, 1843) and 
  <span class="italic">A. corruptrix</span> (Schlechtendal, 1870)). The sexual generation galls of all three species are small (2–3 mm long) and thin-walled, and develop over the winter and early spring concealed within Turkey oak buds. The galls expand to emerge through the bud scales in late March, appearing before any other galls are available on this oak 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Schnrogge3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Schnrogge3">[16]</a>. Though the galls are cryptic, individual oaks may bear hundreds of thousands of them (this study). They represent a novel potential food for resident insectivorous birds prior to their breeding season at a time when other early spring foods can be scarce 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Jansson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Jansson1">[17]</a>. Small insectivorous birds, particularly blue and great tits, have been observed to open the galls to reach the larvae within 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Schnrogge4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Schnrogge4">[18]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assessed native bird responses to these alien gallwasps by analysing spatial patterns in their exploitation across eight sites comprising a north-south transect across the U.K. All of the invading gallwasps first became established in southern England, spreading into Scotland over a period of 40–50 years. 
  <span class="italic">Andricus kollari</span> was introduced to Devon in the 1830s–40′s 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Schnrogge2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Schnrogge2">[10]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Stone2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Stone2">[12]</a>. 
  <span class="italic">Andricus lignicolus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">A. corruptrix</span> were first recorded in Britain in the 1970’s, and their expansion through Scotland is ongoing 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Schnrogge2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Schnrogge2">[10]</a>. Though we do not know the arrival dates of each species at each of our sampling locations, the north-south transect represents a gradient of increasing time of exposure of native birds to invading gallwasps.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Individual populations of insectivorous birds (including blue tits and great tits) are known to be sensitive to between-tree variation in the density of familiar prey, and forage preferentially in highly rewarding trees, i.e. they show positive spatial density dependence 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Betts1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Betts1">[15]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Gibb1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Gibb1">[19]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Tscharntke1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Tscharntke1">[25]</a>. Pre-breeding condition has a significant impact on breeding success in insectivorous birds 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Lambrechts1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Lambrechts1">[26]</a>. We hypothesise that if alien galls are an important resource for native birds prior to the breeding season, they will also recruit to trees with high gall density, and so show positive spatial density dependence at the scale of trees within sites.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Detection of spatial density dependence requires a match between the spatial scale of sampling and that at which birds make foraging decisions 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Hails1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Hails1">[4]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-NaefDaenzer1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-NaefDaenzer1">[23]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Heads1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Heads1">[27]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Veldtman1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Veldtman1">[31]</a>. In addition to responding to variation in prey density between trees, birds may also respond to variation in prey density at smaller spatial scales, such as branches within trees, or shoots within branches 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Heads1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Heads1">[27]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Connor1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Connor1">[28]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Connor2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Connor2">[32]</a>. However, such local variation in density is difficult or impossible to estimate for mobile prey. Most studies on tit foraging have used rates of caterpillar frass fall as a surrogate for caterpillar density, but this measure is impossible to estimate for specific branches within the same tree. A major advantage of working with sessile prey (including galling insects) is that their extraction by birds leaves characteristic signs, allowing analysis of patterns at within-tree spatial scales 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Schnrogge4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Schnrogge4">[18]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Connor1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Connor1">[28]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Connor2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Connor2">[32]</a>. At each of our 8 sites we therefore analysed bird foraging responses to variation in prey density at three spatial scales: shoots within branches, branches within trees, and trees within sites.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous work has also shown that tit foraging preferences for individual patches and prey types track changes in resource availability over timescales of days 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-NaefDaenzer1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-NaefDaenzer1">[23]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Gawlik1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Gawlik1">[33]</a>. Each spring, the alien 
  <span class="italic">Andricus</span> bud galls emerge as a single cohort that once eaten are not replaced, so abundance of this prey declines over time. To study the impact of this change in resource availability, we also tracked week-by-week changes in signatures of density dependence through a single season at a single site. The persistence of any signal of density dependence provides an indication of the attractiveness of this resource to native birds. Our 
  <span class="italic">a priori</span> expectation was that any signature of density dependence would decline as total gall abundance declines and birds recruit to alternative, more profitable foods 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Connor1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Connor1">[28]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Gawlik1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Gawlik1">[33]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We thus address the following specific questions. 1) Is there evidence of spatially density dependent predation of alien bud galls by birds, and, if so, at which spatial scale(s)? 2) How do the sign and strength of spatial density dependence at a single site change through a single season? Is there a detectable decline in any signal of density dependence with decreasing resource availability?</p>
