 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reproduction of northern temperate insectivorous birds, particularly tit species (
  <span class="italic">Parus</span> spp.), is timed to allow nest provisioning during the May peak availability of lepidopteran caterpillars on flushing oak leaves

  <a rid="pone.0053959-Visser1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Visser1">[63]</a>. The match between availability of insect prey and nest provisioning strongly influences offspring survival, offspring quality, and parental condition

  <a rid="pone.0053959-Tremblay1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Tremblay1">[64]</a>. Climate change influences the timing of each of tree budburst, caterpillar availability, and egg laying 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Visser1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Visser1">[63]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Both1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Both1">[65]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Visser3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Visser3">[67]</a>. While bird responses have tracked resource availability in some populations 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-McCleery1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-McCleery1">[68]</a>, other bird populations are breeding before there is adequate caterpillar biomass, with significant fitness costs 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Visser1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Visser1">[63]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Thomas1">[69]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Visser4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Visser4">[70]</a>. We hypothesise that these changes can only increase the significance for songbirds of foods available before the onset of breeding. These include alien 
  <span class="italic">Andricus</span> galls on 
  <span class="italic">Q. cerris,</span> which are increasingly widespread and abundant through much of northern and western Europe 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Schnrogge2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Schnrogge2">[10]</a>,

  <a rid="pone.0053959-Schnrogge6" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Schnrogge6">[54]</a>. We suggest that a useful aim for future research will be to quantify the nutritive contribution to native songbirds of these and other invading insects 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Girardoz2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Girardoz2">[6]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Grobler1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Grobler1">[8]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Nash1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Nash1">[71]</a>, for example through analyses of foraging time allocated to alternative food sources, or of faecal remains

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bird exploitation of alien galls has broader implications for oak-associated animal communities. First, positive spatial density dependence in bird predation, combined with the high absolute mortalities observed here, could contribute to top-down regulation of invading gallwasp populations 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Keane1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Keane1">[51]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Hawkes1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Hawkes1">[52]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Hassell1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Hassell1">[73]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Holmes2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Holmes2">[74]</a>. Second, bird predation could influence indirect interactions among native and invading gallwasp species. Many parasitoids attack both native and invading oak gallwasps 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Schnrogge1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Schnrogge1">[9]</a>, and the invaders may have negative impacts on natives through apparent competition mediated by shared parasitoids 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Cronin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Cronin1">[75]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-vanVeen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-vanVeen1">[76]</a>. If birds open galls before parasitoid natural enemies have a chance to emerge, they kill these parasitoids and reduce the potential for apparent competition. However, if feeding on galls has a significant numerical impact on bird populations, then because they also feed on native gallwasps 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Betts1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Betts1">[15]</a> the birds themselves become agents of apparent competition between the alien gallwasps and other prey outwith gallwasp communities 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Holmes2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Holmes2">[74]</a>. Such an impact may be more likely for the more abundant alien catkin galls on Turkey oak induced by 
  <span class="italic">Andricus grossulariae</span> and 
  <span class="italic">A. quercuscalicis</span>, present at densities of up to 1 million/tree during the May nesting season when the link between food availability and bird reproductive success is at its strongest 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-NaefDaenzer2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-NaefDaenzer2">[41]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-vanNoordwijk1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-vanNoordwijk1">[62]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Visser1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Visser1">[63]</a>. To these can be added the resources represented by recently established populations of other oak gallwasps in southern Britain 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Schnrogge2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Schnrogge2">[10]</a>. These possibilities underline the value of further work on bird exploitation of invading gallwasps and other alien insects.
