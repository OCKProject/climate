  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results show that at the scale of trees within sites, two of seven study sites showing bird predation of alien 
   <span class="italic">Andricus</span> galls also show significant positive spatial density dependence. This parallels previous studies of birds foraging on native prey that show birds to recruit to rewarding patches at this spatial scale

   <a rid="pone.0053959-NaefDaenzer3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-NaefDaenzer3">[42]</a>. This sensitivity to prey density shows that even though we do not know the caloric contribution of gallwasps to bird diets, galls are important enough to influence bird foraging behaviour in the early spring. Few alternative protein-rich foods are available at this time 
   <a rid="pone.0053959-Betts1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Betts1">[15]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0053959-Suhonen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Suhonen1">[24]</a> and because both adult survival 
   <a rid="pone.0053959-Jansson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Jansson1">[17]</a> and breeding success 
   <a rid="pone.0053959-Lambrechts1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Lambrechts1">[26]</a> correlate with pre-breeding adult condition, exploitation of any additional accessible resource is to be expected. Importance of alien gallwasps as a food source is underlined by continuing signatures of positive density dependence across the first three weeks and the fifth week of our five-week sampling period in 2006. We suggest that the observed decline in gall predation rates over the 5 week period may indicate declining dependence on (and hence sensitivity to) this resource as it becomes less abundant 
   <a rid="pone.0053959-NaefDaenzer1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-NaefDaenzer1">[23]</a>. Alternative foods that become increasingly available through May include the Turkey oak catkin galls of two other invaders, 
   <span class="italic">Andricus quercuscalicis</span> and 
   <span class="italic">A. grossulariae</span>, which can reach densities of a million galls/tree

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Variation in prey density among trees – and hence spatial patterns in bird foraging -may be driven by bottom-up influences of host oaks on gall densities. Previous work has shown that some trees support consistently higher densities of a given cynipid gall than others 
   <a rid="pone.0053959-Hails1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Hails1">[4]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0053959-Askew1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Askew1">[43]</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0053959-Egan1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Egan1">[45]</a>, and evidence is growing that such variation is associated with oak genotype 
   <a rid="pone.0053959-Eliason1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Eliason1">[46]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0053959-Ito1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Ito1">[47]</a>. Successful gall induction requires oviposition into host plant tissues at appropriate levels of development, and at least some between-tree variation in gall densities is due to between-tree variation in phenology 
   <a rid="pone.0053959-Askew1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Askew1">[43]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0053959-Crawley2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Crawley2">[44]</a>. It is thus possible that once local bird populations have discovered how to exploit alien galls on Turkey oak, they may also learn which trees are consistently more rewarding than others. Bottom-up impacts of host tree genotype on trophic interactions between birds and their insect prey have been demonstrated in other systems 
   <a rid="pone.0053959-Smith1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Smith1">[48]</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found no consistent evidence of density dependence at spatial scales within trees. Hails and Crawley 
   <a rid="pone.0053959-Hails1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Hails1">[4]</a> studied predation rates on the catkin galls of another invading oak gallwasp, 
   <span class="italic">Andricus quercuscalicis,</span> on Turkey oak in Britain. In experimental treatments involving enhanced gall densities they detected consistently positive spatial density dependence of bird predation at four spatial scales within trees, from within individual catkins to within twigs representing two years of growth. However, at field densities the signs of density dependence at such spatial scales varied within individual trees 
   <a rid="pone.0053959-Hails1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Hails1">[4]</a>, paralleling the lack of consistency at similar spatial scales in our data and in other studies on bird predation of concealed insect prey

   <a rid="pone.0053959-Connor2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Connor2">[32]</a>. The lack of negative density dependence within branches suggests that at this spatial scale birds have no difficulty in exploiting the highest gall densities they encountered.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The signatures of positive spatial density dependence in 1995 were strongest in the two sites in southern England at which the invaders are longest established

   <a rid="pone.0053959-Askew2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Askew2">[50]</a>. Lack of significant relationships at other sites cannot be attributed to low gall densities, since at these sites gall densities were as high or higher than those showing significant density dependence, and (with one exception) predation rates on individual trees also reached similar levels (see 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053959-g002" href="#pone-0053959-g002">Fig. 2</a> and 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053959.s002" href="#pone.0053959.s002">Table S1</a>). The exception was the most northern site, Dunrobin, which is notable because despite high gall densities there was virtually no predation. The geographic pattern in density dependence leads us to hypothesise that the ability of birds to recognise and effectively exploit this resource may be a function of their exposure to this novel prey type. This hypothesis could be tested using predation data from sites in which dates of first record for each of the invading gallwasps are known. Such a time lag in the recruitment of natural enemies to invading species is not uncommon 
   <a rid="pone.0053959-Keane1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Keane1">51</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0053959-Hawkes1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Hawkes1">52</a>, and is well documented for insect natural enemies (parasitoid wasps) exploiting another invading alien oak gallwasp,

   <a rid="pone.0053959-Sherry1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Sherry1">[57]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0053959-Sherry2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Sherry2">[58]</a>, the alien sexual generation galls do not closely resemble any native galls present at the same time of year and their exploitation may require learning of effective exploitation behaviours by local bird populations. If this hypothesis is correct, then future surveys of bird predation involving the same latitudinal series of bird populations should detect increased spatial density dependence of gall predation at more northern sites.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An alternative explanation for between-site variation in density dependence is variation in the abundance of bird species able effectively to exploit cynipid galls. Blue tits and great tits vary in abundance across the UK, and while sites in England and southern Scotland have comparable densities of these species, blue tits have only extended their range into northern Scotland during the second half of the 20
   <span class="sup">th</span> century 
   <a rid="pone.0053959-Gibbons1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Gibbons1">[59]</a>. In 1988–1991, blue tits were recorded at our two most northern sites (Beauly and Dunrobin) at considerably lower abundance than at sites further south (about 5% of southern densities; see 
   <a rid="pone.0053959-Gibbons1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Gibbons1">[59]</a> for details). Separating two alternative explanations for variation in exploitation of alien galls – variation in gall exploitation ability by 
   <span class="underline">in situ</span> populations 
   <span class="underline">versus</span> variation in density of the birds themselves, can be complex, as illustrated by the evolution since 1921 of the ability of blue tits to harvest the cream from foil-covered milk bottles in Britain. It was long believed that this behaviour spread through blue tit populations as a memic wave involving dispersal of expert birds and local mimicry (ringing data show that &gt;10% of recaptured birds fly more than 20 km; 
   <a rid="pone.0053959-Wernhem1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Wernhem1">[60]</a>). However, recent re-analysis of the mapping data suggests that the behaviour arose multiple times and that spread was more local 
   <a rid="pone.0053959-Lefebvre1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Lefebvre1">[61]</a>. Distinction of these alternatives for exploitation of alien galls will require detailed analyses on a large spatial scale 
   <a rid="pone.0053959-Schnrogge4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Schnrogge4">[18]</a> focussing on the behaviour and population structure of birds themselves.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bird exploitation of alien galls has broader implications for oak-associated animal communities. First, positive spatial density dependence in bird predation, combined with the high absolute mortalities observed here, could contribute to top-down regulation of invading gallwasp populations

   <a rid="pone.0053959-Holmes2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Holmes2">[74]</a>. Second, bird predation could influence indirect interactions among native and invading gallwasp species. Many parasitoids attack both native and invading oak gallwasps 
   <a rid="pone.0053959-Schnrogge1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Schnrogge1">[9]</a>, and the invaders may have negative impacts on natives through apparent competition mediated by shared parasitoids

   <a rid="pone.0053959-vanVeen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-vanVeen1">[76]</a>. If birds open galls before parasitoid natural enemies have a chance to emerge, they kill these parasitoids and reduce the potential for apparent competition. However, if feeding on galls has a significant numerical impact on bird populations, then because they also feed on native gallwasps 
   <a rid="pone.0053959-Betts1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Betts1">[15]</a> the birds themselves become agents of apparent competition between the alien gallwasps and other prey outwith gallwasp communities

   <span class="italic">Andricus grossulariae</span> and 
   <span class="italic">A. quercuscalicis</span>, present at densities of up to 1 million/tree during the May nesting season when the link between food availability and bird reproductive success is at its strongest

   <a rid="pone.0053959-Schnrogge2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Schnrogge2">[10]</a>. These possibilities underline the value of further work on bird exploitation of invading gallwasps and other alien insects.
