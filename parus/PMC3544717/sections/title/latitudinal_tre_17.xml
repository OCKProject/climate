 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The signatures of positive spatial density dependence in 1995 were strongest in the two sites in southern England at which the invaders are longest established

  <a rid="pone.0053959-Askew2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Askew2">[50]</a>. Lack of significant relationships at other sites cannot be attributed to low gall densities, since at these sites gall densities were as high or higher than those showing significant density dependence, and (with one exception) predation rates on individual trees also reached similar levels (see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053959-g002" href="#pone-0053959-g002">Fig. 2</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053959.s002" href="#pone.0053959.s002">Table S1</a>). The exception was the most northern site, Dunrobin, which is notable because despite high gall densities there was virtually no predation. The geographic pattern in density dependence leads us to hypothesise that the ability of birds to recognise and effectively exploit this resource may be a function of their exposure to this novel prey type. This hypothesis could be tested using predation data from sites in which dates of first record for each of the invading gallwasps are known. Such a time lag in the recruitment of natural enemies to invading species is not uncommon

  <a rid="pone.0053959-Hawkes1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Hawkes1">52</a>, and is well documented for insect natural enemies (parasitoid wasps) exploiting another invading alien oak gallwasp, 
  <span class="italic">Andricus quercuscalicis,</span> across continental Europe and Britain

  <a rid="pone.0053959-Collins1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Collins1">[53]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Schnrogge8" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Schnrogge8">[56]</a>. Though insectivorous birds, and tits in particular, are able to recruit rapidly to new and rewarding food resources 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Sherry1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Sherry1">[57]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Sherry2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Sherry2">[58]</a>, the alien sexual generation galls do not closely resemble any native galls present at the same time of year and their exploitation may require learning of effective exploitation behaviours by local bird populations. If this hypothesis is correct, then future surveys of bird predation involving the same latitudinal series of bird populations should detect increased spatial density dependence of gall predation at more northern sites.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An alternative explanation for between-site variation in density dependence is variation in the abundance of bird species able effectively to exploit cynipid galls. Blue tits and great tits vary in abundance across the UK, and while sites in England and southern Scotland have comparable densities of these species, blue tits have only extended their range into northern Scotland during the second half of the 20
  <span class="sup">th</span> century 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Gibbons1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Gibbons1">[59]</a>. In 1988–1991, blue tits were recorded at our two most northern sites (Beauly and Dunrobin) at considerably lower abundance than at sites further south (about 5% of southern densities; see 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Gibbons1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Gibbons1">[59]</a> for details). Separating two alternative explanations for variation in exploitation of alien galls – variation in gall exploitation ability by 
  <span class="underline">in situ</span> populations 
  <span class="underline">versus</span> variation in density of the birds themselves, can be complex, as illustrated by the evolution since 1921 of the ability of blue tits to harvest the cream from foil-covered milk bottles in Britain. It was long believed that this behaviour spread through blue tit populations as a memic wave involving dispersal of expert birds and local mimicry (ringing data show that &gt;10% of recaptured birds fly more than 20 km; 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Wernhem1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Wernhem1">[60]</a>). However, recent re-analysis of the mapping data suggests that the behaviour arose multiple times and that spread was more local 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Lefebvre1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Lefebvre1">[61]</a>. Distinction of these alternatives for exploitation of alien galls will require detailed analyses on a large spatial scale 
  <a rid="pone.0053959-Schnrogge4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053959-Schnrogge4">[18]</a> focussing on the behaviour and population structure of birds themselves.
