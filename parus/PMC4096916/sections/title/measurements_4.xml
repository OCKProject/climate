  <a rid="pone.0101927-Freeman1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Freeman1">[40]</a>. Several studies proposed tarsus length as the preferred single proxy for body size

  <a rid="pone.0101927-Senar1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Senar1">[41]</a>. Gosler et al. 
  <a rid="pone.0101927-Gosler1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Gosler1">[30]</a> described wing length as the best single linear proxy of body size (but see

  <a rid="pone.0101927-Moser1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Moser1">[42]</a>). However, wing length is also related to migration and habitat use

  <a rid="pone.0101927-Winkler1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Winkler1">[44]</a>. Wing pointedness is related to the efficiency of long-distance flight, with migrants having more pointed wings

  <a rid="pone.0101927-Baldwin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Baldwin1">[46]</a>.We considered tarsus length, wing length and the Kipp-index of wing pointedness in parallel to appraise whether trends were consistent across all traits and whether alternative explanations suggest some of these traits might not be good surrogates for body size. With respect to the expectation of decreasing body size 
  <a rid="pone.0101927-Sheridan1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Sheridan1">[2]</a> and reduced migratory activity 
  <a rid="pone.0101927-Visser1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Visser1">[47]</a> as a response to the current global warming, the three measurements are expected to decrease during the study period and especially during the last four decades.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wing length was measured from the wrist to the tip with a butted ruler (Wmax 
  <a rid="pone.0101927-Eck1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Eck1">[48]</a>), and the primary projection with a piece of laminated millimetre-gridded paper with a precision of 0.5 mm. The tarsus was measured by taking the distance between the back of the intertarsal joint and the lower front edge of the last undivided scale before the toes diverge (Tar 2 in 
  <a rid="pone.0101927-Eck1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Eck1">[48]</a>). The length was marked using the tip of dividers (pair of compasses) and the length read from them on millimetre-gridded paper under a magnifying lamp with a precision of 0.1 mm. The Kipp-index 
  <a rid="pone.0101927-Kipp2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Kipp2">[49]</a>, hereafter “Kipp”, is calculated as the percentage of the primary projection (distance from the tip of the first secondary feather to the tip of the longest primary feather) of the wing length (Kipp  =  primary projection/wing length*100).

  <a rid="pone.0101927-Gosler1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Gosler1">[30]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0101927-Salewski2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Salewski2">[50]</a>. We analysed within-observer consistency by blindly repeating the measurements of 98 blackbirds 
  <span class="italic">Turdus merula</span> (97 for tarsus) in 2012 that were first measured in 2007. The mean of the repeated values differed by &lt;0.01 mm for tarsus length, 0.02 mm for wing length and 0.04 mm for the primary projection. Analysing the data according to Lessells &amp; Boag 
  <a rid="pone.0101927-Lessells1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Lessells1">[51]</a>, repeatabilities were 50%, 97% and 84% for tarsus length, wing length and primary projection respectively. The repeatability for tarsus length was surprisingly low in contrast to other studies 
  <a rid="pone.0101927-vanNoordwijk1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-vanNoordwijk1">[52]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0101927-Perkta1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Perkta1">[54]</a>, which is probably due to the sometimes problematic assignment of a reference point for measurements of museum specimens 
  <a rid="pone.0101927-Svensson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Svensson1">[55]</a>. Nevertheless, these inconsistencies in tarsus measurements did not vary with year of collection of specimens (hereafter: year); a linear model with the differences between two measurements as dependent and year as the independent variable revealed an equal distribution of differences over time (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0101927.s001" href="#pone.0101927.s001">Figure S1</a>). Therefore, we consider that any trends over time in our data are not influenced by low repeatability although confidence intervals around estimates of temporal trends may be higher for tarsus length.
