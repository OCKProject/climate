 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used generalized additive models (GAMs), implemented in the package mgcv of the programme R 2.11.1 
  <a rid="pone.0101927-R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-R1">[56]</a>, to associate morphological variables with year and temperature. GAMs allow for arbitrary variation in the target variables through time

In order to avoid possible errors in interpretation due to biased availability of specimens by age or sex cohorts, or due to the presence of individuals that only migrated to or through the study area, we performed a two-step analysis for every species and morphological trait. In the first step, we considered only specimens with known sex and age (before the first primary moult or afterwards) according to Svensson

  <a rid="pone.0101927-Jenni1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Jenni1">[59]</a> or the label on the specimen, as well as specimens with known month of collection. We then used ANOVA to test for potential associations of sex, age or month of collection with tarsus length, wing length or Kipp. In the second step, we fitted GAMs to the data with either year or temperature as a smoothing term and the variables that were significant in the first step as fixed factors. Specimens for which information was not available for inclusion at the first step were included at the second step if the relevant variable was not significant at the first, thus considerably increasing our sample sizes for the GAMs.
