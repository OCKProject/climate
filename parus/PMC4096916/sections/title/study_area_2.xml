  <a rid="pone.0101927-Frschler1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Frschler1">[37]</a>. Therefore, we restricted our study to specimens that were collected in southern Germany and adjacent areas in Switzerland and Austria between about 47.0°N and 50.8°N and between about 6.9°E and 14.3°E. The great majority of the specimens used (75%) were collected in the German federal states of Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria between 47.27° and 50.57°N and between 7.5°E and 13.8°E.
