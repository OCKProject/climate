 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study found no support for the hypothesis of a general decrease in surrogates for body size in times of global warming, and no two species displayed similar changes in morphology over time when all three morphological traits were considered together. In the majority of species, there was no consistent variation in tarsus length across the study period (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101927-g002" href="#pone-0101927-g002">Figure 2</a>), but starling, greenfinch and house sparrow showed remarkable parallel fluctuations. Wing length varied significantly and mostly decreased for seven out of eleven species (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101927-g005" href="#pone-0101927-g005">Figure 5</a>). There was a non-significant linear decrease in two additional species, and in one species the non-significant fluctuations included a distinct decrease in wing length during the last decades (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101927-g005" href="#pone-0101927-g005">Figure 5</a>). Kipp showed in general no significant fluctuations throughout the study period (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101927-g006" href="#pone-0101927-g006">Figure 6</a>). Hardly any of the morphological traits was significantly associated with temperature. When they were, models including year as the smooth term often explained significantly more variation in the data. Overall, our results indicate that: (1) independent patterns of long-term variation in multiple morphological traits have occurred within individual species; and (2) species-specific patterns of long-term variation for each trait have been the rule rather than the exception.

  <a rid="pone.0101927-YomTov5" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-YomTov5">[64]</a> (but see 
  <a rid="pone.0101927-Goodman1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Goodman1">[20]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0101927-Guillemain1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Guillemain1">[22]</a>). Many of these studies used wing length as a surrogate for body size which may not be an appropriate predictor of overall body size 
  <a rid="pone.0101927-Rising1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Rising1">[39]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0101927-Senar1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Senar1">[41]</a>. In our study, wing lengths also declined in a number of species throughout the study period, but not in correlation with temperature. Wing length is also related to migratory activity with shorter wings indicating shorter migration distances 
  <a rid="pone.0101927-Fiedler1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Fiedler1">[36]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0101927-Frschler1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Frschler1">[37]</a>. The mean migration distance of many bird populations, as well as the proportion of migratory individuals within populations, have decreased in recent decades presumably due to climate change 
  <a rid="pone.0101927-Visser1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Visser1">[47]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0101927-Fiedler2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Fiedler2">[65]</a>. This may have released populations from the selective pressure to optimise wing shape for migration. Thus, a reduction in wing length may reflect decreasing migratory activity as a response to climate change, rather than decreasing body size. However, a decrease in migration distances or the proportion of migratory individuals should also lead to a reduction in wing pointedness 
  <a rid="pone.0101927-Fiedler1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Fiedler1">[36]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0101927-Frschler1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Frschler1">[37]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0101927-Baldwin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Baldwin1">[46]</a>. We found evidence of reduced wing pointedness only in the blackbird, a species for which a reduction in migratory activity has been shown 
  <a rid="pone.0101927-vanVliet1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-vanVliet1">[66]</a>, and only during a limited period. Thus, the hypothesis that decreasing wing length is a response to the reduction of migratory activity remains to be validated and the observed changes may have been caused by other ecological factors such as change in habitat availability 
  <a rid="pone.0101927-Desrochers1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Desrochers1">[67]</a>. However, decreasing wing length is unlikely to indicate a reduction in body size as a response to increased temperature.

  <a rid="pone.0101927-Dayan2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Dayan2">[68]</a>. Tarsus length has been considered to be a more appropriate surrogate for size than wing length 
  <a rid="pone.0101927-Rising1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Rising1">[39]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0101927-Senar1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Senar1">[41]</a>. In our study, tarsus length did not show any consistent trend among species. Where there were significant fluctuations in tarsus length over time or with temperature, they did not necessarily support the a priori hypothesis of a decreasing trend. Indeed, four species (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101927-g002" href="#pone-0101927-g002">Figure 2d,g,h,j</a>) showed a pronounced increasing trend during the recent decades of accelerated global warming. Nestlings of birds grow larger tarsi when reared under more favourable conditions 
  <a rid="pone.0101927-Alatalo1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Alatalo1">[61]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0101927-Alatalo2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Alatalo2">[69]</a>. Therefore, better foraging conditions related to higher temperatures may result in larger tarsi, yielding the opposite trend to the predicted adaptive change to varying thermoregulatory needs (see also 
  <a rid="pone.0101927-Goodman1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Goodman1">[20]</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Treating wing and tarsus length as surrogates for body size leads to some contradictory results (e.g. trends during the last decades for great-spotted woodpecker, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101927-g002" href="#pone-0101927-g002">Figure 2a</a>,

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101927-g005" href="#pone-0101927-g005">5g</a>; house sparrow, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101927-g002" href="#pone-0101927-g002">Figure 2j</a>, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101927-g005" href="#pone-0101927-g005">5j</a>). Similar contradictions have also been found in previous studies 
  <a rid="pone.0101927-MorenoRueda1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-MorenoRueda1">[70]</a>, further indicating pitfalls when interpreting trends in single measurements. The conclusion that body size in birds has declined in response to climate change may have been biased in some studies by the use of wing length as the only measure for size.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The low support for models that included temperature as the smoothing term also suggests that climate change has not been a universally important driver of morphological change. Using long term data sets of museum specimens, change in bill length in the Hawaiian i'iwi 
  <span class="italic">Vestiaria coccinea</span> was associated with altered food sources 
  <a rid="pone.0101927-Smith3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Smith3">[27]</a>. An increase in wing pointedness in North American forest passerines was linked to habitat fragmentation 
  <a rid="pone.0101927-Desrochers1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Desrochers1">[67]</a>. House sparrows in urbanised habitats have shorter tarsi than those living in rural areas 
  <a rid="pone.0101927-Liker1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Liker1">[71]</a>. Changes in prey availability have been suggested as the cause of variation in size of the European goshawk 
  <span class="italic">Accipiter gentilis</span>
  <a rid="pone.0101927-Tornberg1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Tornberg1">[28]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0101927-YomTov6" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-YomTov6">[72]</a>. Therefore there are many hints that various factors influence morphology irrespective of climate change or only indirectly related to it.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, we found almost no morphological variation that was directly correlated with change in five-year means of temperatures. The general warming that has occurred in southern Germany since the 1880s was not paralleled by the expected change in surrogates for birds' body size. We argue that use of long-term datasets and non-linear models of change over time, along with consideration of multiple surrogates, may prompt similar conclusions in other regions or globally. Furthermore, drivers of adaptation other than ambient temperature

  <a rid="pone.0101927-Huston1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Huston1">[74]</a> should be considered when trying to understand fluctuations in morphology.
