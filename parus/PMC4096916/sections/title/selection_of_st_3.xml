 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We selected a range of species that represent different migration strategies because non-migratory bird species follow Bergmann's rule more strongly than migrants 
  <a rid="pone.0101927-Meiri1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Meiri1">[38]</a>. The migration categories considered were: long-distance migrants from the study area to sub-Saharan Africa, short-distance or partial migrants in which either the entire or a proportion of the population migrates to the Mediterranean, and residents. Initially, we selected six species out of each migration category according to the catalogue of the Rosenstein Museum in Stuttgart, but after the visits to the first two and largest collections (Stuttgart, Munich), we discovered that we could not expect to get sufficient specimens for many species, especially for long-distance migrants. For this reason we restricted our analyses to eleven of our initial 18 target species. Of the eleven species, we measured 4529 specimens collected between 1889 and 2010 (

Some sample sizes for specific analyses may be lower than the totals of measured specimens because it was not possible to measure all morphological variables in all specimens, and specimens were excluded when they did not meet our criteria for certain analyses (see below).
