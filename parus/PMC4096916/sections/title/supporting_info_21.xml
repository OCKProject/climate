    <span class="bold">Result of the repeated measurement of 95 tarsus lengths of blackbirds.</span> Shown are the differences between the two measurements of a single bird (dots) and the result of a linear regression of the differences between the two measurements (d Measurement) on the year of collection of the respective individuals (F
    <sub>1, 93</sub>&lt;0.001, p = 0.988, adjusted R
    <span class="sup">2</span>&lt;0.001). The regression line is shown and it is virtually identical with a line with the function y = 0 which would also be the result of such a regression when there would be no differences between the repeated measurements at all. Therefore our measurements can be used to analyse size trends despite a relatively low repeatability between measurements.
