  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used generalized additive models (GAMs), implemented in the package mgcv of the programme R 2.11.1 
   <a rid="pone.0101927-R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-R1">[56]</a>, to associate morphological variables with year and temperature. GAMs allow for arbitrary variation in the target variables through time

   <a rid="pone.0101927-Zuur1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Zuur1">[58]</a> that potentially describe fluctuations of morphological characters better than linear models, while still approximating linear trends if these are biologically real. In order to avoid possible errors in interpretation due to biased availability of specimens by age or sex cohorts, or due to the presence of individuals that only migrated to or through the study area, we performed a two-step analysis for every species and morphological trait. In the first step, we considered only specimens with known sex and age (before the first primary moult or afterwards) according to Svensson

   <a rid="pone.0101927-Jenni1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Jenni1">[59]</a> or the label on the specimen, as well as specimens with known month of collection. We then used ANOVA to test for potential associations of sex, age or month of collection with tarsus length, wing length or Kipp. In the second step, we fitted GAMs to the data with either year or temperature as a smoothing term and the variables that were significant in the first step as fixed factors. Specimens for which information was not available for inclusion at the first step were included at the second step if the relevant variable was not significant at the first, thus considerably increasing our sample sizes for the GAMs.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conditions during certain seasons may have a greater influence on survival compared to other seasons 
   <a rid="pone.0101927-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Robinson1">[60]</a>. Therefore, morphological adaptations to conditions during a crucial period within the annual cycle may not be detected when using temperature means over the entire annual cycle. However, linear regressions revealed that mean temperatures during seasons were significantly correlated with the temperature of the respective years: spring (March-May; n = 132, 
   <sub>F1,128</sub> = 130.4, adjusted R
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.50, p = &lt;0.001), summer (June-August; n = 132, 
   <sub>F1,128</sub> = 49.62, adjusted R
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.27, p = &lt;0.001), autumn (September-November; n = 132, 
   <sub>F1,128</sub> = 27.15, adjusted R
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.17, p = &lt;0.001) and winter (December-February; n = 132, 
   <sub>F1,128</sub> = 59.93, adjusted R
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.31, p = &lt;0.001). Therefore, seasonal trends in temperature were not considered further.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temperature in the year of collection may not be the most biologically-appropriate year to correlate with morphological characters. Many specimens have been collected early in the year and feathers grew in the previous year. Tarsi are fully grown when birds fledge 
   <a rid="pone.0101927-Alatalo1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Alatalo1">[61]</a> and thus temperature in subsequent years has no direct influence on the tarsus length of older individuals. Further, phenotypic expression of morphological characters may be more influenced by selective pressures acting in previous years. Therefore, we examined correlations between morphology and running means of temperature for the year of collection and the four preceding years. All species considered in this study have a generation length of less than 3.5 years 
   <a rid="pone.0101927-Bauer1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0101927-Bauer1">[62]</a>. Therefore, our approach includes temperatures experienced when the respective traits developed as well as temperatures causing potential selective pressures on one or two previous generations of most individuals considered in this study. Hence, temperatures that may cause phenotypic responses as well as microevolutionary adaptations are included.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test whether temperature explained fluctuations in morphology better than a time trend alone, we fitted similar GAMs to the same data as described above, but with temperature instead of year as the smooth term. We compared pairs of GAMs (temperature, year) for each morphological trait and species with a likelihood ratio test. The accepted significance level was p≤0.05.</p>
