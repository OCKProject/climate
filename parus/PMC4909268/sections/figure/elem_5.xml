  <p>a) The locations for which COI Barcode Data were available from BOLD for Group IV. The black triangles indicate localities with GPS coordinates, the red circles indicate countries for which GPS data were not available, and the blue squares indicate the study site (Aras River Research Station). For the haplotype networks, colors indicate the origin of the haplotypes (Green: Russia, Purple: Turkey, Yellow: Mongolia, Blue: Sweden, Red: Norway, Grey: South Korea, Dark Red: Lithuania). b) Neighbor-joining trees. c) Haplotype networks. For 
   <span class="italic">Caprimulgus europaeus</span>, red and blue areas indicate Hap 1 and Hap 2 respectively. For 
   <span class="italic">Parus major</span> red, orange and blue areas indicate Hap 3, 4, 5, and Hap 1, 2, respectively. For 
   <span class="italic">Sylvia curruca</span>, Hap 1, 2, 3 are indicated by red and Hap 4, 5, 6, 7 are indicated with blue areas. For 
   <span class="italic">Erithacus rubecula</span>, blue area indicates Hap 6 and other haplotypesâ€™ geographical distributions are indicated with red. For 
   <span class="italic">Phoenicurus phoenicurus</span>, Hap 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 are indicated with red and Hap 1, 2, 3, 4 are indicated with blue.
