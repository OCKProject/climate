 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the first barcoding study on Turkey’s birds, we applied genetic barcoding to birds captured in the Aras River wetlands on the Kars-Iğdır border, and compared our findings to the previous barcoding studies at continental scales. Our results generally agreed with the DNA barcoding literature both in terms of the effectiveness of COI barcodes as an identification tool and the existence of a barcoding gap [
  <a rid="pone.0154454.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0154454.ref008">8</a>]. Samples from five different orders, Passeriformes, Cuculiformes, Galliformes, Coraciiformes, and Caprimulgiformes were studied. From 12 species, 18 new haplotypes were recorded from the Aras samples. Unique barcodes/haplotypes were found in 26 of the 33 studied species. Four main groups were identified based on barcoding suitability, current subspecific classification and levels of intraspecific divergence at continental scales. Group I was composed of five species, which have no defined subspecies and no intraspecific divergence, and Group III consisted of five species which had designated subspecies with high intraspecific divergence. Hence these 10 species in groups I and III show concordance between subspecific taxonomic classifications and genetic differentiation. On the other hand, Group II had the greatest number of species in it, 16, which had taxonomically defined subspecies, but no corresponding intraspecific divergence. This suggests that in these species, at least some subspecific classifications are not supported by genetics and there might be over-splitting in their taxonomy. Finally in Group IV, we observed five species that had several genetically divergent subspecies with unique DNA barcodes. Our study shows how data from local scales and seemingly independent DNA barcoding studies can be used together to make phylogeographical comparisons at continental scales and taxonomical inferences. We recommend that this approach also be used with other groups of species that are barcoded.
