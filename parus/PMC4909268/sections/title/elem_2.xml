 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study was undertaken at the Aras River Bird Research and Education Center (Yukarı Çıyrıklı, Tuzluca, Iğdır; elevation: 960 m; 40°07'16''N 43°35'00'' E), the first bird banding station in eastern Turkey (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154454.g001" href="#pone.0154454.g001">Fig 1</a>). At the foot of the 1500–2300 m high Kars plateau and surrounded by arid steppes of the Iğdır plains, the Aras River wetlands comprise a major migration stop-over, breeding, and wintering area for many bird species travelling between Africa, Asia, and Europe. These wetlands are at the confluence of Aras River and Iğdır Plains globally Important Bird Areas [
  <a rid="pone.0154454.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0154454.ref002">2</a>]. At the Aras River bird banding (ringing) station, over 75,000 individuals of 182 bird species have been banded and 264 species have been recorded since banding began in 2006, constituting 56% of the 473 bird species recorded from Turkey [
  <a rid="pone.0154454.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0154454.ref013">13</a>]. Birds were caught using 12 x 2.5 m Ecotone
  <span class="sup">™</span> 1016 series mist nets designed for safe bird and bat sampling, with 16x16mm mesh made of D110 netting (DENIER 110/2) that capture birds without harming them. At the station, wetlands along the Aras River are sampled every year with mist nets, 40–60 of which are open every day between mid-March to early June and mid-August to early November. Nets are checked every half hour, birds are taken out, brought to the processing center, identified, banded, measured, and released after the collection of the blood sample. The bird community of Aras River wetlands is mostly typical of eastern Europe and the species examined for this study are common and well-known European species that were identified by licensed and experienced bird banders, using detailed field guides and identification books when necessary [

  <a rid="pone.0154454.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0154454.ref016">16</a>]. For this study, the collection of the blood samples was conducted in May 2009 and October 2009. Aras station has operated approximately 150 to 200 days every year since 2006. The birds sampled for this study are representative of the bird community at the site. All but two of the species analyzed in this study are captured every year and are among the most common 70% of the species captured. The species diversity and abundance during these seasons was comparable to, and did not differ significantly from, species diversities and abundances from other seasons (t-test, p = 0.062–0.83). Blood samples were collected following standard protocols. From the brachial vein of each bird, 20–50 μl blood was collected with a 30-gauge needle. Blood collected from each bird was less than 0.2% of its body weight, five times below the recommended maximum. No birds were injured or ill during the capture, handling and blood collection.
