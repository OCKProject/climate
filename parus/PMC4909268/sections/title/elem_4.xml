 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a result of our analyses, we generated 73 COI sequences from 33 different species (

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0154454.s004" href="#pone.0154454.s004">S1 Table</a>). These 33 species belonged to 26 different genera. The mean intraspecific divergence was 0.62%. However, we observed relatively high intraspecific divergence values in five cases: 
  <span class="italic">Sylvia curruca</span> 3.2% (based on 12 sequences), 
  <span class="italic">Saxicola maurus</span> 2.8% (based on eight sequences),

  <span class="italic">Parus major</span> 1.7% (based on 21 sequences), and 
  <span class="italic">Caprimulgus europaeus</span> 1.7% (based on six sequences). When these clades were removed, the mean intraspecific divergence dropped to 0.3%. The minimum interspecific distance was 6.8% (

  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>, 23 different samples from seven different countries (Russia, Turkey, Lithuania, Norway, Kazakhstan, South Korea, and Sweden) were analyzed, along with two samples collected from Aras (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154454.g006" href="#pone.0154454.g006">Fig 6d</a>). 
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span> samples formed three main clades, with the samples from Turkey (B258 and B259) in one of these groups (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154454.g006" href="#pone.0154454.g006">Fig 6e</a>). Five different haplotypes were observed in this species (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154454.g006" href="#pone.0154454.g006">Fig 6f</a>). The most common haplotype, Hap 3, was found in 11 different samples from five countries (Aras, Russia, Sweden, Norway and Lithuania). This was different from Hap 1 and Hap 2 by 16 bp. Hap 4 (red) was found in a single location in Russia, whereas Hap 3 and Hap 5 (orange), and Hap 1 and Hap 2 (blue) were found almost sympatrically in the entire distribution of the barcoded individuals for this species (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fifteen different samples from Russia, Turkey, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Sweden, and Norway, including three from Aras, were analyzed for

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154454.g006" href="#pone.0154454.g006">Fig 6g</a>), also in group IV. 
  <span class="italic">Sylvia curruca</span> formed two clades in the neighbor-joining tree, and the Aras samples (B335, B337 and B338) clustered in the same clade (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154454.g006" href="#pone.0154454.g006">Fig 6h</a>). Different clades indicated the eastern and western parts of this species’ range. This differentiation of the haplotypes into two clades (a 32 bp difference) in the neighbor-joining tree was also reflected in the presence of two haplotype groups in the 
  <span class="italic">Sylvia curruca</span> network (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154454.g006" href="#pone.0154454.g006">Fig 6i</a>). Specifically, the first group contained nine samples from Russia, Turkey, Norway, and Sweden, comprising the ‘western clade’. The ‘eastern’ group was composed of six samples from Russia, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fifteen samples from four different countries (Russia, Turkey, Sweden and Norway) were analyzed for the fourth species in group IV, 
  <span class="italic">Erithacus rubecula</span>, including two samples from Aras (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154454.g006" href="#pone.0154454.g006">Fig 6j</a>). Again, two main groups were observed in the haplotype network. All Aras samples (B139, B141) clustered in the first group (red), whereas the second group contained only one sample from Russia (blue; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154454.g006" href="#pone.0154454.g006">Fig 6j</a>). Hap 6, found in Russia, was highly divergent from the other samples by 28 bp (
