 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Birds are found in all habitat types and are sensitive to environmental changes. Therefore, they are good indicator species for environmental monitoring [
  <a rid="pone.0154454.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0154454.ref001">1</a>]. Main causes of bird declines include habitat loss, exploitation (e.g. hunting), introduced species, and pollution [
  <a rid="pone.0154454.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0154454.ref002">2</a>], with climate change rapidly becoming a major threat [

  <a rid="pone.0154454.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0154454.ref003">3</a>]. Increasing temperatures also force many species to move to higher altitudes, reducing their ranges, particularly threatening tropical montane endemics and species of extensive lowlands [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">DNA sequences are significant sources of information for improving our understanding of the evolutionary and genetic relationships of organisms [
  <a rid="pone.0154454.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0154454.ref005">5</a>]. In the last decade, DNA barcoding has become an increasingly important tool to catalog the diversity of life and to improve taxonomic classification. DNA barcoding is based on the notion that a short standardized sequence can differentiate the individuals of a species from those of other species because the sequence variation between species is assumed to be more than that within. The main objectives of DNA barcoding are to help the identification of unknown specimens, speed up the designation of distinct lineages, and improve the discovery of new species. Through DNA barcoding, a number of cryptic species, which were previously thought to be a single species, have also been discovered [
  <a rid="pone.0154454.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0154454.ref006">6</a>]. On the other hand, there are some controversies about using single gene thresholds to discover new species especially considering recent divergences [
  <a rid="pone.0154454.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0154454.ref007">7</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase I (COI, cox1) is frequently used for DNA barcoding in animals. Studies show that more than 95% of species possess unique COI barcode sequences, so species-level identifications can generally be done successfully [
  <a rid="pone.0154454.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0154454.ref006">6</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0154454.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0154454.ref008">8</a>]. In essence, DNA barcoding helps in the characterization of inter- and intraspecific genetic diversity, which is also important for determining species stability and for the conservation of distinct lineages. The genetically diverse but morphologically similar variants of cryptic species can be evaluated with COI barcodes, which helps in the potential discovery of new species or subspecies that might require conservation measures.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Until now, using DNA barcoding to document avian diversity has been limited primarily to North America, Korea, Argentina and Scandinavia [
  <a rid="pone.0154454.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0154454.ref008">8</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0154454.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0154454.ref009">9</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0154454.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0154454.ref010">10</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0154454.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0154454.ref011">11</a>]. The main objective of this study is to utilize the DNA barcoding technique for the first time for birds in Turkey. This approach will help the characterization of the genetic diversity of bird species in this under-studied region and make it possible to compare this diversity to the COI barcodes of the same species living in different parts of the world. Combined with the available DNA barcodes from Scandinavia, Russia and Korea, comparisons that include Turkey will provide a better overview of the distribution of avian genetic diversity in the Palearctic. This study is also an important first step in preparing a database of genetic diversity for the species in the region, and will provide the baseline data for monitoring changes in species and genetic diversity over time. As the study location at Aras River wetlands is a crucial breeding, wintering and migration stopover site for at least 264 bird species, our findings are important because they can demonstrate variation in the genetic composition of widely-distributed bird species. The documentation of genetic diversity at this site is also significant for bird conservation because the government of Turkey is planning to build the Tuzluca dam on the Aras River that threatens to destroy this vital area where most of the bird species of Turkey have been recorded [
