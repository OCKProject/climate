 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Haemosporidian parasite diversity in the highland plateau of San Luis Potosi includes at least four lineages from two genera, plus two sequences from a lineage that has not been reported previously. Parasitemia varies tremendously between individual species. While some suffer from high parasitemia, for unknown causes, others seem not to be parasitized. According to our results, habitat degradation by the establishment of small villages, and the associated tree extraction and overgrazing in the immediacies of these villages seems to increase parasitemia. Consequently, management practices for the mitigation of these negative effects near the villages such as maintenance of native trees and shrubs within villages, reforestation practices with native trees and shrubs in highly degraded shrublands, and the control of browse by domestic animal species could probably help in controlling parasitemia.</p>
