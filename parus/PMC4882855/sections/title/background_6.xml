 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Haemosporidan parasites are transmitted by 17 genera of blood-sucking insects of the order Diptera [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>]. The study of these parasites allows the understanding of various aspects of avian ecology. Parasites indirectly reduce host fitness by decreasing their reproductive success and increasing breeding energy cost [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. Therefore, parasitism by haemosporidians constitutes a selective force on bird populations. Consequently, interactions between birds and haemosporidian parasites have become a model of host-parasite relationships in ecology, conservation and vertebrate management [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Around the world, presence of haemosporidians has been evaluated in tropical and temperate regions. Worldwide and within regions, prevalence values are highly variable, from 0 to 100 % depending on species, but in general, prevalence values tend to be slightly higher, around 50 to 80 %, in tropical regions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>], in comparison with temperate regions of North America and Europe where typical prevalence is around 50 and 70 %, respectively [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>]. Diversity of haemosporidian lineages is also high throughout the globe but tend to be higher in continents than in islands, and in tropical than in temperate regions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>]. However, only a few haemosporidian parasite studies have focused on the diversity of these organisms in dry regions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>]. Knowledge related to factors influencing patterns of bird parasitism by haemosporidians in dry regions of the Americas is rather limited. One study in Arizona reported prevalence values from 0 to 80 %, and parasitemia by 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> related to nesting height, but no infections by 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span>, and speculated that these results could be related to a number of factors including resistance to parasites, ecological barriers, or the absence of 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span> vectors in this environment due to the limited water availability [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>]. Furthermore, a study in arid zones of Venezuela reported 41 % haemosporidian prevalence and high species diversity including seven lineages from the genus 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> and ten from 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span>. It was also reported that humidity and temperature influence vector distribution and abundance [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is also evidence that human-driven habitat changes and the increase in global temperatures are facilitating the expansion of parasite distribution ranges. Infection prevalence and parasite species richness respond to interactions between biotic and abiotic factors [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>]. These processes create ecological niches that facilitate the establishment of vector populations [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>]. Results of comparisons between anthropogenic and relatively undisturbed habitat types have suggested that habitat type and quality may influence the distribution and behavior of the vectors of these parasites, consequently affecting haemosporidian parasite dispersion patterns [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>]. Others have reported that parasite dispersal may be influenced by habitat features such as proximity to water and climate change [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The establishment of villages, as well as tree extraction and overgrazing in the surroundings of these villages are common practices that have induced shrubland habitat degradation in a large proportion of the Mexican high plateau [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]. Therefore, we aimed at evaluating the effect of habitat degradation on parasitemia in resident bird species, and hypothesized that increasing levels of habitat degradation would be correlated with increasing parasitemia [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]. To further understand the underlying mechanisms associated with the effects of habitat degradation on parasitemia through potential negative effects on bird immune system, we assessed the potential correlation between individual bird body condition and parasitemia. Finally, because the construction of artificial ponds for the capture and storage of rainwater is a recurring practice in our study area and in most of the Mexican high plateau, we also evaluated the effect of proximity to water ponds on parasitemia. Our study reports the first records of haemosporidian parasites in avian populations from the highland plateau of Mexico and the effects of environmental variables on parasitemia. Thus, our results may function as the basis for future studies investigating host-parasite interactions between birds and haemosporidians in the region.
