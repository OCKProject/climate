 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Through visual interpretation of satellite imagery from Google Earth of the study area, all permanent and temporary water bodies present in the study area were located and geo-referenced. Water bodies in our study region are characterized by showing a smooth texture and being bright in aerial imagery. Using QGIS 2.0.1 Dufour software [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>], these water bodies were digitized to calculate the total area covered by water. We also used the Dufour QGIS 2.0.1 software [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>] and Google Earth imagery to measure distances between each sampling site and the nearest water body.
