 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sequencing was performed on a 3130 Genetic Analyzer sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California) in the National Laboratory of Agricultural, Medical, and Environmental Biotechnology (LANBAMA-IPICYT). The sequences obtained were compared with sequences deposited in public databases such as NCBI and MalAvi [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>] to identify the species or genera of organisms causing infection in the samples. All sequences were deposited in the GenBank database (Accession numbers KR818942-KR819003) (for details see Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). Following the criteria published by Durrant et al

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>], sequences that diverged by two or more nucleotides were considered as different lineages, and to corroborate these as new lineages, we submitted our sequences to the MalAvi database. (GenBank accession numbers KR819002 and KR819003 for CatoC00400_MELFUS01 and CatoC00443_MELFUS01, respectively). Similarity between the obtained and the previously known sequences were determined through a Neighbor Joining (NJ) analysis. Evolutionary distances between sequences were calculated using the three-parameter model of Tamura, specifying the distribution of rate variation among sites γ = 0.263. To construct the cladogram, 1000 replicates were used in a bootstrap test to calculate the percentage of association between taxa. All these analyses were conducted in MEGA version 6 [
