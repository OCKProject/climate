 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Differences in prevalence among bird species were assessed with a Chi-square test. Parasitemia was compared between bird species using a 
  <span class="italic">t</span> test for independent samples specifying the negative binomial distribution for these count data. These tests were only applied to the two species yielding positive parasitemia.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each bird species, we fitted a series of Generalized Linear Models (GLM’s) to assess the effects of factors influencing parasitemia including habitat degradation [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>], distance from nearest water body, and bird body condition. Body condition was determined for each individual bird according to the Peig and Green escalated mass ratio [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>], which is based on the relationship between body weight and a linear measure of length (e.g. wing length) of each individual. This has recently proved to be a more reliable indicator of true organismal condition than the most popular index based on the residuals of the ordinary least squares regression of body mass 
  <span class="italic">vs</span> any measure of body size. The number of parasitized cells was used as the dependent variable. Because evidence of over dispersion was found, the negative binomial distribution was used for these count data.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used Akaike’s Information Criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AIC
  <sub>c</sub>), and Akaike weights (
  <span class="italic">w</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">i</span>
  </sub>) to evaluate support for several 
  <span class="italic">a priori</span> generalized linear models of our hypotheses related to effects influencing parasitemia [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>]. Our set of 
  <span class="italic">a priori</span> models explaining parasitemia for the house finch included: 1) a null model with no explanatory variables, 2, 3, and 4) models of habitat degradation, distance from water bodies, and body condition index as the only explanatory variables, 5) a multiplicative model including habitat degradation, bird body condition, and the interaction of these two variables, and 6) a multiplicative model including distance from nearest water body, bird body condition, and the interaction of these two variables. For the canyon towhee we did not consider a model containing bird body condition as the only explanatory variable because the algorithm failed to converge, presumably due to the relatively small sample size. We did not include a multiplicative model containing habitat degradation and distance from water bodies for any of the studied species because results of an exploratory analysis indicated that there was autocorrelation between these two explanatory variables (one way ANOVA, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.01), presumably because distance from water bodies tends to increase with increasing distance from villages. Therefore, distance from water bodies is smallest at villages, intermediate at highly degraded shrublands, and highest at moderately degraded shrublands. It is recommended that whenever two explanatory variables are autocorrelated, one of these variables should be dropped from the model [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>]. The null model was used to determine if a random model with no explanatory variables generated a better model than inclusion of any of the remaining variables. We used AICc, Akaike differences (ΔAICc), and 
  <span class="italic">w</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">i</span>
  </sub> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>] to rank models from most to least supported by the data. Then, to account for model-selection uncertainty, we calculated model-averaged weighted parameter estimates and their associated standard errors using 
  <span class="italic">w</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">i</span>
  </sub> as weights as suggested by Burnham &amp; Anderson [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>]. Because some variables were more represented in our set of candidate models than others, we rescaled the 
  <span class="italic">w</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">i</span>
  </sub> values following recommendations of Burnham &amp; Anderson [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>] to avoid possible model redundancy. Finally, we used weighted parameter estimates and weighted standard errors to construct graphs depicting the response in parasitemia to the variables that were present in the best-supported model and those receiving equivalent support from the data as the best-supported model (ΔAICc ≤ 2). All generalized linear models and chi square tests were conducted using R and the MASS library [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>]. Because 
  <span class="italic">w</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">i</span>
  </sub> values were rescaled, we obtained log likelihood values from R, and used these values to calculate AIC tables and average weighted parameter estimates in a spreadsheet adhering to the formulas published in Burnham &amp; Anderson [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>].
