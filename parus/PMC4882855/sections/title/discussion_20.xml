 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The haemosporidian parasite prevalence that we recorded in two resident bird species of the highland plateau of San Luis Potosi are comparable to those previously reported in arid zones [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>]. On the other hand, the prevalence values encountered are lower in comparison to those reported by other studies from tropical [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>] and temperate [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>] regions. Within individual sites, prevalence varies greatly among bird species. Therefore, future studies considering more bird species from dry areas will provide additional knowledge about within-region variation in prevalence values. In comparison to our results, Deviche et al
  <span class="italic">.</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>] failed at registering the genus 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> in bird blood samples from arid Arizona habitats. At present it is difficult to understand the reasons for this difference; though water availability, which is sometimes necessary for the establishment of vector populations, may be a factor into play. Other factors such as exposure to parasites brought by migrants, resistance to parasites, ecological barriers, and other idiosyncrasies of both parasites and vectors may be important, and it is currently impossible to obtain more specific conclusions without further investigations simultaneously considering host and vector distribution and ecology within our study region. Notwithstanding, some literature indicates that 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> prevalence is in general substantially smaller than that of 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>], which is consistent with the lowest prevalence that we found for this genus and with the reports of Deviche et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Haemosporidian infection prevalence is variable among bird species and even absent in some [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]. Lack of infection in the cactus wren may be related to one or many extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Potential extrinsic factors include absence of the specific host-parasite assemblage [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>], which owes to evolutionary causes, and potential competitive exclusion of vectors by ectoparasites [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>]. As reported for other species [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>], behavior and some adaptations may be among intrinsic factors influencing our observations. Although the cactus wren tolerates some disturbance, it tends to settle far from human settlements, where vectors may be absent [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>]. In addition, it is not highly dependent on sites with available water [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>] as it seeks microhabitats with moderate temperatures and its activity decreases to prevent heat stress as the temperature reaches critical levels. Moreover, its physiological adaptations allow it to get water from food to maintain water balance even in extreme temperature conditions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>]. In addition, although cactus wren nesting is not well studied, it may be that it has nest defense strategies as the one reported for 
  <span class="italic">Parus caeruleus</span> which uses herb species as a repellent against 
  <span class="italic">Culex</span> mosquitoes to protect their nest [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>]. Immune capacity may also benefit some species [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>] and this could be the case of the cactus wren. Microbicidal capacity, for instance, which may be associated to nutrition quality and age [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>], could be a factor into play in our study as all captured cactus wren individuals were adults with no weight, size, or length below normal values for the species. In addition, as has been reported by Girard et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>] for other species, previous infection by other pathogens may have stimulated antibody production, which in turn may improve immune response to other infections. Although these could be important factors in a possible resistance of this species to infection by haemosporidians, these hypotheses should be experimentally tested. Such studies should include physiological tests in this species in order to understand its adaptation against such parasites, if any.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because bird migration has contributed significantly to promoting the establishment of widespread haemosporidian parasite distributions throughout most of the planet [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>], future studies should investigate haemosporidian parasites in blood samples from migratory birds using the area, and possible transmission between migratory and resident species, perhaps by banding birds, and simultaneously analyzing samples from residents, migrants, and the vector community. In such study, nestlings and juveniles from resident species that had fledged in our study sites during the times in which migrants were absent, could provide very valuable information. If migrants participate significantly in the parasite transmission process, prevalence in these juveniles would be expected to be significantly lower during the time in which migrants are absent. But caution must be taken in such a study because once a lineage is introduced by migrants, resident birds may function as reservoirs.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study recorded a statistical relation between habitat quality and parasitemia of infected birds. This result might be related to different factors associated to habitat quality such as food availability. Damage to the immune system of birds inhabiting moderately degraded shrublands may also play a role in parasitemia. It has been previously documented that the same acute stress response that allows organisms to survive short-term environmental stressors, such as unusual weather events or the presence of a predator, via the release of corticosterone in birds, may lead to suppression of the immune system and the consequent increase in susceptibility to disease when the source of stress is prolonged, such as under anthropogenic disturbances [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>]. Therefore, the higher parasitemia documented here at highly degraded shrublands could be the result of depressed immune system in these habitats. The correlation found between body condition and parasitemia provides additional evidence for the hypothesis that habitat degradation may influence the immune system, which in turn may promote higher parasitemia in house finches and canyon towhees inhabiting degraded habitats. This type of mechanism has been previously reported for other vertebrates [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>]. Future studies investigating factors such as status of the immune system, food availability, vector densities in relation to different habitat features, as well as manipulative experiments could help disentangle these factors. Moreover, our results should be viewed with caution because parasitemia may be more related to the stage of infection in which each individual bird is recorded than to environmental factors.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The richness of parasite lineages found in this study is similar to that reported in other arid areas [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>]. The presence of different species depends on their environmental needs. Species of the genus 
  <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon,</span> for instance, require the existence of well-oxygenated water flows for the successful development of the larval phase of at least some of their vectors such as 
  <span class="italic">Similillium</span> spp. which are blood-sucking flies of the family Simulidae [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>]. This is probably why this genus is uncommon in arid environments. According to our molecular diagnosis, four different lineages of the genera 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> are present in our study area. These lineages have wide distributions; 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> sp. PYERY01 has been reported at many locations in the entire planet, except for Asia and the Antarctica [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>]. On the other hand, 
  <span class="italic">Parahaemoproteus</span> sp. ICTLEU01 has been registered only at the American continent, specifically in North America, and at the Galapagos [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>]. Similarly, 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> sp. MOLATE01 has been reported only at some places in the USA infecting brown-headed cowbirds (
  <span class="italic">Molothrus ater</span>) and house finches [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>]. We found this lineage infecting a new host, the canyon towhee. 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> sp. SISKIN1 is the most widespread lineage we found. It has been recorded in Lithuania, New York, California, Alaska, Russia and the Czech Republic, in a variety of hosts including 
  <span class="italic">Carduelis spinus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Loxia curvirostra</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Haemorhous mexicanus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Passer domesticus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Carpodacus erythrinus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Carduelis pinus</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>]. Since all these lineages are widely distributed, future investigations should aim at determining the role that both resident and migrant species play in the infectious process in this region.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The similarity analysis showed that two of the sequences obtained had a difference of eight nucleotides compared to the sequence of the closest lineage (
  <span class="italic">Parahaemoproteus</span> ICTLEU01), and more differences regarding 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> lineages. According to Bensch et al. lineage delimitation criteria [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>], this result suggests the presence of a lineage that has not been previously reported. Therefore, our results contribute to the knowledge of intraspecific diversity of these parasites.
