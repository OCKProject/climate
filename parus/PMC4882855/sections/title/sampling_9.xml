 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the non-breeding (August to November) season of 2012, and during the reproductive (March to May) and non-breeding (September to November) seasons of 2013, birds were captured in each of the nine sampling sites. For this purpose, twenty 2.5 × 12 m ornithological mist nets were placed at random locations in each sampling site with the following restrictions: nets should be located at no less than 300 m from all habitat edges in order to avoid possible edge effects, all nets could be revised by one person in a period of 15 to 20 min, and no two nets would be located facing each other. This allowed us to revise nets quickly in order to avoid injuries to birds, and to maintain independence among nets. From each individual of
