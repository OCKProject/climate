  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study area is located between the municipalities of Charcas and Catorce, in the Mexican state of San Luis Potosi. Three communal-owned areas (ejidos) were included in the study: La Cardoncita (LC), Presa de Santa Gertrudis (PSG), and Guadalupe Victoria (GV) (UTM: E271793.37 N2610708.64, E278059.47 N2599525.12, E276057.75 N2582923.98 Zone 14 N). All study sites were embedded in a region known as “Zona Ixtlera” (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), where trees of the genus 
   <span class="italic">Yucca</span> have been historically extracted to obtain fiber, locally known as “Ixtle”, which is used for manufacture of ropes and other crafts. The vegetation in the area is characterized by the presence of rosette microphylous scrublands dominated by 
   <span class="italic">Yucca</span> spp. in the tree layer, and 
   <span class="italic">Larrea tridentata</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Flourensia cernua</span> in the shrub layer [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>]. A high diversity of species from the family Cactaceae is also present. The area contains gentle slopes and low mountains that facilitate storm water runoff to the lowlands. Annual rainfall averages 350 mm, and annual average temperature ranges from 10 to 20 °C [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>,

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the early 1930’s, a large portion of the expropriated land within the Mexican territory was given to local communities, and thus tenure in these lands was established in the “ejido” scheme. At this time, regional economies incentivized 
   <span class="italic">Yucca</span> extraction for “Ixtle” production. Overgrazing was also established as an additional form of local economic subsistence. Because these economic activities continue to date, shrubland habitat degradation through the growth of villages, extraction of tree species, and overgrazing in their surrounding still prevail, thus creating a habitat gradient consisting of at least the following habitat types [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]: (i) “Isotal”, thereafter moderately degraded shrublands, where grazing and tree extraction is moderate; (ii) microphylous shrublands dominated by creosote bush in which the tree layer has been eliminated and intense goat grazing is ongoing, thereafter highly degraded shrublands; and (iii) villages where the natural vegetation has been almost completely removed and substituted by houses and unpaved roads. Three sampling sites representative of these levels of habitat degradation were established in each ejido. In each study site, bird communities were surveyed, and blood samples from birds were taken according to the methods described below.

For this purpose, twenty 2.5 × 12 m ornithological mist nets were placed at random locations in each sampling site with the following restrictions: nets should be located at no less than 300 m from all habitat edges in order to avoid possible edge effects, all nets could be revised by one person in a period of 15 to 20 min, and no two nets would be located facing each other. This allowed us to revise nets quickly in order to avoid injuries to birds, and to maintain independence among nets. From each individual of

Similarity between the obtained and the previously known sequences were determined through a Neighbor Joining (NJ) analysis. Evolutionary distances between sequences were calculated using the three-parameter model of Tamura, specifying the distribution of rate variation among sites γ = 0.263. To construct the cladogram, 1000 replicates were used in a bootstrap test to calculate the percentage of association between taxa. All these analyses were conducted in MEGA version 6 [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each bird species, we fitted a series of Generalized Linear Models (GLM’s) to assess the effects of factors influencing parasitemia including habitat degradation [

For the canyon towhee we did not consider a model containing bird body condition as the only explanatory variable because the algorithm failed to converge, presumably due to the relatively small sample size. We did not include a multiplicative model containing habitat degradation and distance from water bodies for any of the studied species because results of an exploratory analysis indicated that there was autocorrelation between these two explanatory variables (one way ANOVA, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.01), presumably because distance from water bodies tends to increase with increasing distance from villages. Therefore, distance from water bodies is smallest at villages, intermediate at highly degraded shrublands, and highest at moderately degraded shrublands. It is recommended that whenever two explanatory variables are autocorrelated, one of these variables should be dropped from the model [

Finally, we used weighted parameter estimates and weighted standard errors to construct graphs depicting the response in parasitemia to the variables that were present in the best-supported model and those receiving equivalent support from the data as the best-supported model (ΔAICc ≤ 2).
