 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Microscopy analysis revealed the presence of haemosporidian parasites in samples of two bird species, house finches and canyon towhees, whereas in cactus wren samples, only normal erythrocytes were observed. As is typical of the life-cycle of 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> spp., the asexual stages of these parasites, microgametocytes and macrogametocytes, within erythrocytes from infected birds were observed in most of our samples (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). On the other hand, no meronts of 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> were detected in red blood cells, but the presence of 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> was evidenced by PCR amplification in two birds. Haemosporidian prevalence was 47.5 % for the canyon towhee, and 44.3 % for the house finch (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, molecular diagnosis results matched those obtained from microscopy. However, the PCR amplification yielded six false negatives, four of which might be related to low concentration of parasite DNA that was corroborated through microscopy which yielded &lt; 16 parasitized erythrocytes. Two other false negatives yielding somewhat less moderate parasitemia, consisting of 161 and 280 infected erythrocytes, respectively, were found and might be related to contamination or presence of inhibitors in the PCR reactions in spite of the fact that analyses were conducted using three replicates. Additionally, PCR amplification and sequencing of the DNA fragments of the parasites did not show cases of co-infection, but these were detected with microscopy examination in one of the house finch samples which revealed two cells infected with 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> and eleven with 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span>. The estimated prevalence of infection did not differ between the two species with positive cases (

  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.001, 
  <span class="italic">df</span> = 1,
