 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The amplicon sequencing revealed that in the study area house finches and canyon towhees get infected by at least three different lineages of the genus 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span>. One lineage of the genus 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> was detected in only one sample of each bird species, whilst two sequences from canyon towhee samples differ in eight nucleotides from the reference sequences. According to the method for delimiting lineages published by Bensch et al

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>] these sequences represent a lineage that has not been previously reported. This was indeed corroborated as a new lineage by MalAvi (mbio-serv2.mbioekol.lu.se/Malavi/). The new lineage was designated as MELFUS01. Therefore the sequences belonging to this lineage are in a separate clade based on the similarity between sequences (Fig.
