 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within‚Äêyear variations in body mass</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mean body mass was calculated for each species, age class, and month to show seasonal trends in absolute body mass. A 
  <span class="italic">t</span> test was performed for each species to determine the difference in mean annual body mass between adults and juveniles. Additionally, birds with ages coded as 3 or 5 under the BTO ringing scheme were separated from each other during this analysis to demonstrate changes in juvenile mass from fledging to adulthood. Great tits show pronounced sexual dimorphism and were therefore also separated by sex (134,442 female records and 149,666 male records, with 34,643 unsexed or inconsistently sexed records removed from the analysis) to identify differences in seasonal body mass patterns between males and females.
