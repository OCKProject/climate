 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is strong evidence indicating that the mean body mass of bird populations can change over periods of a few years (Gosler, 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0007">2002</a>; Gosler, Greenwood, &amp; Perrins, 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0008">1995</a>; Price, Grant, Gibbs, &amp; Boag, 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0025">1984</a>), as well as fluctuating from day to day (Broggi, Koivula, Hohtela, &amp; Orell, 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0006">2017</a>; Newton, 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0019">1969</a>). One mechanism responsible for these changes involves the deposition of more body fat in colder weather, as insulation and insurance against reduced and unpredictable food availability (Krams et al., 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0010">2010</a>; Newton, 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0019">1969</a>, 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0021">1998</a>). Another may be the deposition of more fat under conditions of greater disease risk, in order to buffer against reduced foraging efficiency as a result of disease (Speakman, 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0028">2018</a>). However, these benefits come at a cost, because increased mass leads to decreased maneuvrability and therefore increased predation risk (McNamara &amp; Houston, 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0016">1990</a>). Consequently, birds will maintain smaller fat reserves when predators are abundant than when predators are scare (Lilliendahl, 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0013">1997</a>). Climate change associated with increasing winter temperatures (Jenkins, Perry, &amp; Prior, 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0009">2008</a>) may thus be expected to lead to a reduction in body mass in small birds, because the trade‐off between higher body mass to compensate for cold‐weather‐induced starvation and lower body mass to reduce predation risk will shift away from starvation. There is also strong evidence to suggest that both natural selection (Bosse et al., 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0005">2017</a>) and adaptive phenotypic plasticity (Gosler et al., 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0008">1995</a>) can cause bird phenotypes to change over periods of only a few years.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Blue tits 
  <span class="italic">Cyanistes caeruleus</span>, great tits 
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>, and coal tits 
  <span class="italic">Periparus ater</span> throughout Britain and Ireland make extensive use of garden bird‐feeders and are major prey items of sparrowhawks 
  <span class="italic">Accipiter nisus</span> (Perrins, 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0022">1979</a>). It is therefore reasonable to expect that all three species could be affected similarly by changes in climate, predation risk, and other factors such as supplementary feeding practices, which have been shown to affect the phenotypes of garden birds (Plummer, Bearhop, Leech, Chamberlain, &amp; Blount, 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0023">2018</a>). Because small bird species in temperate climates rely on temperature as a cue for regulating body mass (Newton, 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0019">1969</a>), anthropogenic increases in the mean winter temperature are likely to lead to predictable decreases in mean winter body mass in small birds. However, these changes may be quite small and long term, and therefore not easy to observe without access to large datasets.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sparrowhawk abundance in Britain was severely reduced by organochlorine pesticide poisoning in the 1960s (Newton, 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0020">1986</a>); however, the population recovered rapidly after the regulation of these pesticides and has since plateaued (Robinson et al., 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0027">2016</a>). This recovery coincided with a significant drop in body mass among great tits, which occurred in specific regions at the same time as sparrowhawk populations recovered in those regions (Gosler et al., 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0008">1995</a>). Increases in sparrowhawk abundance across Britain might therefore also be expected to coincide with a decrease in body mass of tits.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Supplementary feeding of garden birds has increased in recent decades, with notable effects on the ecologies of some species, such as the Eurasian blackcap 
  <span class="italic">Sylvia atricapilla</span> (Plummer, Siriwardena, Conway, Risely, &amp; Toms, 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0024">2015</a>). Supplementary feeding increases food availability and predictability, especially in winter, and would therefore be expected to lead small birds such as tits to downregulate their winter fat deposits, thus reducing their winter body mass.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we used the huge long‐term datasets generated by citizen science bird ringing in Britain and Ireland to analyze seasonal and long‐term changes in mean adult and juvenile body masses in three abundant tit populations (blue tits, great tits, and coal tits) and correlated these with published, UK‐wide sparrowhawk abundances and publicly available temperature data, to determine the possible mechanisms responsible for these changes in body mass. We also examined long‐term variations in the wing lengths of these birds to test the hypothesis that changes in body mass may be accompanied by compensatory changes in wing length.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results confirm that phenotypes of bird populations can be affected by anthropogenic factors over a relatively short time period, with potentially important ecological implications in light of predicted climatic change. Furthermore, these results demonstrate the value of citizen science in generating such large datasets for analzsing long‐term population changes.</p>
