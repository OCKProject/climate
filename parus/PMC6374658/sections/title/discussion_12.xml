 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study demonstrates that multiple garden bird species have undergone a slow but steady decrease in body mass and wing length over the past 60 years, which is associated with increasing winter temperatures and predator abundance.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In terms of within‐year variation, all three investigated species displayed similar patterns of annual body mass change, suggesting that they were all likely to be affected by the same factors. Furthermore, it seems likely that the sexual dimorphism in annual body mass change apparent in great tits would apply in all three species, given that the April/May peak in female body mass can be attributed to egg production (Perrins, 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0022">1979</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding longer‐term changes, body mass decreased only in the winter months in all three species and both age classes. Some of this change may be accounted for by change in the mean capture times of birds. However, much of it is not. There are several possible explanations for this unexplained change. Temperatures are currently increasing across Britain due to global warming (Jenkins et al., 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0009">2008</a>), and the energy‐storage benefit of body fat to birds during the winter may thus be decreasing, leading to a lower optimal winter body mass in response to constant predation risk. The current analysis showed that winter temperature had a strong effect on body mass in all three species, with birds being lighter in warmer winters, which supports this hypothesis.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Optimal body mass could also be reduced by increased predation pressure (Gosler et al., 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0008">1995</a>), even in the absence of changes in temperature. However, the sparrowhawk is one of the main predators of all three tit species (Perrins, 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0022">1979</a>), and sparrowhawk abundance in Britain plateaued in the 1990s (Robinson et al., 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0027">2016</a>), when the population recovered from the negative effects of the pesticide DDT after its use was banned in Britain in 1984 (Newton, 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0020">1986</a>). Furthermore, increasing predator abundance cannot explain why prey body mass would only decrease in winter, given that although passerine food availability is likely to vary with season, their predators must hunt at all times of the year.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, increasing levels of human supplementary feeding of garden bird species across Britain (Plummer et al., 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0024">2015</a>) may also reduce the energy‐storage benefit of body fat to birds during the winter by increasing the reliability of food availability, which may also lead to a reduction in optimal body mass in response to constant predation risk. We also demonstrated a relationship between winter body mass and calendar year that was independent of the effect of winter temperature or sparrowhawk abundance, suggesting that a long‐term increase in supplementary feeding of garden birds (Plummer et al., 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0024">2015</a>) may also have influenced the trade‐off between starvation risk and predation risk.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies showed that great tits have undergone an evolutionary change in bill morphology in response to human supplementary feeding (Bosse et al., 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0005">2017</a>), and that populations are often locally adapted to climate, even on quite small scales (Morrison, Robinson, &amp; Pearce‐Higgins, 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0018">2016</a>). It is now well known that human activities impose sufficient selection pressures on some wild species to allow evolution on directly observable timescales (Allendorf, England, Luikart, Ritchie, &amp; Ryman, 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0001">2008</a>). Short‐timescale evolution could thus be responsible for the observed changes in other aspects of tit morphology. However, it is also possible that the changes observed here are attributable to individuals’ plastic regulation of their body mass in response to changing environmental conditions (Gosler et al., 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0008">1995</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wing length is under genetic control (Lessells &amp; Ovenden, 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0012">1989</a>), and long‐term changes in mean population wing lengths could thus be the result of evolution. For any individual bird, wing length changes over the course of a year are predictable and are caused by a combination of feather wear at the wingtips (Vágási, Pap, Tökölyi, Székely, &amp; Barta, 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0029">2011</a>) and molting. Although wing length is unlikely to be influenced by daily or even monthly plastic regulation, it could theoretically be influenced by yearly plastic regulation if the physical properties of the feathers change adaptively during molting to optimize them for the environment in which the bird “predicts”; it is likely to exist in the coming year. However, there is currently no evidence for such a process and therefore we suggest that the observed reduction in wing length in all three species is the result of short‐timescale evolution.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The observed reduction in wing length in all the investigated species is likely to represent a response to the reduced optimal body mass, given that individuals with larger mass require longer wings to maintain their wing loading (Andrews, Mackenzie, &amp; Gregory, 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0002">2009</a>). Although the reduction in body mass was only evident in the winter, individuals cannot manipulate their wing length physiologically to the same degree as their body mass, and wing length should thus be optimized to the mean body mass throughout the year, or to a weighted mean if selection on wing length is more intense at certain times of year than at others. Mean population wing length may thus be expected to decrease significantly from year to year in response to changes in body mass, as shown by our data, even in months when the mean population body mass does not decrease.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The linear model used to determine the factors influencing body mass was somewhat crude, in that the temperature and sparrowhawk abundance predictor variables were averaged over large areas and may therefore not always be correct for the individual birds in the sample (which will be affected by local temperatures and predator abundances). However, the use of sparrowhawk abundance data from England was justified given that most of the birds (812,252 of 933,024 captures) in the analysis were recorded in England.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of the model supported existing theories very well: higher temperatures and higher sparrowhawk abundances decreased the mean body masses of the birds, presumably by reducing the benefits of fat as an energy‐storage medium or by increasing the cost of fat in terms of predation risk, respectively (McNamara &amp; Houston, 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0016">1990</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is possible that the significant decrease in bird body mass over time independent of temperature or sparrowhawk abundance may be an artifact resulting from the coarse scales of the measurements of temperature and sparrowhawk abundance. However, it is also possible that the decrease may be at least partly due to other variables, such as the level of supplementary feeding, which has been increasing in Britain and Ireland (Plummer et al., 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0024">2015</a>) and which provides a reliable winter food source for many passerine species, reducing the benefits of additional body fat for energy storage and therefore reducing their optimal winter body mass.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The interaction terms including an effect of year indicated a decline in the magnitudes of the effects of both temperature and sparrowhawk abundance over time. The interaction between sparrowhawk abundance and temperature indicated that an increase in one increased the magnitude of the effect of the other. This also supports existing theories: fat gain represents a trade‐off between predation risk and energy storage (Krams et al., 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0010">2010</a>; McNamara &amp; Houston, 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0016">1990</a>; Newton, 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0019">1969</a>, 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0021">1998</a>). Consequently, when the costs of fat gain (in terms of increased predation risk) are very low (e.g., because sparrowhawk abundance is low), there is less pressure to maintain a low body mass when possible (e.g., at higher temperatures where energy reserves are less important), and body mass would thus be predicted to respond less to temperature when sparrowhawk abundance is low, as observed.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study was limited by the coarse scale of measurement of data. Consequently, our findings warrant further detailed research to examine the effects of climate change at smaller scales, and to clarify the effects of other potential factors that could affect optimal body mass in birds, such as levels of supplementary feeding. Some proportion of the observed change in bird body mass over time also appears to be accounted for by a change in the timing of bird capture, with captures becoming, on average, earlier in the day in more recent years. This can be regarded as an artifact. Further studies are also needed to determine to what degree the observed pattern is reflected in other countries and ringing schemes, and in bird species less dependent on garden feeders in winter.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Large, pre‐existing datasets are an underutilized resource in ecology, and with some exceptions (McLean, Jeugd, &amp; Pol, 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0015">2018</a>) are rarely exploited to their full potential. The current study demonstrates the ability of data, gathered with no specific hypotheses in mind, to test specific hypotheses. Our results using such a dataset provide the first evidence for significant declines in the winter body masses of three common garden bird species throughout Britain and Ireland over the last 50 years, with annual variations correlated with climate warming. Such trends are thus liable to persist if winters continue to become warmer due to climate change, and studies in other taxa have demonstrated the potential for changes in population mean body mass to influence ecosystem functioning (Audzijonyte, Kuparinen, &amp; Fulton, 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0003">2014</a>) and life histories (Kuparinen &amp; Hutchings, 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0011">2012</a>). Consequently, our results represent an important point of consideration for conservation and future ecological studies.
