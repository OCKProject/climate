 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A linear model was produced to identify the mechanisms responsible for the observed long‐term trends in body mass. Each body mass record was transformed into a standard deviation from the mean mass for that species and age class to allow standardized comparisons between groups. Temperatures and sparrowhawk abundances were also standardized. Based on visual similarity between the December and January datasets and among the three study species, data from all three species and both age classes in December and January were then pooled to produce a midwinter dataset, making the assumption that approximately the same pressures would be acting on each age class and species. A linear model was then fitted to determine the effects of year of capture (centered on the year 2000), mean monthly UK temperature in the year of capture (MET Office, 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0017">2018</a>), and an index of sparrowhawk abundance in England in the year of capture (Robinson et al., 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0027">2016</a>) on the standardized mass of the captured individuals. All variables were added both separately and as pairwise interactions, and the “dredge” function (Bartoń, 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0004">2018</a>) was used to compare models to determine which model had the strongest Akaike information criterion (AIC) support. The three‐way interaction between all variables was not included, as it is difficult to justify biologically.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although wing length is likely to have a major impact on individual body mass (because wing length acts as a proxy for body size, and larger birds are typically heavier; Gosler et al., 
  <a rid="ece34812-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34812-bib-0008">1995</a>), wing length was omitted from this model because mean population wing length is liable to change over time in response to changing wing‐loading demands driven by changes in body mass. Consequently, inclusion of wing length in the model would be liable to mask the effects of other factors on bird body mass.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sparrowhawk abundance indices were not available after January 2015 or before December 1974, and birds from years outside these bounds were therefore excluded from the model. Sparrowhawk abundance was recorded in the summer, and winter indices were therefore approximated by interpolating between adjacent summer measurements.</p>
