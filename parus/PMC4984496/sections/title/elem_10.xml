 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study pointed out a large diversity of bird species and guild responses to edges, even among species or guilds with the same general habitat requirements (i.e., forest or open‐habitat species). We actually found different types of species responses along the habitat gradient at both sides of forest edges. Forest edges appeared as important habitats in terms of conservation value, as a consequence of higher total abundance and species richness in bird assemblages using this habitat as well as higher occurrence of sensitive species exhibiting particular traits (insectivore and cavity‐nesting species). These results support the hypothesis of higher availability of resources in forest‐open habitat edges (Ries et al.

  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0054">2015</a>). Forest edges should thus be considered keystone habitats, providing bird‐related ecosystem services (predation) in mosaic landscapes (González‐Gómez et al.

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both habitat structure and floristic composition are important to explain the distribution of birds across forest‐open habitat edges. Bird communities appear to respond to a complex of forest habitat attributes, including growth stage and the structure and composition of understorey vegetation (Hewson et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0037">2011</a>). As a consequence, higher abundance of breeding birds in forest edges could be linked to differences in small‐scale vegetation composition and structure affecting prey abundance and foraging efficiency (Van Wilgenburg et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0059">2001</a>; González‐Gómez et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0031">2006</a>). Ouin et al. (
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0047">2015</a>), studying the same forest edges in the Midi‐Pyrénées site, showed that forest edges support a higher density of tree microhabitats (TMH thereafter) than forest interior, particularly because of the presence of larger trees at forest edges. They also confirmed that some TMH types were more abundant in forest edges, such as bark loss patches, cracks, sap runs, and epiphytes. These TMH are known to provide suitable habitat for many species (Bouget et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0013">2014</a>). Forest edges, with higher TMH density and higher vegetation complexity (e.g., higher shrub cover and higher richness and diversity of vascular plants; Alignier et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0002">2014</a>) are likely providing birds with more foraging and nest sites (Ouin et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0047">2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results thus support the hypothesis that forest edges are important habitats for breeding birds in longstanding man‐made landscapes. Indeed, bird species richness and total abundance were higher at interior forest edges than at any other habitat type, although there was high inter‐regional variation. Moreover, species with less favorable conservation status had higher abundance at forest edges, as suggested by higher values of conservation index in this habitat. Additionally, the positive effect of forest edges on bird species richness and total abundance mainly resulted from the addition of species from both sides of the edge (and particularly from forest habitats) as very few species were true edge‐specialists in this study (see Imbeau et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0038">2003</a>). Even if results were statistically significant for only two species (blue and long‐tailed tits), two other forest species − great tit and nuthatch − followed this pattern of increased abundance at forest edges. These species are characterized by an insectivorous diet and nest located either in tree cavities or within shrubs, further supporting the role of higher habitat complexity in shaping local bird distribution (Brotons and Herrando 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0015">2003</a>; Balestrieri et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0005">2015</a>). Higher prey availability and more abundant tree cavities in more complexly structured forest edges than forest interiors, are factors potentially explaining the observed pattern (Van Wilgenburg et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0059">2001</a>; Laiolo and Rolando 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0043">2005</a>; Ouin et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0047">2015</a>), as well as the noticeable increase in avian insectivory observed in manipulative experiments (Barbaro et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0007">2012</a>; Bereczki et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0010">2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our study, there was an important variation in the magnitude of edge effect between regions. The positive edge effect on abundance and species richness was observed in two regions, in Midi‐Pyrénées and Centre, but this was not the case in the Aquitaine region. This pattern is probably linked to inter‐regional variation in forest composition, edge contrast, and adjacent habitat management. In Aquitaine, forest stands were composed of homogeneous pine plantations with sharp edges, i.e., limited presence of broadleaved understorey (van Halder et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0033">2011</a>). This homogeneous structure in pine plantations resulted in low contrast between interior edges and interior forests, probably explaining the lack of positive bird responses to edges in this region (Ries et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0053">2004</a>). The lower abundance of bird species showing a positive response to forest edges in coniferous forests compared to broadleaved stands could also explain this pattern (Barbaro and van Halder 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0006">2009</a>). Actually, forests in the two other regions were principally composed of broadleaved species, less intensively managed and with softer edges (Roume et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0057">2011</a>), which could explain their higher selection by foraging forest birds (Brotons and Herrando 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0015">2003</a>; Bereczki et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0010">2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results also suggest a possible negative edge effect for six bird species since the abundance of these species was higher in interior forests (Flaspohler et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0028">2001</a>; Ewers and Didham 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0025">2006a</a>). In this study, woodpigeon, common cuckoo, and song thrush were all in this case. Interestingly, these three species are typically associated with heterogeneous landscapes mixing open habitats and woodlands (Inglis et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0039">1994</a>; Bellamy et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0009">2003</a>; Peach et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0049">2004</a>; Paquet et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0048">2006</a>). These species are thus likely examples of habitat complementation (Dunning et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0024">1992</a>), with birds selecting interior forest habitats for breeding and adjacent open habitats to forests for foraging, like for example the hoopoe 
  <span class="italic">Upupa epops</span> or the mistle thrush 
  <span class="italic">Turdus viscivorus</span> (Barbaro and van Halder 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0006">2009</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The absence of interior forest specialist species in our dataset, such as the middle spotted woodpecker (
  <span class="italic">Dendrocops medius</span>), may be related to the small size of the selected forest patches, particularly in Midi‐Pyrénées and Centre regions but may also reflect an edge avoidance extending beyond 75 m (the maximum distance in our case) in the most sensitive birds. Therefore, it would be valuable to repeat this study in other regions enabling the selection of larger forest patches in order to decipher how long‐distance edge effects influence sensitive forest species in forest landscapes with less anthropogenic footprint.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Forest edge avoidance in grassland species has been documented in other European farmland regions (Reino et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0051">2009</a>) resulting from increased nest predation near edges due to changes in vegetation structure affecting nest conspicuousness and predator foraging behavior (Chalfoun et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0018">2002</a>). Our results highlighted that open‐habitat communities were the most specialized in terms of habitat (Devictor et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0021">2010</a>). This suggests that open‐habitat species could be negatively affected by the fragmentation of open habitats by forested patches in mosaic landscapes (Archaux and Martin 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0003">2009</a>). Particularly, two species restricted to open habitats (stonechat and tawny pipit) showed negative responses to forest edges in terms of abundance. Forest edges can also be associated with higher predation risks for adult birds, and the negative selection of open habitats near edges by conspicuous singing birds during the breeding period could be explained by this spatial variation in predation risk. Forest edge avoidance could alternatively result from the evolutionary history of grassland birds in meadows and steppes with virtually no trees, which resulted in a strong aversion to less familiar features (Fletcher 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0029">2005</a>; Rodewald and Vitz 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0056">2005</a>; Reino et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0051">2009</a>). This could be the case for the tawny pipit, a typical open habitat specialist. By contrast, the stonechat is often associated to shrubland areas interspersed with trees, and this species has been showed to positively respond to forest edges in Portuguese farmland (Reino et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0051">2009</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Implications for conservation</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Globally, bird response to edge was either species‐ or guild‐specific but our results provided evidence that forest edges in fragmented landscapes can be important habitats for generalist forest birds as well as for some specialist edge and interior forest species (Imbeau et al. 
   <a rid="ece32273-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0038">2003</a>). However, further research is required to investigate whether higher bird densities (corresponding to individual birds singing) at edges are also paralleled by higher fitness parameters (breeding success, survival) inducing spatial variation in population dynamics. For example, higher nest predation rates at edges could result in lower breeding success for songbirds, as already shown in other studies (Flaspohler et al. 
   <a rid="ece32273-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0028">2001</a>). Our results confirmed that forest edges are valuable for conserving and even enhancing biodiversity in managed, fragmented landscapes, by increasing local habitat heterogeneity and mitigating the effects of landscape homogenization linked to modern forestry practices (Dolman et al. 
   <a rid="ece32273-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0022">2007</a>). Combined with negative factors in African wintering areas for migratory birds, changes in temperate forest structure and composition are thought to be responsible for the decline in common woodland birds in Europe (Gregory et al. 
   <a rid="ece32273-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0032">2007</a>; Vickery et al. 
   <a rid="ece32273-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0061">2014</a>). Moreover, forest edges are not only important habitats for breeding birds but they are also extensively used by migratory passerine birds during stopovers (Keller et al. 
   <a rid="ece32273-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0042">2009</a>). Refuelling in high‐quality stopover stations is critical for migratory birds, as low body condition during this phase of the annual cycle can increase mortality (Rodewald and Brittingham 
   <a rid="ece32273-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0055">2004</a>). Higher avian predation rates on invertebrates have been actually recorded experimentally at forest edges in fragmented landscapes, suggesting that prey availability and accessibility may be much higher at edges compared to forest interiors (González‐Gómez et al. 
   <a rid="ece32273-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0031">2006</a>; Barbaro et al. 
   <a rid="ece32273-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0007">2012</a>; Bereczki et al. 
   <a rid="ece32273-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0010">2015</a>). The loss of favorable stopover sites linked to current land‐use changes in European landscapes has been proposed as one of the factors related to the long‐term population decline in Afro‐Palearctic migrant birds (Sanderson et al. 
   <a rid="ece32273-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0058">2006</a>; Gregory et al. 
   <a rid="ece32273-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0032">2007</a>; Vickery et al. 
   <a rid="ece32273-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0061">2014</a>), pointing out the conservation value of forest edge habitats for stopover insectivore migrants. A better integration between forestry practices and optimal management of forest edges is thus needed, including complex understorey structures at forest edges, a measure potentially highly beneficial to a large range of forest bird species but also to various insect taxa such as butterflies (van Halder et al. 
   <a rid="ece32273-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0033">2011</a>). Finally, our results also provide evidence that seminatural open habitats are important habitats for some specialist species with high conservation value in our study sites. Because some of these open habitat species exhibited negative responses to forest edges, landscape planning should aim at increasing the area of open patches in forested landscapes. This may provide both habitat for the persistence of these species and corridors enhancing dispersal toward extensive intact open habitats, particularly in continuous forest plantations.
