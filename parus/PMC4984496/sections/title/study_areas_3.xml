 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study was conducted in three regions of France: two in the south‐west (Aquitaine and Midi‐Pyrénées) and one in central France (Centre‐Val de Loire) during spring of 2011 (see Fig. 
  <a rid="ece32273-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece32273-fig-0001">1</a>). In Aquitaine, almost one million hectares of maritime pines 
  <span class="italic">Pinus pinaster</span> have been planted since the 19th century representing the largest plantation forest in Europe, where landscape is dominated by a mosaic of maritime pine plantations of different ages, clear‐cuts and herbaceous firebreaks. Firebreaks were created in order to minimize the risks associated to large fires, providing an interesting case to study the complex response of bird communities to sharp edges in a mosaic forest landscape. The climate is thermo‐Atlantic (mean annual temperature 12°C, mean annual rainfall 700 mm) and the elevation is low (c. 50 m a.s.l.). The study area in Midi‐Pyrénées (Haute‐Garonne district) is a temperate agro‐forested landscape, characterized by edges between broadleaved forest patches and agricultural land that present a sharp contrast as a result of regular management by farmers. Forest edges are quantitatively important because of the high number of small woodlots, dominated by oaks, 
  <span class="italic">Quercus robur</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Q. pubescens,</span> with total forest covering approximately 15% of total area. The region is hilly (250–400 m a.s.l.) and has a sub‐Atlantic climate with slight mountainous and Mediterranean influences (mean annual temperature 12.5°C; mean annual precipitation 750 mm). The study area in the Centre region encompassed two distinct subareas located ca. 75 km from each other, in the Loiret and Cher districts. The area is mostly dedicated to intensive crop (Loiret) and crop and apple production (Cher). Small deciduous forest fragments still persist on poorest soils, representing ca 18% of the total area. Most are oak‐hornbeam coppice‐with‐standards and used for timber and fuel wood production, presenting sharp edges with adjacent crop areas (see Appendix S1). Climate is sub‐Atlantic with some continental influence (mean annual temperature 11.3°C, mean annual precipitation 740 mm). The region is flat with mean elevation around 140 m (Loiret) and 225 m a.s.l. (Cher). Most of the forest edges in the Centre region were regularly managed with tractor‐mounted hedge trimmers to limit forest canopy growth over the fields. Trees in forest interiors are typically cut every 15–20 years.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bird sampling was carried out on 80 sites as follows: 33 sites in Aquitaine, 26 sites in Midi‐Pyrénées and 21 sites in Centre region. In each region, we selected forest patches representative of the dominant forest habitat types. Degraded and small forest patches, with low, irregular forest cover were discarded because they were not representative of the forest stands present in the three regions. Edges too close to each other were also discarded to avoid multiple edge effects (as a potential source of bias, see Fletcher 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0029">2005</a>). In each region, we selected half of forest patches adjacent to ploughed open habitats (oilseed rape fields in Midi‐Pyrénées and Centre and corn/buckwheat fields in Aquitaine) and the other half adjacent to unploughed open habitats (permanent grasslands in Midi‐Pyrénées and Aquitaine and apple orchards in Centre). In the Aquitaine region, study sites also included coastal pine forests adjacent to gray dune vegetation and interior pine forests adjacent to herbaceous firebreaks (ploughed or unploughed grasslands). There was no difference in habitat structure between coastal and interior pine plantations.
