 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bird communities were sampled in three 100 m‐long and 50 m‐wide linear transects parallel to the forest edge, within three habitat types (forests, edges and open habitats). The transects were divided into six 100 m‐long and 25 m‐wide habitat strips (interior forest, exterior forest, interior edge, exterior edge, interior open habitat and exterior open habitat, see Fig. 
  <a rid="ece32273-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece32273-fig-0002">2</a>). Linear transects were preferred over point counts because transects are less prone to bias due to bird movements and can be used for low bird densities (Bibby et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0011">2000</a>; Buckland 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0016">2006</a>). Bird sampling was carried out by experienced observers walking along transects and locating, all birds seen or heard within the 25 m‐wide strips, except when clearly over‐flying the observer (migratory birds, raptors, swifts and swallows). Observers walked slowly enough to maximize the number of birds they encountered without risking double counting. Moving birds sighted while walking along the transect were given the location at first detection. Bird sampling was conducted twice (April and May) in the breeding season of 2011 (same period of time in the three regions), from 7:00 to 11:00 am, when birds are most active, and poor weather conditions were avoided (rain, strong wind or fog). For further data analysis, we used the maximum number of individuals recorded per species over the two visits.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used a sampling design that allowed accounting for distance to the forest edge while minimizing the variation in species detectability within the edge. A distance of 25 m is actually considered as a distance allowing an optimal detectability (probability of detection by the observer close to 1) for most forest passerines (Brotons and Herrando 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0015">2003</a>). Several studies on the depth of edge influence (DEI) have shown that edge effects do not penetrate further than 50 m for various taxa, including plants or insects (Harper and Macdonald 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0034">2001</a>; Heliolä et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0036">2001</a>; Magura 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0045">2002</a>; Harper et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0035">2005</a>; Roume et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0057">2011</a> and references therein). Although the width of edge effect reported for birds can be deeper than 50 m, it rarely exceeds 70–80 m except for some interior specialist species or guilds that do not occur within our study sites located in longstanding fragmented temperate landscapes (Restrepo and Gómez 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0052">1998</a>; Brand and George 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0014">2001</a>; Fletcher 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0029">2005</a>). Bird sampling was therefore designed according to previous studies that had demonstrated that 50 m was a recurrent threshold of approximate edge influence for both forest vegetation and birds, including avian foraging activity and insectivory levels (Baker et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0004">2002</a>; Harper et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0035">2005</a>; Rodewald and Vitz 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0056">2005</a>; Barbaro et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0007">2012</a>; Bereczki et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0010">2015</a>). Moreover, this distance was compatible with the radius width of 25 m used for bird transect counts and allowed us to sample even small woodland patches and their edges.
