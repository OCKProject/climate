 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Edge responses were analyzed with Poisson Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) to account for the lack of independence among bird counts between strips within the same site (Zuur et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0065">2009</a>). Sites were treated as random effects while region and habitat strip (i.e., a categorical variable with six modalities defined in the ‘Bird sampling design’ section) were defined as fixed effects. A two‐way interaction between these two variables was also included. We first analyzed variation in total species richness and abundance, CSI and CVI, in relation to distance from the forest interior to the exterior open habitat, in the 80 sites surveyed during this study. Second, we examined whether the edge response observed for each species also varied according to four major life‐history traits, expected to be good predictors of species response to fragmentation and of vulnerability to global change: adult diet, foraging method, migratory behavior and nest site selection (Barbaro and van Halder 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0006">2009</a>; Vetter et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0060">2011</a>). Trait data were gathered from Cramp and Simmons (
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0019">1980</a>). Species were assigned to the three main food types that constitute the majority of adult diet during the breeding season: insectivorous species, mixed‐diet of insects and seeds, and granivorous species. Foraging methods were categorized as ground probers, ground gleaners, canopy gleaners, understorey gleaners, or bark foragers. Migratory behavior distinguished resident, short‐distance migrants, early long‐distance migrants and late long‐distance migrants, and nest site selection was categorized as species nesting in tree cavities, open nest on ground, open nest in shrub and open nest in tree (Barbaro and van Halder 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0006">2009</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Preliminary analyses using IndVal method (Dufrêne and Legendre 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0023">1997</a>) were conducted to assess which of the commonest species had a higher degree of specificity and fidelity to the six habitat strips considered in this study. The 22 species, which had a maximal indicator value higher than 10%, were included in the analysis that aimed at assessing species‐specific response of birds to forest edges.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the species level, many species had null abundance in unfavorable habitats (e.g., open habitats for a forest species). To avoid zero‐inflation of species‐specific models, we therefore analyzed the variation in each species abundance in four habitats rather than six: two corresponding to the specific‐species habitat preference and two corresponding to the adjacent habitat. For example, for forest species, we analyzed their abundance variation in the two forest strips (IF and EF, 
  <span class="italic">d </span>=
  <span class="italic"> </span>0 and 25 m, Fig. 
  <a rid="ece32273-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece32273-fig-0002">2</a>) and the two edge habitat strips (IE and EE, 
  <span class="italic">d </span>=
  <span class="italic"> </span>50 and 75 m, Fig. 
  <a rid="ece32273-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece32273-fig-0002">2</a>), while for edge species, we analyzed their abundance variation in the two edge strips and in one strip of the two other adjacent habitat types (exterior forest EF and interior open habitat IO strips, 
  <span class="italic">d</span> = 25 and 100 m; Fig. 
  <a rid="ece32273-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece32273-fig-0002">2</a>). In each case, three different distance functions (see Reino et al. 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0051">2009</a>) were tested by specifying linear (t
  <sub>d1</sub> = 
  <span class="italic">d</span>), logarithmic (t
  <sub>d2</sub> = log
  <sub>10</sub> [
  <span class="italic">d </span>+
  <span class="italic"> </span>1]) and power (t
  <sub>d3</sub> = 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span>) transformations of the predictor variable, where 
  <span class="italic">d</span> is the distance from forest interior (full model: species abundance, t
  <sub>d (1,2,3)</sub>+ region; interior forest habitat set as a base in all models). We chose to consider distance as a continuous factor as it better describes the extent and magnitude of edge effects for species (Ewers and Didham 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0026">2006b</a>). We evaluated support for all models using AIC
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">c</span>
  </sub> (AIC corrected for small sample size, Akaike 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0001">1973</a>), the difference between the best model and other candidate models (ΔAIC
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">c</span>
  </sub>) and Akaike weights (
  <span class="italic">w</span>
  <sub>i</sub>), which represent relative support for each model in the set of three candidate models (‘Linear’, ‘Logarithmic’ and ‘Power’) and summed to one (Burnham and Anderson 
  <a rid="ece32273-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0017">2002</a>).
