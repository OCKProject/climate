  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study was conducted in three regions of France: two in the south‐west (Aquitaine and Midi‐Pyrénées) and one in central France (Centre‐Val de Loire) during spring of 2011 (see Fig. 
   <a rid="ece32273-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece32273-fig-0001">1</a>). In Aquitaine, almost one million hectares of maritime pines 
   <span class="italic">Pinus pinaster</span> have been planted since the 19th century representing the largest plantation forest in Europe, where landscape is dominated by a mosaic of maritime pine plantations of different ages, clear‐cuts and herbaceous firebreaks. Firebreaks were created in order to minimize the risks associated to large fires, providing an interesting case to study the complex response of bird communities to sharp edges in a mosaic forest landscape. The climate is thermo‐Atlantic (mean annual temperature 12°C, mean annual rainfall 700 mm) and the elevation is low (c. 50 m a.s.l.). The study area in Midi‐Pyrénées (Haute‐Garonne district) is a temperate agro‐forested landscape, characterized by edges between broadleaved forest patches and agricultural land that present a sharp contrast as a result of regular management by farmers. Forest edges are quantitatively important because of the high number of small woodlots, dominated by oaks, 
   <span class="italic">Quercus robur</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Q. pubescens,</span> with total forest covering approximately 15% of total area. The region is hilly (250–400 m a.s.l.) and has a sub‐Atlantic climate with slight mountainous and Mediterranean influences (mean annual temperature 12.5°C; mean annual precipitation 750 mm). The study area in the Centre region encompassed two distinct subareas located ca. 75 km from each other, in the Loiret and Cher districts. The area is mostly dedicated to intensive crop (Loiret) and crop and apple production (Cher). Small deciduous forest fragments still persist on poorest soils, representing ca 18% of the total area. Most are oak‐hornbeam coppice‐with‐standards and used for timber and fuel wood production, presenting sharp edges with adjacent crop areas (see Appendix S1). Climate is sub‐Atlantic with some continental influence (mean annual temperature 11.3°C, mean annual precipitation 740 mm). The region is flat with mean elevation around 140 m (Loiret) and 225 m a.s.l. (Cher). Most of the forest edges in the Centre region were regularly managed with tractor‐mounted hedge trimmers to limit forest canopy growth over the fields. Trees in forest interiors are typically cut every 15–20 years.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bird sampling was carried out on 80 sites as follows: 33 sites in Aquitaine, 26 sites in Midi‐Pyrénées and 21 sites in Centre region. In each region, we selected forest patches representative of the dominant forest habitat types. Degraded and small forest patches, with low, irregular forest cover were discarded because they were not representative of the forest stands present in the three regions. Edges too close to each other were also discarded to avoid multiple edge effects (as a potential source of bias, see Fletcher 
   <a rid="ece32273-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0029">2005</a>). In each region, we selected half of forest patches adjacent to ploughed open habitats (oilseed rape fields in Midi‐Pyrénées and Centre and corn/buckwheat fields in Aquitaine) and the other half adjacent to unploughed open habitats (permanent grasslands in Midi‐Pyrénées and Aquitaine and apple orchards in Centre). In the Aquitaine region, study sites also included coastal pine forests adjacent to gray dune vegetation and interior pine forests adjacent to herbaceous firebreaks (ploughed or unploughed grasslands). There was no difference in habitat structure between coastal and interior pine plantations.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bird sampling</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bird communities were sampled in three 100 m‐long and 50 m‐wide linear transects parallel to the forest edge, within three habitat types (forests, edges and open habitats). The transects were divided into six 100 m‐long and 25 m‐wide habitat strips (interior forest, exterior forest, interior edge, exterior edge, interior open habitat and exterior open habitat, see Fig. 
   <a rid="ece32273-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece32273-fig-0002">2</a>). Linear transects were preferred over point counts because transects are less prone to bias due to bird movements and can be used for low bird densities (Bibby et al. 
   <a rid="ece32273-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0011">2000</a>; Buckland 
   <a rid="ece32273-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0016">2006</a>). Bird sampling was carried out by experienced observers walking along transects and locating, all birds seen or heard within the 25 m‐wide strips, except when clearly over‐flying the observer (migratory birds, raptors, swifts and swallows). Observers walked slowly enough to maximize the number of birds they encountered without risking double counting. Moving birds sighted while walking along the transect were given the location at first detection. Bird sampling was conducted twice (April and May) in the breeding season of 2011 (same period of time in the three regions), from 7:00 to 11:00 am, when birds are most active, and poor weather conditions were avoided (rain, strong wind or fog). For further data analysis, we used the maximum number of individuals recorded per species over the two visits.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used a sampling design that allowed accounting for distance to the forest edge while minimizing the variation in species detectability within the edge. A distance of 25 m is actually considered as a distance allowing an optimal detectability (probability of detection by the observer close to 1) for most forest passerines (Brotons and Herrando 
   <a rid="ece32273-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0015">2003</a>). Several studies on the depth of edge influence (DEI) have shown that edge effects do not penetrate further than 50 m for various taxa, including plants or insects (Harper and Macdonald 
   <a rid="ece32273-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0034">2001</a>; Heliolä et al.

   <a rid="ece32273-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0057">2011</a> and references therein). Although the width of edge effect reported for birds can be deeper than 50 m, it rarely exceeds 70–80 m except for some interior specialist species or guilds that do not occur within our study sites located in longstanding fragmented temperate landscapes (Restrepo and Gómez 
   <a rid="ece32273-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0052">1998</a>; Brand and George 
   <a rid="ece32273-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0014">2001</a>; Fletcher 
   <a rid="ece32273-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0029">2005</a>). Bird sampling was therefore designed according to previous studies that had demonstrated that 50 m was a recurrent threshold of approximate edge influence for both forest vegetation and birds, including avian foraging activity and insectivory levels (Baker et al. 
   <a rid="ece32273-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0004">2002</a>; Harper et al.

   <a rid="ece32273-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0010">2015</a>). Moreover, this distance was compatible with the radius width of 25 m used for bird transect counts and allowed us to sample even small woodland patches and their edges.

   <a rid="ece32273-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0065">2009</a>). Sites were treated as random effects while region and habitat strip (i.e., a categorical variable with six modalities defined in the ‘Bird sampling design’ section) were defined as fixed effects. A two‐way interaction between these two variables was also included. We first analyzed variation in total species richness and abundance, CSI and CVI, in relation to distance from the forest interior to the exterior open habitat, in the 80 sites surveyed during this study. Second, we examined whether the edge response observed for each species also varied according to four major life‐history traits, expected to be good predictors of species response to fragmentation and of vulnerability to global change: adult diet, foraging method, migratory behavior and nest site selection (Barbaro and van Halder 
   <a rid="ece32273-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0006">2009</a>; Vetter et al.

   <a rid="ece32273-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0019">1980</a>). Species were assigned to the three main food types that constitute the majority of adult diet during the breeding season: insectivorous species, mixed‐diet of insects and seeds, and granivorous species. Foraging methods were categorized as ground probers, ground gleaners, canopy gleaners, understorey gleaners, or bark foragers. Migratory behavior distinguished resident, short‐distance migrants, early long‐distance migrants and late long‐distance migrants, and nest site selection was categorized as species nesting in tree cavities, open nest on ground, open nest in shrub and open nest in tree (Barbaro and van Halder

The 22 species, which had a maximal indicator value higher than 10%, were included in the analysis that aimed at assessing species‐specific response of birds to forest edges.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the species level, many species had null abundance in unfavorable habitats (e.g., open habitats for a forest species). To avoid zero‐inflation of species‐specific models, we therefore analyzed the variation in each species abundance in four habitats rather than six: two corresponding to the specific‐species habitat preference and two corresponding to the adjacent habitat. For example, for forest species, we analyzed their abundance variation in the two forest strips (IF and EF, 
   <span class="italic">d </span>=

   <a rid="ece32273-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0026">2006b</a>). We evaluated support for all models using AIC

   <a rid="ece32273-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32273-bib-0001">1973</a>), the difference between the best model and other candidate models (ΔAIC
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">c</span>
   </sub>) and Akaike weights (
   <span class="italic">w</span>
   <sub>i</sub>), which represent relative support for each model in the set of three candidate models (‘Linear’, ‘Logarithmic’ and ‘Power’) and summed to one (Burnham and Anderson
