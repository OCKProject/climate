  <p>Optimal (A), predicted (B), and observed (C) reaction norms of laying date against spring temperature in three consecutive periods (blue: 1973–1987; black: 1988–2001; orange: 2002–2016) in the HV great tit population. (A) The optimal laying date for each year was the caterpillar peak date minus 33 days. Lines are estimates from linear regressions, excluding 1991 (marked by an asterisk) because late frost damaged the oak leaves in that year. (B) The black and orange dashed lines are the predicted evolutionary deviation from the observed reaction norm in period 1 (solid blue line) by the end of the second (2001) and third (2016) time period, respectively, based on cumulative change due to annual selection (eq. 
   <a rid="evo13660-disp-0007" ref-type="disp-formula" href="#evo13660-disp-0007">(5b)</a>; see Methods for interpretation). (C) Observed laying dates are yearly averages (±1 SEM); solid lines and shadings are the regression lines and 95% HPDI regions from a univariate mixed‐effects model of laying date against temperature (i.e., the mean individual‐level slope).
