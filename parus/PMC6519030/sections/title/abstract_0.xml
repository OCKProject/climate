 <p>Phenotypic plasticity is an important mechanism for populations to respond to fluctuating environments, yet may be insufficient to adapt to a directionally changing environment. To study whether plasticity can evolve under current climate change, we quantified selection and genetic variation in both the elevation (RN
  <sub>E</sub>) and slope (RN
  <sub>S</sub>) of the breeding time reaction norm in a long‐term (1973–2016) study population of great tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>). The optimal RN
  <sub>E</sub> (the caterpillar biomass peak date regressed against the temperature used as cue by great tits) changed over time, whereas the optimal RN
  <sub>S</sub> did not. Concordantly, we found strong directional selection on RN
  <sub>E</sub>, but not RN
  <sub>S</sub>, of egg‐laying date in the second third of the study period; this selection subsequently waned, potentially due to increased between‐year variability in optimal laying dates. We found individual and additive genetic variation in RN
  <sub>E</sub> but, contrary to previous studies on our population, not in RN
  <sub>S</sub>. The predicted and observed evolutionary change in RN
  <sub>E</sub> was, however, marginal, due to low heritability and the sex limitation of laying date. We conclude that adaptation to climate change can only occur via micro‐evolution of RN
  <sub>E,</sub> but this will necessarily be slow and potentially hampered by increased variability in phenotypic optima.
