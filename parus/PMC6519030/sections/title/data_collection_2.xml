 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data were collected from a long‐term great tit (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) population at the Hoge Veluwe National Park (HV; 52°23′N, 05°51′E, central Netherlands). The HV population is situated within a matrix of natural habitat, facilitating dispersal from and into the study area, and has been monitored continuously since 1955. Nest boxes are provided in excess (∼400) in suitable habitat. Each breeding season from April to July, boxes are checked at least once a week to monitor the breeding activity of hole‐breeding passerines. Clutch size is noted and laying date (i.e., the date when a female's first egg of her first clutch in that season is laid) is calculated based on the number of eggs in the nest, assuming that one egg is laid per day. During the chick‐feeding phase, parents and chicks are captured at the nest box and ringed, allowing for establishing a “social” pedigree. Extra‐pair paternity in the neighboring population of Westerheide ranges from 6.5% to 12.5% of all chicks (Van Oers et al. 
  <a rid="evo13660-bib-0093" ref-type="ref" href="#evo13660-bib-0093">2008</a>), a common rate for tit species (Brommer et al. 
  <a rid="evo13660-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#evo13660-bib-0007">2010</a>) that has been found to only marginally affect the accuracy of heritability estimates when sample sizes are sufficiently large (Charmantier and Réale 
  <a rid="evo13660-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#evo13660-bib-0015">2005</a>; Firth et al. 
  <a rid="evo13660-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#evo13660-bib-0023">2015</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temperature data were retrieved as daily averages from a nearby weather station of the Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute (KNMI; Deelen station: 52°05′N, 5°87′E; 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://projects.knmi.nl/klimatologie/daggegevens/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://projects.knmi.nl/klimatologie/daggegevens/</span>). Temperature data were averaged over the period from March 11 to April 20, which is the time window yielding the strongest correlation between annual mean daily average temperature and annual mean laying date (
  <span class="italic">r</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.74). This was done using a sliding‐window approach in the “climwin” R package (Bailey and Van de Pol 
  <a rid="evo13660-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#evo13660-bib-0002">2017</a>); details of the analyses are given elsewhere (Bailey et al. in prep.). We used these mean daily average temperatures as proxies for the environmental cues great tits use to time their reproduction, which in reality is an intricate interplay between day length and changes in temperature over time (Gienapp et al. 
  <a rid="evo13660-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#evo13660-bib-0028">2005</a>; Schaper et al. 
  <a rid="evo13660-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" href="#evo13660-bib-0076">2012</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The peak date of food availability has been estimated since 1985, using frass samples (see Visser et al. 
  <a rid="evo13660-bib-0103" ref-type="ref" href="#evo13660-bib-0103">2006</a> for details). The most common caterpillars are of the winter moth (
  <span class="italic">Operophtera brumata</span>) and the oak leaf roller (
  <span class="italic">Tortrix viridana</span>), although other species are present. Caterpillar peak date correlates very well with the mean temperature from March 22 to May 16 (
  <span class="italic">r</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.81, resulting from a sliding window analysis); we used this relationship to hindcast the caterpillar peak date from 1973 to 1984 (all temperatures fell within the analyzed range).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we consider brood data from 1973 to 2016, as the study area was reorganised following a major storm in 1972, and the latest data on recruitment of fledged offspring (our fitness measure) was available for 2017. During the study period, a number of broods were manipulated in brood size. None of the broods that we considered were affected in their laying date, but brood size manipulations could affect the reproductive success of a brood. We therefore included broods whose size was manipulated in the laying date analyses, but removed them from annual selection analysis (but not for analysis of selection on the reaction norm; see below). Sample sizes per analysis are given in Table
