 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There was ample additive genetic variation in the elevation, but not the slope, of the great tit reaction norm (Table 
  <a rid="evo13660-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" href="#evo13660-tbl-0003">3</a>). Based on selection patterns in Table 
  <a rid="evo13660-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" href="#evo13660-tbl-0002">2</a>, we may expect the reaction norm to evolve toward an earlier average over time, but its slope to change only marginally because of the weak selection on it. Using the quantitative genetic model (eq. 
  <a rid="evo13660-disp-0007" ref-type="disp-formula" href="#evo13660-disp-0007">(5b)</a>), we found that both the elevation and the slope of the reaction norm were expected to evolve only marginally over time (Fig. 
  <a rid="evo13660-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#evo13660-fig-0001">1</a>B; cumulative change in elevation across years in period 2 and 3: –2.34 [–4.20, –0.48] days; in slope: –0.04 [–0.09, 0.02]; see Table 
  <a rid="evo13660-supl-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#evo13660-supl-0001">S1</a> for annual predicted responses). The small predicted response in the elevation—compared to the change in the optimal reaction norm—despite strong selection in period 2 was due to the generation time of about two years and the sex limitation of the trait; when we disregarded these factors (eq. 
  <a rid="evo13660-disp-0006" ref-type="disp-formula" href="#evo13660-disp-0006">(5a)</a>), the predicted response in elevation was substantially stronger (cumulative change in elevation: –10.30 [–18.63, –1.98] days; in slope: –0.16 [–0.40, 0.08]; Table 
  <a rid="evo13660-supl-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#evo13660-supl-0001">S1</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In close agreement with the predicted reaction norms, the observed reaction norm showed no distinct advancement over the three periods (Fig. 
  <a rid="evo13660-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#evo13660-fig-0001">1</a>C), with largely overlapping 95% HPDIs for the intercepts (posterior medians and 95% HPDIs for period 1–3: 41.80 [33.40, 49.29], 41.27 [30.72, 53.50], and 42.73 [35.85, 50.81]).
