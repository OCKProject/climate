 <p>We are grateful to the board of the Hoge Veluwe National Park for allowing us to do fieldwork all these years, to the countless number of students, assistants, and volunteers who collected the data, and to Jan Visser and Louis Vernooij for carefully managing the database. We are grateful to Thomas E. Reed for the inspiring discussions that eventually led to this manuscript. Sam Scheiner, Michael Morrissey, and an anonymous referee provided useful comments on a previous version of the manuscript. We thank Jarrod Hadfield for his help with the model specifications. Funding for this project was provided by an ERC advanced grant (339092‐E‐Response) to M.E.V.</p>
