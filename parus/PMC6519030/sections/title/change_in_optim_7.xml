 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CHANGE IN OPTIMAL REACTION NORM OVER TIME</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found that the optimal reaction norm for laying date (estimated as the date of the caterpillar biomass peak versus the temperatures in the time window as used by great tits to time their reproduction) changed to earlier dates over three distinct periods (Fig. 
  <a rid="evo13660-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#evo13660-fig-0001">1</a>A); the optimal phenotype (LD
  <sub>θ</sub>) advanced by 7.72 days (95% CI: [–10.89, –4.79]) from the first to the second period, and by 8.45 days (95% CI: [–12.75, –5.13]) from the first to the third period. There was, however, no interaction between temperature and time period (change in slope coefficient from first to second period: –1.54 [–4.19, 2.15]; from the first to the third period: 0.58 [–2.10, 3.31]), indicating that the response of LD
  <sub>θ</sub> to temperature did not change over the three periods (slope coefficient across all years: –3.15 [–4.36, –1.76] days/°C). Besides the mean, interannual variance in optimal laying date changed across the three periods (24.31 [10.82, 50.36], 29.98 [15.09, 64.27] and 63.70 [30.56, 149.37], respectively).

   <p>Optimal (A), predicted (B), and observed (C) reaction norms of laying date against spring temperature in three consecutive periods (blue: 1973–1987; black: 1988–2001; orange: 2002–2016) in the HV great tit population. (A) The optimal laying date for each year was the caterpillar peak date minus 33 days. Lines are estimates from linear regressions, excluding 1991 (marked by an asterisk) because late frost damaged the oak leaves in that year. (B) The black and orange dashed lines are the predicted evolutionary deviation from the observed reaction norm in period 1 (solid blue line) by the end of the second (2001) and third (2016) time period, respectively, based on cumulative change due to annual selection (eq. 
    <a rid="evo13660-disp-0007" ref-type="disp-formula" href="#evo13660-disp-0007">(5b)</a>; see Methods for interpretation). (C) Observed laying dates are yearly averages (±1 SEM); solid lines and shadings are the regression lines and 95% HPDI regions from a univariate mixed‐effects model of laying date against temperature (i.e., the mean individual‐level slope).
