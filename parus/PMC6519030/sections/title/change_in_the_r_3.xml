 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If the optimal laying date (LD
  <sub>θ</sub>, i.e., the laying date at which fitness is maximized) advanced at a faster rate over time than the observed laying date, this could lead to selection on (1) the reaction norm elevation, if the sensitivity of the optimal reaction norm to temperature (i.e., plasticity) remained constant over time, or (2) the slope, if the sensitivity of LD
  <sub>θ</sub> to temperatures changed over time. We therefore determined LD
  <sub>θ</sub> in each year and regressed it against the temperature cues used by the birds (i.e., the mean temperature across March 11–April 20). LD
  <sub>θ</sub> was defined as the peak date of caterpillar biomass minus 33 (see Chevin et al. 
  <a rid="evo13660-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#evo13660-bib-0016">2015</a>). The rationale behind this was that it takes approximately 33 days from the laying date to the moment when chicks’ food requirements are highest, assuming a clutch size of 9–10, followed by 12–13 days of incubation, and a peak in food demands at chick age 9–11 d (e.g., Keller and Van Noordwijk

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test whether the optimal reaction norm changed over time, we divided the datasets into three equal‐interval time periods (spanning 14–15 years: 1973–1987, 1988–2001, 2002–2016; Table 
  <a rid="evo13660-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" href="#evo13660-tbl-0001">1</a>). We then fitted a linear model with LD
  <sub>θ</sub> as a function of temperature and time period. We assessed statistical significance of model terms by bootstrapping (1000 iterations, bias‐corrected, and accelerated confidence intervals) estimates for each period, as well as the temperature slope. We then ran a model that contained an interaction between temperature and period and bootstrapped the change in the slope of the optimal reaction norm between periods to determine whether the slope changed over time. The year 1991 was excluded from this analysis as an exceptionally late frost spell in that year damaged all fresh oak leaves and hence the food peak was exceptionally late (see also Visser et al.
