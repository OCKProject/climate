  <div class="title">Patterns in selection on timing of reproduction in pied flycatchers using the number of local recruits produced as a fitness measure and environmental variables underlying selection.</div>
  <p>(A) Standardised linear selection gradients against year and (B) against mismatch between the birds’ population annual mean egg-laying date and timing of caterpillar peak abundance. (C) The relationship between the number of recruits and timing of reproduction (standardised egg-laying date) (see 
   <a rid="pbio.1002120.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pbio.1002120.t001">Table 1</a>) becomes steeper with increasing arrival temperatures in the years offspring recruited (note that egg-laying dates and temperatures were grouped in equally sized groups for graphical purposes only; cold spring (&lt;5 C): blue symbols and line, normal spring (5–8 C): green symbols and line, and warm spring (&gt;8 C): red symbols and line). Shown are mean and standard error (s.e.) of number of recruits grouped in 10- to 15-day intervals. Note that this grouping was only done for illustrative purposes. (D) Standardised selection gradients plotted against arrival temperatures. The data used to generate these graphs can be found in
