    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We tested the effect of the interaction of the following environmental variables with (centred) egg-laying date on reproductive success: (1) weather variables during the breeding season, calculated for two periods: nestling period and the first weeks after fledging, (2) caterpillar biomass during the breeding season, both the timing relative to the birds’ egg-laying date and the amount of caterpillar biomass (1993–2010 only), and (3) weather variables when the fledglings recruit into the breeding population: the minimum temperatures, averaged for one and two years after fledging, during the females’ “arrival period” (see main text). Estimates from multivariate generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs) with year and female identity as random effects and Poisson or Binomial error distribution and corresponding link-functions. Significant 
     <span class="italic">p</span>-values are given in bold. The number of fledglings cannot be affected by environmental variables that occur after fledging so these were not tested (n/a in the Table).

  </div>
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Selection has therefore gone from stabilising in the first decade (within-year analysis for the period 1980–1989: linear selection gradient = -0.09 ± 0.07, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.18, quadratic selection gradient = -0.24 ± 0.08, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.012) to directional selection for earlier egg-laying dates in the second decade (within-year analysis for the period 1990–1999: linear selection gradient = -0.50 ± 0.11, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001; quadratic selection gradient = 0.43 ± 0.20, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.02). However, in the last decade, directional selection on egg-laying date has weakened again but without a return to stabilising selection (within-year analysis for the period 2000–2010: linear selection gradient = -0.24 ± 0.06, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0001; quadratic selection gradient = 0.04 ± 0.09, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.70).

  <a rid="pbio.1002120.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pbio.1002120.g001">Fig. 1A</a>), we analysed how the relationships between egg-laying date and the number of recruits produced, and its two components, changed with environmental variables. Surprisingly, the strength of the seasonal decline in the number of recruits was not correlated with the mismatch between egg-laying date and the timing of the seasonal caterpillar peak (interaction egg-laying date * mean population mismatch; 
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pbio.1002120.t001">Table 1</a>). In accordance with this result, we found no statistically significant relationship between mismatch and standardised linear selection gradients (b = -0.02 ± 0.07, Chi

  <a rid="pbio.1002120.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pbio.1002120.g001">Fig. 1B</a>). Thus, the difference between the egg-laying date and the caterpillar peak (the phenological mismatch) does not appear to be a major driver of selection. Additionally, none of the meteorological variables during the breeding season, such as temperature or rainfall duration, explained variation in the strength of the seasonal decline in number of local recruits produced, the number of fledglings produced, or the recruitment probability of fledglings (
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pbio.1002120.t001">Table 1</a>). However, the seasonal decline in the number of fledglings produced was stronger when caterpillar peaks were lower, suggesting that the seasonal decline in reproductive output is related to the amount of caterpillars available (interaction egg-laying date * height of the caterpillar peak; 
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pbio.1002120.t001">Table 1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found support for the alternative hypothesis that conditions upon spring arrival for recruiting offspring explain between-year variation in selection on egg-laying date. Thus, when arrival temperatures were warm in the year of recruitment, recruitment probability declined more steeply with the egg-laying date of the clutch the offspring hatched in than when the springs were cold (interaction egg-laying date * arrival temperature; 
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pbio.1002120.t001">Table 1</a>; 
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pbio.1002120.g001">Fig. 1C</a>). As pied flycatcher fledglings mostly recruited in the first or second year after fledging (see “Age at recruitment” in 
  <a rid="sec004" ref-type="sec" href="#sec004">Materials and Methods</a>), the arrival temperature was calculated as the mean minimum spring temperature averaged over the two years after hatching during the arrival period of females (see 
  <a rid="sec004" ref-type="sec" href="#sec004">Materials and Methods</a>). In accordance with this, selection for earlier egg-laying date was stronger when arrival temperatures in the two years after fledging were higher (b = -0.18 ± 0.08, Chi

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We contend that spring arrival temperatures are important because these temperatures determine ecological conditions affecting survival and settlement just before or after arrival at the breeding grounds. The link with the egg-laying date of a bird’s mother is through a potential effect of hatch date on arrival date later in life. If early-hatched individuals themselves have an early arrival, they may benefit in warmer years but may pay a penalty in colder years (c.f., [
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref038">38</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref040">40</a>]). Indeed, the relative egg-laying date from the clutch in which an individual hatched was positively correlated with the first spring arrival date as adult breeder (relative to the population mean), especially in females (b = 0.22 ± 0.07, F
  <sub>1,351</sub> = 8.97, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.003), but less so for males (b = 0.11 ± 0.08, F
  <sub>1,211</sub> = 1.99, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.16). Note that when we constrain the analysis for females to the same observation period as for males (2002–2012), this effect remains statistically significant in females (b = 0.28 ± 0.10, F
  <sub>1,186</sub> = 8.02, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.005). A further indication that females hatched in early-laid clutches are themselves also arriving and laying eggs early is that egg-laying date is heritable: 
  <span class="italic">h</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.33 (95% CI: 0.25–0.39).
