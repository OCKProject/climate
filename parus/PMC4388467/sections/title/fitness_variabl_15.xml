 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the number of offspring produced that return as a breeding bird in the Hoge Veluwe population (local recruit) as a fitness measure. This number of recruits produced is the total number of recruits from first and replacement clutches (after a failed first clutch) within a single season.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The number of recruits produced can be partitioned in two components, the number of fledglings produced and the probability for these fledglings to recruit. These two components can be affected by very different climatic variables, and hence we also analysed how these two components were affected by the selected climatic variables to gain more insight in how our overall fitness measure, the number of recruits, was related to climate variables. The number of fledglings was the number of chicks ringed minus the number of offspring found dead in the nest box after the offspring had fledged. The probability to recruit was calculated as the number of recruits per nest divided by the number of fledglings per nest (thus excluding the nests without fledglings). As capture probability of a locally recruiting offspring was not correlated with the egg-laying date of the brood a recruit originated from (see above and 
  <a rid="sec003" ref-type="sec" href="#sec003">Discussion</a>), we did not correct the number of recruiting offspring for capture probability. Note that an offspring is a recruit when it is caught at any age at the Hoge Veluwe, so even when birds are missed in their first breeding year, they are likely to be caught in their second year of breeding.
