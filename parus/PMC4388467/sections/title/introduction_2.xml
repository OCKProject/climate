 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Global climate change has led to shifts in phenology, i.e., the seasonal timing of life history events, such as budburst, flowering, hibernation, migration, or reproduction, in many species. Over the past three decades, plants and animals have shifted their timing, on average, three to four days per decade [
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref001">1</a>–
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref008">8</a>]. These shifts allowed them to at least partly adapt to the shifted optimal timing caused by the altered abiotic and biotic conditions. The observed shifts in seasonal timing have often not been as strong as the shift in the optimal timing, which could have negative consequences for fitness [
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref009">9</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref010">10</a>]. In seasonal habitats, reproductive success often increases with the temporal match at the peak of food availability [
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref008">8</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref011">11</a>–
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref015">15</a>]. Climate change can disrupt this phenological match between trophic levels because of differential phenological responses at different trophic levels [
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref002">2</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref008">8</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref016">16</a>], but variation between specific systems is likely depending on the ecology of the interrelated trophic levels [
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref017">17</a>–
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref021">21</a>]. In migrant species, these differential responses could be caused by differences in the rates of temperature change in different geographical regions during the annual cycle [
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref022">22</a>]. Migratory species in particular must rely on environmental conditions experienced en route to predict the optimal time for stopover, arrival, or breeding at distant areas [
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref023">23</a>,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When in a population the timing of life cycle events shifts at a different rate than the optimal timing is shifting, directional selection on the timing will increase. Identifying the environmental variables that are the selective agents is important to predict future impacts of climate change and to be able to study the mechanisms underlying the ecological effects of climate change. However, these selective agents have rarely been identified, even outside the climate change setting, as pointed out earlier [
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref025">25</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref026">26</a>]. There are only a handful of studies that have identified such environmental variables [
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref009">9</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref027">27</a>–
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref030">30</a>]. One example is selection on timing of reproduction in great tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) in the Netherlands, where increasing spring temperatures have advanced the peak date in the food for the nestlings (i.e., caterpillars) more strongly than the egg-laying date of the birds [
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref007">7</a>] (but see [
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref028">28</a>] for a United Kingdom great tit population where there has been no increase in phenological mismatch). As this mismatch between nestling food availability and demand affects the strength of selection on egg-laying date [
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref009">9</a>,

  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref027">27</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref028">28</a>], selection for earlier laying has increased [
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref007">7</a>]. As the timing of both the caterpillars and the birds depends on temperature, the strength of selection depended on spring temperature [
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref009">9</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref027">27</a>]. Here, we aim to identify the possible selective agents, including phenological mismatch, underlying the selection for egg-laying date in an insectivorous songbird, the pied flycatcher (
  <span class="italic">Ficedula hypoleuca</span>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pied flycatchers are long-distance migrant birds whose timing of reproduction is constrained by spring arrival time [
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref031">31</a>]. As for many long-distance migrants, spring arrival dates are advancing slowly, possibly because the environmental cues in the wintering grounds have limited reliability to forecast environmental conditions in the breeding areas [
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref031">31</a>] (but see [
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref023">23</a>]). Pied flycatchers in our Dutch long-term study population have advanced their egg-laying date, but not sufficiently enough to keep track of the advancing caterpillar peak [
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref032">32</a>], and selection for early breeding increased between 1980–1998 [
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref031">31</a>]. Pied flycatchers breeding in areas with early caterpillar phenology declined strongly, in contrast to areas with later phenology [
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref033">33</a>], suggesting that the mismatch with caterpillar availability could be determining this change in selection patterns (“phenological mismatch hypothesis” [
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref007">7</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref034">34</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref035">35</a>]). Despite these circumstantial data, the environmental variables causing the increased selection for earlier breeding have not been formally tested.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We here aim to (1) describe ongoing changes in selection for timing of reproduction in our long-term pied flycatcher population, spanning more than three decades, using a novel statistical framework, and (2) identify the environmental variables that account for the temporal pattern of selection on timing of reproduction.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To explore the environmental variables potentially underlying selection that could explain this temporal pattern, we analysed not only our primary fitness measure, the number of recruits produced, but also its two components: the number of fledglings produced and the probability that a fledgling recruits as a breeding bird. These two components could be affected by different environmental variables, and therefore analysing them separately may provide further insights in how environmental variables affect the number of recruits produced. As a way to identify the determinants of observed variation in (directional) selection, we assessed the effects of a number of environmental variables (see below) on the relationships between these fitness components and timing of reproduction.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three types of environmental variables were tested: climatic variables during the breeding season, food availability during the breeding season, and the conditions at the time the offspring returned to breed for the first time. As climatic variables, we considered seasonal patterns in temperature and the duration of rainfall (which reduces the provisioning time for the parents), both during the chick feeding period and during the period just after fledging, i.e., when offspring become independent, as these may affect fledgling survival from early and late broods differently (e.g., [
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref036">36</a>]). Next, we tested the hypothesis that the degree of temporal mismatch between caterpillar peak dates (as one of the main food sources for offspring [
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref037">37</a>]) and flycatcher egg-laying dates is important for explaining among-year variation in selection [
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref035">35</a>]. Finally, we tested an alternative mechanism to explain the observed variation in the annual strength of selection, based on previous observations that in years with low temperatures during spring arrival, early-arriving individuals are less likely to survive [
  <a rid="pbio.1002120.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1002120.ref038">38</a>]. We investigate whether hatch date of an individual (i.e., the lay date of its mother) is a predictor of spring arrival date when offspring return as a breeder and whether early- and late-hatched individuals’ survival upon arrival may thus be affected differentially by spring temperatures.
