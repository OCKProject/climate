 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conducted systematic nest-searches by checking tree cavities used in previous years and all nest-boxes approximately every 4 days, and we monitored nests in tree cavities (excavated or natural decay-formed holes) and in boxes. We visually inspected nest boxes and tree cavities using a mirror and flashlight. Nest boxes were generally within reach of the ground, but inspection of tree cavities usually required the use of a ladder. Throughout the study, we recorded and did not remove all old and new nest materials and contents including unhatched eggs and dead nestlings. For each nest, we recorded the date the first egg was laid (date of first egg), the maximum number of eggs observed during incubation (where the same number of eggs was observed on ≥ 2 visits; clutch size), hatch date, and the maximum number of eggs to hatch (brood size) and the maximum number of nestlings to fledge. To determine date of first egg at nests found after the first egg was laid, we assumed that one egg was laid per day and counted backwards from the date that the final egg was laid at nests found during laying. We determined hatch date as the first day we observed at least one chick hatched, or we estimated hatch date from chick age based on characteristics of the nestlings [

  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref052">52</a>]. To quantify date of first egg and hatch date, we used the number of days since 1 January (Julian day). When nestlings were approximately 10 days old (post-hatching), we weighed and marked them with aluminum bands, and then placed them back in the cavity or box. We captured some adults at the nest by placing a net over the cavity or box entrance, and measured, marked with aluminum and colour bands, and then released them immediately. However, we captured an insufficient number of adults to assess how age and experience might have influenced reproduction in this study. We monitored nest boxes and cavities until they were empty (chicks fledged or nests failed). Successful nests were those where we observed fledging by at least one chick, or at least one chick was in the nest at least 18 days after hatching (with no evidence of predation after the nest was empty), the minimum number of days required for Tree Swallow nestlings to fledge [

Nest depredation was identified by the absence of eggs or nestlings before the minimum number of days required for fledging and/or the presence of a predatory species inside the cavity, or teeth marks in the wood around the cavity entrance, and/or mammal fur or feces inside the cavity entrance or on the cavity floor. All field data were collected under annually renewed permits under the University of British Columbia Animal Care Protocol, and Environment and Climate Change Canada’s Scientific permit and banding permit number 10365.
