Our study sites were located near Riske Creek, 40 km west of the City of Williams Lake, and near Knife Creek, 20–40 km east of Williams Lake (52°14’N, 122°12’W). Our 20 sampling sites (most 15–32 ha in size) varied in composition from continuous forest to five sites that consisted of forest groves (0.2–5 ha). Small gaps in continuous forest stands comprised grasslands, shallow ponds and small clearcuts [

Martin unpublished data). We placed nest boxes 3 m to 30 m apart along fence lines and at forest edges 500 m to 1 km from our Riske Creek tree cavity study sites. Of 100 boxes monitored from 2001 to 2003, 90 were present for at least two years prior to our study, with nine added in 2002, and another one added in 2003. We monitored Tree Swallow nests in boxes at six sites and in tree cavities at 19 of the 20 sites.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Boxes were rectangular, top-opening, and constructed of 1.27-cm-thick plywood. For nest boxes, entrances were circular with a mean diameter of 5.2 ± 1.9 (SD) cm, mean entrance height above ground was 1.6 ± 0.6 (SD) m (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nest monitoring</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conducted systematic nest-searches by checking tree cavities used in previous years and all nest-boxes approximately every 4 days, and we monitored nests in tree cavities (excavated or natural decay-formed holes) and in boxes. We visually inspected nest boxes and tree cavities using a mirror and flashlight. Nest boxes were generally within reach of the ground, but inspection of tree cavities usually required the use of a ladder. Throughout the study, we recorded and did not remove all old and new nest materials and contents including unhatched eggs and dead nestlings. For each nest, we recorded the date the first egg was laid (date of first egg), the maximum number of eggs observed during incubation (where the same number of eggs was observed on ≥ 2 visits; clutch size), hatch date, and the maximum number of eggs to hatch (brood size) and the maximum number of nestlings to fledge. To determine date of first egg at nests found after the first egg was laid, we assumed that one egg was laid per day and counted backwards from the date that the final egg was laid at nests found during laying. We determined hatch date as the first day we observed at least one chick hatched, or we estimated hatch date from chick age based on characteristics of the nestlings [
   <a rid="pone.0204226.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref003">3</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0204226.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref051">51</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0204226.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref052">52</a>]. To quantify date of first egg and hatch date, we used the number of days since 1 January (Julian day). When nestlings were approximately 10 days old (post-hatching), we weighed and marked them with aluminum bands, and then placed them back in the cavity or box. We captured some adults at the nest by placing a net over the cavity or box entrance, and measured, marked with aluminum and colour bands, and then released them immediately. However, we captured an insufficient number of adults to assess how age and experience might have influenced reproduction in this study. We monitored nest boxes and cavities until they were empty (chicks fledged or nests failed). Successful nests were those where we observed fledging by at least one chick, or at least one chick was in the nest at least 18 days after hatching (with no evidence of predation after the nest was empty), the minimum number of days required for Tree Swallow nestlings to fledge [
   <a rid="pone.0204226.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref003">3</a>]. Nest depredation was identified by the absence of eggs or nestlings before the minimum number of days required for fledging and/or the presence of a predatory species inside the cavity, or teeth marks in the wood around the cavity entrance, and/or mammal fur or feces inside the cavity entrance or on the cavity floor. All field data were collected under annually renewed permits under the University of British Columbia Animal Care Protocol, and Environment and Climate Change Canada’s Scientific permit and banding permit number 10365.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistical analyses</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used five generalized linear mixed effects models to compare the fecundity characteristics (date of first egg, clutch size, brood size, hatch day, and fledging success) of nests in tree cavities to those in nest boxes. For each model except date of first egg laid, the fixed effects were nest type (natural tree cavity or nest box) and year. In the model with the response variable, date of first egg laid, we included year as a random effect to divide the error terms into year versus measures within year thereby partially accounting for correlations of repeated measures within years. We matched nests in cavities and boxes with the same date of first egg laid, and assigned a unique identifier, TempID. To account for temporal variation in fecundity variables while comparing reproductive output between nest types (cavities vs. boxes), we included TempID as a random effect in all models except where date of first egg laid was the response variable.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For both clutch and brood size, data were non-normal integers, and the residual deviance of Poisson models was not equal to the degrees of freedom (DF), so we specified a quasi-Poisson distribution for both variables. For date of first egg and hatch day, we used normal distributions, and visually examined plots of residuals to ensure that errors were homoscedastic and that the models fit the data. For fledging success, we specified a binomial distribution (fledged = 1, failed = 0), and used a logit link function. Because nests found at different nesting stages can bias nest success estimates [
   <a rid="pone.0204226.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref053">53</a>], we applied a logistic-exposure adjustment to the binomial distribution in the fledging success model. Each observation was weighted by the inverse of the number of days that the nest was observed, thus providing estimates for fledging success without assuming when nest loss occurred [
   <a rid="pone.0204226.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref054">54</a>]. We used penalized quasi-likelihood to generate parameter estimates for clutch size, brood size, and fledging success, and restricted maximum likelihood for date of first egg and hatch day, with the functions glmmPQL and lme, respectively, in the program R version 2.12.1 [
