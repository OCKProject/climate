However, nest boxes can become ecological traps when a cue such as nest size leads cavity-nesters to prefer boxes over tree cavities despite boxes being located in areas of higher predation risk and/or lower food availability (and subsequently lead to lower reproductive success and/or survival [
  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref004">4</a>]). Thus, local increases in breeding densities after the addition of nest boxes and other artificial cavities, as shown in many species [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A number of mechanisms may explain differences in reproductive output between birds nesting in nest boxes and tree cavities. Studies reporting differences in the initiation of egg laying between nesting contexts have suggested that, 1) abundant nest boxes placed in areas where competition for tree cavities is high may allow pairs to settle earlier in boxes [
  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref011">11</a>], and/or 2) a greater number of older females settle in nest boxes and initiate laying earlier [
  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref011">11</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref013">13</a>]. One possible explanation for the discrepancies in clutch size between nest box and tree cavity nests is that females adjust clutch sizes based on the dimensions of the cavities [
  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref013">13</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref021">21</a>]to decrease the negative effects of crowding on nestlings [
  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref022">22</a>]. An increase in clutch size with increasing nest cavity size has been reported for some bird species such as Great Tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>), Pied and Collared Flycatchers (
  <span class="italic">Ficedula spp</span>.; [

  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref025">25</a>], but not for other species such as European Starlings (

  <span class="italic">Falco sparverius</span>), and Northern Flickers (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ectoparasites can reduce the mass, growth rate, and survival of nestlings of cavity-nesting species [
  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref028">28</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref032">32</a>]. Even though removing nest material between breeding seasons is a common practice in nest box studies, it is rarely, if ever, reported [
  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref033">33</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref034">34</a>]. Nest boxes containing old nests that are not removed between breeding seasons can have a greater number of ectoparasites (bird fleas; 
  <span class="italic">Ceratophyllus idius</span>) than cleaned boxes, more closely mimicking the ectoparasite loads found in tree cavities [
  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref034">34</a>]. Therefore, many studies reporting greater reproductive output in nest boxes may be an artefact of reduced ectoparasite loads in clean boxes [
  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref033">33</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Predation rates could vary between boxes and tree cavities given that boxes are often lower to the ground, placed in exposed locations, and located in greater densities than natural tree cavities, thus making boxes more vulnerable to predators. In continental Europe, nest predation rates by Greater Spotted Woodpeckers (
  <span class="italic">Dendrocopus major</span>) were greater in boxes located closer to the ground compared to tree cavities for European Starlings, Eurasian Blue Tits (
  <span class="italic">Cyanistes caeruleus</span>) and Marsh Tits (
  <span class="italic">Poecile palustris</span>) [
  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref012">12</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref014">14</a>]. However, these same studies and others in the UK reported the opposite result of lower woodpecker predation rates in boxes for tits and Pied Flycatchers (
  <span class="italic">Ficedula hypoleuca</span>), relative to tree cavities [
  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref012">12</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref014">14</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref015">15</a>]. As a result of higher predation rates in nest boxes, researchers often modify boxes to limit predation [
  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref035">35</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref036">36</a>]. A recent analysis of nest fate data in nest boxes across the United States and Canada found that nest survival was improved with the presence of predator guards for most species examined, including Tree Swallows [
  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref036">36</a>]. The presence of predator guards, therefore, might explain some discrepancies in reproductive success between birds nesting in boxes and tree cavities. Thus, differences in reproductive variables between nest types and their suggested mechanisms are often variable both across and within species. Further, meta-analyses are complicated by inconsistencies in reporting whether nest boxes are cleaned and/or have been modified to limit nest predation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Much of what we know about how nest characteristics influence the breeding biology of secondary cavity-nesting passerines comes from studies of Tree Swallows in nest boxes [
  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref003">3</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref037">37</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref044">44</a>]. Researchers studying Tree Swallows in Ontario, Canada found that birds using nest boxes tended to be older females that initiated clutches earlier and had larger clutches than those nesting in tree cavities [
  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref013">13</a>]; however, in that study, nestling survival rates varied with year and the proportion of nests fledging young did not vary with nest site type. Further, this study reported on a limited sample size of reproductive variables in tree cavities that were located up to only 3 m above standing water despite nest heights ranging up to &gt; 9 m above water [
  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref013">13</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref024">24</a>]. In another study of Tree Swallows in interior British Columbia, Canada, researchers found that laying date and clutch size did not differ between pairs using nest boxes and tree cavities, but results were inconclusive as a result of a very small sample size [
  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref045">45</a>]. Thus there is a need to examine the question of the influence of nest site type in a setting where the full range of natural tree cavities can be compared with uncleaned nest boxes (i.e., nest contents not removed between breeding seasons) that do not have predator guards, and where both nest site types are in close proximity to food.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During three years (2001–2003) of our long-term study on cavity-nesting birds [
  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref046">46</a>], we examined the fecundity of Tree Swallows nesting in cavities (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 123) and uncleaned nest boxes that lacked predator guards (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 78) in the same habitat types but with experimentally manipulated supplies of nest-sites in central British Columbia. We hypothesized that annual reproductive output (breeding phenology, clutch and brood sizes, and fledging success) of Tree Swallows differed between pairs using tree cavities and nest boxes.
