 <div class="title">Julian date of first egg laid (DFE) by Tree Swallows nesting in tree cavities (

 <p>Lines indicate a moving average (moving mean number of nests across date of first egg) for each nest type. This is calculated using the number of nests across two times: the DFE where the data point corresponds to the line and one data point prior.</p>
