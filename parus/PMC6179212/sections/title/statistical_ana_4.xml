 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used five generalized linear mixed effects models to compare the fecundity characteristics (date of first egg, clutch size, brood size, hatch day, and fledging success) of nests in tree cavities to those in nest boxes. For each model except date of first egg laid, the fixed effects were nest type (natural tree cavity or nest box) and year. In the model with the response variable, date of first egg laid, we included year as a random effect to divide the error terms into year versus measures within year thereby partially accounting for correlations of repeated measures within years. We matched nests in cavities and boxes with the same date of first egg laid, and assigned a unique identifier, TempID. To account for temporal variation in fecundity variables while comparing reproductive output between nest types (cavities vs. boxes), we included TempID as a random effect in all models except where date of first egg laid was the response variable.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For both clutch and brood size, data were non-normal integers, and the residual deviance of Poisson models was not equal to the degrees of freedom (DF), so we specified a quasi-Poisson distribution for both variables. For date of first egg and hatch day, we used normal distributions, and visually examined plots of residuals to ensure that errors were homoscedastic and that the models fit the data. For fledging success, we specified a binomial distribution (fledged = 1, failed = 0), and used a logit link function. Because nests found at different nesting stages can bias nest success estimates [
  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref053">53</a>], we applied a logistic-exposure adjustment to the binomial distribution in the fledging success model. Each observation was weighted by the inverse of the number of days that the nest was observed, thus providing estimates for fledging success without assuming when nest loss occurred [
  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref054">54</a>]. We used penalized quasi-likelihood to generate parameter estimates for clutch size, brood size, and fledging success, and restricted maximum likelihood for date of first egg and hatch day, with the functions glmmPQL and lme, respectively, in the program R version 2.12.1 [
