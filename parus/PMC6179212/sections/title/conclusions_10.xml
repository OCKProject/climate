 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tree Swallows in North America depend on acquiring nesting cavities in ecological conditions that generally involve a limited supply of suitable tree cavities and a suite of strong nest site competitors. Our results that Tree Swallows laid larger, and more successful clutches in nest boxes suggests that nest boxes provide a reproductive advantage to Tree Swallow populations, particularly where competition for nest-sites is high. Our results contrast with earlier studies, which did not find greater fledging success in boxes relative to cavities [

  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref045">45</a>]. If, as our findings suggest, nest types differ with birds nesting in boxes having higher fecundity, then regional or continental estimates of annual fecundity for Tree Swallows will be inflated when using data from nest boxes. It remains unclear why Tree Swallow populations in some parts of North America appear to be increasing while populations in other parts of the continent are in steady decline [

  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref061" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref061">61</a>], and habitat loss in breeding, wintering, or migration routes (see [
  <a rid="pone.0204226.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0204226.ref002">2</a>] for additional hypotheses). Further continent-wide research on how reproductive success is influenced by climate, microclimate in nest boxes and in tree cavities, and food availability is needed to understand the geographic variation in population changes of swallows and other aerial insectivores, and to determine the conditions where nest-box supplementation can favor increased reproductive output.
