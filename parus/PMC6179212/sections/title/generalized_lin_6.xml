 <div class="title">Generalized linear mixed-effects model parameter estimates, standard errors (SE), degrees of freedom (DF), test statistics (
  <span class="italic">t</span>-value), and 
  <span class="italic">P</span> values for fecundity variables of Tree Swallows nesting in nest boxes versus tree cavities (Natural) and whether fecundity variables observed in 2001 differed from those in 2002 and 2003 (Year 2002, Year 2003).
 </div>
 <p>The signs of parameter estimates indicate whether clutches were laid/hatched earlier (-) or later (), whether clutches/broods were smaller (-) or larger (), and whether nests fledged at least one young () or failed (-) more frequently in tree cavities compared to nests in nest boxes. We included year as a random effect in the model, Date of first egg laid. Nests with the same date of first egg laid were grouped together and given a unique identification number, TempID, which was included as a random effect in all models except where date of first egg laid was the response variable.</p>
