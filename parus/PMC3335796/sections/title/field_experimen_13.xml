 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We carried out a field experiment to test if laying dates in the wild are restricted by gonadal development of the females. In the Oosterhout (∼150 nest boxes) and Hoge Veluwe study area (∼440 nest boxes) all nest boxes were checked at night for the presence of female great tits (Oosterhout 2009: February 25
  <span class="sup">th</span>; 2010: March 1
  <span class="sup">st</span>; Hoge Veluwe 2009: March 3
  <span class="sup">rd</span>). All females were banded with a uniquely numbered aluminum ring as well as a unique colour band combination. Of the 103 females encountered, we took 69 females into temporary captivity (Oosterhout: 2009 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 20, 2010 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 20, Hoge Veluwe: 2009

  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0035617-t001" href="#pone-0035617-t001">Table 1</a>). Thus, 34 females were not taken into captivity; these control females were put back in the nest box after being ringed and weighed with a pesola spring scale (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0035617-t001" href="#pone-0035617-t001">Table 1</a>). The females taken into captivity were housed indoor in individual cages with 
  <span class="italic">ad libitum</span> food and water.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Half of the females were kept indoors under a natural light regime (light from 7:30AM to 6:15PM), while the other half were photostimulated (light from 7AM to 3AM; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035617-g003" href="#pone-0035617-g003">Fig. 3</a>), and thus experienced an increase in day length of 8 hours and 45 minutes. Thus, we created three experimental groups in this field experiment: (i) photostimulated females in captivity (ii) females which experienced natural day length in captivity and (iii) females which experienced natural day length in the field. We chose not to measure gonadal size of the females in the field after release since disturbance in the period just before egg laying could probably affect the timing of egg laying. All females were released at the field site of capture the day after the treatment (day 3,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nest boxes at both study sites were checked once a week from the beginning of April onwards to monitor nest building. Once the bottom of the box was covered with nest material, nests were checked daily to determine the exact laying date (date the first egg was laid). During incubation, females were identified by their unique colour code combination by exposing the colour rings with a pen. Laying dates of three females were excluded since they were likely to be replacement clutches (&gt;30 days after the first egg laying dates in that year of that population) of which we had missed the first clutch (removed laying dates are: Oosterhout 2009: April 40
  <span class="sup">th</span>; Oosterhout 2010: April 34
  <span class="sup">th</span> and April 61
  <span class="sup">st</span>). Results of the analysis did not change after including these data points.
