 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Breeding success largely depends on the timing of breeding relative to the timing of maximum food availability 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-VanNoordwijk1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-VanNoordwijk1">[1]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Visser1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Visser1">[3]</a>. Many forest passerine bird species in temperate regions feed their young with caterpillars, which occur only in a short period of time during spring (caterpillar biomass peak). Due to increased spring temperatures, the window in which food availability is high has shifted forward in time over the last 25 years 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Visser2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Visser2">[4]</a>. As a result, the optimal timing for breeding advanced, but many species, like the great tit, have not adjusted their timing sufficiently, causing them to breed too late 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Visser2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Visser2">[4]</a>–

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reproductive system of most seasonally breeding birds, including great tits, shows a clear seasonal pattern 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Murton1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Murton1">[7]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Silverin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Silverin1">[8]</a>. Gonads are regressed during winter, grow slowly during late winter and grow rapidly in spring until fully developed. Gonads are regressed again after the breeding season. The rapid growth in spring is affected by increasing day length, which causes the release of gonadotrophins 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Murton1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Murton1">[7]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Dawson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Dawson1">[9]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Sharp1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Sharp1">[10]</a>. Although it has been shown that temperature can affect the speed at which gonads develop in great tits breeding in Southern latitudes 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Silverin2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Silverin2">[11]</a>, the speed of gonadal development in great tits breeding in more Northern latitudes is not accelerated by increasing spring temperatures (The Netherlands 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Schaper1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Schaper1">[12]</a>, Scandinavia 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Silverin2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Silverin2">[11]</a>). In these latitudes, gonadal growth is driven by photoperiod 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Silverin2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Silverin2">[11]</a>. Increasing spring temperatures due to global warming will therefore not advance the birds' readiness to reproduce. As climate change does not affect the seasonal change in photoperiod, a possible reason as to why great tits are not advancing their laying date adequately is that gonads are not fully developed early enough to allow early egg laying.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test whether gonadal development is hampering early egg laying, gonadal development needs to be experimentally advanced. This could be done by manipulating the photoperiod a bird experiences, as is shown in an experiment where blue tits (
  <span class="italic">Cyanistes caeruleus</span>) in captivity (with 
  <span class="italic">ad libitum</span> food) could be tricked into laying their eggs in winter (January) by exposing them to long days from December onwards 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Lambrechts1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Lambrechts1">[13]</a>. Under a natural photoperiod, egg laying in January is not possible as the reproductive system will not be fully developed at that time.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the experienced photoperiod of captive birds is easily manipulated, photostimulating birds in the field has many practical problems, such as fitting a large number of nest boxes with a light, batteries and a timer. More importantly, birds do not always sleep in a particular nest box in the period before egg laying and thus it is difficult to determine which bird is photostimulated and by how much. Taking wild birds into captivity for photostimulation treatment for long periods can cause problems as breeding vacancies as a result of the removal of territorial birds are filled within a few days by unpaired birds, which may lead to fights after release of the original territory holder or its female (pers. comm. P. de Goede (NIOO-KNAW)).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous experiments have shown that the exposure to ‘a single long day’ can affect levels of hormones involved in reproduction. Nicholls and colleagues 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Nicholls1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Nicholls1">[14]</a> kept Japanese quail under 8L∶16D and gave them a single long day of 20L∶4D resulting in an increase of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) within four hours of the end of the long day. These birds were kept in constant darkness thereafter and their LH and FSH levels decreased slowly over the next 8 to 10 days. Creighton and Follett 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Creighton1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Creighton1">[15]</a>, who performed a similar experiment, kept Japanese quails under short day lengths after just one long day and report that LH remained elevated for three days after photostimulation. Follet and colleagues 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Follett1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Follett1">[16]</a> have shown that LH levels of white-crowned sparrows (
  <span class="italic">Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii</span>) transferred from short (8L∶16D) to long days (20L∶4D) increased six-fold in five days, with the largest increase after the first day (three-fold increase). Saab and colleagues 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Saab1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Saab1">[17]</a> has shown that a single long day increased gonadotrophin-releasing hormone and LH concentrations in white-throated sparrows (
  <span class="italic">Zonotrichia albicollis</span>). A single long day also affects gonadal growth of both male and female Song sparrows (
  <span class="italic">Melospiza melodia</span>). Wingfield 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Wingfield1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Wingfield1">[18]</a> showed that after one single long day, females' gonads grew for up to 60 days, even though the changes in LH and FSH were only present for a few days. In all of the experiments above food was available 
  <span class="italic">ad libitum</span>. If a single long day would affect gonadal growth in wild female great tits, it would allow us to test the hypothesis that laying dates are restricted by photo-induced gonadal growth.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Outside the breeding season gonads are regressed, implying that there are costs connected with having and/or maintaining fully developed gonads. These costs can be present in terms of increased risk of predation due to lower aerial maneuverability and take-off ability 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Metcalfe1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Metcalfe1">[19]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Witter1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Witter1">[21]</a>, but might also involve energetic maintenance costs. Thus, it is likely that advancing gonadal growth in spring also comes with a cost. If energetic costs restrict early gonadal development, only birds in habitats with high food availability might be growing their gonads as a reaction to a single long day.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The aim of this study was to determine (i) if a single long day induces gonadal growth in captive female great tits and (ii) if a single long day in spring affects laying dates in two field populations which differ in the availability of supplementary food in the period before and during egg laying. If gonadal growth restricts early egg laying, we expect photostimulated birds to lay earlier compared to control birds in both study areas. If gonadal growth is restricted by a combined effect of photoperiod and food availability, we expect only those birds in the population with available supplementary food during the pre-laying period to advance egg laying.</p>
