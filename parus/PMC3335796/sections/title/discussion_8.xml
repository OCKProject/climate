 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study aimed to test the hypothesis that timing of egg laying is restricted by the timing of gonadal development, which is under photoperiodic control. We showed that, even in winter (average daily temperature in the outdoor aviary in December 2008 = 1.8°C, January 2009 = 0.1°C; February = 2.7°C), gonadal growth is initiated after exposing captive female great tits to ‘a single long day’ (20L∶4D). In a field experiment in spring, however, free living female great tits which were given a single long day did not advance egg laying, either in the study area with or without good food conditions and the availability of supplementary food in the period before egg laying. Although we did not measure gonadal development prior to egg laying in the field study and can therefore not confirm that our ‘single long day’ treatment also worked in spring, these results suggest that the seasonal timing of gonadal growth does not play a major role in restricting great tits from advancing their laying date.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Follicles of captive female great tits which were exposed to a single long day in winter started growing. As gonads are in a regressed state outside the breeding season and only start growing very slowly in early winter, follicles were still small in December (maximum 0.3 mm long). It is therefore difficult to measure their size: in 3 out of 15 cases, the follicle size in December was too small to be measured precisely. Follicle sizes in January ranged from 0.1 mm to 0.5 mm, which is still small compared to the accuracy with which we can measure them (0.1 mm). Although measuring follicles in winter is difficult, we have confidence in our measurements.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both populations have a long history of selection for early laying: reproductive success, measured as the number of fledged offspring that recruited in the breeding population in the next year, was higher for early breeding females for 21 out of 25 years in Oosterhout, and for 23 out of 25 years in the Hoge Veluwe 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Visser2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Visser2">[4]</a>. If gonadal growth would restrict egg laying, this would most likely occur in years with high spring temperatures since warm springs lead to early egg laying. Temperature in the period 16 March until 20 April correlates well with laying dates 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Visser2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Visser2">[4]</a>. In 2010, mean temperature in this period was high and indeed, the first pair that started egg laying in the Oosterhout study population was the earliest recorded laying date in the last 55 years in this study area. Although laying dates are early in years with warm springs, gonadal growth is not affected by temperature in the period before egg laying 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Schaper1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Schaper1">[12]</a>. Therefore we would expect an effect of photostimulation (especially in 2010) if gonadal growth was restricting egg laying dates.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although follicle volumes increased after one day of photostimulation in captivity during winter, photostimulation in spring did not affect laying dates in the field. There are a number of potential explanations.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We did not measure gonadal growth in a subset of the photostimulated animals in March. It is therefore possible that the photostimulation in March did not result in gonadal growth, causing the lack of effect in laying dates. To our knowledge, no studies have focused on the seasonal variation in the strength of the response in hormonal change or gonadal growth to a single long day. However, Silverin 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Silverin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Silverin1">[8]</a> caught male great tits during different months of the year and exposed (a part of) them to a 20L∶4D light regime for 100 days. Testis growth of male great tits caught in December was less than one millimeter after 10 days of photostimulation, whereas male great tits caught in March grew their tested on average just over 2 mm. Thus, at both dates photostimulation leads to a reaction that was adequate for that time and developmental stage and it is therefore likely that follicle growth of the female great tits in our field experiment was stimulated by our experimental treatment in March.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since the natural day length is shorter in winter than in spring, the photostimulation in winter was a relatively stronger stimulation compared to the photostimulation in spring. Silverin 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Silverin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Silverin1">[8]</a> measured testes growth of male great tits exposed to two different light regimes (14L∶10D and 20L∶4D) and showed that the gonadal maturation was faster in he 20L∶4D group compared to the 14L∶10D group. In our experiment in spring, the increase in day length was still 9 hours and 15 minutes for the photostimulated group, which is more than the increase in day length from 8L∶16D to 14L∶10D in the experiment from Silverin 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Silverin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Silverin1">[8]</a> which resulted in clear effects on hormones and gonadal development. We therefore believe the photostimulation treatment in spring is strong enough to evoke a response in gonadal growth.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another possible explanation why photostimulated females did not advance egg laying is that, besides the primary predictive cue of photoperiod, supplementary cues are used to time egg laying 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Farner1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Farner1">[22]</a>, for example the increase in spring temperature 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Schaper1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Schaper1">[12]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Visser4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Visser4">[23]</a>. One of the supplementary cues might be food availability. During the aviary experiment, as well as in most other experimental studies 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Schaper1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Schaper1">[12]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Visser4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Visser4">[23]</a>, food and water were given 
  <span class="italic">ad libitum</span> while the females in the field encountered all kinds of stressors (predation risk, lower food availability, inter-species interactions et cetera). In addition, eggs are laid in cold weather conditions under which foraging efficiency is low 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Avery1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Avery1">[24]</a> and energetic costs are high 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Stevenson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Stevenson1">[25]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-teMarvelde1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-teMarvelde1">[26]</a>. Therefore, adverse food conditions can restrict growth of gonads (either acting as a cue or as an energetic constraint). Perfito 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Perfito1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Perfito1">[27]</a> showed that male zebra finches (
  <span class="italic">Taeniopygia guttata guttata</span>) under long photoperiod but with food restrictions did not develop their testis, similar to those under short day lengths, while birds under long photoperiod with 
  <span class="italic">ad libitum</span> food did. Zebra finches, however, are opportunistic breeders that have evolved to use food availability as a cue, since they live in areas where food availability is unpredictable and do not follow a seasonal pattern 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Zann1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Zann1">[28]</a>. Testis size of male European starlings kept in aviaries was not affected by a food restriction 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Dawson2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Dawson2">[29]</a>, however, as the birds were able to maintain body weight during the treatment they were possibly not restricted enough. Also, in most physiological studies like these, males are used, while it is the females that determine the timing of reproduction 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Caro1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Caro1">[30]</a>. It is likely that the female great tits in our field experiment were food restricted. If this would be the case, we would expect females in Oosterhout (which had a richer food supply) to advance egg laying compared to the control females, but not the Hoge Veluwe females. However, photostimulated females from the Oosterhout population also did not advance laying compared to the control groups in neither of two years. Therefore, we hypothesize that other supplementary cues, like temperature, or perhaps the availability of insects, prevented photostimulated females from laying early relative to the phenology of their environment.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While egg laying can not start before males 
  <span class="italic">and</span> females have fully developed reproductive organs, we only photostimulated female great tits in the field experiment. Field observations showed that the male reproductive system is functioning well before that of the females 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Farner1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Farner1">[22]</a>. Gonadal measurements of great tit breeding pairs in captivity confirmed this by showing that males have mature gonads sometimes weeks earlier compared to the exponential growth phase of female follicles 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Visser4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Visser4">[23]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0035617-Schaper2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035617-Schaper2">[31]</a>. Therefore, laying dates in wild birds are not likely to be restricted by the development of the male reproductive system.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is important to know which factors hamper the lack of shift in laying dates because these can have different implications on how to adapt to future climate change. If a shift in laying date is hampered by gonadal development (which our result suggest is it not), birds have to adjust their rules in which day length is used as a cue. Since climate change is not affecting day lengths, gonadal development is likely to restrict a shift in laying dates in the future. At the moment there seems be other reasons why the shift in the advancement of laying date lags behind this shift in the phenology of the food, leading to an increasing phenological mismatch between food availability and food requirements over the last decades. Future temperature increase will further this mismatch. A better understanding of the causes and consequences of the (in)ability of birds to adapt their timing of reproduction to restore the synchrony with their prey is important and will provide insights into the effects of future climate change on population viability
