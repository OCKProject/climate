  <p>Adjusted marginal 
   <span class="italic">r</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> of models with and without SNP
   <span class="sup">∗</span>temperature interaction. The marginal 
   <span class="italic">r</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> measures the variation explained by fixed effects only and is hence appropriate here because the random effects structure of the models is identical. The 
   <span class="italic">r</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> is only plotted for models in which either the SNP effect or the interaction SNP
   <span class="sup">∗</span>temperature was significant at the 0.05 level.
