 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">DNA was extracted from blood samples by using the FavorPrep 96-Well Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (Favorgen Biotech corp.). DNA quality and DNA concentration were measured on a Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific). A total of 2311 female great tits were genotyped using a custom made Affymetrix
  <span class="sup">®</span> great tit 650K SNP chip at Edinburgh Genomics (Edinburgh, United Kingdom). SNP calling was done following the Affymetrix
  <span class="sup">®</span> best practices workflow by using the Axiom
  <span class="sup">®</span> Analysis Suite 1.1. Eight individuals with dish quality control value of &lt;0.82 were discarded. Dish quality control is an Affymetrix-specific QC measure and we used the default threshold to exclude individual samples. The recommended SNP group (PolyHighResolution, NoMinorHom, MonoHighResolution, CallRateBelowThreshold, Hemizygous) consisted of 537174 SNPs while 73796 SNPs were discarded. In addition to the SNPs that did not pass the quality control steps, an additional 234 SNPs were removed because they were duplicates or the genomic position was missing (NCBI 
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span> genome version 1.1, GCA_001522545.2). Altogether 536940 SNPs passed initial quality control and 2303 individuals were included for downstream analyses.
