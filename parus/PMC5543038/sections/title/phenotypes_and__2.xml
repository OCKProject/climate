  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) has been studied in our long-term study populations on the ‘Veluwe’ area near Arnhem (52° 00′ N, 5° 50′ E, Netherlands) since the 1950s. Great tits are small, hole-breeding passerine birds that readily accept nest boxes, which has made them a ‘model system’ in behavioral and evolutionary ecology. In our study populations nest boxes are supplied in abundance so that almost the entire population breeds in boxes and can be monitored. Nest boxes were checked weekly in spring and the dates when the first egg of a clutch was laid (from now on: egg-laying date) were back-calculated from the number of recorded eggs assuming one egg is laid per day. All nestlings were banded with standard aluminum bird-bands and blood sampled when seven to 10-days-old. Adult great tits were caught when feeding their chicks with spring-traps in the nest box, identified from their bands, and blood-sampled. Whole blood samples were stored in either 1 ml Cell Lysis Solution (Gentra Puregene Kit, Qiagen, United States) or Queens buffer (
