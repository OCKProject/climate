 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Environmental change, as, e.g., global warming, will inevitably lead to novel selection pressures, especially in phenological traits, as, for example, timing of breeding, migration or hibernation (
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">Gienapp et al., 2014</a>), and in the long run only adaptive microevolution (‘evolutionary rescue’) will enable population persistence (
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">Bürger and Lynch, 1995</a>; 
  <a rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52">Visser, 2008</a>; 
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">Gienapp et al., 2013</a>; 
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">Gonzalez et al., 2013</a>). Understanding the genetics of traits that are affected by environmental change is important, as this will allow us to assess the adaptive potential of these traits. From quantitative genetic studies we know that many traits, including ecologically relevant phenological, life-history or behavioral traits, are heritable (
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">Mousseau and Roff, 1987</a>), and hence that evolutionary adaptation to climate change would be possible. Heritability is, however, not necessarily constant across environments (
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">Pigliucci, 2001</a>, 
  <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">2005</a>; 
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">Nussey et al., 2007</a>; 
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">Husby et al., 2011</a>), which complicates predictions about evolutionary adaptation. This is especially true when environmental conditions will shift beyond the currently observed range due to climate change. Consequently, in the end a better understanding of the genomics of the traits under selection will help us to predict whether they will be able to adapt fast enough to novel environmental conditions.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to the advancement in molecular genetics, it is now possible to map the loci that underlie traits of interest in natural populations of ‘ecological model species’ and this has moved the research field of ecological genetics into the genomics era (
  <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">Slate et al., 2010</a>). So far, however, the number of published mapping studies in natural populations is limited. Over the last decade, over 20 published studies aimed to identify loci underlying almost 40 traits in natural populations (Supplementary Table 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" href="#SM1">S1</a>). A number of studies successfully identified some of the loci underlying, for example, wing length in birds, age at maturity in Salmon, or birth weight and recombination rate in mammals (
  <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">Slate et al., 2002</a>; 
  <a rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46">Tarka et al., 2010</a>; 
  <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">Barson et al., 2015</a>; 
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">Johnston et al., 2016</a>). In these studies the identified loci explained moderate to substantial amounts of the genetic variation but in other studies that could identify loci the amount of variation explained by them was (very) small (e.g., 
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">Husby et al., 2015</a>; 
  <a rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58">Wenzel et al., 2015</a>). In general, in only about one third of the analyzed traits, one or more loci or genomic regions associated with the trait could be identified. The total number of studies aiming at mapping loci in wild populations that could not identify any locus may even be larger because these studies may simply not have been published due to their non-significant results. There are a number of possible reasons behind this limited success of gene-mapping in wild populations. For example, in some studies the number of individuals was only in the low hundreds. Heritabilities of life-history traits also tend to be low to moderate (
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">Mousseau and Roff, 1987</a>), which would make detecting loci more difficult. Another potential reason for the limited success of these gene-mapping studies in wild populations could be that phenotypic plasticity complicates the detection of relationships between genotype and phenotypes. Many life-history and behavioral traits but also morphological traits are phenotypically plastic (
  <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">Pigliucci, 2005</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In phenotypically plastic traits the same genotype can produce different phenotypes, and these different phenotypes can hence not be the product of genomic sequence variation alone but must be caused by environmentally induced differential gene expression or post-translational mechanisms (
  <a rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45">Snell-Rood et al., 2010</a>; 
  <a rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57">Weake and Workman, 2010</a>; 
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">Huntzinger and Izaurralde, 2011</a>). This means that the effects of certain genes will be reduced, entirely shut down, or altered under specific environmental conditions. Consider, for example, three genes, A, B and C, affecting a plastic trait: In environment X the expression of gene A may be up-regulated and the expression of gene B down-regulated, while in environment Y the expression of gene A may be down-regulated and the expression of gene B up-regulated. In contrast, the expression of gene C may be neither up- nor downregulated in these environments. A mapping study not taking phenotypic plasticity into account will only identify gene C as associated with the plastic trait because sequence variation in genes A and B is only associated with the trait in part of the data. If post-translational mechanisms are affected, the effect of a gene could not only disappear, due to environmentally dependent downregulation, but its phenotypic effects could even be reversed in one environment compared to the other. Only when modeling an interaction between marker effects and environment the effects of genes A and B will be detected. Such a variable genomic architecture of plastic traits may make detecting loci underlying such traits more difficult if phenotypes are measured in different environment, which is likely to be the case in natural populations, and phenotypic plasticity is not taken into account. Genotype-by-environment interactions have been tested in laboratory or medical studies (
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">Mackay et al., 2009</a>; 
  <a rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48">Thomas, 2010</a>) but not in studies of natural populations where their effects should, however, be even more important.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Breeding time, i.e., the timing of egg-laying, is a highly plastic trait in birds. Depending on spring temperature breeding time can vary by weeks from 1 year to the next (
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">Gienapp et al., 2005</a>, 
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">2010</a>; 
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">Charmantier et al., 2008</a>). Besides temperature, photoperiod is known to affect breeding time in birds (
  <a rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26">Lambrechts et al., 1997</a>; 
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">Lambrechts and Perret, 2000</a>) and there is also evidence that the roles of temperature and photoperiod differ in early and late spring (
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">Gienapp et al., 2005</a>, 
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">2010</a>). As pointed out above, phenological traits are expected to come under selection from climate change and increasing spring temperatures have led to mismatches between breeding time and food supply in birds and other species (
  <a rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55">Visser et al., 1998</a>; 
  <a rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53">Visser and Both, 2005</a>). Understanding the genomics of avian breeding time is hence interesting in the context of climate change, which makes it a very suitable candidate to test whether a variable genomic architecture can obscure genotype-phenotype links. We here use a unique data set consisting of wild 2045 female great tits with recorded egg-laying dates that also have been genotyped on a recently developed 650k SNP chip to test whether the association between SNPs and egg-laying date interacts with spring temperature.
