  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The timing of egg-laying of great tits (
   <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) has been studied in our long-term study populations on the ‘Veluwe’ area near Arnhem (52° 00′ N, 5° 50′ E, Netherlands) since the 1950s. Great tits are small, hole-breeding passerine birds that readily accept nest boxes, which has made them a ‘model system’ in behavioral and evolutionary ecology. In our study populations nest boxes are supplied in abundance so that almost the entire population breeds in boxes and can be monitored. Nest boxes were checked weekly in spring and the dates when the first egg of a clutch was laid (from now on: egg-laying date) were back-calculated from the number of recorded eggs assuming one egg is laid per day. All nestlings were banded with standard aluminum bird-bands and blood sampled when seven to 10-days-old. Adult great tits were caught when feeding their chicks with spring-traps in the nest box, identified from their bands, and blood-sampled. Whole blood samples were stored in either 1 ml Cell Lysis Solution (Gentra Puregene Kit, Qiagen, United States) or Queens buffer (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">DNA was extracted from blood samples by using the FavorPrep 96-Well Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (Favorgen Biotech corp.). DNA quality and DNA concentration were measured on a Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific). A total of 2311 female great tits were genotyped using a custom made Affymetrix
   <span class="sup">®</span> great tit 650K SNP chip at Edinburgh Genomics (Edinburgh, United Kingdom). SNP calling was done following the Affymetrix
   <span class="sup">®</span> best practices workflow by using the Axiom
   <span class="sup">®</span> Analysis Suite 1.1. Eight individuals with dish quality control value of &lt;0.82 were discarded. Dish quality control is an Affymetrix-specific QC measure and we used the default threshold to exclude individual samples. The recommended SNP group (PolyHighResolution, NoMinorHom, MonoHighResolution, CallRateBelowThreshold, Hemizygous) consisted of 537174 SNPs while 73796 SNPs were discarded. In addition to the SNPs that did not pass the quality control steps, an additional 234 SNPs were removed because they were duplicates or the genomic position was missing (NCBI 
   <span class="italic">Parus major</span> genome version 1.1, GCA_001522545.2). Altogether 536940 SNPs passed initial quality control and 2303 individuals were included for downstream analyses.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The GenABEL package v1.8-0 (
   <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">Aulchenko et al., 2007</a>) implemented in R v3.2.0 (
   <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">R Core Team, 2015</a>) was used to perform a quality control on the dataset. 15719 SNPs and 24 individuals were discarded, because of being monomorphic and/or a low call rate (&lt;95%). The mean autosomal heterozygosity was 0.342 and nine additional individuals were discarded because of a high heterozygosity (FDR &lt; 1%). The mean identity by state of SNPs (IBS) was 0.696 and 14 individuals were discarded because of high IBS value (≥0.95). We did not exclude SNPs that deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) because egg-laying date in our study populations is under directional selection and causal loci may therefore deviate from HWE. We used a MAF-threshold of 0.1 because we wanted to avoid small numbers of individuals for any genotype-temperature class group. We furthermore excluded all SNPs for that not all three genotypes were present and also SNPs that had less than 20 individuals in any genotype-temperature class group.

   <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">Purcell et al., 2007</a>) we calculated genomic relatedness, based on IBS, for all individuals across all SNPs and a genetic distance from this. This genetic distance matrix was then used, also in PLINK, for multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) to identify whether there was clustering of genetically similar individuals. Twenty-one individuals were identified as outliers and excluded (Supplementary Figure 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" href="#SM1">S1</a>). In total 384081 SNPs and 2249 individuals passed the quality control. Given the size of the great tit genome of about 1.02 Gbp (
   <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">Laine et al., 2015</a>) we have a coverage of roughly 1 SNP per 2700 bp. Of these individuals 2045 had records for at least one egg-laying date and could be included in the analysis.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Individual egg-laying dates were corrected for among-year and among-area variation prior to analyses by centering to the annual mean egg-laying date separately per area. To test whether SNP effects differed depending on spring temperature we divided the years in our data set into three categories according to their spring temperature. For every year we calculated the average daily mean temperature for the period March 11 to April 20. Average temperature during this period correlates best with annual mean egg-laying dates for our study population (
   <a rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54">Visser et al., 2006</a>). The used daily mean temperatures from the weather station De Bilt were obtained from the website of the Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute (KNMI
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="fn" rid="fn01" href="#fn01">1</a>
   </span>). We then calculated the 33%iles and grouped the first, second and third 33%ile into the ‘cold,’ ‘intermediate’ and ‘warm’ category, respectively. The ‘cold’ category comprised 1074 observed egg-laying date of 941 individuals in 6 years, the ‘intermediate’ category 770 observed egg-laying dates of 651 individuals in 6 years and the ‘warm’ category 1615 observed egg-laying dates of 1310 individuals in 5 years. Note that the total number of individuals in our analysis (2045) is not the sum of the individuals breeding in cold, intermediate and warm years, since the same individual can be included in more than one category. The average (and standard deviation in brackets) of the temperature during the period March 11 to April 20 was 6.2°C (0.96°C) for the ‘cold’ category, 7.8°C (0.27°C) for the ‘intermediate’ category, and 9.4°C (0.66°C) for the ‘warm’ category, respectively. Our model to test for SNP effect and their interaction with temperature was:

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All GWA analyses were run in ASReml-R 3.0 (
   <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">Gilmour et al., 2015</a>). Due to computation-time constraints we fitted the (sparse) relatedness matrix calculated from a pedigree instead of the (full) ‘genomic’ relatedness matrix. This should not affect the results as results for a simple model testing only the SNP effect (RepeatABEL cannot fit interactions) run in RepeatABEL (genomic relatedness matrix) and ASReml (pedigree relatedness matrix) correlated highly (Supplementary Figure 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" href="#SM1">S2</a>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An assumption underlying linear regression and ANOVA is that the variance of the dependent variable is homoscedastic with respect to the independent variable, i.e., that its variance does not change with the covariate in linear regression or that its variance is roughly equal in the different factor groups in ANOVA. If this assumption is violated, the resulting heteroscedasticity leads to biased results. This problem is exacerbated by fitting SNP
   <span class="sup">∗</span>environment interactions and can lead to inflation of 
   <span class="italic">p</span>-values as has been recognized in the field of psychiatric genetics (
   <a rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56">Voorman et al., 2011</a>; 
   <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">Almli et al., 2014</a>). To account for this problem we allowed the residual variance to differ among temperature classes in the models fitted with ASReml. Residual variances did indeed differ among temperature classes and fitting them avoided inflating 
   <span class="italic">p</span>-values. See Supplementary Materials for further details.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because the standard Bonferroni correction is generally considered overly conservative, an adjusted Bonferroni correction taking linkage disequilibrium (LD) between all SNP loci into account has been suggested (
   <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">Moskvina and Schmidt, 2008</a>). We calculated this correction with a sliding window of 20 SNPs using the software KEFF VSEP 2007 (
   <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">Moskvina and Schmidt, 2008</a>). However, because of low LD between SNPs in our great tit population, the amount of effective tests, on which the Bonferroni correction depends, dropped by just 4% and we hence did not apply this correction.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although previous work in of the study populations analyzed here showed that egg-laying dates are heritable in general (
   <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">Gienapp et al., 2006</a>; 
   <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">Husby et al., 2010</a>) and also under different spring temperatures (
   <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">Husby et al., 2011</a>), we here analyzed whether egg-laying date would be heritable in each of the three temperature classes. To increase the power of our analysis, we not only included the genotyped individuals but all females with known identity in our analysis. This data set consisted of 4624 observations of 4032 females, 3737 observations of 3019 females and 4147 of 3532 females for the cold, medium and warm temperature class, respectively. We hence had to include a pedigree-based relatedness matrix instead of a genomic relatedness matrix in our animal model. Besides the additive genetic (random) effect, we fitted female identity as random effect to account for repeated observations as well as age (two level factor as above), year (as factor), area, and the interaction year
   <span class="sup">∗</span>area as fixed effects. These analyses were also run in ASReml-R 3.0.
