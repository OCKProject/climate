 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using data from 2045 wild great tits that were genotyped for more than 500k SNPs we could not identify any SNPs that were associated with egg-laying date. However, including an interaction between SNP effects and spring temperature improved model fit (
  <span class="bold">Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">4</a>
  </span>) although no SNP reached significance after multiple testing correction (
  <span class="bold">Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">2</a>
  </span>). This result shows that including the effects that the environment has on genotype-phenotype relationship can improve our understanding of this relationship. This has been realized previously in some research fields, as, e.g., animal and plant breeding or psychiatrical genetics (
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">Kraft et al., 2007</a>; e.g., 
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">Lindström et al., 2009</a>; 
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">Korte and Farlow, 2013</a>; 
  <a rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42">Silva et al., 2014</a>) but not in evolutionary genomics of wild populations.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fitting an interaction between loci and an environmental variable can only identify loci that are responsible for trait variation in a given environment but not the loci that are responsible for phenotypic plasticity itself. Mapping the genes that are responsible for phenotypic plasticity by altering gene expression or post-translational mechanisms is possible if genetic variation in reaction norm slopes exist and reaction norms of individuals or genotypes, e.g., using clones, can be reliably quantified (e.g., 
  <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">Schadt et al., 2003</a>; 
  <a rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47">Tétard-Jones et al., 2011</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The phenotypic variance in egg-laying dates varied with temperature and to account for this heteroscedasticity we fitted heterogeneous residuals in more SNP
  <span class="sup">∗</span>temperature interaction model, i.e., allowed the residual variance to differ among temperature classes. Not doing so would have let to inflated 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-values because an important assumption of linear models was violated. This is a potential problem in many statistical analysis and may be more common but the 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-value inflation often goes undetected and becomes only apparent when a (very) large number of tests are performed, as for example in GWAS. The inflation of 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-values due to heteroscedasticity is likely more problematic when SNP
  <span class="sup">∗</span>environment interactions are fitted but could theoretically also occur when only SNP effects are tested. It is normally assumed that variants at a locus affect the mean but they may also affect the variance of the trait (e.g., 
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">Ansel et al., 2008</a>; 
  <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">Shen et al., 2012</a>) and thereby lead to heteroscedasticity among genotypes. An observed inflation in 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-values in GWAS may hence not only be due to population structure, which can be dealt with by applying ‘genomic control’ but also due to heteroscedasticity. In the latter case, however, applying ‘genomic control’ will not be sufficient and fitting heterogeneous residuals, as we did here, or other approaches (
  <a rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56">Voorman et al., 2011</a>) to correct for this problem are needed.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among the 10 most significant SNPs whose effects on breeding time differed depending on spring temperature in the year the phenotype was expressed, three were associated with genes of known function. One SNP is located within the thyroglobulin (
  <span class="italic">TG</span>) gene. Thyroglobulin is a precursor for thyroid hormones which form an integral part of the Hypothalamus–pituitary–thyroid axis, which has an important role in controlling general metabolism (
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">Dietrich et al., 2012</a>). In bulls the genetic variance in 
  <span class="italic">TG</span> has been linked to age of puberty (
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">Fernández et al., 2014</a>) and thyroid hormones affect reproduction in both sexes (
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">Flood et al., 2013</a>). Another SNP was located within the heparan sulfate-glucosamine 3-sulfotransferase 5 (
  <span class="italic">HS3ST5</span>) gene, which is involved in heparan sulfate biosynthesis and glycosaminoglycan metabolism. Heparan sulfate is involved in cell-signaling and has various essential functions in development and homeostasis (
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">Li and Kusche-Gullberg, 2016</a>). Like for 
  <span class="italic">HS3ST5</span>, Glycosaminoglycans are involved in cell-signaling and have structural functions in connective tissue, bone and blood vessels (
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">Esko et al., 2009</a>). The third SNP was located within the teneurin transmembrane protein 4 (
  <span class="italic">TENM4</span>). Teneurins are a highly conserved gene family that function as cell surface signal molecules and transcriptional regulators (
  <a rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49">Tucker and Chiquet-Ehrismann, 2006</a>). 
  <span class="italic">TENM4</span> has been shown to play a role in neural development in chicken (
  <a rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50">Tucker et al., 2000</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Genome-wide association studies have worked well in certain fields, e.g., in case-control studies of human diseases (
  <a rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51">Visscher et al., 2012</a>) but identifying genes underlying quantitative traits, especially in natural populations has proven to be much more difficult. Besides other reasons, as, e.g., unknown environmental effects on phenotypes that could not be accounted for, limited power or overly conservative multiple testing corrections, one potential reason for this is variation in phenotypes due to phenotypic plasticity. This variation can be accounted for if the environmental driver of the plasticity or the temporal or spatial scale on that it varies is known. For example, egg-laying dates vary strongly from year-to-year driven by spring temperatures. We can therefore account for this plasticity by correcting phenotypes for annual means; even if we had no idea which environmental variable was driving the annual variation. Phenotypic plasticity can, however, also ‘obscure’ genotype-phenotype associations because different loci are associated with the trait in different environments due to differential gene expression levels or post-translational mechanisms. An important aspect when testing whether genotype-phenotype associations vary across environments is obviously to identify the correct environmental variable that drives plastic variation in the trait. We here used spring temperature from March 11 to April 20, which has been shown to predict egg-laying dates fairly well in our study population (
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">Husby et al., 2011</a>), to classify our environment. However, using two temperature classes instead of three led to different results, in terms of the SNPs included in the best models. This highlights the problem of identifying a meaningful environmental variable when fitting SNP
  <span class="sup">∗</span>environment interactions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most traits are phenotypically plastic (
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">Pigliucci, 2001</a>) and the lack of awareness of the variable genetic architecture underlying plastic traits may explain why identifying genes underlying quantitative traits has proven to be a major challenge. We here found indication for such variable SNP effects in plastic traits. This demonstrates that explicitly modeling phenotypic plasticity can be crucial for genome-wide association studies, especially – but not only – in studies of wild populations, which would thereby contribute to our still limited knowledge of the genome-phenome link in ecologically relevant traits, which is especially important as species need to adapt to their changing world.
