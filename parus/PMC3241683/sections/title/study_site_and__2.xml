 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fieldwork was conducted on Kent Island, an isolated 80 ha island in the Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick, Canada (44°35′N, 66°45′W). The northern third of the island is comprised of spruce-fir forest (
  <span class="italic">Picea glauca</span>, 
  <span class="italic">P.rubens</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Abies balsamea</span>) and the southern two-thirds are characterized by old-field habitat. We studied a population of migratory Savannah sparrows inhabiting a 10 ha old-field located in the centre of the island. Savannah sparrows are grassland songbirds that breed in the northern United States and across Canada, and which mainly winter through the southern United States

  <a rid="pone.0028838-Wheelwright2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Wheelwright2">[29]</a>). Approximately 30% of breeding females on the island are double-brooded

  <a rid="pone.0028838-Dixon1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Dixon1">[31]</a>). Both adults and juveniles begin departing the island from mid-September through late October (GWM, DRN, personal observation). Kent Island represents an ideal study site to examine early developmental conditions in a migratory species because its small size restricts the scope of pre-migratory movements, which facilitates the recapture of individuals prior to migration. Natal philopatry is also high (median dispersal distance = 228 m and &lt;2 individuals per year were observed to have dispersed to surrounding islands across 10 years of census;
