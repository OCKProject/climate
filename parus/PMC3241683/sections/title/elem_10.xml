 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We predicted that nestling mass would be negatively influenced by the timing of nesting and brood size (

  <a ref-type="sec" rid="s1" href="#s1">Introduction</a> for hypotheses). We controlled for year because of potential differences in resource availability, weather, and predators across years

  <a rid="pone.0028838-Miller1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Miller1">[56]</a>. We examined two-way interactions between timing of nesting and year with number of nestlings and nestling mass, as well as two-way interactions between clutch size with year, timing of nesting with nestling mass, and clutch size with nestling mass (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028838.s015" href="#pone.0028838.s015">Table S11</a>). These interactions were examined because relationships between variables may vary across time owing to potential differences in environmental conditions both within and across years. Again, a random effect for natal nest was included to control for covariances among nest mates. Only one randomly selected nest per adult female was included in the analysis.

   <p>Solid black arrows represent significant relationships. Numbers associated with each solid line represent standardized path coefficients. The asterisks indicate significant year effects. Hatched lines represent hypothesized causal relationships that were not statistically significant (P&gt;0.05). The sign inside the parentheses associated with each hatched line represents the predicted direction of the relationship.</p>
