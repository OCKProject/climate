 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From 1989–1999, 2001, and 2008–2010, nests were located between 30 May–25 July by observing adult females during the nest building and incubation stages. When nestlings were 8 d old we measured mass using a top loading electronic balance (±0.1 g) and measured wing and tarsus lengths (±1 mm) according to Pyle 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Pyle1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Pyle1">[32]</a>. From 1987–2001, 188 of 635 nests were found after hatch and from 2008–2010, three of 60 nests were found following hatch. For these nests, age was estimated using plumage characteristics and behavior 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Wheelwright1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Wheelwright1">[28]</a>. Removal of these nests did not change the sign, magnitude, or overall significance of our final results, and so they were retained in our final analyses (

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028838.s006" href="#pone.0028838.s006">Table S2</a>). Nests were not visited after nestlings were 8 d old to reduce the risk of premature fledging. We used the date of the last nest visit as our measure of timing of nesting.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2009 and 2010, we carried out experimental brood manipulations to establish a causal link between nestling condition and number of fledglings. In 2009, nests were both reduced (−1 nestling) and enlarged (+1 nestling). Only nests that were initially comprised of four nestlings were manipulated. Nests involved in the manipulation were paired based on hatching date, and one nest in the pair was randomly chosen for reduction. The nestling from the reduced nest (three nestlings) was transferred to the other nest, making it enlarged (five nestlings). Nestlings were 1 d of age at the time of transfer. The control group in our experiment consisted of all un-manipulated nests comprised of four nestlings. Analysis of the 2009 data suggested that the enlarged treatment did not have a significant effect on nestling mass relative to control broods (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028838.s007" href="#pone.0028838.s007">Table S3</a>). Based on these results, we carried out only brood reductions in 2010. This was accomplished by removing one randomly chosen egg from a random subset of nests (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine if early life events carry forward into the pre-migratory period, individuals were captured from 10 August–16 October in 2008, 31 August–19 October in 2009, and 18 August–21 October in 2010. Based on extensive field observations of foraging and social interactions and previous experimental work, all juveniles were independent of their family groups during this period (independence occurs by about 25 d of age; 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Wheelwright4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Wheelwright4">[33]</a>). Juveniles were captured by flushing individuals from within a randomly chosen 50 m×50 m quadrat (29 in total) bordered on three sides by mist nets. All netting took place between 0700 and 1700 hr Atlantic Standard Time. Following capture, the same morphological measurements described for adults were taken for juveniles, as well as the condition measurements described below. Moult progression was assessed via the completeness of body moult and was scored as an ordinal variable (1≤25%, 2 = 25–49%, 3 = 50–74%, 4≥75%). Body moult was assessed because juveniles do not moult flight or tail feathers prior to their first autumn migration
