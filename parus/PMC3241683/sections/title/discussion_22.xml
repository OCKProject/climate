 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study is the first to simultaneously show that nestling mass is affected by brood size (through our brood manipulation experiments), that fledging condition carries over to affect pre-migratory fat stores immediately prior to migration, and that nestling condition is linked with 1
  <span class="sup">st</span> year survival in the same migratory population. A key prediction of the hypothesis that conditions during development limit survival during migration through their effects on pre-migratory body condition is demonstration of a positive relationship between nestling mass and pre-migratory body condition. Although we did not measure fat stores in nestling Savannah sparrows, recent evidence suggests that differences in nestling mass may be attributable to differences in quantities of fat

  <a rid="pone.0028838-Ardia1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Ardia1">[72]</a>, further suggesting that the positive relationship we observed between nesting mass and pre-migratory fat mass represents a positive correlation between fat stores in the nest and fat stores prior to migration. This correlation may be maintained by several mechanisms. For example, birds in poor body condition may be more susceptible to disease 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Saino2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Saino2">[73]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Moreno1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Moreno1">[74]</a>, resulting in additional maintenance costs that limit fat accumulation 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Meril1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Meril1">[25]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Svensson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Svensson1">[75]</a>. Alternatively, nutritional stress during development may impair cognitive function 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Nowicki1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Nowicki1">[57]</a>, affecting an individual's ability forage efficiently and accumulate fat. Individuals fledging in better condition may also exclude individuals in poor condition from favorable foraging sites 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Meril1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Meril1">[25]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Marra1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Marra1">[58]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Koivula1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Koivula1">[76]</a>, again preventing individuals from compensating for their poor condition. Further studies linking conditions during development with body condition, behavior, and immune system function during the pre-migratory period are needed to adequately test these hypotheses.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Indirect effects in path models are calculated as the product of the path coefficients along the indirect path (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028838-g001" href="#pone-0028838-g001">Fig. 1</a>). Our path model suggests that timing of nesting may affect pre-migratory body condition through two indirect mechanisms. First, timing of nesting had a negative indirect effect on pre-migratory fat mass through its effect on nestling mass (−0.33×0.24 = −0.08). Second, the negative effect of timing of nesting on moult progression (see also 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Neto1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Neto1">[66]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Bojarinova1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Bojarinova1">[70]</a>), and the negative effect of moult progression on total body water (see also 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Baggott1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Baggott1">[59]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Bauchinger1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Bauchinger1">[62]</a>), results in a positive indirect effect of timing of nesting on total body water (−0.35×(−0.27–0.22
  <span class="sup">2</span>) = 0.09+0.07
  <span class="sup">2</span>). However, this ‘positive’ effect results from late fledging individuals having yet to incur the lean tissue costs of moult. Perhaps this impending cost explains why we observed late fledging birds increasing lean tissue mass throughout the pre-migratory period, but did not see the same pattern for earlier fledging birds; late fledging birds may have been preemptively trying to mitigate the costs of moult associated with timing of nesting.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moult requires substantial amounts of protein to replace the integument that supports feather growth 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Murphy2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Murphy2">[60]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Murphy3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Murphy3">[61]</a>. However, most studies investigating the costs of moult in songbirds have taken place in the laboratory, where food is available 
  <span class="italic">ad libitum</span> (e.g., 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Murphy2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Murphy2">[60]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Murphy3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Murphy3">[61]</a>), making it difficult to assess how moult may affect lean tissue mass under natural conditions. Furthermore, when protein intake has been restricted, it is often at levels far below what would be encountered in the wild, and control groups are often still fed 
  <span class="italic">ad libitum</span> (e.g., 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Murphy4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Murphy4">[77]</a>). Our results suggest that moult progression may deplete pre-migratory lean tissue mass in wild birds. Similarly, Baggott 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Baggott1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Baggott1">[59]</a> found that pectoralis muscle mass was negatively correlated with moult progression in free-living willow warblers 
  <span class="italic">Phylloscopus trochilus</span>, and Bauchinger and Biebach 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Bauchinger1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Bauchinger1">[62]</a> found that kidney and pancreas mass was negatively correlated with moult progression in garden warblers 
  <span class="italic">Sylvia borin</span>. Our results and those of these other studies suggest the importance of assessing lean tissue costs of moult under natural conditions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results suggest that the timing of nesting influences moult progression. Similar results have also been found for juvenile great tits 
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span> and Savi's warblers 
  <span class="italic">Locustella luscinioides</span>
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Neto1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Neto1">[66]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Bojarinova1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Bojarinova1">[70]</a>. This pathway represents another mechanism through which early life events may limit survival during migration, or even during the subsequent wintering period. For example, the rate of moult (not assessed here) may increase for late fledging individuals, resulting in lower quality plumage, which in turn may result in decreased flight performance and impaired thermoregulation 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Nilsson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Nilsson1">[78]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Dawson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Dawson1">[80]</a>. Alternatively, delays in moult could constrain the timing of migratory departure 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Pulido1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Pulido1">[81]</a>. To address these hypotheses in migratory species, improvements in tracking technologies are needed to follow individuals from birth and monitor subsequent survival rates at each stage of the annual cycle.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found that pre-migratory total body water increased with date captured in 2008, but not in 2009 or 2010. Conversely, pre-migratory fat mass did not increase with date captured in 2008, but increased in both 2009 and 2010. These results suggest that individuals may be choosing to invest in either lean tissue mass or fat mass depending on current or anticipated conditions. For example, when food availability is unpredictable, songbirds tend to invest in fat mass 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Bednekoff1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Bednekoff1">[82]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Gosler1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Gosler1">[83]</a>. Alternatively, annual differences in food availability or weather conditions may constrain what aspects of body condition are to be invested towards. In our study region, the average daily precipitation for the months of August and September were 4.0, 2.8, and 2.3 mm in 2008, 2009, and 2010 respectively (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca</span>). Juvenile songbirds are inefficient foragers, and rainstorms are expected to hamper their foraging abilities even further 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Sullivan1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Sullivan1">[84]</a>. Therefore, the ‘unpredictable foraging conditions’ hypothesis predicts that individuals should invest in fat mass during 2008, however this is opposite to what we observe. Instead, increasing lean tissue mass in 2008 appears to be linked to precipitation through some other (unknown) causal mechanism.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results indicate that nestlings from larger broods had lower mass (controlling for tarsus length). However, opposite to our prediction, nestlings from larger broods had longer tarsi, suggesting that tarsus length in the nest is not affected by the same nutritional or energetic mechanisms as mass. Structural traits are often heritable in songbirds 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Alatalo1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Alatalo1">[85]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Smith1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Smith1">[86]</a>, and breeding females with longer tarsi tend to be high quality individuals that produce larger clutches 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Alatalo1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Alatalo1">[85]</a>. Therefore, the observed positive relationship between clutch size and tarsus length may be caused by a correlation between clutch size and tarsus length in the mother. Regardless of the exact mechanism resulting in this correlation, the net effect of clutch size on nestling mass was still negative (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028838-g001" href="#pone-0028838-g001">Fig. 1</a>; sum of direct and indirect effects of clutch size on nestling mass = (0.25×0.67)+−0.33 = −0.16).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Migration is energetically and physically demanding; lean tissue mass and fat mass are both critical to a successful migration 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Lindstrm2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Lindstrm2">[26]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Klaassen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Klaassen1">[27]</a>. Here we provide evidence that conditions during development affect survival during migration through their effects on pre-migratory body condition. Understanding these relationships is important given recent evidence that climate change and anthropogenic changes to landscape structure may affect the growth and development of nestlings (e.g., 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Zanette1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Zanette1">[87]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Both1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Both1">[88]</a>). Future research investigating the effects of environmental perturbations on migratory species should consider how early developmental conditions carry-over to influence individual success in subsequent life-history stages.
