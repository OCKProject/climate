  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028838-g001" href="#pone-0028838-g001">Fig. 1</a>) was consistent with the structure of our data (Fisher's C statistic = 119.32, df = 100, P = 0.091, i.e., our proposed model did not significantly differ from the correlational structure of the data). Timing of nesting was significantly later in 2009 than in 2008, but did not vary between 2008 and 2010 (2009: β = 0.90, t = 2.5, df = 57, P = 0.015; 2010: β = 0.22, t = 0.7, df = 57, P = 0.469; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028838-g001" href="#pone-0028838-g001">Fig. 1</a>). As predicted, the number of fledglings decreased as timing of nesting increased (β = −0.49, t = −4.0, df = 56, P&lt;0.001), but we did not find any evidence for a difference between years (2009: β = 0.01, t = 0.2, df = 56, P = 0.986; 2010: β = 0.35, t = 1.3, df = 56, P = 0.207). The main effects in our structural equation accounted for approximately 23% of the observed variation in number of fledglings.

Nestling mass also varied positively with tarsus length (β = 0.67, t = 8.9, df = 51, P&lt;0.001) and was greater in 2010 compared with 2008 (β = 0.43, t = 2.2, df = 55, P = 0.031), however, there was little evidence for a difference between 2008 and 2009 (β = 0.34, t = 1.4, df = 55, P = 0.174). Tarsus length increased as the number of nestlings increased (β = 0.25, t = 2.2, df = 55, P = 0.035) and was larger in both 2009 and 2010 relative to 2008 (2009: β = 0.66, t = 2.1, df = 55, P = 0.038; 2010: β = 0.61, t = 2.6, df = 55, P = 0.014). We did not find any evidence for a relationship between tarsus length and timing of nesting (β = −0.08, t = −0.7, df = 55, P = 0.509). The main effects in our structural equations accounted for approximately 53% of the observed variation in fledging mass and 14% of the observed variation in tarsus length.
