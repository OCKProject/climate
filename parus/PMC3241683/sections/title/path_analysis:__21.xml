 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The average number of captures during the pre-migratory period per individual was 4.8 in 2008 (range = 2–11, SD = 2.2, n = 33), 3.7 in 2009 (range = 2–8, SD = 1.4, n = 22), and 3.5 in 2010 (range = 2–11, SD = 1.63, n = 44). Average age at capture was 59, 66, and 63 d in 2008, 2009, and 2010, respectively (2008: range = 27–114, SD = 21.7, n = 52; 2009: range = 48–105, SD = 15.2, n = 36; 2010: range = 32–98, SD = 15.2, n = 81).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As predicted, we found a positive relationship between fat mass during the pre-migratory period and nestling mass (β = 0.24, t = 2.9, df = 28, P = 0.008; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028838-g001" href="#pone-0028838-g001">Fig. 1</a>, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028838-g004" href="#pone-0028838-g004">Fig. 4b</a>, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028838.s016" href="#pone.0028838.s016">Table S12</a>), but only weak evidence for a relationship between total body water and nestling mass (β = 0.16, t = 1.9, df = 28, P = 0.064). Also as predicted, moult progression influenced total body water (linear term for moult progression: β = −0.27, 
  <span class="italic">t</span> = −2.61, df = 48, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.012; curvilinear term for moult progression: β = −0.22, t = −2.33, df = 48, P = 0.024; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028838-g004" href="#pone-0028838-g004">Fig. 4c</a>), but we did not find evidence for a relationship between fat mass and moult progression (β = 0.13, t = 1.2, df = 50, P = 0.219). Total body water varied with timing of nesting, however, this relationship was dependent on date captured: total body water did not vary with date captured for birds fledging early or in the middle of the breeding period, but increased as date captured increased for late fledging birds (β = 0.13, t = 2.1, df = 48, P = 0.040; 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028838.s003" href="#pone.0028838.s003">Fig. S3</a>, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028838.s015" href="#pone.0028838.s015">Table S11</a>). We did not find any evidence for a relationship between pre-migratory fat mass and timing of nesting (β = −0.08, t = −0.9, df = 46, P = 0.399).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both total body water and fat mass varied with date captured, but the direction of these relationships was different across years. Specifically, total body water increased as date captured increased in 2008, but decreased during 2009 and 2010 (β = −0.34, t = −5.8, df = 48, P&lt;0.001; 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028838.s004" href="#pone.0028838.s004">Fig. S4a</a>–c). Conversely, fat mass did not change with date captured in 2008, but increased with date captured in 2009 and 2010 (β = 0.32, t = 4.3, df = 50, P&lt;0.001; 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028838.s004" href="#pone.0028838.s004">Fig. S4d</a>–f). After controlling for these interactions, total body water was higher on average in 2009 relative to 2008 (β = 1.23, t = 4.8, df = 46, P&lt;0.001), but we did not find evidence for a difference between 2008 and 2010 (β = −0.21, t = −1.0, df = 46, P = 0.329). Conversely, fat mass was on average lower in 2009 relative to 2008 (β = −0.68, t = −2.9, df = 46, P = 0.006), but again, we did not find evidence for a difference between 2008 and 2010 (β = −0.38, t = −1.8, df = 46, P = 0.077). Fat mass increased with time of day (time captured: β = 0.19, t = 2.6, df = 50, P = 0.014; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028838-g001" href="#pone-0028838-g001">Fig. 1</a>, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028838.s016" href="#pone.0028838.s016">Table S12</a>), but we did not find evidence for a similar relationship with total body water (β = 0.07, t = 1.2, df = 48, P = 0.252). We also did not find any evidence for a relationship between total body water or fat mass with tarsus length (total body water: β = 0.12, t = 1.4, df = 28, P = 0.183; fat mass: β = −0.11, t = −1.3, df = 28, P = 0.210). The main and interaction effects in our structural equations for total body water and fat mass accounted for approximately 54% and 36% of the observed variation in each variable, respectively.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As predicted, the progression of body moult was negatively influenced by the timing of nesting (β = −0.35, t = −4.0, df = 46, P&lt;0.001) and increased as date captured increased (β = 0.42, t = 7.0, df = 53, P&lt;0.001). Progression of body moult was also more advanced in 2010 than in 2008, but we did not find any evidence for a difference between 2008 and 2009 (2009: β = 0.26, t = 1.0, df = 46, P = 0.302; 2010: β = 1.03, t = 5.1, df = 46, P&lt;0.001). The main effects in this structural equation accounted for approximately 50% of the observed variation in moult progression. As expected, tarsus length was strongly and positively related to tarsus length in the nest (β = 0.58, t = 7.5, df = 50, P&lt;0.001).</p>
