 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We predicted nestling mass would positively influence 1
  <span class="sup">st</span> year survival (see 
  <a ref-type="sec" rid="s1" href="#s1">Introduction</a> for hypotheses) and that the timing of nesting would negatively influence survival. We made the latter prediction because optimal conditions for migration are hypothesized to decrease through time, possibly limiting survival immediately before or during migration

  <a rid="pone.0028838-Newton3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Newton3">[55]</a>. Random effects for natal nest nested within mother id nested within year were included to control for covariances among nest mates, related individuals, and individuals from the same cohort.
