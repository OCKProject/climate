  <a rid="pone.0028838-Monaghan1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Monaghan1">[3]</a>. Many of these long-term effects occur over varying time scales and under specific ecological contexts 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Monaghan1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Monaghan1">[3]</a>. In migratory animals, the annual cycle is comprised of a series of life history stages that often take place over broad geographical areas, allowing individuals to take advantage of seasonal fluctuations in resources

Critical to understanding how conditions during development affect future performance and fitness in migratory animals is being able to track individuals from development through successive life history stages

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In many species of migratory songbirds, both experimental and natural variation in brood size can affect the condition of young in the nest, likely owing to either a decrease in available food per individual as brood size increases (6 of 9 species reviewed by 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Dijkstra1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Dijkstra1">[8]</a>, see also

  <a rid="pone.0028838-Tremblay1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Tremblay1">[13]</a>) or to an increase in energy expenditure associated with begging as brood size increases

  <a rid="pone.0028838-Kilner1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Kilner1">[15]</a>. Similarly, the condition of young is also affected by natural and experimental variation in the timing of nesting, owing to either decreases in resource availability or parental provisioning rates as the breeding season progresses

  <a rid="pone.0028838-Verhulst2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Verhulst2">[17]</a>. Furthermore, survival until the following breeding season (hereafter 1
  <span class="sup">st</span> year survival) tends to be positively correlated with nestling mass (12 of 14 species reviewed;

  <a rid="pone.0028838-Lindn1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Lindn1">[20]</a>). Together, these studies suggest that conditions during development can affect 1
  <span class="sup">st</span> year survival in migrants. However, because juveniles move large distances prior to migration

  <a rid="pone.0028838-Winkler1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Winkler1">[24]</a>, documenting the proximate mechanisms linking conditions during development with 1
  <span class="sup">st</span> year survival has been challenging.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One mechanism that may lead to a positive correlation between the condition of young and 1
  <span class="sup">st</span> year survival in migratory birds is if body condition in the nest carries forward into the pre-migratory period, when individuals need to build sufficient reserves to make long distance flights 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Meril1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Meril1">[25]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Klaassen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Klaassen1">[27]</a>. If young in poor condition are unable to compensate for their lower condition, then survival during migration may be compromised. In this paper, we first use a long-term dataset and a field experiment to show that nestling mass in a migratory population of Savannah sparrows is affected by nutritional or energetic constraints experienced during development and that 1
  <span class="sup">st</span> year survival is strongly related to nestling mass. We then examine the hypothesis that conditions during development affect 1
  <span class="sup">st</span> year survival through their effect on migratory body condition. Following this hypothesis, we predicted a positive relationship between pre-migratory lean tissue mass and pre-migratory fat mass with nestling mass. Using comprehensive experimental and observational data spanning multiple years and life-history stages, we provide the first evidence that conditions during development limit survival during migration through their effects on pre-migratory fat stores.
