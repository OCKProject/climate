  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fieldwork was conducted on Kent Island, an isolated 80 ha island in the Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick, Canada (44°35′N, 66°45′W). The northern third of the island is comprised of spruce-fir forest (
   <span class="italic">Picea glauca</span>, 
   <span class="italic">P.rubens</span>, and 
   <span class="italic">Abies balsamea</span>) and the southern two-thirds are characterized by old-field habitat. We studied a population of migratory Savannah sparrows inhabiting a 10 ha old-field located in the centre of the island. Savannah sparrows are grassland songbirds that breed in the northern United States and across Canada, and which mainly winter through the southern United States 
   <a rid="pone.0028838-Wheelwright1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Wheelwright1">[28]</a>. On Kent Island, median clutch size is four eggs (mean = 4.17, SD = 0.62, n = 1667 clutches; NTW unpublished data, 
   <a rid="pone.0028838-Wheelwright2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Wheelwright2">[29]</a>). Approximately 30% of breeding females on the island are double-brooded 
   <a rid="pone.0028838-Wheelwright3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Wheelwright3">[30]</a>. Nestlings typically fledge the nest at 9 d of age (range 9–11; 
   <a rid="pone.0028838-Wheelwright1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Wheelwright1">[28]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0028838-Dixon1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Dixon1">[31]</a>). Both adults and juveniles begin departing the island from mid-September through late October (GWM, DRN, personal observation). Kent Island represents an ideal study site to examine early developmental conditions in a migratory species because its small size restricts the scope of pre-migratory movements, which facilitates the recapture of individuals prior to migration. Natal philopatry is also high (median dispersal distance = 228 m and &lt;2 individuals per year were observed to have dispersed to surrounding islands across 10 years of census; 
   <a rid="pone.0028838-Wheelwright3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Wheelwright3">[30]</a>), allowing for a robust assessment of 1

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From 1989–1999, 2001, and 2008–2010, nests were located between 30 May–25 July by observing adult females during the nest building and incubation stages. When nestlings were 8 d old we measured mass using a top loading electronic balance (±0.1 g) and measured wing and tarsus lengths (±1 mm) according to Pyle 
   <a rid="pone.0028838-Pyle1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Pyle1">[32]</a>. From 1987–2001, 188 of 635 nests were found after hatch and from 2008–2010, three of 60 nests were found following hatch. For these nests, age was estimated using plumage characteristics and behavior 
   <a rid="pone.0028838-Wheelwright1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Wheelwright1">[28]</a>. Removal of these nests did not change the sign, magnitude, or overall significance of our final results, and so they were retained in our final analyses (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028838.s005" href="#pone.0028838.s005">Table S1</a>, 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028838.s006" href="#pone.0028838.s006">Table S2</a>). Nests were not visited after nestlings were 8 d old to reduce the risk of premature fledging. We used the date of the last nest visit as our measure of timing of nesting.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2009 and 2010, we carried out experimental brood manipulations to establish a causal link between nestling condition and number of fledglings. In 2009, nests were both reduced (−1 nestling) and enlarged (+1 nestling). Only nests that were initially comprised of four nestlings were manipulated. Nests involved in the manipulation were paired based on hatching date, and one nest in the pair was randomly chosen for reduction. The nestling from the reduced nest (three nestlings) was transferred to the other nest, making it enlarged (five nestlings). Nestlings were 1 d of age at the time of transfer. The control group in our experiment consisted of all un-manipulated nests comprised of four nestlings. Analysis of the 2009 data suggested that the enlarged treatment did not have a significant effect on nestling mass relative to control broods (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028838.s007" href="#pone.0028838.s007">Table S3</a>). Based on these results, we carried out only brood reductions in 2010. This was accomplished by removing one randomly chosen egg from a random subset of nests (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028838.s008" href="#pone.0028838.s008">Table S4</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine if early life events carry forward into the pre-migratory period, individuals were captured from 10 August–16 October in 2008, 31 August–19 October in 2009, and 18 August–21 October in 2010. Based on extensive field observations of foraging and social interactions and previous experimental work, all juveniles were independent of their family groups during this period (independence occurs by about 25 d of age; 
   <a rid="pone.0028838-Wheelwright4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Wheelwright4">[33]</a>). Juveniles were captured by flushing individuals from within a randomly chosen 50 m×50 m quadrat (29 in total) bordered on three sides by mist nets. All netting took place between 0700 and 1700 hr Atlantic Standard Time. Following capture, the same morphological measurements described for adults were taken for juveniles, as well as the condition measurements described below. Moult progression was assessed via the completeness of body moult and was scored as an ordinal variable (1≤25%, 2 = 25–49%, 3 = 50–74%, 4≥75%). Body moult was assessed because juveniles do not moult flight or tail feathers prior to their first autumn migration 
   <a rid="pone.0028838-Pyle1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Pyle1">[32]</a>, and body feathers comprise 70% of a bird's total plumage mass

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Condition (age = 8 d) in the nest was assessed using mass while controlling for tarsus length (structural size). In Savannah sparrows, tarsus length is positively correlated with overall skeletal size 
   <a rid="pone.0028838-Rising1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Rising1">[36]</a>. Because body mass may not scale linearly with tarsus length (
   <a rid="pone.0028838-Green1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Green1">[37]</a>, although see 
   <a rid="pone.0028838-SchulteHostedde1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-SchulteHostedde1">[38]</a>), curvilinear relationships between mass and tarsus were considered in each model. For the 1989–2001 dataset used in the analysis of 1
   <span class="sup">st</span> year survival the relationship between mass and tarsus was slightly convex and so a curvilinear term was included in this model (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028838.s001" href="#pone.0028838.s001">Fig. S1a</a>). In all other models the relationship was linear (curvilinear terms were not statistically significant), so a linear term for tarsus length was used (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Body condition during the pre-migratory period was assessed using (1) total body water, a surrogate for lean tissue mass (muscle+organ mass+gut contents), and (2) fat mass. Both of the latter measures were assessed using heavy water dilution 
   <a rid="pone.0028838-Eichhorn1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Eichhorn1">[39]</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0028838-Speakman1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Speakman1">[41]</a>. For a detailed summary of our methods involving heavy water dilution, please refer to Rae 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>
   <a rid="pone.0028838-Rae1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Rae1">[42]</a>. Briefly, heavy water dilution involves introducing a known quantity and concentration of deuterium labeled water (D
   <sub>2</sub>O) into the body of an organism, allowing it to reach equilibrium, and then taking a blood sample to measure the concentration in the water distilled from the blood. The dilution of D
   <sub>2</sub>O is then multiplied by the initial injection mass of D
   <sub>2</sub>O and a correction factor for the exchange of the heavy hydrogen with non-water molecules to estimate the mass of total body water.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fat mass was measured using the residuals of the regression between body mass and total body water while controlling for tarsus length and repeated measures on individuals through time with a random effect. We measured fat mass using heavy water dilution, because in Savannah sparrows, visual fat scores are not a reliable measure of actual quantities of fat, particularly for low fat scores 
   <a rid="pone.0028838-Connell1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Connell1">[43]</a>. Although we lack a validated model for both our measures of total body water and our index of fat mass (see 
   <a rid="pone.0028838-Rae1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Rae1">[42]</a>), we suggest both measures of body condition are robust. First, with respect to our estimates of total body water representing an index of lean tissue mass, Karasov and Pinshow 
   <a rid="pone.0028838-Karasov1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Karasov1">[40]</a> found a strong correlation between deuterium dilution space and lean tissue mass as determined via chemical extraction (R
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.84) in a similar sized species to the Savannah sparrow, the black cap 
   <span class="italic">Sylvia atricapilla</span>. Second, any unexplained variation in mass not accounted for by total body water after accounting for skeletal size will be mostly due to fat.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For nestlings of altricial species, such as the Savannah sparrow, measurements of total body water using heavy water dilution may over estimate lean tissue mass for two reasons. First, deuterium may be incorporated into rapidly growing tissues, over estimating deuterium dilution space and total body water 
   <a rid="pone.0028838-Williams1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Williams1">[44]</a>. Second, the tissues of young nestling songbirds retain extra water 
   <a rid="pone.0028838-Austin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Austin1">[45]</a>. However, the growth rate of both lean and dry mass in nestling Savannah sparrows reach their asymptotes by approximately 8 d of age 
   <a rid="pone.0028838-Williams2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Williams2">[46]</a> and excess tissue water in similarly sized rufous-winged sparrows 
   <span class="italic">Aimophila carpalis</span> declines to adult levels by approximately 7 d of age 
   <a rid="pone.0028838-Austin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Austin1">[45]</a>. Therefore, given the age of our study individuals during the pre-migratory period (≥27 d of age), heavy water dilution provides an accurate measure of lean tissue mass.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2008, 2009, and 2010, three, eight, and 22 individuals, respectively, were carrying radio transmitters during the pre-migratory period (0.62 g; Lotek, Newmarket, Ontario) as part of a larger study on migratory movements. In a recent analysis, we showed that radio transmitters had no effect on total body water or quantity of fat before migration 
   <a rid="pone.0028838-Rae1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Rae1">[42]</a>. Also, inclusion of a radio term in our models (0 = no radio, 1 = radio) was not significant and did not change the sign or magnitude of any parameter estimates in our final models (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028838.s009" href="#pone.0028838.s009">Table S5</a>,

   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028838.s011" href="#pone.0028838.s011">Table S7</a>). Thus, for parsimony, this term was not included in our final models. Additionally, in 2008, all nestlings from 12 nests received phosphate-buffered saline as a nutritional supplement and all nestlings from four nests received a hypothesized immune system booster (lysozyme). Similarly, in 2009, one nestling from three nests also received phosphate buffered saline. However, neither treatment had an effect on nestling mass (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028838.s012" href="#pone.0028838.s012">Table S8</a>) and removing these individuals had no effect on the relationship between clutch size and nestling mass in either our observational or experimental analyses (

   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028838.s014" href="#pone.0028838.s014">Table S10</a>), and so were not censored from any analysis.

   <a rid="pone.0028838-Shipley2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Shipley2">[51]</a>. The fit of a GMLP model is assessed using the concept of d-sep (distance separation) tests 
   <a rid="pone.0028838-Shipley1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Shipley1">[50]</a>. A d-sep test represents a test of the statistical independence between two variables. Shipley 
   <a rid="pone.0028838-Shipley1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Shipley1">[50]</a> shows that for each acyclic path model, there is a subset of independence tests referred to as a “minimum basis set” that account for all possible independence relationships. The null probabilities (P-values) from each test are used to calculate Fisher's C statistic: C = −2∑ln(P)), where P represents the null probability (the P-value) of each d-sep test (total = K), and where C follows a χ
   <span class="sup">2</span> distribution with 2*K degrees of freedom

A significant P-value for this test (P&lt;0.05), suggests the structure of the path model is not consistent with the empirical data. Once model fit is assessed, each path or structural equation is parameterized using the appropriate statistical model.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All model fitting was done using generalized linear mixed effects models. Significance of parameter estimates was evaluated at α = 0.05. Significance of random effects was evaluated using 95% confidence intervals for the SD estimate of the intercepts. Prior to model fitting, potential curvilinear relationships were visually assessed using scatter plots fitted with loess lines. Model fit was visually assessed using residual plots. Correlations between predictors were evaluated through the variance-covariance matrix of the fitted model (r≥0.7); in no case were model terms highly correlated. The approximate proportion of variation accounted for by each model was assessed via regressions of observed and fitted values derived from models without random effects. For the path analysis, each variable was standardized ([value−X̄]/SD) such that path coefficients represent standardized partial regression coefficients, or the standard deviation change in y when x is increased or decreased by one SD

We also predicted that the progression of moult would negatively influence total body water given increased protein demands by tissues that support feather growth

    <a rid="pone.0028838-Bauchinger1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Bauchinger1">[62]</a>, and that moult would negatively influence fat mass given increased thermoregulatory costs and a higher basal metabolic rate during moult (

    <a rid="pone.0028838-Bonier1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Bonier1">[67]</a>). We included time captured in our path model because body mass may vary with time of day

    <a rid="pone.0028838-JenniEiermann1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-JenniEiermann1">[68]</a>. We included date captured because migratory birds generally improve condition through time in preparation for migration

    <a rid="pone.0028838-Bairlein1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Bairlein1">[69]</a>. A term for year was also included. We examined two-way interactions between nestling mass, timing of nesting, and moult progression with date captured and year, and two-way interactions between nestling mass with timing of nesting and year with date captured (
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028838.s015" href="#pone.0028838.s015">Table S11</a>). Owing to ontogeny, we also examined whether timing of nesting and date of capture influenced moult progression

    <a rid="pone.0028838-Bojarinova1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Bojarinova1">[70]</a>. Last, we tested for differences in moult progression across years and examined the effect of two-way interactions between timing of nesting, date captured, and year on moult (

All structural equations for the pre-migratory period included a random effect for individual nested within natal nest to control for covariances within individuals and among nest mates, respectively.
