 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All analyses were conducted in R version 2.8.1 using the ‘nlme’ or the ‘MASS’ packages 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-R1">[47]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Ripley1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Ripley1">[49]</a>. The effects of conditions during development on pre-migratory body condition were analyzed in a generalized multi-level path (GMLP) modeling framework using restricted maximum likelihood estimates 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Shipley1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Shipley1">[50]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Shipley2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Shipley2">[51]</a>. A GMLP model is a type of path analysis that can easily accommodate small sample sizes, non-normally distributed data, non-linear functional relationships, and random effects 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Shipley1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Shipley1">[50]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Shipley2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Shipley2">[51]</a>. The fit of a GMLP model is assessed using the concept of d-sep (distance separation) tests 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Shipley1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Shipley1">[50]</a>. A d-sep test represents a test of the statistical independence between two variables. Shipley 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Shipley1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Shipley1">[50]</a> shows that for each acyclic path model, there is a subset of independence tests referred to as a “minimum basis set” that account for all possible independence relationships. The null probabilities (P-values) from each test are used to calculate Fisher's C statistic: C = −2∑ln(P)), where P represents the null probability (the P-value) of each d-sep test (total = K), and where C follows a χ
  <span class="sup">2</span> distribution with 2*K degrees of freedom 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Shipley1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Shipley1">[50]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Shipley2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Shipley2">[51]</a>. A significant P-value for this test (P&lt;0.05), suggests the structure of the path model is not consistent with the empirical data. Once model fit is assessed, each path or structural equation is parameterized using the appropriate statistical model.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All model fitting was done using generalized linear mixed effects models. Significance of parameter estimates was evaluated at α = 0.05. Significance of random effects was evaluated using 95% confidence intervals for the SD estimate of the intercepts. Prior to model fitting, potential curvilinear relationships were visually assessed using scatter plots fitted with loess lines. Model fit was visually assessed using residual plots. Correlations between predictors were evaluated through the variance-covariance matrix of the fitted model (r≥0.7); in no case were model terms highly correlated. The approximate proportion of variation accounted for by each model was assessed via regressions of observed and fitted values derived from models without random effects. For the path analysis, each variable was standardized ([value−X̄]/SD) such that path coefficients represent standardized partial regression coefficients, or the standard deviation change in y when x is increased or decreased by one SD

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two-way interactions were initially assessed one at a time using the cross-product values of the terms involved in the interactions (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028838.s015" href="#pone.0028838.s015">Table S11</a>). For those interactions that were significant, we replaced the cross-product terms with the standardized cross-product residuals according to Lance 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Lance1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Lance1">[52]</a>. This procedure eliminates covariances between the interaction term and the terms involved in the interaction, thereby reducing the number of parameters (paths) in the path model. Only significant interactions were included in the final path model for parsimony.
