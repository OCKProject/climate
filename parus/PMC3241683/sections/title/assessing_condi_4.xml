 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Condition (age = 8 d) in the nest was assessed using mass while controlling for tarsus length (structural size). In Savannah sparrows, tarsus length is positively correlated with overall skeletal size 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Rising1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Rising1">[36]</a>. Because body mass may not scale linearly with tarsus length (
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Green1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Green1">[37]</a>, although see 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-SchulteHostedde1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-SchulteHostedde1">[38]</a>), curvilinear relationships between mass and tarsus were considered in each model. For the 1989–2001 dataset used in the analysis of 1
  <span class="sup">st</span> year survival the relationship between mass and tarsus was slightly convex and so a curvilinear term was included in this model (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028838.s001" href="#pone.0028838.s001">Fig. S1a</a>). In all other models the relationship was linear (curvilinear terms were not statistically significant), so a linear term for tarsus length was used (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Body condition during the pre-migratory period was assessed using (1) total body water, a surrogate for lean tissue mass (muscle+organ mass+gut contents), and (2) fat mass. Both of the latter measures were assessed using heavy water dilution 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Eichhorn1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Eichhorn1">[39]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Speakman1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Speakman1">[41]</a>. For a detailed summary of our methods involving heavy water dilution, please refer to Rae 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span>
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Rae1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Rae1">[42]</a>. Briefly, heavy water dilution involves introducing a known quantity and concentration of deuterium labeled water (D
  <sub>2</sub>O) into the body of an organism, allowing it to reach equilibrium, and then taking a blood sample to measure the concentration in the water distilled from the blood. The dilution of D
  <sub>2</sub>O is then multiplied by the initial injection mass of D
  <sub>2</sub>O and a correction factor for the exchange of the heavy hydrogen with non-water molecules to estimate the mass of total body water.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fat mass was measured using the residuals of the regression between body mass and total body water while controlling for tarsus length and repeated measures on individuals through time with a random effect. We measured fat mass using heavy water dilution, because in Savannah sparrows, visual fat scores are not a reliable measure of actual quantities of fat, particularly for low fat scores 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Connell1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Connell1">[43]</a>. Although we lack a validated model for both our measures of total body water and our index of fat mass (see 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Rae1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Rae1">[42]</a>), we suggest both measures of body condition are robust. First, with respect to our estimates of total body water representing an index of lean tissue mass, Karasov and Pinshow 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Karasov1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Karasov1">[40]</a> found a strong correlation between deuterium dilution space and lean tissue mass as determined via chemical extraction (R
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.84) in a similar sized species to the Savannah sparrow, the black cap 
  <span class="italic">Sylvia atricapilla</span>. Second, any unexplained variation in mass not accounted for by total body water after accounting for skeletal size will be mostly due to fat.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For nestlings of altricial species, such as the Savannah sparrow, measurements of total body water using heavy water dilution may over estimate lean tissue mass for two reasons. First, deuterium may be incorporated into rapidly growing tissues, over estimating deuterium dilution space and total body water 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Williams1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Williams1">[44]</a>. Second, the tissues of young nestling songbirds retain extra water 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Austin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Austin1">[45]</a>. However, the growth rate of both lean and dry mass in nestling Savannah sparrows reach their asymptotes by approximately 8 d of age 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Williams2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Williams2">[46]</a> and excess tissue water in similarly sized rufous-winged sparrows 
  <span class="italic">Aimophila carpalis</span> declines to adult levels by approximately 7 d of age 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Austin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Austin1">[45]</a>. Therefore, given the age of our study individuals during the pre-migratory period (≥27 d of age), heavy water dilution provides an accurate measure of lean tissue mass.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2008, 2009, and 2010, three, eight, and 22 individuals, respectively, were carrying radio transmitters during the pre-migratory period (0.62 g; Lotek, Newmarket, Ontario) as part of a larger study on migratory movements. In a recent analysis, we showed that radio transmitters had no effect on total body water or quantity of fat before migration 
  <a rid="pone.0028838-Rae1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Rae1">[42]</a>. Also, inclusion of a radio term in our models (0 = no radio, 1 = radio) was not significant and did not change the sign or magnitude of any parameter estimates in our final models (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028838.s009" href="#pone.0028838.s009">Table S5</a>, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028838.s010" href="#pone.0028838.s010">Table S6</a>, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028838.s011" href="#pone.0028838.s011">Table S7</a>). Thus, for parsimony, this term was not included in our final models. Additionally, in 2008, all nestlings from 12 nests received phosphate-buffered saline as a nutritional supplement and all nestlings from four nests received a hypothesized immune system booster (lysozyme). Similarly, in 2009, one nestling from three nests also received phosphate buffered saline. However, neither treatment had an effect on nestling mass (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028838.s012" href="#pone.0028838.s012">Table S8</a>) and removing these individuals had no effect on the relationship between clutch size and nestling mass in either our observational or experimental analyses (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028838.s013" href="#pone.0028838.s013">Table S9</a>, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028838.s014" href="#pone.0028838.s014">Table S10</a>), and so were not censored from any analysis.
