   <a rid="pone.0028838-Miller1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Miller1">[56]</a>. We examined two-way interactions between timing of nesting and year with number of nestlings and nestling mass, as well as two-way interactions between clutch size with year, timing of nesting with nestling mass, and clutch size with nestling mass (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028838.s015" href="#pone.0028838.s015">Table S11</a>). These interactions were examined because relationships between variables may vary across time owing to potential differences in environmental conditions both within and across years. Again, a random effect for natal nest was included to control for covariances among nest mates. Only one randomly selected nest per adult female was included in the analysis.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We predicted that nestling mass would be positively correlated with total body water and fat mass because individuals in poor condition may not be able to compensate for their poor start owing to impaired cognition, increased susceptibility to disease both in and out of the nest, or size related dominance hierarchies at high quality foraging locations

We also predicted that the progression of moult would negatively influence total body water given increased protein demands by tissues that support feather growth

   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028838.s015" href="#pone.0028838.s015">Table S11</a>). Owing to ontogeny, we also examined whether timing of nesting and date of capture influenced moult progression

   <a rid="pone.0028838-Bojarinova1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0028838-Bojarinova1">[70]</a>. Last, we tested for differences in moult progression across years and examined the effect of two-way interactions between timing of nesting, date captured, and year on moult (

All structural equations for the pre-migratory period included a random effect for individual nested within natal nest to control for covariances within individuals and among nest mates, respectively.
