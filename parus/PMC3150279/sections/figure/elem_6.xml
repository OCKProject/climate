   <span class="bold">Bayesian skyline plot representing historical demographic trends in two mitochondrial DNA lineages of 
    <span class="italic">G. elliotii</span>
   </span>. The × axis is in units of millions of years ago and is estimated based on a rate of 0.78 × 10

   </span>τ (the product of the effective female population size and the generation time in years (log transformed)). Estimates of means are joined by a solid line while the dashed lines delineate the 95% HPD limits. Blue represents the north-eastern lineage and green the southern lineage. The abbreviation MIS refers to marine isotope stage.
