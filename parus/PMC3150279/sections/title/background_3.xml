 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climatic oscillations over the past few million years have had profound effects on the demography of, and patterns and levels of genetic diversity in, many extant species [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B1" href="#B1">1</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B4" href="#B4">4</a>]. Temperate taxa inhabiting alpine habitats often shift their ranges along an altitudinal gradient in response to climatic changes. Therefore, populations on different mountains may experience alternating periods of isolation and connectivity [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B2" href="#B2">2</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B5" href="#B5">5</a>]. Periods of isolation may result in genetic divergence among populations, whereas periods of connectivity allow for dispersal and gene flow [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B1" href="#B1">1</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B2" href="#B2">2</a>]. Because species' responses to climate change are influenced by interactive factors including ecology, demography and local topography, the pattern and tempo of diversification may differ between taxa and from place to place [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B1" href="#B1">1</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B4" href="#B4">4</a>]. For example, the amount of time that populations are isolated and their effective population size will determine whether they sort into independent evolutionary lineages, whereas the level of divergence and ecological characteristics of the species often influence whether they remain distinct or merge back into a common gene pool upon secondary contact [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B2" href="#B2">2</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B6" href="#B6">6</a>]. Studies of genetic diversification in alpine regions are currently limited to a few areas [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B7" href="#B7">7</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B14" href="#B14">14</a>]. Additional research in other alpine regions is therefore required to confirm the generality of existing hypotheses on how Pleistocene climatic change affected species diversification and demography.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The eastern Himalayan mountain range, which has perhaps the most complex topography on Earth, offers an unusual opportunity to study interactions among geography, climatic changes and diversification. These mountains rose rapidly with the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau during the past three million years [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B15" href="#B15">15</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B18" href="#B18">18</a>]. Mountains are characterized as a series of parallel alpine ranges climbing to altitudes over 5 000 m above sea level (m.a.s.l.) with the differences in altitude from valley to mountaintops often exceeding 2 000 m.a.s.l. This broadly altitudinal range has created dramatic ecological stratification and resulted in geographic isolation for many taxa [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B19" href="#B19">19</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B21" href="#B21">21</a>]. Tremendous variations in altitude, climate and vegetation may have created an archipelago of high elevation sky islands [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B22" href="#B22">22</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B23" href="#B23">23</a>]. The Elliot's laughing thrush (
  <span class="italic">Garrulax elliotii</span>) is endemic to the eastern Himalayan region [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B23" href="#B23">23</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B26" href="#B26">26</a>], where it generally occupies shrubland habitats at altitudes from 2 000 to 4 000 m.a.s.l. Since the montane habitat in this region is divided by deep valleys into distinct eco-subregions or clusters of mountains [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B19" href="#B19">19</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B20" href="#B20">20</a>], it is plausible that these geographic barriers restrict gene flow between 
  <span class="italic">G. elliotii </span>populations thus contributing to genetic diversity in this bird.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">High altitude parts of the eastern Himalayas were subject to repeated glaciations during the Pleistocene [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B27" href="#B27">27</a>]. These glacial cycles and accompanying climate changes probably had a large influence on species' distribution and demography [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B28" href="#B28">28</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B29" href="#B29">29</a>]. The range of 
  <span class="italic">G. elliotii </span>is predicted to have expanded and contracted along an altitudinal gradient resulting in historic periods of connectivity and isolation. Given the potential for repeated contacts between populations on different mountains, it is possible that populations merged into a single gene pool during historic periods of connectivity [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B1" href="#B1">1</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B2" href="#B2">2</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B6" href="#B6">6</a>]. However, many studies in other montane regions suggest that gene flow among populations remained restricted during the Pleistocene, leading to each population remaining a distinct evolutionary lineage [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B8" href="#B8">8</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B14" href="#B14">14</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites to address the effects of Pleistocene climatic changes on genetic diversification in the eastern Himalayas. We first evaluate whether Elliot's laughing thrush from each eco-subregion or cluster of mountains comprises a distinct evolutionary lineage. Second, we investigate the contribution of geographic and environmental barriers to 
  <span class="italic">G. elliotii</span>'s distribution. Third, we test whether the timing of diversification within 
  <span class="italic">G. elliotii </span>is consistent with climatic shifts induced by Pleistocene glacial cycles. Fourth, we use coalescent simulations to test whether populations from different mountains have descended from a single ancestor (single refugium), or, alternatively, remained isolated on individual mountains during down-slope expansions (multiple refugia). Finally, given that the range of 
  <span class="italic">G. elliotii </span>is predicted to have expanded and contracted in response to Pleistocene climatic fluctuations, we also examine historical demography of this species.
