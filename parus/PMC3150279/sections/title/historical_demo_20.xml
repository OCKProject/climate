 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The historical population trend inferred by the Bayesian skyline plot seems a relatively good fit to the climate trend since the late Pleistocene glaciations (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F7" href="#F7">7</a>). Past population dynamics of two mitochondrial lineages coherently indicate continuous population growth over the last 0.125 mya. Log transformed theta values were around 0.02 near the end of the MIS6, after which populations began to increase rapidly until they reached their current sizes (theta around 3.5). Recent population growth is also supported by maximum-likelihood estimates of positive growth rates (corrected

The abbreviation MIS refers to marine isotope stage.
