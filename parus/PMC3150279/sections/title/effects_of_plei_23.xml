 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Pleistocene glacial cycles have been considered to induce environmental shifts in the eastern Himalayas resulting in the isolation of 
  <span class="italic">G. elliotii </span>populations on different subregions. Congruent with this, our divergence time estimates indicate that lineage diversification occurred during the late Pleistocene interglacial period (MIS5). Climatic fluctuations during the late Pleistocene resulted in several glacial-interglacial cycles in the eastern Himalayas [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B28" href="#B28">28</a>,

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B101" href="#B101">101</a>]. Glaciations were restricted to relatively high altitudes and did not affect the lower slopes or valleys [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B27" href="#B27">27</a>]. Palaeoclimatic and palynological studies from this region reveal a vegetational shift over the Pleistocene glacial cycles [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B102" href="#B102">102</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B103" href="#B103">103</a>]; during the glacial periods, cool-temperate vegetations, such as shrublands, expanded to lower elevations, and contracted to high elevations during warmer and wetter interglacial periods [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B104" href="#B104">104</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B105" href="#B105">105</a>]. Because alpine birds are often strongly associated with their preferred habitat, range expansion and contraction of shrublands probably mirrored that of 
  <span class="italic">G. elliotii</span>. It is plausible therefore that the glacial and interglacial cycles would allow 
  <span class="italic">G. elliotii </span>to disperse among subregions during glacial periods, but isolate population in different subregions during the interglacial periods.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the potential for repeated contacts of populations from subregions during glacial expansions, it is possible that subregional populations merged into a common gene pool. However, our analyses of diversification pattern in 
  <span class="italic">G. elliotii </span>appear to reflect historical differentiation in multiple refugia. Coalescent simulations and reconstruction ancestral areas of the mtDNA phylogeny suggested a divergence model involving the multiple refugia, while microsatellite data identify a distinct genetic structure concordant with the geographically separated southern, northern and eastern subregions. These results suggested that subregional populations of 
  <span class="italic">G. elliotii </span>were isolated into separated refugia during down-slope expansions, although we could not distinguish between the two-refugia and three-refugia model. Furthermore, while coalescent simulation assumes that the discordance between the reconstructed gene tree and multi-refugia population trees reflects the retention of ancestral variation, the discordance could also result from migration among subregional populations (see below).
