 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the four runs of IM and IMa2 gave similar results, we report below the estimates from the run with the highest effective sample size (ESS) for the parameter 
  <span class="italic">t </span>(the parameter with the lowest ESS value in every run). For mitochondrial data, posterior probability for divergence time peaked at time 
  <span class="italic">t </span>= 3.415 (90% HPD, 2.765-4.3345). When converted to a scale of years, the divergence time between north-eastern and southern lineages was estimated to be 0.109 (0.088-0.138) mya. The migration parameters estimated by IM (
  <span class="italic">m</span>1 and 
  <span class="italic">m</span>2), which represented the number of migrants per mutation (
  <span class="italic">m </span>= m/μ), were converted to population migration rates (M = 2 Nm = θ
  <span class="italic">m</span>/2). The migration rate per generation was estimated to be 0.43 (0.09-0.65) from the southern to north-eastern lineage, and 0.37 (0.07-0.63) from the north-eastern to southern lineage.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For microsatellite data, the posterior probability of parameter 
  <span class="italic">t </span>peaked at 0.975 (0.185-2.325) for the southern and north-eastern lineages, and at 0.15 (0.045-0.315) for the northern and eastern lineages. When converted to a scale of years, the divergence time between the southern and north-eastern lineages was estimated from 0.097 (0.018-0.232) to 0.01 (0.002-0.023) mya. For the northern and eastern lineages, divergence time was estimated between 0.015 (0.004-0.032) and 0.0015 (0.0005-0.003 2) mya. The migration rate per generation (2 Nm) was estimated at 0.83 (90% HPD, 0.48-1.8) from the north-eastern to southern lineage, and 1.01 (0.38-2.2) from the southern to north-eastern lineage. From the eastern to northern lineage, the migration value was estimated to be 1.34 (0.56-1.8), and 0.33 (0.02-1.14) from the northern to eastern lineage.
