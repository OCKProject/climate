 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climatic changes that resulted in population expansion and contraction are also expected to lead to demographic changes over time between lineages confined to different subregions. Congruent with this, the Bayesian skyline plot revealed an increasing population size in each genealogical lineage since 0.125 mya, i.e. during the warmer interglacial MIS5 period. During the Quaternary, the eastern Himalayas were uplifted to 4 000 - 4 500 m.a.s.l. Climatic conditions responsible for high rainfall moved away from the centre of mountains and mountain glaciers shrank [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B99" href="#B99">99</a>]. The maximum extent of glacial development in this region occurred during MIS6 and MIS4, with ice being restricted during the global Late Glacial Maximum, LGM (MIS2) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B27" href="#B27">27</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B29" href="#B29">29</a>]. Palynological research has indicated that a series of prolonged, mild interglacials supported vegetation similar to the present-day flora of East Asia during MIS5 (0.11 to 0.071 mya) [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B108" href="#B108">108</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B109" href="#B109">109</a>]. It is likely that Pleistocene climatic stability might have allowed the persistence of vegetation similar to that observed today in the eastern Himalayas, especially at moderate or low altitudes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B109" href="#B109">109</a>]. Therefore, our results, combined with the palaeoclimatic and palynological data, suggest that 
  <span class="italic">G. elliotii </span>experienced population growth during the warmer MIS5 period.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Contrary to the expectation that profound ecological upheavals during cooler periods would have reduced the population size of 
  <span class="italic">G. elliotii</span>, the Bayesian skyline plot revealed a stable population during the cooler MIS4 and MIS2 periods. Maintenance of a rather stable population size can probably be attributed to the frequency and location of glaciations in this region. Unlike high latitude regions of Europe and North America that were covered by heavy ice during much of Pleistocene, glaciations in the eastern Himalayas were restricted to relatively high altitudes and did not affect the lower slopes or valleys [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B26" href="#B26">26</a>]. It is likely that this relatively milder climate was less stressful for cold-tolerant alpine birds than the extremes experienced by both European and North American birds. Although temperatures might have been lower elsewhere during the MIS4 and MIS2, it has been inferred that the climate of the eastern Himalayas, particularly at low altitudes, was warmer [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B42" href="#B42">42</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B107" href="#B107">107</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B109" href="#B109">109</a>]. Therefore, the resultant stable niches might have provided suitable habitats for 
  <span class="italic">G. elliotii </span>even during periods of climatic change, making it possible for this species to maintain a stable population size during the cooler MIS4 and MIS2.
