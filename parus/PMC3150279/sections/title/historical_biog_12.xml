 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine whether populations remained isolated in individual habitats (multiple refugia), or merged into a single gene pool (single refugium) during down-slope dispersal, we used coalescent simulations in MESQUITE 2.5 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B90" href="#B90">90</a>] to test three phylogeographic models of diversification. The first hypothesis posited that all populations derive from a single source population (single-refugium hypothesis). The second hypothesis postulated that populations were isolated into southern and north-eastern refugia (two-refugia hypothesis). The geographic structure was inferred from mitochondrial data. A third, three-refugia hypothesis, which was consistent with three-subregion division and inferred from microsatellite data (see RESULTS), predicted that populations derive from three independent refugia.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For coalescent simulations, we first estimated 
  <span class="italic">N</span>
  <sub>e </sub>for individual populations of 
  <span class="italic">G. elliotii </span>using values for θ calculated in MIGRATE 2.3.2 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B91" href="#B91">91</a>] under the following parameters: 10 short chains (500 trees used out of 10 000 sampled) and three long chains (5 000 trees used out of 100 000 sampled) with four adaptive heating chains (1, 3, 5 and 7). Maximum-likelihood estimates (MLE) were calculated under a stepping-stone model four times to ensure convergence upon similar values for θ. We converted θ to 
  <span class="italic">N</span>
  <sub>e </sub>using the equation for maternally inherited mitochondrial data θ = 2 
  <span class="italic">N</span>
  <sub>e</sub>μ, using same mutation rate in divergence time estimate. The estimates of 
  <span class="italic">N</span>
  <sub>e </sub>for all populations were summed to calculate Total 
  <span class="italic">N</span>
  <sub>e </sub>and scaled the branch widths of our hypothesized population trees using the proportion of Total 
  <span class="italic">N</span>
  <sub>e </sub>that each population comprised. The 
  <span class="italic">N
   <sub>e </sub>
  </span>of the refugial population was constrained to a size proportional to the relative 
  <span class="italic">N
   <sub>e </sub>
  </span>of the population sampled from the sites of the putative refugia. Thus, if samples from the site of the putative refugium had an effective population size of one-third that of the Total 
  <span class="italic">N</span>
  <sub>e</sub>, we would constrain the population size in the simulation prior to population expansion to one-third the total 
  <span class="italic">N</span>
  <sub>e</sub>. During coalescent simulations, both Total 
  <span class="italic">N</span>
  <sub>e </sub>and lower and upper bounds of the 95% CI for 
  <span class="italic">N
   <sub>e </sub>
  </span>were used as model parameters in order to encompass a wide range of potential 
  <span class="italic">N</span>e values The divergence time specified for each model corresponded to the approximate age estimated using IM and IMa2 as follows: 0.1 mya for the southern and north-eastern populations (two-refugia model), 0.015 mya for northern and eastern populations (three-refugia model). In the single refugium model, we specified divergence time as 0, which assumed a panmixia population derived from a single refugium. For converting coalescent time (in generations) to absolute time, we assumed a generation length of 1 year [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The amount of discordance between a gene tree and population model was measured by 
  <span class="italic">S</span>, the minimum number of sorting events required to produce the genealogy within a given model of divergence [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B92" href="#B92">92</a>]. The 
  <span class="italic">S </span>value is a measure of the number of parsimony steps in characters for a reconstructed gene tree, such that more discordance between the population model and gene tree leads to a higher 
  <span class="italic">S </span>value. To obtain a distribution of 
  <span class="italic">S </span>values, 10 000 gene trees were simulated, constrained within each model of population divergence under a neutral coalescent process, and the amount of discordance between the simulated genealogy and population model was determined. Overall, this produced a null distribution of 10 000 
  <span class="italic">S </span>values based on reconstructed genealogy for each model of population divergence. The 
  <span class="italic">S </span>value for observed genealogy was calculated and compared to the distributions of 
  <span class="italic">S </span>values from coalescent simulations to determine whether the observed genealogy could have been generated under a given model.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also examined the ancestral area distributions for deeper nodes of the mitochondrial haplotype phylogeny with an event-based method in DIVA 1.1 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B93" href="#B93">93</a>]. Each individual in the phylogeographic analysis was coded to one of the ten biogeographic sectors. We used an equal likelihood for the rate of change among sectors for estimating ancestral areas because we had no information on the dispersal rate among sectors.
