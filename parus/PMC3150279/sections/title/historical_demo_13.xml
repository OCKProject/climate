  <span class="italic">G. elliotii </span>were estimated using the Bayesian skyline plot method implemented in BEAST 1.4.6 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B94" href="#B94">94</a>]. This approach incorporates uncertainty in the genealogy using MCMC integration under a coalescent model, in which the timing of dates provides information about effective population sizes through time. Chains were run for 100 million generations, and the first 10% of which were discarded as 'burn-in'. The substitution model was selected according the result of Modeltest 3.7. We applied 10 grouped coalescent intervals and constant growth rate for the skyline model. The same mutation rate in divergence time estimate was used. Pilot analyses showed that the ucld.stdev parameters were close to zero, thus a strict clock model was employed. Demographic history through time was reconstructed using Tracer 1.4 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B95" href="#B95">95</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The exponential growth rate (
  <span class="italic">g</span>) was also estimated for each mitochondrial lineage by FLUCTUATE 1.4 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B96" href="#B96">96</a>]. FLUCTUATE was initiated with a Watterson [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B97" href="#B97">97</a>] estimate of theta (Î¸) and a random topology, performing 10 short chains, sampled every 20 genealogies for 200 steps, and two long chains, sampled every 20 genealogies for 20 000 steps. FLUCTUATE analyses were repeated five times and the mean and standard deviation of 
  <span class="italic">g </span>calculated from the results of these separate runs. Because this genealogical method yields estimates of 
  <span class="italic">g </span>with an upward bias [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B96" href="#B96">96</a>], we corrected 
  <span class="italic">g </span>values following the conservative approach of Lessa et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B98" href="#B98">98</a>] and only considered the 
  <span class="italic">g </span>value indicative of population growth when 
  <span class="italic">g </span>&gt; 3 SD (
