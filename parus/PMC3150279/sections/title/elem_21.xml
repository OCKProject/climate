  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Geographic complexity and environmental heterogeneity are likely to have shaped the genetic structure among 
   <span class="italic">G. elliotii </span>populations. Such a landscape effect is evident in the eastern Himalayan region. Although 
   <span class="italic">G. elliotii </span>has a rather restricted geographic distribution, mitochondrial data support the separation of a southern and a north-eastern lineage with incomplete gene sorting, while microsatellites indicate a clear subdivision into three lineages, a southern, a northern and an eastern. Despite intermixing of mitochondrial haplotypes, none of the haplotypes are geographically widespread. All shared haplotypes occur within the same subregional population. In this case, the steep mountains and deep valleys of the Kangding-Muli-Baoxin Divide, recognized as a geographic barrier by Zhang et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B19" href="#B19">19</a>] and Li [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B20" href="#B20">20</a>], appear to effectively have prevented gene flow among subregional populations. Across the entire sampling area, the correlation between phylogeographic pattern and subregion division is strong. Furthermore, our regression model reveals that the general pattern of subdivision could be attributed to geographic and environmental differentiations, e.g. subregion and vegetation.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mountains, like sky islands, and are separated by areas of unsuitable habitats that act as barriers to gene flow [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B14" href="#B14">14</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B15" href="#B15">15</a>]. Species restricted to sky islands commonly have high levels of interpopulation genetic divergence [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B8" href="#B8">8</a>-
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B15" href="#B15">15</a>]. In the eastern Himalayas, 
   <span class="italic">G. elliotii </span>is restricted to shrublands in the three subregions separated by deep valleys. The habitat-mapping model shows that these subregions or lineages are separated by areas where the environmental conditions are unsuitable for 
   <span class="italic">G. elliotii</span>. Consistent with the expectation that these valleys prevent or restrict gene flow, each subregional population represents an evolutionary lineage. Thus, the contrast in environmental conditions at high and low elevations in the eastern Himalayas may have created a "sky island situation" for 
   <span class="italic">G. elliotii</span>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although many sky island species in other regions show high levels of isolation in clusters of mountains [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B7" href="#B7">7</a>-
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B14" href="#B14">14</a>], our data indicate that diversification of 
   <span class="italic">G. elliotii </span>has occurred on a broader geographic scale, eco-subregions. 
   <span class="italic">G. elliotii </span>is an alpine bird found between 2 000 and 4 000 m.a.s.l. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B24" href="#B24">24</a>-
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B26" href="#B26">26</a>]. This broad altitudinal range implies large ecological plasticity. Considering that most previously studied sky island species belong to less mobile groups such as beetles and plants, this difference in scale probably reflects the fact that historical processes of isolation are more easily reconstructed in species with less dispersal capability than in highly mobile species [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B1" href="#B1">1</a>-
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B4" href="#B4">4</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While our study may demonstrate newly discovered sky island diversification in a previously unstudied region, sky islands also have the extra connotation that mountain ranges are equivalent ecologically and they share the same biogeographic history. Since three eco-subregions in the eastern Himalayas present different ecological systems, our result should be considered cautiously. Whether the eastern Himalayan region is a sky island situation ultimately depends on the ecology of the organisms under study. Further research on more organisms inhabiting this region, especial the same eco-climatic subregions is required to clarify this.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Effects of Pleistocene glaciations on population divergence</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Pleistocene glacial cycles have been considered to induce environmental shifts in the eastern Himalayas resulting in the isolation of 
   <span class="italic">G. elliotii </span>populations on different subregions. Congruent with this, our divergence time estimates indicate that lineage diversification occurred during the late Pleistocene interglacial period (MIS5). Climatic fluctuations during the late Pleistocene resulted in several glacial-interglacial cycles in the eastern Himalayas [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B27" href="#B27">27</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B28" href="#B28">28</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B99" href="#B99">99</a>-
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B101" href="#B101">101</a>]. Glaciations were restricted to relatively high altitudes and did not affect the lower slopes or valleys [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B27" href="#B27">27</a>]. Palaeoclimatic and palynological studies from this region reveal a vegetational shift over the Pleistocene glacial cycles [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B102" href="#B102">102</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B103" href="#B103">103</a>]; during the glacial periods, cool-temperate vegetations, such as shrublands, expanded to lower elevations, and contracted to high elevations during warmer and wetter interglacial periods [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B104" href="#B104">104</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B105" href="#B105">105</a>]. Because alpine birds are often strongly associated with their preferred habitat, range expansion and contraction of shrublands probably mirrored that of 
   <span class="italic">G. elliotii</span>. It is plausible therefore that the glacial and interglacial cycles would allow 
   <span class="italic">G. elliotii </span>to disperse among subregions during glacial periods, but isolate population in different subregions during the interglacial periods.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the potential for repeated contacts of populations from subregions during glacial expansions, it is possible that subregional populations merged into a common gene pool. However, our analyses of diversification pattern in 
   <span class="italic">G. elliotii </span>appear to reflect historical differentiation in multiple refugia. Coalescent simulations and reconstruction ancestral areas of the mtDNA phylogeny suggested a divergence model involving the multiple refugia, while microsatellite data identify a distinct genetic structure concordant with the geographically separated southern, northern and eastern subregions. These results suggested that subregional populations of 
   <span class="italic">G. elliotii </span>were isolated into separated refugia during down-slope expansions, although we could not distinguish between the two-refugia and three-refugia model. Furthermore, while coalescent simulation assumes that the discordance between the reconstructed gene tree and multi-refugia population trees reflects the retention of ancestral variation, the discordance could also result from migration among subregional populations (see below).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Genetic admixture among intraspecific lineages</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to the deep phylogeographic partitions found in other sky island species [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B8" href="#B8">8</a>-
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B14" href="#B14">14</a>], we only found a shallow phylogeographic division in 
   <span class="italic">G. elliotii</span>. This is consistent with genetic admixture among lineages occurring during glacial periods. The two partially sympatric mitochondrial lineages show shared ancestry, and microsatellite data indicate gene flow among the three subregional populations. Furthermore, GENECLASS identified a considerable proportion of admixed individuals, most of which were assigned to the geographically intermediate populations MK, YA and BC. Interestingly, despite the relatively high degree of genetic admixture, these locations were also identified as the potential refugia that most likely defined the boundary of each genetic lineage.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on these observations, it is probable that isolated populations of 
   <span class="italic">G. elliotii </span>periodically expanded to lower elevation where they mixed. Thus, the three intraspecific lineages likely established a contact zone along their boundaries. Because these lineages are geographically relatively close and are likely to have experienced repeated glacial cycles, this has resulted in multiple episodes of genetic admixture. Over time, this could have defined a centre of gene flow, such as populations YA, MK and BC. This process might cause the mixing of genetic lineages thereby obscuring the pattern of genetic variation [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B42" href="#B42">42</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nevertheless, the rather large degree of genetic separation among lineages indicates that these have been isolated from each other for a relatively long period. Although the southern and north-eastern mitochondrial lineages are intermixed, no haplotypes are shared between them. This lack of sharing suggests that the two lineages are at an intermediate stage of divergence along the continuum from complete panmixia to paraphyly and ultimately to reciprocal monophyly [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B106" href="#B106">106</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B107" href="#B107">107</a>]. In contrast, differences in microsatellite allele frequencies among the three lineages are more distinct. The discrepancy between these two markers may indicate that admixture among these lineages is relatively ancient, and hence, that the mixing signature is relatively weak.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Historical demography</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climatic changes that resulted in population expansion and contraction are also expected to lead to demographic changes over time between lineages confined to different subregions. Congruent with this, the Bayesian skyline plot revealed an increasing population size in each genealogical lineage since 0.125 mya, i.e. during the warmer interglacial MIS5 period. During the Quaternary, the eastern Himalayas were uplifted to 4 000 - 4 500 m.a.s.l. Climatic conditions responsible for high rainfall moved away from the centre of mountains and mountain glaciers shrank [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B27" href="#B27">27</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B99" href="#B99">99</a>]. The maximum extent of glacial development in this region occurred during MIS6 and MIS4, with ice being restricted during the global Late Glacial Maximum, LGM (MIS2) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B27" href="#B27">27</a>-
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B29" href="#B29">29</a>]. Palynological research has indicated that a series of prolonged, mild interglacials supported vegetation similar to the present-day flora of East Asia during MIS5 (0.11 to 0.071 mya) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B42" href="#B42">42</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B108" href="#B108">108</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B109" href="#B109">109</a>]. It is likely that Pleistocene climatic stability might have allowed the persistence of vegetation similar to that observed today in the eastern Himalayas, especially at moderate or low altitudes [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B109" href="#B109">109</a>]. Therefore, our results, combined with the palaeoclimatic and palynological data, suggest that 
   <span class="italic">G. elliotii </span>experienced population growth during the warmer MIS5 period.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Contrary to the expectation that profound ecological upheavals during cooler periods would have reduced the population size of 
   <span class="italic">G. elliotii</span>, the Bayesian skyline plot revealed a stable population during the cooler MIS4 and MIS2 periods. Maintenance of a rather stable population size can probably be attributed to the frequency and location of glaciations in this region. Unlike high latitude regions of Europe and North America that were covered by heavy ice during much of Pleistocene, glaciations in the eastern Himalayas were restricted to relatively high altitudes and did not affect the lower slopes or valleys [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B26" href="#B26">26</a>]. It is likely that this relatively milder climate was less stressful for cold-tolerant alpine birds than the extremes experienced by both European and North American birds. Although temperatures might have been lower elsewhere during the MIS4 and MIS2, it has been inferred that the climate of the eastern Himalayas, particularly at low altitudes, was warmer [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B42" href="#B42">42</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B107" href="#B107">107</a>-
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B109" href="#B109">109</a>]. Therefore, the resultant stable niches might have provided suitable habitats for 
   <span class="italic">G. elliotii </span>even during periods of climatic change, making it possible for this species to maintain a stable population size during the cooler MIS4 and MIS2.
