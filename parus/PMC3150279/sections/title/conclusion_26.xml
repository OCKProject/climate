  <span class="italic">G. elliotii </span>indicates that lineages have been isolated on individual subregions since the late Pleistocene interglacial period (MIS 5). Despite being isolated in multiple refugia during glacial advance, gene flow periodically occurred when populations expanded their ranges to lower altitudes. The resultant genetic admixture might have caused the mixing of genetic lineages thereby obscuring the pattern of genetic variation. The Bayesian skyline plot shows a gradual increase in population size in each mitochondrial lineage since the late Pleistocene interglacial period (MIS 5). Our results provide new evidence that climatic changes during the Pleistocene glaciations had profound effects on lineage diversification and demography in a bird species in a previously unstudied montane region - the eastern Himalayas.
