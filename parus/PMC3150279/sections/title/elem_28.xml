    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B111" href="#B111">111</a>]; 1 represents the southern group; 2, the eastern group; 3, the northern group. The likelihood of an individual's genotype belonging to the population where the individual has been sampled was estimated using the frequency-based method [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B112" href="#B112">112</a>]. The probability that an individual was not from the local population was computed using a gamete-based Monte Carlo resampling method with 1 000 simulated individuals and a threshold of 0.01 [
