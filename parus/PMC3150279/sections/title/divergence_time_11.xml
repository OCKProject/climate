 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to overcome the limitations of conventional estimates of divergence time based on

  <sub>ST </sub>values (e.g. estimation of divergence time assuming isolation without gene flow) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B75" href="#B75">75</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B77" href="#B77">77</a>], we employed a coalescent-based MCMC simulation to estimate the divergence times for the main mitochondrial lineages in the program IM [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B78" href="#B78">78</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B79" href="#B79">79</a>]. As recommended by Hey &amp; Nielsen [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B78" href="#B78">78</a>] we first performed multiple runs, with an increasing number of steps and using wide priors and heating schemes to ensure that the complete posterior distribution could be obtained. We finally performed four independent runs of 5 × 10
  <span class="sup">8 </span>steps with a burn-in of 5 × 10
  <span class="sup">7 </span>steps and a linear heating scheme (g1 = 0.05). IM was run under the HKY substitution model (estimated by Modeltest 3.7). Convergence on stationary distributions was assessed by monitoring the similarity of posterior distributions from independent runs and by assessing the autocorrelation parameter values over these runs [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B80" href="#B80">80</a>]. The peaks of the resulting posterior distributions were taken as estimates of parameters [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B81" href="#B81">81</a>]. Credibility intervals were recorded as the 90% highest posterior density (HPD). Because no fossil data were available to calibrate the mutation rate, we assumed a conventional molecular clock for the avian mitochondrial DNA cytochrome 
  <span class="italic">b </span>gene (1 × 10
  <span class="sup">-8 </span>per site per year) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B82" href="#B82">82</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B83" href="#B83">83</a>]. The mutation rate was modulated by multiplying the ratio of the average distance for the combined sequences versus that for cyt 
  <span class="italic">b </span>alone to deduce the mutation rate for all fragments combined. We used this modified mutation rate to convert the divergence time estimate into calendar years.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For microsatellite data, timing of population splits was estimated using the IMa2 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B81" href="#B81">81</a>] with burn-ins of 5 × 10
  <span class="sup">7 </span>and 5 × 10
  <span class="sup">8 </span>iterations under the SSM model with initial short runs to provide prior estimates. A geometric heating scheme was employed and the program run four times with different random seed numbers to ensure convergence of parameter estimates. The IMa2 output included mean values of the parameters for two sets after the burn-in period, representing the first and second half of the total generations of the post burn-in run. We ran our analyses until the peak location set values were equal for both sets. This, along with the high effective sample size and low autocorrelation estimate, suggested the Markov chains reached convergence after a sufficiently long burn-in period and were sampled from the appropriate likelihood space. A generation time of 1 year [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B26" href="#B26">26</a>] and a mutation rate of 10

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B89" href="#B89">89</a>] were used to convert divergence time into calendar years. Given the uncertainty in mutation rates, the resultant estimates should be interpreted with caution.
