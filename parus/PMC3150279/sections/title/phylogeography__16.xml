 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A reconstructed maximum-likelihood tree of mitochondrial haplotypes suggested that 
  <span class="italic">G. elliotii </span>was composed of two major clades with support rates of 82% and 71%, respectively (1000 replicates). The geographic distributions of the two clades appeared uneven, with the majority of first clade's haplotypes found mainly in populations in the northern and eastern subregions (north-eastern clade), whereas haplotypes of second clade were most common in southern subregion (southern clade) (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">2</a>). Time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for both clades fell within the late Pleistocene glacial period (Marine Isotope Stage, MIS6): 0.139 (95% HPD, 0.093-0.194) and 0.149 (95% HPD, 0.097-0.205) mya for north-eastern and southern clades, respectively.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both Neighbour-Joining and STRUCTURE analyses detected similar population structures in the microsatellite data. Samples from the southern, northern and eastern subregions separated into three distinct clusters. The first cluster (southern lineage) was comprised of two populations from the southern subregion (DL and ZD), the second cluster (eastern lineage) consisted of the five eastern populations (WX, QL, HB, BC and YA), and the third cluster (northern lineage) included the three northern populations (CD, MK and RT) (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">4</a>). Yet, STRUCTURE indicated that populations from the eastern subregion showed minor admixture with samples from the northern subregion (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">4</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess the genetic admixture, we carried out an exclusion method implemented in the program GENECLASS 2.0 to identify potential admixture individuals. Using the previously determined three genetic clusters and geographic sampling locations as prior population information, GENECLASS identified a considerable proportion of admixture individuals (25%), most of which were assigned to the geographically intermediate populations MK, YA and BC (method and result see Additional file 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">1</a>, Table S1).
