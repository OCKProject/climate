 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For mitochondrial data, we calculated the number of segregating sites, haplotype diversity and nucleotide diversity for each population and all populations combined using DnaSP 4.0 [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B53" href="#B53">53</a>] test was used to examine the selective neutrality of the mitochondrial DNA protein-coding fragments. Two additional neutrality tests, Fu's
