   <span class="italic">Spizixos semitorques.</span> For each species, three time points were considered, i.e., the present day (Present), last glacial maximum (LGM; ~26–19 thousand years ago, Ka), and last interglacial period (LIG; ~112–132 Ka). Black dots show species occurrence records rarefied at a 1-km spatial resolution. To avoid over-prediction, the ENMs were transformed to binary (presence/ absence) distribution by a threshold of the maximum training sensitivity plus specificity (MTSS), with detailed logistic values specified in Additional file
