 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recent glacial cycles have been well recognized as one of the major forces shaping patterns of global biodiversity [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>]. It is widely perceived that species responded to the cyclical climatic changes in the Pleistocene by the repeated “expansion-contraction” of their ranges during the alternating glacial and interglacial periods [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>]. For example, advancing ice sheets in the Pleistocene drove the contraction of temperate biota to refugia and the expansion of polar biota in glaciated regions such as Europe [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>], North America [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>] and Antarctica [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>]. Conversely, in unglaciated regions increasing aridity due to global cooling during glacial maxima led to range contraction in mesic-adapted species and range expansion in arid-adapted species, as reported in South America and Africa [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>], Australia [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>] and Sundaland [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. It has been argued that the alternative warmer and wetter climate during interglacial periods caused the range changes in these regions into the reverse [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. However, whether climate oscillations during the Pleistocene lead to cyclical range changes in the biota of East Asia, a biodiversity hotspot [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>], has not been comprehensively assessed.
 </p>
 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">East Asia was not covered by ice sheets during the entire Pleistocene [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>]. Palynological data indicate a southward contraction of subtropical vegetation at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 19–26 thousand years ago, Ka) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>]. Despite confirmation by several ecological niche modeling (ENM) studies [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>], other recent studies failed to find any significant impact of the LGM on the distributions of several plant and animal species in East Asia [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>]; rather, some studies observed substantial range contraction during the warmer Last Interglacial period (LIG, ~112–132 Ka) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>]. Given that severe range retraction can cause dramatic reductions in population [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>], one might expect small effective population sizes (
  <span class="italic">N</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">e</span>
  </sub>) in East Asian species because of either LGM or LIG contraction. By contrast, several genetic analyses found confounding effects, e.g. with demographic growth under a range contraction scenario [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>] or with constant population size through Pleistocene glaciations [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>]. Thus, it was hypothesized that Pleistocene glaciations might have had a minor impact on East Asian organisms [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>]. However, such discrepancies may have been caused by limitations in study design, for example, with low power to detect population decline (e.g. bottleneck) based on limited number of loci [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>], such as a single maternally inherited locus (e.g. mitochondrial or chloroplast DNA) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>] or few, if any, nuclear genes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>]. In addition, previous studies only focused on one or few species precluding a comprehensive understanding of community level dynamics. Therefore, analyses based on multiple species and multiple loci are required to robustly test for demographic dynamics of biota in this region [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>].

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the present study, we used ecological niche profiles and genetic data to examine the impact of the last interglacial-glacial cycle on 11 non-migrant bird species common in subtropical East Asia. These birds can be categorized into three classes with different elevational distribution ranges reflecting the breadth of their habitats (see details in Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Table S1): five elevational generalists (elevational range: 0–4000 m; 
  <span class="italic">Aegithalos concinnus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Cettia fortipes</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Leiothrix lutea</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Pomatorhinus ruficollis</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Stachyridopsis ruficeps</span>), four highland specialists (1000 - 4000 m; 
  <span class="italic">Fulvetta ruficapilla</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Lioparus chrysotis</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Parus monticolus</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Yuhina diademata</span>) and two lowland specialists (mainly 0 - 1500 m; 
  <span class="italic">Alcippe morrisonia</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Spizixos semitorques</span>). Given that their ranges are mostly confined to the subtropics (south of 34° N), these birds are likely to have been sensitive to historical environmental changes, presenting an ideal system to examine biological responses to late Pleistocene climate in East Asia. Understanding their responses to historical climate change is also critical to predict the future fate of the East Asian biota under the ongoing global warming.

 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because climate plays a primary and necessary role in species’ range limitation [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>], we first used ENM analyses to examine whether the birds’ habitats were subject to regular glacial contraction and interglacial expansion during the last glacial cycle (i.e. the LIG, LGM and present day). Range dynamics (expansion or contraction) resulting from climate change are expected to have had pronounced genetic consequences in populations [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>]. So we further performed coalescent analyses based on 25–30 nuclear loci for each species to examine whether the last glaciation cycle had impacted population genetic variation and demographic dynamics of the 11 East Asian birds.
