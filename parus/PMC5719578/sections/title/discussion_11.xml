 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the present study, both our range and demographic analyses imply the contraction of the East Asian subtropical birds’ populations at the LIG and a subsequent expansion through the LGM to the present. The results suggest that the glacial maximum might only have a minor impact on the demography of East Asian organisms in contrast to the potential severe effect of the last interglacial climate. The concordant patterns of change in the multiple species allow us to make a more general picture about late Pleistocene range shifts in East Asian avifauna, which was alluded to by previous studies based on one or a few species [

 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The response pattern suggested by our present study stands in contrast to the prevailing view of cyclical range shifts for temperate species, which postulates glacial contraction and post-glacial expansion. These results also contradict the palynological analysis suggesting an LGM contraction in East Asia. The power of palynological reconstructions might be compromised by the scarcity of pollen-fossil data, a problem prevalent in unglaciated regions in the Pleistocene [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>]. For example, few pollen fossils from the LGM have been obtained in subtropical China [

 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The LIG has long been recognized as a climatic optimum for most mesic-adapted species [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>], and fossil records suggest similar avifaunas between the LIG and the current interglacial period in temperate regions of Europe and North America [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>]. However, our analyses revealed species’ range and demographic contraction at this time, suggesting that the East Asian climate at the LIG had some significant evolutionary consequences. Climate summary statistics showed larger seasonal climatic variability at the LIG than the LGM or present (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a and b</a>), which increased with latitude in this region at the LIG (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a> and Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM6">6</a>: Figure S3). This climatic scenario is consistent with results from recent simulation studies of LIG climate based on orbit parameters, which also showed that the larger temperature seasonality over East Asia during LIG might have resulted from seasonal fluctuations in incoming solar radiation [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>]. Given the nature of the limited tolerance of subtropical species to climatic variations [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>], the increased LIG climate seasonality at higher latitudes in East Asia might have caused the predicted southern contraction and declines in the study species’ population during the LIG.

 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The three LIG southern contraction patterns among species (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM4">4</a>: Figure S1) might be associated with different environmental requirements (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Table S1). The asynchrony at population growth (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> and Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM8">8</a>: Figure S4) might illustrate a difference in species’ responses to habitat availability during the transition from the LIG into the last glacial period, reflecting the possibility that their specific climatic and environmental tolerances were associated with the breadth of their ecological niches [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. For example, precipitation in the warmest quarter (Bio_18) is the most influential bioclimatic variable in present-day ENM prediction for all five of the species with early population growth, but makes a secondary contribution for the other species with late growth (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Table S3).
