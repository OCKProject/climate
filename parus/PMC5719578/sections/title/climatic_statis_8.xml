 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To characterize the climate of the last glaciation cycle, we compared climatic variations among the LIG, LGM and present day, and those across latitudes at the LIG, by extracting bioclimatic values based on a spatially rarefied occurrence dataset combined from all 11 birds studied. All the occurrence records across species were first combined and then rarefied by a 5-km distance, to approximate one point in one grid. Based on these points, values of the 10 bioclimatic variables used in above ENM analyses were extracted using DIVA-GIS 7.5 [
