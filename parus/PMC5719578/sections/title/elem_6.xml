  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used ENM analyses to model range dynamics between the LIG, LGM and Present. Raw occurrence records for each of the 11 species (see details in Additional file

To avoid spatial autocorrelation, the retained records were then rarefied at a 5-km spatial resolution under a south Asian continent equidistant conic projection in SDMtoolbox 1.1c [

The LIG model was initially obtained with a 30 arc-second resolution and then resampled to 2.5 arc-minute using a “NEAREST” algorithm using SDMtoolbox. The reasonability of study area extent is crucial for accuracy of ENM analyses and is difficult to determine [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>]. Given present distributions, we set an enlarged area exceeding the mainland Oriental Region [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>], sufficiency of which was verified by whether or not embracing the species’ distribution changes across historical climate changes.

  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To reduce model overfitting associated with factor autocorrelation, highly correlated (
   <span class="italic">r</span> &gt; 0.90) bioclimatic variables were identified and finally 10 variables were reserved, namely Bio_2 (mean diurnal range in temperature), Bio_3 (isothermality, monthly/ annual temperature range), Bio_5 (maximum temperature of warmest month), Bio_7 (temperature annual range), Bio_11 (mean temperature of coldest quarter), Bio_14 (precipitation of driest month), Bio_15 (precipitation seasonality, coefficient variation), Bio_16 (precipitation of wettest quarter), Bio_18 (precipitation of warmest quarter) and Bio_19 (precipitation of coldest quarter). In addition, winter records for species with significant seasonal migration (e.g. 
   <span class="italic">S. semitorques</span> and 
   <span class="italic">C. fortipes</span>, see details in Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Table S1) were excluded from the downstream analyses to improve prediction accuracy. The present-day ENM for each species was created and then extrapolated to palaeoclimatic layers at the LGM and LIG in MAXENT 3.3.3 k [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>]. Model parameters were trained with 75% of the occurrence records randomly sampled for each species and test by the other 25%, except that for species (
   <span class="italic">F. ruficapilla</span> and 
   <span class="italic">L. chrysotis</span>) with fewer occurrence records (e.g. &lt;100) all data were used to train the models (see details in Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Table S3). Two options in MAXENT were applied to reduce model over-prediction, with the maximum training sensitivity plus specificity (MTSS) threshold and the fade-by-clamping (i.e. to mitigate clamping issues during extrapolation among nonanalogous climates) procedure. Model performance was evaluated with the statistics of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To characterize the climate of the last glaciation cycle, we compared climatic variations among the LIG, LGM and present day, and those across latitudes at the LIG, by extracting bioclimatic values based on a spatially rarefied occurrence dataset combined from all 11 birds studied. All the occurrence records across species were first combined and then rarefied by a 5-km distance, to approximate one point in one grid. Based on these points, values of the 10 bioclimatic variables used in above ENM analyses were extracted using DIVA-GIS 7.5 [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>] and the significance of differences was calculated with a paired-sample T-test.

Positive growth rates would indicate a growing population, while negative values suggest population shrinkage. We performed one short MCMC run (1000 samples, 100 steps as interval and 10,000 samples as burn-in) followed by a longer one (10,000 samples, 100 steps as interval and 10,000 samples as burn-in) for each species with default model priors. To improve search performance, a heating scheme was used with one cold and three heated chains with default temperature settings. Convergence on the parameter estimates was visually inspected in Tracer 1.6 with an effective sample size &gt;200.
