 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study demonstrates that the conventional views of glacial contraction and interglacial expansion for mesic-adapted species cannot be applied to all the earthâ€™s climatic zones. In East Asia, subtropical avifauna showed narrower distribution and smaller

  </sub> at the LIG and then bounced back to a larger LGM range similar to the current one. The asynchronous range dynamics among organisms in different ecozones might have led to variable evolutionary consequences. For example, at the LGM temperate species might have retreated to isolated refugia facilitating population divergence and speciation [

Therefore, a comprehensive assessment of regional differences is critical to test historical biogeographic hypotheses globally.

 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study also suggests that high climatic variation, rather than high mean temperatures, explain the potential range contraction of subtropical birds at the LIG. The LIG climate might reflect the near future climate characterized by increased climatic variation under the impact of global warming [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>]. Accordingly, we can predict that a continuing trend of climate warming will pose a serious threat to subtropical biodiversity and thus justifies more conservation attention.
