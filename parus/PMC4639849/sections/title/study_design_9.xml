 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When the birds were 9 weeks old, individuals were infested with 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> nymphs three times in succession (Infestation 1–3) (see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>). Each infestation lasted 4–5 days, and the birds were kept free of ticks for a duration of 5–6 days between the consecutive infestations. Within 20 days, three batches were involved in the experiments (9–10 birds per batch). Batches of birds were stratified according to nest of origin. We infested birds with tick loads corresponding to the maximum level found under natural conditions in our study population. To this end, 17 randomly selected 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> nymphs were put underneath the feathers on the head of each bird in each infestation session using moistened tweezers. Birds were then kept for 2 h in an air-permeable cotton bag (size: 20 cm × 15 cm) inside a darkened cage which kept them inactive
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" href="#b28">28</a>. After tick exposure, birds were placed in individual cages with a wire-mesh floor (40 cm × 80 cm). Below the wire-mesh was a plastic tray containing damp filter paper and edges were streaked with vaseline to prevent nymphs from escaping. The engorged nymphs that dropped through the mesh cage were collected each day with minimal disturbance to the host.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We measured the effects of the 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infection and the cumulative exposure to ticks (Inf. 1+ Inf. 2) on health measures as the change in health status between the moments immediately before tick exposure 1 and immediately before tick exposure 3 (i.e. 5–6 days after Inf. 2). 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infection rate in the ticks are obtained from the three infestation sessions, that is the proportion of ticks that were 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> positive. They were used as a proxy for the bird’s 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infection status built up during the first 20 days (hereafter: ‘
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infection rate’). This time period is assumed to be sufficiently long to measure the degree of systemic infectivity, based on literature data on the latent period between the hosts being bitten by an infected tick and becoming infective (6–12 days in American robins 
  <span class="italic">Turdus migratorius</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" href="#b16">16</a>, 14 days in juvenile chickens 
  <span class="italic">Gallus gallus</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b62" href="#b62">62</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, we studied the change in the acute responses (i.e. the change in health status immediately before and just after tick exposure; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1A</a>) between infestation 1 and infestation 3 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1B</a>) in response to the cumulative exposure to the ticks and the 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infection status.
