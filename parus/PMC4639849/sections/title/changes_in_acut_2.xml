 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Model parameter estimates for the change in acute effects of the tick exposure (Δ Inf. 3 minus Δ Inf. 1; see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>) in relation to the 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infection rate and the total number of ticks are presented in

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hct levels decreased during each tick infestation (−0.0012 ± 0.0003; F
  <sub>1,48</sub> = 13.01, P = 0.0007), but this acute effect did not differ between infestation 1 and 3. The acute effect of the ticks on ESR decreased significantly over the infestation sessions (Δ Inf. x session: −0.003 ± 0.001; F
  <sub>1,47</sub> = 9.09, P = 0.004), but there was no statistical association with any of the parasites. The acute NOx responses were higher in Inf. 3, but this increase was counteracted by the negative correlation between NOx and 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infection rate (Δ Inf. x session x 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span>: −0.0010 ± 0.0002; F
  <sub>1,39.3</sub> = 12.32, P = 0.001). No other significant effects were found in any of the other health characteristics studied.
