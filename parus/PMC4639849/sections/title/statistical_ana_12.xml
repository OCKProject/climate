 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GLMM’s (Generalized Linear Mixed Models) were fitted on the health measures ((a)granulocyte counts: poisson distributed residuals, all other variables: normally distributed residuals) to model the change in their initial values (Δ Inf. 3-1) (= Cumulative effects) as a function of the following main effects: total number of ticks (Inf. 1 + 2), 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infection rate in the ticks and their higher order interactions. In a second analysis, we tested whether the changes in acute effects of tick infestation (‘Δ Acute’, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>) are related to the same main effects as above. For all analyses, we corrected for the bird’s sex. Only the baseline values (i.e. intercepts at day 0 of Inf. 1) differed between the sexes in two of the health measures: Hct (Δ 
  <sub>male-female</sub>: 0.024 
  <span class="underline">+</span> 0.008; T
  <sub>df=21.1</sub> = 3.1; P = 0.005) and condition (Δ 
  <sub>male-female</sub>: 0.06 
  <span class="underline">+</span> 0.02 g/mm; T
  <sub>df=21.9</sub> = 4.1; P &lt; 0.001), for which we controlled in the models. None of the higher interaction terms with sex differed significantly from zero, and the results related to sex will, therefore, not be reported further.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We added a random intercept effect on the level of bird individual, consequently we took into account the correlation among individuals of the same cluster. In all models, a stepwise selection procedure was used in which the model was iteratively refitted after exclusion of the least significant effect, until only significant factors and their lower order interactions terms were left. For the inference of the maximum likelihood estimates of the fixed effects, Kenward Roger approximation was used to estimate the denominator degrees of freedom of the F-distributed test statistics, which takes into account the correlation of observations within the same cluster
