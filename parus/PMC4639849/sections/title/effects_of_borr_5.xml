  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infection and their interaction with tick parasitism
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to the above mentioned seasonal changes in among others body condition, we found that this increase correlated with the 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infection rate. This is highly interesting, since such an increase contrasts with the substantial nutritional and energetic costs that are required to trigger and maintain an inflammatory response
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" href="#b35">35</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" href="#b36">36</a>. Birds may possibly anticipate the costs of an activation of the immune system due to ongoing, non-cleared 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infections. From the pathogen perspective, 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spirochetes could proliferate more successfully in those birds with a stronger body mass increase and it is conceivable that they may even induce such metabolic processes (cf. 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> stimulating fat decompositions in 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" href="#b37">37</a>). When considering the effects of a 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infection on the songbirdâ€™s immune system, we found an interactive effect on the NOx levels between 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infection and the tick loads during previous infestations. NOx has signaling functions in the cascade of an immune response and may also act as a direct non-specific cytotoxin
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">38</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" href="#b39">39</a>. Here, NOx levels decreased with tick infestation levels, but this change was counteracted by the 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infection rate (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3</a>). The decrease of NOx with tick loads can most likely be explained by the immuno-suppressive effects of molecules secreted by the tick saliva
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" href="#b40">40</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" href="#b41">41</a>. This may ultimately also facilitate the proliferation of vector-borne diseases
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b42" href="#b42">42</a>. A stimulation of NOx production by 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infections as shown here, has also been observed in mammals
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" href="#b43">43</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b44" href="#b44">44</a>, where the signal function of NOx plays a significant role in the processes that aim at eliminating 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> spirochetes via macrophages
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b45" href="#b45">45</a>. Interestingly, the acute NOx response against the final tick exposure was lower when the previous 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infection rate (and hence NOx level) was already high (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3</a>). This association suggests a physiological upper limit in the immune reaction, possibly due to a high immune-pathological cost. It could however also indicate that those birds that had already elevated NOx levels because of an ongoing 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infection, were more effective in eradicating additionally introduced bacteria of infestation 3, and hence show a smaller NOx increase. The outcome may also suggest an acquired immune response against 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span>, which would probably be associated with the downregulation of effectors such as NOx. Identifying the specific immunological pathways in birds against tick-
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> exposures requires further research. The NOx association in great tits indicates that competent reservoirs, which are expected to carry infections without showing signs of disease
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" href="#b46">46</a>, may still present measurable symptoms of infection. Nevertheless, the effects of the bacteria on health and mortality in great tits seem to be low, which is in line with findings in other infected native
