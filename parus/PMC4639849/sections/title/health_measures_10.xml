 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We measured six parameters reflecting the hosts’ health status immediately before and after the infestation (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1A</a>). (1) Body condition (mass/tarsus ratio): Body mass was measured to the nearest 0.1 g using a digital balance. We subsequently calculated the ratio between body mass and a skeletal measurement (tarsus length, measured with a digital caliper to the nearest 0.01 mm) as a measure of body condition e.g.

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b64" href="#b64">64</a>. All other health parameters were measured from a blood sample (maximum 65 μL) that was taken from the ulnar vein collected into 75 μL heparinized capillary tubes. (2) Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR): The ESR is a diagnostic method based on the fact that the movement of erythrocytes through plasma is enhanced by increased levels of major acute-phase proteins and immunoglobulins. High values signify an impaired health status

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b66" href="#b66">66</a>. To measure ESR, heparinized capillary tubes containing blood samples were placed vertically for 4 h at 4 °C. The level of ESR was measured by calculating the ratio between the volume of the part of a capillary tube not occupied by red blood cells and the total volume of blood in the capillary tube. As this measure is correlated with the haematocrit level (Hct) (Pearson’s rho = −0.32; P &lt; 0.0001), for further statistical analyses we calculated its residuals of a least squares regression with Hct. (3) Haematocrit level: After measuring the ESR, blood samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 
  <span class="italic">g</span> to measure the Hct. Anaemia, as indicated by low Hct, results in a reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and consequently restricts oxygen-demanding processes
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b67" href="#b67">67</a>. ESR and Hct were measured with a digital calliper to the nearest 0.01 mm under optimal light conditions. (4) Agranulocyte and (5) granulocyte counts (#/10,000 erythrocytes): A drop of blood was smeared on a marked microscope slide, air-dried, fixed in 100% methanol, stained according to a 3-step Romanovsky stains procedure and scanned for 15 min under 400x and 1,000x magnification with oil immersion. None of the blood smears showed infestations with protozoan blood parasites. Before scanning for hematozoa, slides were used to measure leukocyte concentrations (expressed as the number of leukocytes per 10,000 erythrocytes). The total number of leukocytes among approximately 40,000 erythrocytes under 400x magnification were counted. Leukocyte concentrations obtained by this method have been shown to be repeatable

Nitric oxide acts as an immune effector contributing to the control of the acute phase of infection, and NOx measurements can be considered as a robust tool for the assessment of the magnitude of innate immune response and pathogenicity of infections
