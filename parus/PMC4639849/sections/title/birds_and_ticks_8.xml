 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The great tit is a small passerine bird (body mass 15–20 g) which commonly breeds in woodlands and gardens throughout the Palearctic. Great tits act as competent reservoir for

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" href="#b20">20</a>. Wild 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span>-free birds were obtained a few days before fledging by collecting nestlings from parasite-free, artificial nest boxes, which great tits readily accept for breeding
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b59" href="#b59">59</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b60" href="#b60">60</a> (under licence N° S8/VERG/07-U5R26 of the Agency for Nature and Forests, Flemish Government, Belgium) (for details see
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" href="#b20">20</a>). They were introduced together with their parents into tick-free outdoor aviaries located at the University of Antwerp (Belgium), where the parents continued to feed the nestlings until independence. In total 28 naïve 
  <span class="italic">P. major</span> individuals were used in the experiment. Birds received water and food 
  <span class="italic">ad libitum</span> during their stay in captivity, and had the opportunity to take a bath in fresh water. All procedures, including the tick infestation, were carried out in accordance with national environmental legislation and regulations, and were approved by the Ethical Committee for Animal Experiments of the University of Antwerp (License N° 2009-32).

  <span class="italic">Ixodes ricinus</span> nymphs (approximately 3000) were caught by dragging a white flannel flag over suitable vegetation in an area that is endemic for 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span>. The ticks were subsequently kept under sterile conditions in a climate room at &gt;90% relative humidity, a 16 h:8 h (light:dark) photoperiod, and a 25 °C:15 °C temperature cycle until infestation. After feeding on 
  <span class="italic">P. major</span>, the engorged nymphs were kept in individual tubes at 25 °C and &gt;90% relative humidity
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b61" href="#b61">61</a> until moult to the adult stage was completed, after which ticks were screened for 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span>.
