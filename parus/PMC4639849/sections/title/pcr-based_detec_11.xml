 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1414 unfed nymphs and 854 nymphs that had fed and moulted to the adult stage, were immersed in 70% ethanol and stored at −20 °C before testing. All the ticks were screened for the presence of 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia burgdorferi</span> s.l. DNA was extracted by alkaline lysis
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b69" href="#b69">69</a>. For the detection of 
  <span class="italic">B. burgdorferi</span> s.l., a duplex qPCR was redesigned based on existing qPCR protocols on fragments of the OspA
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b70" href="#b70">70</a> and flagellin
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b71" href="#b71">71</a> genes. For a detailed description of primers, probes an qPCR protocol we refer to
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" href="#b23">23</a>. For each PCR and multiplex qPCR, positive, negative controls and blank samples were included. A 10
  <span class="sup">−3</span> to 10
  <span class="sup">−5</span> dilution of DNA from a 
  <span class="italic">B. burgdorferi</span> culture (
  <span class="italic">B. burgdorferi</span> s.s. B31 strain) was used as a positive control. From all qPCR-positive tick lysates, 
  <span class="italic">B. burgdorferi</span> s.l. genospecies were determined by PCR amplification and sequencing of the variable 5S-23S (rrfA-rrlB) intergenic spacer region. In order to minimize contamination, the PCR procedures were performed in three separate rooms, of which the reagent setup and sample addition rooms were kept at positive pressure, whereas the DNA extraction room was kept at negative pressure. All rooms had airlocks.
