 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found that the increase in body condition over the infestation sessions was higher in birds that had more 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infected ticks (interaction session x 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span>: 0.055 ± 0.015 g/mm; F
  <sub>1,27.1</sub> = 13.2, P = 0.0012; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>). Furthermore, the Hct levels significantly changed throughout the observation period as a function of tick loads, with a stronger increase in Hct in birds that carried more ticks (session x ticks = 0.0015 ± 0.0006; F
  <sub>1,37.4</sub> = 6.85, P = 0.012). For the NOx levels, we found an interactive effect of tick exposure and 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infection rates: The change in NOx levels decreased with tick load (session x ticks = −0.0011 ± 0.0004 mmol/L; F
  <sub>1,46</sub> = 5.62, P = 0.02), but the higher the 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infection rates, the more the NOx concentration increased (session x ticks x 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> = 0.0016 ± 0.0007 mmol/L; F
  <sub>1,46</sub> = 4.9, P = 0.03). In none of the other immune measures was the change with infestation session related with the 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infection rates or tick loads. Agranulocyte numbers increased over the course of the experiment (log-link: 0.43 ± 0.09/10,000; F
  <sub>1,47</sub> = 21.0, P &lt; 0.0001), but this was not related to the parasites.
