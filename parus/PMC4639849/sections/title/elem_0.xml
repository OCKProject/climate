 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The number of ticks that successfully fed on the birds (Inf. 1 + Inf. 2) varied among individuals, ranging from 15 to 34 ticks per bird (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Figs 2</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">3</a>). The average number of ticks that successfully fed during each infestation session was: 13.4 ± 0.6, 12.7 ± 0.8, and 11.4 ± 0.8 per bird for Inf. 1 to Inf. 3, respectively. The infestation success did not significantly change with infestation order
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" href="#b20">20</a>. 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> DNA was detected in 12.2% of the 1414 unfed ticks. The average infection rate (i.e. the proportion of ticks being infected per host) significantly increased with each infestation cycle
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">22</a>, being 40 ± 4%, 73 ± 5%, 88 ± 4% for Inf. 1 to Inf. 3, respectively. There was considerable variation among individuals, with cumulative infection rates (sum Inf. 1–3) per bird ranging from 21 to 86% (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Figs 2</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">3</a>). The bird-specific 
  <span class="italic">B. garinii</span> dominated the 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> community, comprising more than 80% of the genotyped tick extracts
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">22</a>. The 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infection rates were not significantly correlated with tick infestation success (Pearson’s rho: −0.1; P = 0.64). None of the health parameters measured immediately before tick exposure 1 (Inf. 1) were associated with the feeding success of the ticks, or 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infection rates (all P’s &gt; 0.05).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the experiment, five birds died (one, two and two during sessions 1, 2, and 3, respectively). One bird that died in session 1, had a high infection rate of 87% (in 16 fed ticks), which was the highest in rank for all birds. All other birds that died had 
  <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infection rates (range rank orders 12–20) and infestation loads (range rank orders 12–22) that were similar to those birds that survived.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found that the increase in body condition over the infestation sessions was higher in birds that had more 
   <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infected ticks (interaction session x

   <sub>1,27.1</sub> = 13.2, P = 0.0012; 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>). Furthermore, the Hct levels significantly changed throughout the observation period as a function of tick loads, with a stronger increase in Hct in birds that carried more ticks (session x ticks = 0.0015 ± 0.0006; F
   <sub>1,37.4</sub> = 6.85, P = 0.012). For the NOx levels, we found an interactive effect of tick exposure and 
   <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infection rates: The change in NOx levels decreased with tick load (session x ticks = −0.0011 ± 0.0004 mmol/L; F
   <sub>1,46</sub> = 5.62, P = 0.02), but the higher the 
   <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infection rates, the more the NOx concentration increased (session x ticks x 
   <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> = 0.0016 ± 0.0007 mmol/L; F
   <sub>1,46</sub> = 4.9, P = 0.03). In none of the other immune measures was the change with infestation session related with the 
   <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infection rates or tick loads. Agranulocyte numbers increased over the course of the experiment (log-link: 0.43 ± 0.09/10,000; F
   <sub>1,47</sub> = 21.0, P &lt; 0.0001), but this was not related to the parasites.
