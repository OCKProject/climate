   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" href="#b20">20</a>. Wild 
   <span class="italic">Borrelia</span>-free birds were obtained a few days before fledging by collecting nestlings from parasite-free, artificial nest boxes, which great tits readily accept for breeding

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b60" href="#b60">60</a> (under licence N° S8/VERG/07-U5R26 of the Agency for Nature and Forests, Flemish Government, Belgium) (for details see
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" href="#b20">20</a>). They were introduced together with their parents into tick-free outdoor aviaries located at the University of Antwerp (Belgium), where the parents continued to feed the nestlings until independence. In total 28 naïve 
   <span class="italic">P. major</span> individuals were used in the experiment. Birds received water and food 
   <span class="italic">ad libitum</span> during their stay in captivity, and had the opportunity to take a bath in fresh water. All procedures, including the tick infestation, were carried out in accordance with national environmental legislation and regulations, and were approved by the Ethical Committee for Animal Experiments of the University of Antwerp (License N° 2009-32).

   <span class="italic">Ixodes ricinus</span> nymphs (approximately 3000) were caught by dragging a white flannel flag over suitable vegetation in an area that is endemic for

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Study design</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When the birds were 9 weeks old, individuals were infested with 
   <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> nymphs three times in succession (Infestation 1–3) (see 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>). Each infestation lasted 4–5 days, and the birds were kept free of ticks for a duration of 5–6 days between the consecutive infestations. Within 20 days, three batches were involved in the experiments (9–10 birds per batch). Batches of birds were stratified according to nest of origin. We infested birds with tick loads corresponding to the maximum level found under natural conditions in our study population. To this end, 17 randomly selected 
   <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> nymphs were put underneath the feathers on the head of each bird in each infestation session using moistened tweezers. Birds were then kept for 2 h in an air-permeable cotton bag (size: 20 cm × 15 cm) inside a darkened cage which kept them inactive
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" href="#b28">28</a>. After tick exposure, birds were placed in individual cages with a wire-mesh floor (40 cm × 80 cm). Below the wire-mesh was a plastic tray containing damp filter paper and edges were streaked with vaseline to prevent nymphs from escaping. The engorged nymphs that dropped through the mesh cage were collected each day with minimal disturbance to the host.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We measured the effects of the 
   <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infection and the cumulative exposure to ticks (Inf. 1+ Inf. 2) on health measures as the change in health status between the moments immediately before tick exposure 1 and immediately before tick exposure 3 (i.e. 5–6 days after Inf. 2). 
   <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infection rate in the ticks are obtained from the three infestation sessions, that is the proportion of ticks that were 
   <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> positive. They were used as a proxy for the bird’s 
   <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infection status built up during the first 20 days (hereafter: ‘
   <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infection rate’). This time period is assumed to be sufficiently long to measure the degree of systemic infectivity, based on literature data on the latent period between the hosts being bitten by an infected tick and becoming infective (6–12 days in American robins 
   <span class="italic">Turdus migratorius</span>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" href="#b16">16</a>, 14 days in juvenile chickens 
   <span class="italic">Gallus gallus</span>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b62" href="#b62">62</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, we studied the change in the acute responses (i.e. the change in health status immediately before and just after tick exposure; 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1A</a>) between infestation 1 and infestation 3 (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1B</a>) in response to the cumulative exposure to the ticks and the 
   <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infection status.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Health measures</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We measured six parameters reflecting the hosts’ health status immediately before and after the infestation (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1A</a>). (1) Body condition (mass/tarsus ratio): Body mass was measured to the nearest 0.1 g using a digital balance. We subsequently calculated the ratio between body mass and a skeletal measurement (tarsus length, measured with a digital caliper to the nearest 0.01 mm) as a measure of body condition e.g.
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b63" href="#b63">63</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b64" href="#b64">64</a>. All other health parameters were measured from a blood sample (maximum 65 μL) that was taken from the ulnar vein collected into 75 μL heparinized capillary tubes. (2) Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR): The ESR is a diagnostic method based on the fact that the movement of erythrocytes through plasma is enhanced by increased levels of major acute-phase proteins and immunoglobulins. High values signify an impaired health status
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b65" href="#b65">65</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b66" href="#b66">66</a>. To measure ESR, heparinized capillary tubes containing blood samples were placed vertically for 4 h at 4 °C. The level of ESR was measured by calculating the ratio between the volume of the part of a capillary tube not occupied by red blood cells and the total volume of blood in the capillary tube. As this measure is correlated with the haematocrit level (Hct) (Pearson’s rho = −0.32; P &lt; 0.0001), for further statistical analyses we calculated its residuals of a least squares regression with Hct. (3) Haematocrit level: After measuring the ESR, blood samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 
   <span class="italic">g</span> to measure the Hct. Anaemia, as indicated by low Hct, results in a reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and consequently restricts oxygen-demanding processes
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b67" href="#b67">67</a>. ESR and Hct were measured with a digital calliper to the nearest 0.01 mm under optimal light conditions. (4) Agranulocyte and (5) granulocyte counts (#/10,000 erythrocytes): A drop of blood was smeared on a marked microscope slide, air-dried, fixed in 100% methanol, stained according to a 3-step Romanovsky stains procedure and scanned for 15 min under 400x and 1,000x magnification with oil immersion. None of the blood smears showed infestations with protozoan blood parasites. Before scanning for hematozoa, slides were used to measure leukocyte concentrations (expressed as the number of leukocytes per 10,000 erythrocytes). The total number of leukocytes among approximately 40,000 erythrocytes under 400x magnification were counted. Leukocyte concentrations obtained by this method have been shown to be repeatable
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" href="#b28">28</a>. (6) Nitric oxide concentrations (NOx): Plasma samples were stored at −80 °C until analysis of NOx (mmol/L). Nitric oxide acts as an immune effector contributing to the control of the acute phase of infection, and NOx measurements can be considered as a robust tool for the assessment of the magnitude of innate immune response and pathogenicity of infections
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">38</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b68" href="#b68">68</a>. We used a spectrophotometric assay based on the reduction of nitrate to nitrite by copper-coated cadmium granules, followed by colour development with a Griess Reagent System according to the protocol described in

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1414 unfed nymphs and 854 nymphs that had fed and moulted to the adult stage, were immersed in 70% ethanol and stored at −20 °C before testing. All the ticks were screened for the presence of 
   <span class="italic">Borrelia burgdorferi</span> s.l. DNA was extracted by alkaline lysis
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b69" href="#b69">69</a>. For the detection of 
   <span class="italic">B. burgdorferi</span> s.l., a duplex qPCR was redesigned based on existing qPCR protocols on fragments of the OspA
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b70" href="#b70">70</a> and flagellin
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b71" href="#b71">71</a> genes. For a detailed description of primers, probes an qPCR protocol we refer to
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" href="#b23">23</a>. For each PCR and multiplex qPCR, positive, negative controls and blank samples were included. A 10

   <span class="sup">−5</span> dilution of DNA from a 
   <span class="italic">B. burgdorferi</span> culture (
   <span class="italic">B. burgdorferi</span> s.s. B31 strain) was used as a positive control. From all qPCR-positive tick lysates, 
   <span class="italic">B. burgdorferi</span> s.l. genospecies were determined by PCR amplification and sequencing of the variable 5S-23S (rrfA-rrlB) intergenic spacer region. In order to minimize contamination, the PCR procedures were performed in three separate rooms, of which the reagent setup and sample addition rooms were kept at positive pressure, whereas the DNA extraction room was kept at negative pressure. All rooms had airlocks.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistical analysis</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GLMM’s (Generalized Linear Mixed Models) were fitted on the health measures ((a)granulocyte counts: poisson distributed residuals, all other variables: normally distributed residuals) to model the change in their initial values (Δ Inf. 3-1) (= Cumulative effects) as a function of the following main effects: total number of ticks (Inf. 1 + 2), 
   <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> infection rate in the ticks and their higher order interactions. In a second analysis, we tested whether the changes in acute effects of tick infestation (‘Δ Acute’, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>) are related to the same main effects as above. For all analyses, we corrected for the bird’s sex. Only the baseline values (i.e. intercepts at day 0 of Inf. 1) differed between the sexes in two of the health measures: Hct (Δ 
   <sub>male-female</sub>: 0.024 
   <span class="underline">+</span> 0.008; T
   <sub>df=21.1</sub> = 3.1; P = 0.005) and condition (Δ 
   <sub>male-female</sub>: 0.06 
   <span class="underline">+</span> 0.02 g/mm; T
   <sub>df=21.9</sub> = 4.1; P &lt; 0.001), for which we controlled in the models. None of the higher interaction terms with sex differed significantly from zero, and the results related to sex will, therefore, not be reported further.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We added a random intercept effect on the level of bird individual, consequently we took into account the correlation among individuals of the same cluster. In all models, a stepwise selection procedure was used in which the model was iteratively refitted after exclusion of the least significant effect, until only significant factors and their lower order interactions terms were left. For the inference of the maximum likelihood estimates of the fixed effects, Kenward Roger approximation was used to estimate the denominator degrees of freedom of the F-distributed test statistics, which takes into account the correlation of observations within the same cluster
