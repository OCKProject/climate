  <div class="title">Changes in immune measures (Δ Cumulative, see 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>) of great tits in relation to the

  <p>Least squares regression lines are fitted. Except for the presented Tick x 
   <span class="italic">Borrelia</span> interaction in NOx, slopes that differ statistically significantly from zero are indicated by a solid line. The size of the symbols portrays the actual difference in the acute response between infestation 3 and 1 (Δ Acute, see 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>). Triangles represent the birds that died during infestation 3.
