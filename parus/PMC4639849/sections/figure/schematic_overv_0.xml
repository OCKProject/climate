   <span class="bold">A</span>) Actions taken during an infestation session (Inf.). “Δ Inf. 1” denotes the acute effect of the tick exposure (17 nymphs) on the birds’ physiology in session 1, i.e. the change in physiological parameters from prior to infestation to the moment that all ticks detached. (
   <span class="bold">B</span>) Schedule of successive infestation sessions. “Δ Cumulative” denotes the change in physiological parameters when birds had the opportunity to recover from the acute tick effects of Inf. 1 and Inf. 2 compared to the initial value in at day 1 (D1). “Δ Acute” denotes the change in acute responses between Inf. 1 and Inf. 3.
