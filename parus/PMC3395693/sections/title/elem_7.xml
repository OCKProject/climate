 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Birds were subjected to a photoperiod treatment consisting of two different lighting regimes. At capture, the local natural photoperiod was 15L:9D (light:dark). The lighting regime of control group birds was a steadily decreasing photoperiod that conformed the natural photoperiod characteristic to study latitude (control photoperiod, hereafter ‘CP’ group). This meant a decrease in day-length by in average 3 min per day. Birds of the experimental group experienced an accelerated seasonal decrease in photoperiod (experimental photoperiod, hereafter ‘EP’ group; 8 min decrease in day-length per day) until reaching 9L:15D photoperiod at the 46th day of experimentation and then held it constantly at this level (

We concomitantly followed the molting pattern of the field population and found this to be similar to that of CP birds (personal observation), indicating that captivity did not alter their normal molting pattern.
