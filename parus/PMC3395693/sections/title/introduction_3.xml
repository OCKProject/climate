 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The trade-off between current reproductive effort and future (residual) reproductive value is of outstanding concern in life history theory 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Lindn1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Lindn1">[1]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Roff1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Roff1">[2]</a>. However, the mechanisms that potentially mediate such long-term effects remain an evolutionary conundrum. It was recently proposed that molt (regular replacement of worn and torn feathers) and the quality of the feathers produced in particular may couple events that precede and follow the molting period via carry-over effects (‘molt constraint’ hypothesis, MCH; 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Nilsson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Nilsson1">[3]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Dawson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Dawson1">[4]</a>). The MCH suggests that the long-term costs of breeding are expressed via a compromised molt, which can lead to plumage malfunctions and hence curtailed future fitness.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The MCH integrates several lines of evidence. First, it assumes that breeding and molt are scheduled sequentially during the annual cycle due to the adaptive avoidance of overlapping two costly activities 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Svensson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Svensson1">[5]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Hemborg1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Hemborg1">[6]</a>, which holds for most temperate zone bird species 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Barta1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Barta1">[7]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Ginn1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Ginn1">[8]</a>. Thus, prolonged breeding due to its late onset or higher investment evokes delayed molt 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Morton1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Morton1">[9]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Helm1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Helm1">[11]</a>. Second, molting is a costly process 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Lindstrm1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Lindstrm1">[12]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0040651-MorenoRueda1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-MorenoRueda1">[14]</a>, and molting birds may encounter elevated energetic constraints due to lower resource availability if the initiation of molt is postponed 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Nilsson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Nilsson1">[3]</a>. Consequently, any delay might manifest in the production of functionally inferior feathers. This may be exacerbated because the approaching winter shortens the time available for plumage exchange, which forces birds to accelerate their rate of molt 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Dawson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Dawson1">[4]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Ginn1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Ginn1">[8]</a>. However, this seems a best-of-a-bad-job strategy because the rate of molt is traded off against the quality of flight feathers 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Dawson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Dawson1">[4]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Hall1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Hall1">[15]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Dawson2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Dawson2">[19]</a> and presumably the structure of body feathers as well 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Nilsson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Nilsson1">[3]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Broggi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Broggi1">[20]</a>. Third, poor-quality feathers might not serve their main functions adequately, e.g. insulation, flight and communication. These losses of function are obviously precipitated in fitness reduction by abating future performance 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Nilsson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Nilsson1">[3]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Barta1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Barta1">[7]</a>. Compromised molt (1) impinge fundamental adverse effects on flight 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Jovani1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Jovani1">[21]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Swaddle2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Swaddle2">[23]</a> and thermoregulation 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Nilsson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Nilsson1">[3]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Broggi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Broggi1">[20]</a> due to lower-quality feathers, (2) diminishes reproductive success because of breakage or altered pigmentation and/or microstructure of feathers involved in visual displays (
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Vgsi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Vgsi1">[24]</a> and refs therein, 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Smith1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Smith1">[25]</a>), or (3) might have multiple costs through starvation–predation and thermoregulation–predation trade-offs 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Macleod1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Macleod1">[26]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Carr1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Carr1">[27]</a>. In conclusion, this cause–effect cascade implies that the molting process might link past (or current) and future life history events.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The MCH has mainly been studied by the correlative approach on the flight feathers of migratory species (
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Serra1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Serra1">[16]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0040651-delaHera2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-delaHera2">[18]</a>; see 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Hall1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Hall1">[15]</a> for an experiment). Exceptions include comparisons of migratory and sedentary blackcap 
  <span class="italic">Sylvia atricapilla</span> populations (e.g. 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-delaHera1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-delaHera1">[17]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-delaHera3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-delaHera3">[28]</a>) and two experiments with European starlings 
  <span class="italic">Sturnus vulgaris</span> in East England 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Dawson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Dawson1">[4]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Dawson2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Dawson2">[19]</a>. Although starlings are sedentary or partial migrants in Britain, their annual routine resembles that of summer-molting migrants with a short breeding period (usually only one clutch in East England) and they shed their plumage early (May–August) 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Perrins1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Perrins1">[29]</a>. Temperate zone migrants commonly employ the summer-molting strategy 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Svensson2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Svensson2">[30]</a> that spans a shorter period and results in the production of lighter feathers compared with sedentary birds 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-delaHera1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-delaHera1">[17]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-delaHera2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-delaHera2">[18]</a>. In contrast, sedentary birds partition their annual cycle into fewer costly activities (lacking migration), which allows more time for plumage renewal 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Ginn1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Ginn1">[8]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-delaHera4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-delaHera4">[31]</a>. An open question is whether the inter-individual variation in molt rate and duration in a less time-constrained sedentary population is sufficiently large to generate variation in feather quality. Furthermore, only one correlative study of sedentary great tits 
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span> dealt with molt constraints on body feather quality 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Broggi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Broggi1">[20]</a>. To the best of our knowledge, no experimental studies have explored whether the accelerated molt rate can represent one of the proximal underpinnings of altered body feather structure, which is one of the cornerstones of the MCH 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Nilsson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Nilsson1">[3]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Broggi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Broggi1">[20]</a>. Altogether, this topic clearly deserves further investigation. The house sparrow 
  <span class="italic">Passer domesticus</span> is a ‘typical’ sedentary bird; it is multi-brooded (up to four clutches in Central and Eastern Europe; 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Perrins1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Perrins1">[29]</a>), consequently its reproductive period is much longer and hence it molts later (August–early November in our wild-living population; Pap PL, Vágási CI, Barta Z unpublished data) than similar-sized migratory species. This makes it an ideal candidate for testing this hypothesis.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Body condition is a phenotypic trait, which refers to size-adjusted, non-skeletal mass and it was defined by Peig and Green 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Peig1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Peig1">[32]</a> as “the energy capital accumulated in the body … assume[d] to be an indicator of an animal’s health and quality.” Variation in body condition has a substantial heritable component in a wide range of taxa (
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Meril1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Meril1">[33]</a> and refs therein) including the house sparrow 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Jensen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Jensen1">[34]</a>. Thus, body condition might have broad evolutionary implications because it shapes a plethora of life history and fitness-related traits 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Roff1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Roff1">[2]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Meril1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Meril1">[33]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-vanNoordwijk1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-vanNoordwijk1">[35]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Green1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Green1">[37]</a>. Molt is not an exception; a trade-off has been documented between body mass (i.e. mass unadjusted to size) and molt rate, and body mass also mediates the molt–immunity trade-off 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-MorenoRueda1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-MorenoRueda1">[14]</a>. Further, body mass and body condition are also relevant to the MCH because body mass can predict molt initiation 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Svensson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Svensson1">[5]</a>, while body condition can predict speed of molt 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Mller1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Mller1">[38]</a>. However, body mass does not correlate with feather growth rate 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Gienapp1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Gienapp1">[39]</a>. Each metabolically costly activity has recourse to finite stores, so birds in a better condition can afford higher investment due to their higher amount of resources available for supporting demanding activities and/or their more efficient replenishment of stores after allocation (higher turnover rate). Embedded in the molt constraint scenario, fitness accrual can be mediated by body condition if birds with greater energy capital can better fuel the demands of molting to grow better-quality feathers, even if molt is compromised (i.e. show higher developmental homeostasis). Yet this aspect has only been addressed indirectly 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-delaHera1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-delaHera1">[17]</a> or investigations have been limited to feather growth rate 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Gienapp1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Gienapp1">[39]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Grubb1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Grubb1">[40]</a> and molt–immunity trade-off 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-MorenoRueda1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-MorenoRueda1">[14]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our previous study showed that house sparrows subjected to a photoperiod regime that simulated a late molting season experienced an accelerated molt of flight feathers, wing coverts and body feathers of the melanin-based throat patch (badge of status) 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Vgsi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Vgsi1">[24]</a>. These indicated that the overall plumage molting program was affected by the treatment. Fast-molting birds renewed their plumage approximately two weeks earlier than controls, although molt initiation was similar in the two groups, and grew a smaller badge and a less bright wing-bar. The current study continued this experimental investigation of the molt pattern in the same birds, but the aim was to determine whether life history trade-offs might be mediated by molt rate. The following predictions were tested. First, the speed of molt should have no effect on feather attributes if the longer molting period of sedentary birds permits cost-spreading. Second, Broggi et al. 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Broggi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Broggi1">[20]</a> found that northern great tits, which face time constraints grew shorter, more densely structured body feathers with fewer plumulaceous barbs. It is suggested that such feather architecture may provide less efficient heat conservation (
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Nilsson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Nilsson1">[3]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Broggi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Broggi1">[20]</a> and refs therein). If the MCH of Nilsson and Svensson 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Nilsson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Nilsson1">[3]</a> stands, the body feather structure of fast-molting experimental sparrows should resemble that of northern great tits. This is a missing piece of the MCH. Third, an interaction between treatment and body condition is predicted if good-quality birds can cope better with a faster molt rate.
