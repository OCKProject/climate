  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We caught 50 non-molting adult male house sparrows at a cattle farm near Cluj Napoca (46°46′N, 23°33′E, Transylvania, Romania) on 25 July 2008. Birds were transferred to the Campus of Babeş-Bolyai University, Cluj Napoca and randomly assigned in equal numbers into two indoor aviaries (each 4 m L×3.5 m W×4 m H). Birds allocated to the aviaries did not differ in any measured aspect (one-way ANOVA, pre-molt wing length: 
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>1,47</sub> = 0.09, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.76; pre-molt tail length:

Coccidian parasites that emerge spontaneously in captive populations were purged by an anticoccidial drug (toltrazuril) administered in the drinking water 
   <a rid="pone.0040651-Vgsi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Vgsi1">[24]</a>. Except one sparrow from the control group that died for unknown reasons, the rest of the birds were released back to the population of origin in good body condition after the termination of the experiment (on 15 November 2008).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Aggressive behavior can determine resource acquisition and has physiological bases (e.g. steroid hormones) that are recognized to influence keratin synthesis. Still, group housing was issued because free-ranging house sparrows are gregarious in the molting period 
   <a rid="pone.0040651-Perrins1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Perrins1">[29]</a>. To preclude the possible confounding effects caused by male–male interactions, we recorded within flock agonistic behavior of individually marked sparrows from a hide, calculated fighting success (% fights won out of total) and included this in all subsequent statistical analyses (see

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Photoperiod Treatment</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Birds were subjected to a photoperiod treatment consisting of two different lighting regimes. At capture, the local natural photoperiod was 15L:9D (light:dark). The lighting regime of control group birds was a steadily decreasing photoperiod that conformed the natural photoperiod characteristic to study latitude (control photoperiod, hereafter ‘CP’ group). This meant a decrease in day-length by in average 3 min per day. Birds of the experimental group experienced an accelerated seasonal decrease in photoperiod (experimental photoperiod, hereafter ‘EP’ group; 8 min decrease in day-length per day) until reaching 9L:15D photoperiod at the 46th day of experimentation and then held it constantly at this level (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040651-g001" href="#pone-0040651-g001">Fig. 1</a>). This setup simulates photoperiod conditions met by early-molting (CP) and late-molting (EP) sparrows. We concomitantly followed the molting pattern of the field population and found this to be similar to that of CP birds (personal observation), indicating that captivity did not alter their normal molting pattern.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Measurements</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wing and tail length (±0.5 mm) were measured with a ruler both pre- and post-molt. At capture and on every 10th day of the 110-day-long experimentation, body mass (±0.1 g) was measured with a Pesola spring balance and molt status was scored (see below). Hereafter, ‘mass’ is shorthand for “mean body mass averaged over the 11 measurement sessions”. Adult house sparrows perform one post-breeding molt per year, thus feathers developed in a given year are retained until the end of breeding in the next year. Only the molting status of primaries was scored because it gives a good general picture about the complete post-breeding molt 
   <a rid="pone.0040651-Pap1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Pap1">[13]</a>. The molt status of each primary on both wings was scored on a 0–5 scale according to Ginn and Melville 
   <a rid="pone.0040651-Ginn1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Ginn1">[8]</a> from which the molting index was derived as the sum of 9 primaries’ scores per wing (range 0–45). Note that the outermost primary is rudimentary in sparrows. Molt of flight feathers starts with the innermost primary. Molt was considered to be started on the day when the molt index was first &gt;0. The reaching of a molt score of 45 marks the end of molt. The duration of molt is the number of days elapsed between molt onset and molt termination.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Once molt was completed, we plucked the 5th and 7th primaries (henceforth P5 and P7) of both wings. We use descendant primary numbering, i.e. the 1st primary, P1, is the innermost. The rationale behind choosing these feathers stems from the followings: (1) P5s were grown when groups started to diverge in molt speed, whereas P7s when the difference in molt speed was the largest between groups (see 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040651-g001" href="#pone-0040651-g001">Fig. 1</a> in 
   <a rid="pone.0040651-Vgsi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Vgsi1">[24]</a>), and (2) P5s grow at the highest rate, whereas P7s are the longest primaries thus necessitating the most keratin, though developing at a slower pace 
   <a rid="pone.0040651-Pap1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Pap1">[13]</a>. We further removed 4–5 contour body feathers from the mantle region. All feathers were stored dry in zip-lock plastic bags. The quality of flight feathers was quantified through 4 parameters (mass, length, the width of the rachis and the number of fault bars; 
   <a rid="pone.0040651-Dawson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Dawson1">[4]</a>,

   <a rid="pone.0040651-Vgsi2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Vgsi2">[43]</a>), whereas that of body feathers through 5 parameters (barbule density, total number of barbs, proportion of plumulaceous barbs, length and area; 
   <a rid="pone.0040651-Broggi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Broggi1">[20]</a>). The rachis is the solid upper part of the feather shaft from which barbs are branching. Barbs have further branches, called barbules that connect the adjacent barbs to form together the feather vane of pennaceous body and flight contour feathers. The measures of left and right wing primaries and that of 2–3 randomly chosen body feathers were averaged to increase measurement accuracy. To reduce measurement error, each trait was assessed by one author (CIV, Z. Benkő or AM) without knowledge on group identity of samples.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dry mass of primaries was measured with a SCALTEC (SBA 32) balance (±0.1 mg). Maximum length of primaries (from the proximal end of calamus to tip) was measured with a ruler (±0.5 mm) by stretching the feather straight. Rachis width of primaries was measured at the base of the vane with a digital caliper (±0.01 mm). The measurement of primary mass, length and rachis width proved to be highly repeatable within individuals (
   <span class="italic">R</span>&gt;0.8) in a previous study with the same methodology 
   <a rid="pone.0040651-Pap1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Pap1">[13]</a>. Fault bars are abnormalities that appear in form of translucent bands quasi perpendicular to the rachis where feathers are prone to break 
   <a rid="pone.0040651-Jovani1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Jovani1">[21]</a>. These were counted on all 4 plucked primaries and summed up. Barbule density of body feathers was measured by taking digital photographs under a stereomicroscope (Olympus SZ61, Tokyo, Japan; camera: Cool SNAP-Pro cf) at 50× magnification. Feathers were placed in a frame fixed to microscope platform aspiring to expose the same feather region. Feathers were sandwiched between two microscope slides to flatten the naturally curved feathers rendering possible planar measurements. Barbules were counted at the three longest barbs along 1.5 mm length of barb starting from the rachis. The standardized 1.5 mm lengths, calibrated from a stage micrometer scale, were traced in ImageJ 
   <a rid="pone.0040651-Rasband1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Rasband1">[44]</a>. When counting the number of barbs we progressed along the shaft at 30× magnification and made a distinction between pennaceous and plumulaceous barbs according to Broggi et al. 
   <a rid="pone.0040651-Broggi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Broggi1">[20]</a>. Pennaceous barbs are compact, closer to each other, have shorter barbules and often form vanes. Plumulaceous barbs are fluffy, with long barbules and do not create vanes, hence trap air for insulation. We recorded the total number of barbs and that of pennaceous ones and calculated the proportion of plumulaceous barbs (%) as (total barbs – pennaceous barbs)/total barbs. For length and area, mantle feathers were photographed (Nikon D80 on tripod) on a grey-card with metric template and sandwiched between two microscope slides. Feather length (±0.01 mm) was measured by tracing a line along the shaft (calamus included), whereas area (±0.01 cm

To test whether treatment has a condition-dependent effect, the treatment × SMI interaction term was also entered. Because the widely used condition proxy computed as residuals from mass on skeletal length ordinary least squares regression violates certain statistical assumptions 
   <a rid="pone.0040651-Green1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Green1">[37]</a>, we calculated SMI (g) as this more accurately indicates non-skeletal mass. SMI was scaled to mean = 0 in each model by subtracting the sample’s mean SMI from each individual’s value in order to gain meaningful parameter estimates. Entering both SMI and fighting success as continuous predictors is reasonable because they are unrelated (Pearson’s product-moment correlation, 
   <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.01, 
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 49, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.98). We first built saturated models that were simplified to minimum adequate models (MAMs) by backward stepwise procedure dropping the predictor with lowest improvement of model fit. For this selection we chose the 
   <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;0.1 criteria to retain confounding variables with weaker influence. MAMs were not allowed to differ from the saturated model in explanatory power. The treatment main effect was always kept in the model, while SMI only when it was significant itself or non-significant itself but significantly interacted with treatment. We adopt stepwise elimination as it performs similarly as information theory approach 
   <a rid="pone.0040651-Murtaugh1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Murtaugh1">[47]</a>. The requirements of MAMs were checked by plot diagnosis. Each model suited the requirements of linearity, residual’s variance and distribution, and no outliers (i.e. standardized residuals &gt; |3|) were detected.
