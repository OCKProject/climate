 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wing and tail length (±0.5 mm) were measured with a ruler both pre- and post-molt. At capture and on every 10th day of the 110-day-long experimentation, body mass (±0.1 g) was measured with a Pesola spring balance and molt status was scored (see below). Hereafter, ‘mass’ is shorthand for “mean body mass averaged over the 11 measurement sessions”. Adult house sparrows perform one post-breeding molt per year, thus feathers developed in a given year are retained until the end of breeding in the next year. Only the molting status of primaries was scored because it gives a good general picture about the complete post-breeding molt 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Pap1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Pap1">[13]</a>. The molt status of each primary on both wings was scored on a 0–5 scale according to Ginn and Melville 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Ginn1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Ginn1">[8]</a> from which the molting index was derived as the sum of 9 primaries’ scores per wing (range 0–45). Note that the outermost primary is rudimentary in sparrows. Molt of flight feathers starts with the innermost primary. Molt was considered to be started on the day when the molt index was first &gt;0. The reaching of a molt score of 45 marks the end of molt. The duration of molt is the number of days elapsed between molt onset and molt termination.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Once molt was completed, we plucked the 5th and 7th primaries (henceforth P5 and P7) of both wings. We use descendant primary numbering, i.e. the 1st primary, P1, is the innermost. The rationale behind choosing these feathers stems from the followings: (1) P5s were grown when groups started to diverge in molt speed, whereas P7s when the difference in molt speed was the largest between groups (see

  <a rid="pone.0040651-Vgsi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Vgsi1">[24]</a>), and (2) P5s grow at the highest rate, whereas P7s are the longest primaries thus necessitating the most keratin, though developing at a slower pace 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Pap1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Pap1">[13]</a>. We further removed 4–5 contour body feathers from the mantle region. All feathers were stored dry in zip-lock plastic bags. The quality of flight feathers was quantified through 4 parameters (mass, length, the width of the rachis and the number of fault bars;

  <a rid="pone.0040651-Broggi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Broggi1">[20]</a>). The rachis is the solid upper part of the feather shaft from which barbs are branching. Barbs have further branches, called barbules that connect the adjacent barbs to form together the feather vane of pennaceous body and flight contour feathers. The measures of left and right wing primaries and that of 2–3 randomly chosen body feathers were averaged to increase measurement accuracy. To reduce measurement error, each trait was assessed by one author (CIV, Z. Benkő or AM) without knowledge on group identity of samples.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dry mass of primaries was measured with a SCALTEC (SBA 32) balance (±0.1 mg). Maximum length of primaries (from the proximal end of calamus to tip) was measured with a ruler (±0.5 mm) by stretching the feather straight. Rachis width of primaries was measured at the base of the vane with a digital caliper (±0.01 mm). The measurement of primary mass, length and rachis width proved to be highly repeatable within individuals (

  <a rid="pone.0040651-Pap1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Pap1">[13]</a>. Fault bars are abnormalities that appear in form of translucent bands quasi perpendicular to the rachis where feathers are prone to break 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Jovani1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Jovani1">[21]</a>. These were counted on all 4 plucked primaries and summed up. Barbule density of body feathers was measured by taking digital photographs under a stereomicroscope (Olympus SZ61, Tokyo, Japan; camera: Cool SNAP-Pro cf) at 50× magnification. Feathers were placed in a frame fixed to microscope platform aspiring to expose the same feather region. Feathers were sandwiched between two microscope slides to flatten the naturally curved feathers rendering possible planar measurements. Barbules were counted at the three longest barbs along 1.5 mm length of barb starting from the rachis. The standardized 1.5 mm lengths, calibrated from a stage micrometer scale, were traced in ImageJ 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Rasband1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Rasband1">[44]</a>. When counting the number of barbs we progressed along the shaft at 30× magnification and made a distinction between pennaceous and plumulaceous barbs according to Broggi et al. 
  <a rid="pone.0040651-Broggi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0040651-Broggi1">[20]</a>. Pennaceous barbs are compact, closer to each other, have shorter barbules and often form vanes. Plumulaceous barbs are fluffy, with long barbules and do not create vanes, hence trap air for insulation. We recorded the total number of barbs and that of pennaceous ones and calculated the proportion of plumulaceous barbs (%) as (total barbs – pennaceous barbs)/total barbs. For length and area, mantle feathers were photographed (Nikon D80 on tripod) on a grey-card with metric template and sandwiched between two microscope slides. Feather length (±0.01 mm) was measured by tracing a line along the shaft (calamus included), whereas area (±0.01 cm
