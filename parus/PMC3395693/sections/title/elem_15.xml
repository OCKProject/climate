 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because feather mass and length were strongly positively correlated (P5: 
  <span class="italic">b</span> = 0.39±0.06, 
  <span class="italic">t</span> = 6.70, 
  <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;0.0001; P7: 
  <span class="italic">b</span> = 0.36±0.08, 
  <span class="italic">t</span> = 4.65, 
  <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;0.0001) and treatment had qualitatively similar results on these two parameters, we show only results concerning feather length. Groups did not differ in the length (mm) of P5 (CP: 65.79±0.37; EP: 65.04±0.28) and P7 (CP: 69.77±0.27; EP: 68.78±0.30), but treatment interacted with SMI (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0040651-t001" href="#pone-0040651-t001">Table 1</a>). This indicates that feather length was unrelated to condition in the CP group (P5: 
  <span class="italic">b</span> = –0.27±0.28, 
  <span class="italic">t</span> = –0.98, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.33; P7: 
  <span class="italic">b</span> = –0.35±0.23, 
  <span class="italic">t</span> = –1.50, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.14), whereas a positive association was found in the EP group (P5: 
  <span class="italic">b</span> = 0.94±0.46, 
  <span class="italic">t</span> = 2.62, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.01; P7: 
  <span class="italic">b</span> = 0.98±0.46, 
  <span class="italic">t</span> = 3.46, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.001) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040651-g003" href="#pone-0040651-g003">Fig. 3</a>). The rachis width (mm) of P5 was not affected by treatment (CP: 0.97±0.01; EP: 0.96±0.01), but was positively related to body condition (
  <span class="italic">b</span> = 0.02±0.01;

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040651-g003" href="#pone-0040651-g003">Fig. 3C</a>). The rachis width of P7 was unaffected either by treatment (CP: 1.06±0.01; EP: 1.04±0.01) or by other predictors (
