 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The data presented here form part of a growing body of evidence that supports the existence of a second interglacial in the British late Middle Pleistocene, which included some ‘Hoxnian’ palaeovegetation elements (cf. 
  <a rid="bib115 bib128 bib113" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib115 bib128 bib113">Scourse et al., 1999; Thomas, 2001; Scourse, 2006</a>). This interglacial has been correlated with MIS 9 on the basis of the widely held assumption that the Anglian can be equated with MIS 12 and the Hoxnian with part of MIS 11 (cf. 
  <a rid="bib14 bib107 bib49 bib111 bib95" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib14 bib107 bib49 bib111 bib95">Bridgland, 1994; Rowe et al., 1999; Grün and Schwarcz, 2000; Schreve, 2001; Preece et al., 2007</a>). In addition to Cudmore Grove and the aforementioned interglacial estuarine deposits in southern Essex (Shoeburyness, Barling, North Wick and Canewdon), the interglacial beds at Purfleet and Grays (
  <a rid="bib14 bib112" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib14 bib112">Bridgland, 1994; Schreve et al., 2002</a>; 
  <a rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>) and Hackney Downs (
  <a rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib46">Green et al., 2006</a>) have all been assigned to this temperate event. These deposits have been separated from the Hoxnian and later temperate stages using aminostratigraphy, mammalian biostratigraphy and by their position in the Thames terrace sequence; in no case has separation been possible on the basis of pollen biostratigraphy alone. Of these sites, the sequence at Cudmore Grove is by far the most complete, and, we argue, the most important: it spans a considerable part of the interglacial, provides detailed insights into the climate and local environment associated with this temperate stage, and evidence of high relative sea levels in the southern North Sea region. Moreover, the record shows that the marine transgression of this interglacial differed in its timing in this region from that of the preceding Hoxnian, taking place during the oak-dominated, early-temperate sub-stage. The maximum height attained by this inferred MIS 9 marine transgression is less easy to ascertain, as the Cudmore Grove interglacial beds are locally compacted and do not necessarily record the maximum flooding surface, which may or not be represented in the grey clays (Unit 5). Evidence from the interglacial channel-fills on the Southend Peninsula suggests that relative sea levels attained a height of at least ca 5–7 m O.D. in this region during the early-temperate sub-stage of this interglacial (
  <a rid="bib99 bib22" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib99 bib22">Roe, 1999; Bridgland et al., 2001</a>). This compares with the estimate of ca &gt;20 m O.D. inferred for the Hoxnian RSL highstand during Ho IIIb from Swanscombe (
  <a rid="bib62 bib14" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib62 bib14">Kerney, 1971; Bridgland, 1994</a>). However, the possibility of differential post-depositional movements associated with long-term tectonic subsidence in the Thames Estuary (cf. 
  <a rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib33">D'Olier, 1972</a>) means that comparisons of the highstand maxima must be made with caution.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Flint artefacts indicate that hominins were present during the infilling of the Cudmore Grove Channel, as they were at contemporary sites such as Grays and Purfleet in the Lower Thames (
  <a rid="bib112" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib112">Schreve et al., 2002</a>). A full archaeological excavation of the margins of the channel may therefore be worthwhile.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Perhaps the most important attribute of the Cudmore Grove record are the insights that it provides into the vegetation history of MIS 9 in southern Britain, particularly its record of the late-temperate sub-stage, which is missing from all the other regional sites presumed to be of this age (cf. 
  <a rid="bib128" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib128">Thomas, 2001</a>). Interestingly, one possible exception is the interglacial sequence in the Nar Valley, Norfolk, which has long been correlated with the Hoxnian (e.g. 
  <a rid="bib120 bib134 bib135 bib42" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib120 bib134 bib135 bib42">Stevens, 1960; Ventris, 1986, 1996; Gibbard et al., 1992</a>). Here, a complex succession of freshwater and marine deposits, locally over 10 m thick and extending up to 23 m O.D., overlies Anglian glacial sediments (Woodlands Farm Member of the Lowestoft Formation) (
  <a rid="bib134 bib42 bib68" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib134 bib42 bib68">Ventris, 1986; Gibbard et al., 1992; Lewis, 1999</a>). The pollen spectra from the marine beds include well defined 
  <span class="italic">Abies</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Carpinus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Empetrum</span> peaks, which have been ascribed to the Hoxnian late-temperate sub-stage (
  <a rid="bib120 bib134 bib135" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib120 bib134 bib135">Stevens, 1960; Ventris, 1986, 1996</a>), whereas the same unit has also yielded a diatom flora indicative of a nearshore, shelf environment (
  <a rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib77">Mitlehner, 1992</a>). This Hoxnian correlation has recently been challenged by 
  <span class="sup">230</span>Th/
  <span class="sup">238</span>U dates from peats within the Nar Valley freshwater beds, which have produced a mean age of 317 ± 14 ka, suggesting a correlation with MIS 9 (
  <a rid="bib106" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib106">Rowe et al., 1997</a>). Conventional isoleucine epimerization determinations on the foraminiferid 
  <span class="italic">Ammonia beccarii</span> from the Nar Valley marine beds add independent support to this interpretation (
  <a rid="bib115" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib115">Scourse et al., 1999</a>). The mean aIle/Ile ratio obtained (0.135) is much lower than ratios (ca 0.2) based on the same species from the offshore interglacial Sand Hole Formation in the Inner Silver Pit, ca 20 km off the coast of East Yorkshire (
  <a rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>). This deposit also yielded high levels of 
  <span class="italic">Abies</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Picea</span> and has similarly been ascribed to the Hoxnian late-temperate sub-stage (
  <a rid="bib114" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib114">Scourse et al., 1998</a>). These differences in ratios might reflect contrasting post-depositional thermal histories between the two sites, but it seems more likely that the Nar Valley and the Sand Hole Formation interglacial beds date from two temperate stages (MIS 9 and MIS 11 respectively) characterized by similar palaeovegetation (
  <a rid="bib115" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib115">Scourse et al., 1999</a>). If this interpretation is correct, then the widely held correlation of the Anglian glacial sediments in the Nar Valley with MIS 12 is thrown into question, although 
  <a rid="bib115" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib115">Scourse et al. (1999: p. 554)</a> suggest that a substantial hiatus may exist between the Woodlands Farm Member and the Nar Valley freshwater beds. This warrants further investigation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The stratigraphic separation of the Cudmore Grove interglacial deposits from those at neighbouring Clacton directly thus directly parallels the separation that has been made between the Nar Valley interglacial beds and the Sand Hole Formation on the basis of conventional aminostratigraphy and uranium series dating. Together these findings imply that: i) 
  <span class="italic">Abies</span> was indeed a constituent of the regional forests in southern Britain during the late-temperate sub-stages of two successive late Middle Pleistocene interglacials, which are suggested to be equivalent to MIS 9 and 11; and ii) these interglacials were both characterized by high relative sea levels in the Southern North Sea region. This postulated distribution of 
  <span class="italic">Abies</span> in the British late Middle Pleistocene tallies with the inferred distribution of the tree from the maar lake records of the Velay region, central France, where 
  <span class="italic">Abies</span> appears to have been a significant forest component in both the latter stages of the Praclaux (MIS 11) and Landos (MIS 9) interglacials (
  <a rid="bib97 bib9" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib97 bib9">Reille et al., 2000; de Beaulieu et al., 2001</a>), although it was also present on a significantly reduced scale in the Bouchet 2 and 3 interstadials, which are correlated with MIS 7 (
  <a rid="bib97" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib97">Reille et al., 2000</a>). Such long-distance comparisons must be made with caution, however, as the composition of the interglacial forests of central France may have differed to those prevailing in southern Britain. Certainly the collective evidence from Britain implies that the biostratigraphical significance formerly attributed to 
  <span class="italic">Abies</span> as a Hoxnian ‘indicator taxon’ in the late Middle Pleistocene should now be abandoned.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On a wider European scale, the evidence for two marine highstands associated with interglacial deposits of ‘Hoxnian-type’ character in the Southern North Sea region has more far-reaching implications, for it follows that the ‘Holsteinian’ marine beds of continental Europe may also record more than one interglacial high sea-level event. In short, we refute the contention that the issue of “two Holstein-like Interglacials” is “a problem confined to the Quaternary of the British Isles” as advocated by 
  <a rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib38">Geyh and Müller (2006: p. 3072)</a>. Whether polleniferous marine sediments of the inferred MIS 9 and MIS 11 highstands are widely present in other areas of the Southern North Sea and western Baltic regions remains to be seen; this paper has certainly highlighted their rather patchy distribution in southern Britain. What has become clear is the need to continue to adopt a multidisciplinary approach, supplementing pollen biostratigraphy with other more rigorous stratigraphical and geochronological techniques, to separate and better constrain these interglacials with ‘Hoxnian-like’ affinities.
