 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The silty clays are truncated at the southwestern part of the site by a thin bed of shelly detritus muds, composed of abundant shell debris in a matrix of dark brown (7.5YR 2/0) silty clay. This deposit, which when sampled in the early 1990s was only a few centimetres thick, is richly fossiliferous and has yielded a wealth of faunal remains (
  <a rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib57">Holman et al., 1990</a>; see below). The detritus muds were formerly more extensive and up to 30 cm thick (
  <a rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib18">Bridgland et al., 1988</a>) but have been eroded significantly by ongoing cliff retreat. The contact between the detritus muds and the silty clays of Unit 2 is sharp and is marked by a thin bed of coarse sand. The maximum thickness of the detritus muds (15 cm) was recorded near borehole MM3 (
  <a rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#fig5">Fig. 5</a>). From here the unit thins rapidly westwards, grading into 2–3 cm layer of grey sand and eventually disappearing near borehole MM5.
