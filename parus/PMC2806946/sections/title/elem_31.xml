 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three main local diatom assemblage zones (ldaz) are recognised (CGD1–CGD3; 
  <a rid="fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#fig8">Fig. 8</a>). In ldaz CGD2 the assemblage is complex and the zone has been divided into three subzones ldaz CGD2a–2c.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ldaz CGD1 (15.10–12.70 m)</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This zone, which spans the lower silty clays (sub-unit 2b), is characterized by a fining upward sedimentary sequence. Diatoms are absent below ca 15 m. Freshwater (oligohalobous–indifferent) taxa, dominated by 
   <span class="italic">Aulacoseira granulata</span> (Ehr.) Simonsen reach &gt;50% of the total assemblage, with 
   <span class="italic">Fragilaria pinnata</span> Ehr., 
   <span class="italic">Fragilaria brevistriata</span> Grun. and 
   <span class="italic">Fragilaria lapponica</span> Grun. together at &gt;15%. Brackish-water (mesohalobous and oligohalobous–halophilous) species are present throughout the zone at low values (&lt;10%). Marine diatoms (polyhalobous) occur erratically, with the littoral species 
   <span class="italic">Paralia sulcata</span> (Ehr.) Cleve making an early appearance.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This subzone begins close to the contact of sub-units 2b and 2c in borehole CG1 and marks the major expansion of polyhalobous taxa to &gt;28%, with 
   <span class="italic">P. sulcata</span> rising to &gt;20%. Other marine taxa present at lower frequencies include 
   <span class="italic">Diploneis smithii</span> (Bréb.) Cleve, 
   <span class="italic">Cymatosira belgica</span> Grun. and 
   <span class="italic">Thalassiosira excentrica</span> (Ehr.) Cleve. The expansion of marine diatoms is accompanied by a increase in brackish species, dominated by

   <span class="italic">Nitzschia navicularis</span> (Bréb.) Grun. and

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Significant fluctuations occur between freshwater and marine diatoms in this subzone.

   <span class="italic">A. granulata</span> declines to 10–15% and is joined at similar values by

   <span class="italic">Actinocyclus normanii</span> (Greg.) Hust., which reaches &gt;80%. At the base of the zone, marine taxa, dominated by 
   <span class="italic">P. sulcata</span> and
