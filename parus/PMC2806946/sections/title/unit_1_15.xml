 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The basal sands and gravels (Unit 1) recovered from borehole CG1 were found to comprise the same general lithologies (southern, exotic and local) as typical Thames–Medway gravels (
  <a rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib13">Bridgland, 1988</a>; 
  <a rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>). However, proportions of the three types differed significantly. First, the samples included much higher levels of angular (non-Tertiary flint), which gave Tertiary:non-Tertiary flint ratios of 5.36 and 6.22 (ratios from Thames–Medway gravels rarely exceed 1). These ratios are comparable to those recorded by 
  <a rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib12">Bridgland (1983)</a> in the ‘Upper Holland Gravel’ near Clacton, a deposit that is thought to be enriched with distal outwash material (
  <a rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib14">Bridgland, 1994</a>: p. 287). The Unit 1 samples also yielded much higher frequencies of exotics (9.7% and 13.2% of the total) than local Thames–Medway gravels, which typically contain 0.5–2.5% (
  <a rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib12">Bridgland, 1983</a>). In this case, the most probable source is the exotic-rich Kesgrave Member deposits that outcrop widely to the north and west of Mersea Island (
  <a rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, the range of lithologies in the Unit 1 gravels indicates a composition intermediate between Thames–Medway and outwash, with an additional element of Kesgrave material. The gravels may, therefore, have been aggraded by the Thames–Medway itself, downstream of a confluence with a river re-working fluvio-glacial sediments. Alternatively, they could have been deposited by a tributary that was fed by streams re-working older Thames–Medway, fluvio-glacial and Kesgrave deposits.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A single analysis from the Cudmore Grove Channel lag differed from the counts described above in showing a typical Thames–Medway composition (cf. 
  <a rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib18">Bridgland et al., 1988</a>; 
  <a rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>). Unfortunately, no counts were obtained from this marginal deposit in the present study because pebble numbers were too low to obtain a valid sample size. Nevertheless, general observations confirmed that the deposit was indeed much richer in Tertiary flint than the gravels in borehole CG1. It therefore appears that the basal gravel is a composite deposit, the thinner, marginal part of which probably represents a lag derived from older Thames–Medway sediments.
