 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pollen analyses were undertaken on the sediments of borehole CG1 and were prepared using the method of 
  <a rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib8">Berglund and Ralska-Jasiewiczowa (1986)</a>. Pollen was recovered from the sediments between 6.27 and 14.80 m in this borehole, spanning Units 2–4 (
  <a rid="fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#fig7">Fig. 7</a>). The sandy facies at the base of Unit 2 (14.80–16 m) yielded only degraded 
  <span class="italic">Pinus</span> pollen at sparse concentrations, precluding detailed analyses. Plant macrofossil remains retained at the sieving stage of pollen preparation are given in
