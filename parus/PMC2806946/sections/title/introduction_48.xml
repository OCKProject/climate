 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Samples taken throughout the organic clays (Unit 4) mostly yielded sparse, fragmentary and indeterminable insect remains. However, bulk samples (∼5 kg wet weight) from the detritus muds (Unit 3) exposed in a foreshore trench (
  <a rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>) produced fossil Coleoptera that were well enough preserved to enable some taxa to be identified. The insect remains were recovered from the sediment using the method outlined by 
  <a rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib24">Coope (1986)</a>. Altogether 65 coleopteran taxa were recognised of which 47 could be determined to species level (
