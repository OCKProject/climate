  <span class="italic">Oulimnius tuberculatus</span>, represented by a single specimen, is the only beetle indicative of running water, where it lives amongst stones and moss in shallow well-aerated riffles (
  <a rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib55">Holland, 1972</a>). However, the caddisfly 
  <span class="italic">Hydropsyche contubernalis</span> McL. is usually found in large slow-flowing rivers (
  <a rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib34">Edington and Hildrew, 1995</a>). All the rest of the aquatic beetles are typical of standing or very slowly moving. The large carnivorous dytiscid taxa 
  <span class="italic">Agabus bipustulatus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Ilybius</span> sp., 
  <span class="italic">Acilius</span> sp. and 
  <span class="italic">Dytiscus</span> sp. live in well-vegetated ponds. The hydrophilids 
  <span class="italic">Coelostoma orbiculare</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Cercyon convexiusculus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Hydrobius fuscipes</span> occur in similar habitats where they feed on decomposing plant material. 
  <span class="italic">Chaetarthria seminulum</span> lives in wet mud, usually beside eutrophic pools or on the muddy banks of slow-flowing streams (
  <a rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib50">Hansen, 1987</a>). 
  <span class="italic">Macroplea appendiculata</span> lives permanently underwater feeding mostly on 
  <span class="italic">Potamogeton</span> but also on 
  <span class="italic">Myriophyllum spicatum</span> and other pond-weeds. 
  <span class="italic">Macronychus quadrituberculatus</span> lives in the fissures of submerged logs or rocks in fairly large, slow-moving rivers, where it probably feeds on algae. It is an extremely rare species in Britain today probably due to the reduction of its habitat by riverine management activities. 
  <span class="italic">Tanysphyrus lemnae</span> is a minute weevil that feeds on the duckweed 
  <span class="italic">Lemna</span> on the surface of stagnant water.
