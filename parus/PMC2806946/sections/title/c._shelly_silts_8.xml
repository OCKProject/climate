 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The lower silty clays grade upwards into a thick sequence of massive, dark grey silts with scattered shell debris. These vary in thickness, from ca 5 m near borehole MM5 to &lt;1 m in the southwest. The shelly silts can also be traced to the end of the sea wall in the northeast, where they extend from −3 m to 2 m O.D. (
