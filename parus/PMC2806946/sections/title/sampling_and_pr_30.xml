  <a rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#fig5">Fig. 5</a>), collected in 1986, recovered ca 5.5 m of sediment spanning sub-units 2b–2d, below 0.5 m of modern beach sand. Samples from the eroded Units 3–4 at CG0 were taken from a separate borehole ca 8 m away, near the position of borehole 9 (
  <a rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#fig5">Fig. 5</a>). Borehole CG1, ca 50 m east of CG0 in the deeper part of the channel, which was collected in 1990, provided a thicker and more complete sedimentary sequence (Units 2–4) through the interglacial (
  <a rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#fig4">Fig. 4</a>). Diatom samples from this core came from 6.7 m to below 16 m, providing overlap and continuation of the record from CG0. The diatom assemblages from the cores have been integrated. Preparation of the sediments for diatoms was based upon standard techniques (
