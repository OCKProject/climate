 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The upper sands and gravels (Unit 6) show some compositional similarities to the Thames–Medway gravels of the Southend and Dengie Peninsulas (cf. 
  <a rid="bib12 bib43" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib12 bib43">Bridgland, 1983; Gibbard et al., 1996</a>). They differ, however, in their marginally higher proportions of exotics, which reach 2.4–4.6% (for comparison, frequencies in the Asheldham Member on the Dengie Peninsula rarely exceed 2.0%). The assemblages nevertheless compare closely with those of gravels found elsewhere on the island, which have also been assigned to the Mersea Island Member (

  <a rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>). 
  <a rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib12">Bridgland (1983)</a> attributed their slight enrichment of exotics to the input of additional quartzose material from a tributary, possibly the proto-Blackwater, which joined the Thames–Medway between the Dengie Peninsula and Mersea Island.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Whatever the origin of the exotics, the close similarities shown between the counts from Units 6a and 6b suggest that the same materials were being sourced throughout the aggradation, in spite of the inferred changes in flow direction (
  <a rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>; 
  <a rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>c). This is somewhat surprising, since the upper gravel-rich facies appear to have been deposited by a river flowing from the northeast, a direction that is inconsistent with a Thames–Medway origin. It is therefore possible that these upper gravels were reworked by a smaller river (perhaps a proto-River Colne) from older Thames–Medway material to the north.
