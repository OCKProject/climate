 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A new technique of amino acid analysis has been developed for geochronological purposes (
  <a rid="bib83 bib84 bib86" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib83 bib84 bib86">Penkman, 2005; Penkman et al., 2007a, 2008a</a>), combining a reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method of analysis (
  <a rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib60">Kaufman and Manley, 1998</a>) with the isolation of an ‘intra-crystalline’ fraction of amino acids by bleach treatment (
  <a rid="bib127" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib127">Sykes et al., 1995</a>). This combination of techniques results in the analysis of D/L (dextro- and laevo-rotatory optical isomers) values of multiple amino acids from the chemically protected protein within the biomineral, thereby enabling both decreased sample sizes and increased reliability of the analysis.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Amino acid racemization (AAR) analyses were undertaken on shells and opercula from bulk samples from Unit 3: four shells of 
  <span class="italic">B. tentaculata</span> (NEaar 0859, 0888–0890; published in 
  <a rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib84">Penkman et al., 2007a</a>), four shells of 
  <span class="italic">V. piscinalis</span> (NEaar 0855–0858; published in 
  <a rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib84">Penkman et al., 2007a</a>) and four opercula of 
  <span class="italic">B. tentaculata</span> (NEaar 0891–0894). Seven 
  <span class="italic">B. tentaculata</span> opercula (NEaar 2407–8, 3728–3730, 3820–2821) have also been analysed from the neighbouring ‘East Mersea Restaurant Site’ (Sample 3) (
  <a rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>); five previously published by 
  <a rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib85">Penkman et al. (2007b)</a> (NEaar 3728–3730, 3820–3821) and two new analyses (NEaar 2407–8). All samples were prepared using the procedures of 
  <a rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib83">Penkman (2005)</a> and 
  <a rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib86">Penkman et al. (2008a)</a> to isolate the intra-crystalline protein by bleaching. Two subsamples were then taken from each shell; one fraction was directly demineralised and the free amino acids analysed (referred to as the ‘Free’ amino acids, FAA, F), and the second was treated to release the peptide-bound amino acids, thus yielding the ‘total’ amino acid concentration, referred to as the ‘Total Hydrolysable amino acid fraction’ (THAA, H*). Samples were analysed in duplicate by RP-HPLC.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The DL ratios of aspartic acid/asparagine, glutamic acid/glutamine, serine, alanine and valine (D/L Asx, Glx, Ser, Ala, Val) as well as the [Ser]/[Ala] value provide an overall estimate of protein decomposition (
  <a rid="fig10" ref-type="fig" href="#fig10">Fig. 10</a>; 
  <a rid="appseca1" ref-type="sec" href="#appseca1">Supplementary Online Appendix 1</a>). Serine is one of the most geochemically unstable amino acids, with one of its decomposition products being alanine (
  <a rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib6">Bada et al., 1978</a>). This enables the ratio of the concentration of serine ([Ser]) to the concentration of alanine ([Ala]) to be used as a useful indication of the extent of protein decomposition. The D/L of an amino acid will increase with increasing time, whilst the [Ser]/[Ala] value will decrease. The D/L of Ser is less useful as a geochronological tool for samples of this age, but is presented here as aberrant values are useful indications of contamination.
