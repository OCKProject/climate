  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fossiliferous deposits were first reported at East Mersea in the early 1900s by 
   <a rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib29">Dalton (1908)</a>, although no specific mention was made of vertebrate remains. Later accounts by 
   <a rid="bib137 bib138" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib137 bib138">Warren (1917, 1933)</a> and 
   <a rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib27">Cornwall (1958)</a> mention bones of 
   <span class="italic">Hippopotamus</span> and therefore probably refer to the deposits of Ipswichian age that are known from the nearby ‘Hippopotamus Site’ (
   <a rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib17">Bridgland and Sutcliffe, 1995</a>) and the ‘East Mersea Restaurant Site’ (
   <a rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib20">Bridgland et al., 1995</a>) a short distance away on the foreshore (
   <a rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>). The detritus muds (Unit 3) at Cudmore Grove have yielded an extensive vertebrate assemblage including mammals, birds and herpetiles (
   <a rid="bib18 bib57" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib18 bib57">Bridgland et al., 1988; Holman et al., 1990</a>) and fish. Unit 1 has yielded a fragmentary molar of an indeterminate elephant (G.R. Ward, personal communication) and a single bone of 
   <span class="italic">Bison</span> or 
   <span class="italic">Bos</span> was recovered from Unit 2 (
   <a rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib98">Roe, 1994</a>). The specimens from Unit 3 are extremely well preserved, showing no significant signs of rolling or abrasion. The presence of fragile herpetile vertebrae and small mammal mandibles with the dentition still 
   <span class="italic">in situ</span> suggests that there has been little post-depositional disturbance.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At least 18 mammalian taxa have been recognized amongst the 1508 bones and teeth recovered from the detritus muds (Unit 3) (
   <a rid="tbl5" ref-type="table" href="#tbl5">Table 5</a>). In addition, 11 fish taxa, 14 herpetofaunal taxa (364 specimens) and 11 avian taxa (41 specimens) have been recorded.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 11 fish taxa recovered from Unit 3 belong to seven different families (
    <a rid="tbl5" ref-type="table" href="#tbl5">Table 5</a>). All are typical of freshwater rivers and streams, although a few can tolerate more saline habitats. The fish remains would therefore seem to have been transported from purely freshwater habitats upstream of tidal influence. The most interesting species is sturgeon (
    <span class="italic">Acipenser</span> sp.) represented by distinctive fragments of scute, the presence of which indicates that Unit 3 includes material transported by a sizeable stream or river. Interestingly, sturgeon (
    <span class="italic">Acipenser sturio</span>) was recovered from the interglacial beds at Purfleet in the Lower Thames region (
    <a rid="bib112" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib112">Schreve et al., 2002</a>; 
    <a rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>), a site which is believed to occupy a similar position in the Thames terrace sequence to Cudmore Grove (

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Herpetofauna</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The herpetofaunal assemblage, one of the richest reported from Britain (
    <a rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib57">Holman et al., 1990</a>), provides valuable palaeoclimatic information, since the geographical distributions of these animals are closely linked to temperature. All herpetiles are directly reliant upon external heat for their survival, and in the case of oviparous reptiles, require certain minimum temperatures for the hatching of their eggs. Six of the 14 herpetile taxa reported from Cudmore Grove by 
    <a rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib57">Holman et al. (1990)</a> are not native in Britain: water frog or edible frog (
    <span class="italic">Rana ridibunda</span> or 
    <span class="italic">Rana esculenta</span>), moor frog (
    <span class="italic">Rana arvalis</span>) tree frog (
    <span class="italic">Hyla</span> sp.), viperine or dice snake (
    <span class="italic">Natrix tessellata</span> or 
    <span class="italic">Natrix maura</span>), aesculapian snake (
    <span class="italic">Zamenis longissimus</span>) and European pond terrapin (
    <span class="italic">Emys orbicularis</span>). There is some debate over the degree of oceanicity or continentality indicated by these exotic taxa. Based upon their present-day ranges, 
    <a rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib57">Holman et al. (1990)</a> suggested that the palaeoclimate at Cudmore Grove was slightly warmer than at present in Britain, with mean July temperatures above 17–18 °C and with mild winters. Comparable modern analogues have been suggested for central or southern France (
    <a rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib57">Holman et al., 1990</a>) or northern Italy (
    <a rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib56">Holman, 1993</a>) but 
    <a rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib44">Gleed-Owen (1999)</a> proposed more continental conditions. 
    <span class="italic">Z. longissimus</span> and 
    <span class="italic">N. tessellata</span> are distributed throughout most of eastern Europe, where they experience cold continental winters (
    <a rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib36">Gasc et al., 1997</a>). Taken in association with the occurrence of 
    <span class="italic">R. arvalis</span> at Cudmore Grove, 
    <a rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib44">Gleed-Owen (1999)</a> suggested that a more realistic modern analogue would be around the southeast German border with north-east Austria and the western Czech Republic.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Cudmore Grove herpetofaunal assemblage is indicative of still or slowly flowing water with abundant aquatic vegetation, adjacent damp grassland and nearby well-vegetated, damp habitats with plenty of ground cover. Some drier, open shrub or woodland habitats are also indicated by 
    <span class="italic">Bufo bufo</span> and 
    <span class="italic">Z. longissimus</span>, whereas 
    <span class="italic">Vipera berus</span> and 
    <span class="italic">Lacerta vivipara</span> occur in a wide range of open terrestrial habitats, including heaths, dunes, woodland, marshes and meadowland (

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Avian remains, which are usually under-represented in open sites, are represented by 42 identifiable bones or bone fragments. The presence of garganey (
    <span class="italic">Anas querquedula</span>), gadwall (
    <span class="italic">Anas strepera</span>) and little crake (
    <span class="italic">Porzana parva</span>) suggests summers as warm as that of central Europe at the present-day, in which case the northern boreal breeding whooper swan (
    <span class="italic">Cygnus cygnus</span>) and smew (
    <span class="italic">Mergellus albellus</span>) would probably have been present as winter visitors. These species suggest the presence of an open body of freshwater, with a well-vegetated margin and shallow-water plantlife. A range of passerines, including song thrush (
    <span class="italic">Turdus philomelos</span>), fieldfare (
    <span class="italic">Turdus pilaris</span>), great tit (
    <span class="italic">Parus major</span>), blue or coal tit (

    <span class="italic">Phylloscopus collybita</span>) indicate the proximity of woodland. The Sandwich tern (
    <span class="italic">Sterna sandvicensis</span>) suggests the proximity of the coast.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mammalian remains suggest a similar range of environments, with woodland and aquatic species particularly well represented. The presence of deciduous or mixed woodland with thick ground cover is suggested by the abundance of bank vole (
    <span class="italic">Clethrionomys glareolus</span>) and wood mouse (
    <span class="italic">Apodemus sylvaticus</span>), with smaller numbers of pygmy shrew (
    <span class="italic">Sorex minutus</span>) and serotine bat (
    <span class="italic">Eptesicus serotinus</span>), for which there are few British Pleistocene records. This is supported by larger mammal taxa such as red squirrel (
    <span class="italic">Sciurus vulgaris</span>), macaque (
    <span class="italic">Macaca sylvanus</span>), beaver (
    <span class="italic">Castor fiber</span>), brown bear (
    <span class="italic">Ursus arctos</span>), badger (
    <span class="italic">Meles meles</span>) and roe deer (
    <span class="italic">Capreolus capreolus</span>). Locally open vegetation is indicated by field vole (
    <span class="italic">Microtus agrestis</span>) and horse (
    <span class="italic">Equus ferus</span>), whereas aquatic habitats are indicated by the abundance of water vole (
    <span class="italic">Arvicola terrestris cantiana</span>), which represents 37% of the mammalian assemblage (MNI = 60), and the high frequency of water shrew (
    <span class="italic">Neomys</span> cf. 
    <span class="italic">browni</span>), which frequent the well-vegetated banks of rivers and lakes with still or slow-flowing water. The presence of bicoloured white-toothed shrew (
    <span class="italic">Crocidura</span> cf. 
    <span class="italic">leucodon</span>), which today has a predominantly southern European distribution, supports the inference that the climate may have been slightly warmer than at present.
