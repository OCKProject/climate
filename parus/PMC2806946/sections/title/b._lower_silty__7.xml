 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">b. Lower silty clays</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sandy clays pass gradually upwards into brown-grey silty clays (Munsell: 10YR 4/1), commonly interbedded with thin, horizontal and gently inclined sand bands. Shell fragments occur occasionally. The lower silty clays reach maximum thickness (ca 3 m) between boreholes CG1 and MM5 and can be traced as far north as the sea wall (
