 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This basal zone occurs in the sediments of sub-units 2b–2c. The spectra are dominated 
  <span class="italic">Pinus</span> pollen, which rises to 69% at 14.40 m. 
  <span class="italic">Betula</span> pollen also peaks in the lower section, then falls gradually near the upper zone boundary. 
  <span class="italic">Quercus</span> pollen increases steadily through the zone. Of the other tree taxa, 
  <span class="italic">Alnus</span> pollen frequencies are most significant, rising in the middle of the zone. Shrub taxa are poorly represented, with 
  <span class="italic">Corylus</span> the most persistent. Poaceae and Cyperaceae pollen dominate the herbaceous taxa. Lower plant and aquatic pollen types are well represented, attaining peak frequencies of ca 15%.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the exception of several 
  <span class="italic">Typha</span> fruits, plant macrofossils were rare. However, several macrofossils were recovered from the underlying sandy sediments, which contained little or no pollen. These included two fruits of 
  <span class="italic">Elatine hydropiper</span> (at 15.87 and 16.00 m) and an achene of 
  <span class="italic">Ranunculus</span>, subgenus Batrachian (at 15.87 m) (
