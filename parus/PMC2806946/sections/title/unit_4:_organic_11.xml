 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Organic clays with abundant wood fragments overlie the detritus muds. The contact between the two units is abrupt and is marked by the sudden disappearance of shell debris. Like the detritus muds, the organic clays achieve maximum thickness (2.5 m) in the southwestern part of the site, where two facies can be recognised, a lower ca 20–50 cm bed of highly compressed wood interbedded with organic clay, and an upper 1–2 m bed of massive, organic clay with occasional wood fragments. The lower deposit is the more heterogeneous and is partly laminated. Three tree trunks have been exhumed from this horizon, one with its roots still intact (

The organic clays thin steadily south-westwards, where they finally meet the rising surface of the London Clay. They also thin north-eastwards and eventually become truncated by the Upper sands and gravels (Unit 6) (Figs.
