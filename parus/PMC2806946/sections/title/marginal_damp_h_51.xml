 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this category are included marsh habitats of varying degrees of humidity. By far the largest number of beetle species in this fauna fall into this group.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Carabidae are ground beetles that are either predators or general scavengers. All the recovered species live close to still or slowly flowing eutrophic water where the soil is rich in humus and where the vegetation is rather lush and composed of 
  <span class="italic">Carex</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Scirpus</span> or 
  <span class="italic">Phragmites</span>. 
  <span class="italic">Bembidion unicolor</span> occurs in deciduous forests and is especially characteristic of the drier parts of 
  <span class="italic">Alnus</span> swamps. Some species, such as 
  <span class="italic">Loricera pilicornis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Platynus ruficornis</span>, require bare patches of soil. Of particular interest are the two carabids 
  <span class="italic">Oodes gracilis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Odacantha melanura</span>, which inhabit accumulations of dead reeds, such as 
  <span class="italic">Phragmites</span>, on the swampy borders of eutrophic lakes (

  <span class="italic">Plateumaris braccata</span>, monophagous on 
  <span class="italic">Phragmites communis</span> (
  <a rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib64">Koch, 1992</a>), was represented by numerous fragments. 
  <span class="italic">Donacia cinerea</span> feeds on reeds and sedges, such as 
  <span class="italic">Typha</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Phragmites</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Carex</span>. 
  <span class="italic">Donacia semicuprea</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Notaris acridulus</span> feed principally on the aquatic grass 
  <span class="italic">Glyceria</span>. The weevil 
  <span class="italic">Limnobaris pilistriata</span> chiefly feeds on Cyperaceae and similar plants; the larvae usually eating the roots. 
  <span class="italic">Phalacrus caricis</span> feeds on the smutted inflorescences of various species of 
  <span class="italic">Carex</span> (
  <a rid="bib129" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib129">Thompson, 1958</a>). 
  <span class="italic">Dascillus cervinus</span> lives in damp meadows where the larvae feed on the roots of grasses.
