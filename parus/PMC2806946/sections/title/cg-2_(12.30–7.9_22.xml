 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sub-units 2c and 2d continue to the top of this zone. The base of the zone is marked by a sudden rise in the frequency of 
  <span class="italic">Quercus</span> and a small increase in 
  <span class="italic">Corylus</span> pollen. These trends continue to the middle of the zone, where 
  <span class="italic">Quercus</span> achieves peak frequencies (53%). 
  <span class="italic">Pinus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Betula</span> pollen frequencies decline simultaneously. The frequencies of most taxa stabilise in the upper half of the zone, with 
  <span class="italic">Quercus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Pinus</span> dominant. 
  <span class="italic">Alnus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Corylus</span> pollen undergo slight frequency increases. A single 
  <span class="italic">Typha</span> fruit (at 12.20 m) and a bryophyte fragment (at −10.0 m) were the only macrofossils recorded.
