 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The basal gravels grade upwards into a thick sequence of silts and clays, which occupy most of the channel and are exposed over wide areas of the foreshore. This unit can be divided into four sub-units:</p>
 <sec id="sec4.2.1" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">a. Sandy clays</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Massive, dark grey sandy clays occupy the basal 0.5–1 m. These reach maximum thickness (1.2 m) in borehole CG1, and thin towards the channel margin (
   <a rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#fig4">Fig. 4</a>). They can also be traced at the eastern end of the site below −5 m O.D. The continuity of the sub-unit beyond this point is unknown.

 <sec id="sec4.2.2" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">b. Lower silty clays</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sandy clays pass gradually upwards into brown-grey silty clays (Munsell: 10YR 4/1), commonly interbedded with thin, horizontal and gently inclined sand bands. Shell fragments occur occasionally. The lower silty clays reach maximum thickness (ca 3 m) between boreholes CG1 and MM5 and can be traced as far north as the sea wall (

 <sec id="sec4.2.3" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">c. Shelly silts</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The lower silty clays grade upwards into a thick sequence of massive, dark grey silts with scattered shell debris. These vary in thickness, from ca 5 m near borehole MM5 to &lt;1 m in the southwest. The shelly silts can also be traced to the end of the sea wall in the northeast, where they extend from −3 m to 2 m O.D. (
   <a rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#fig4">Fig. 4</a>). The sub-unit is truncated further to the east by Holocene estuarine sediment.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">d. Upper silty clays</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Green-grey silty clays, (ca 0.5 m) with occasional horizontal sand beds form the uppermost member of this unit, which contains occasional scattered wood fragments and shell debris.</p>
