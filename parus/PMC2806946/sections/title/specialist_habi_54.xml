 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A number of species occur with other specialised habitats. Thus 
  <span class="italic">Onthophagus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Aphodius</span> are dung feeders. Species of 
  <span class="italic">Hister</span> are most often found in carcasses where the larvae live on maggots. 
  <span class="italic">Silpha tristis</span> is another carrion beetle that can feed on other dead insects (
  <a rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib63">Koch, 1989</a>). Their presence indicates that both dung and carcases must have existed on dry ground rather than in the marsh itself. 
  <span class="italic">Phosphuga atrata</span> is a specialist predator on snails and slugs.
