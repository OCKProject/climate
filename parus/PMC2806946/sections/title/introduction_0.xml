 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The differentiation of MIS 9 from MIS 11 in the continental record is a topic of ongoing debate. In Britain there is a consensus in favour of correlation of the Anglian Stage with MIS 12 and of the ensuing Hoxnian Stage with MIS 11 (e.g. 
  <a rid="bib14 bib21 bib107 bib49 bib111 bib95" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib14 bib21 bib107 bib49 bib111 bib95">Bridgland, 1994; Bridgland et al., 1999; Rowe et al., 1999; Grün and Schwarcz, 2000; Schreve, 2001; Preece et al., 2007</a>). However, in continental Europe, much uncertainty surrounds both the correlation of the Elsterian and the Holsteinian with other continental or deep-sea records. Like the consensus in Britain, many European workers favour correlation of the Holsteinian with at least part of MIS 11 (

However, a recent study by 
  <a rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib37">Geyh and Müller (2005)</a> has promoted correlation with MIS 9 based on some new TIMS 
  <span class="sup">230</span>Th/U dates from two peat layers from the Holsteinian reference site at Bosel in northern Germany and reappraisal of uranium series dates from two Hoxnian sites in England. They also reconsider the correlation of certain critical pollen sequences from maar lakes in France to support their case and they consequently dismiss the potential conflation of two “Holstein-like Interglacials” as “a problem confined to the Quaternary of the British Isles” (
  <a rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib38">Geyh and Müller, 2006</a>: p. 3072). Such divergent views hamper assessment of events within the late Middle Pleistocene.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Thames Valley in southern England is one region where a range of deposits of late Middle Pleistocene age have been distinguished, largely because the critical interglacial sediments occur at different elevations in the terrace staircase (e.g. 
  <a rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib14">Bridgland, 1994</a>). Pollen analysis, the technique most frequently used for biostratigraphy, often fails to discriminate between late Middle Pleistocene interglacials, especially in fluvial contexts, where the records are notoriously fragmentary and frequently undiagnostic (cf. 
  <a rid="bib128" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib128">Thomas, 2001</a>). However, different stages can be distinguished, often fairly easily, using molluscan (
  <a rid="bib91 bib92" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib91 bib92">Preece, 1995, 1999</a>) and especially mammalian biostratigraphy (
  <a rid="bib111" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib111">Schreve, 2001</a>). By integrating terrace and faunal biostratigraphical data with aminostratigraphy, 
  <a rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib14">Bridgland (1994)</a> identified four post-Anglian temperate stages in the Thames terrace record in the Lower Thames region downstream of central London, which he correlated with MIS 11, 9, 7 and 5e respectively. Moreover, new aminostratigraphic techniques, involving the analysis of multiple amino acids contained within the crystalline lattice of fossil shells (especially the calcitic opercula of the freshwater gastropod 
  <span class="italic">Bithynia</span>), have provided additional independent support for such differentiation (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This paper reviews evidence from eastern Essex, on the western margin of the North Sea basin, that has a direct bearing on these issues. New data are presented from Cudmore Grove, a coastal site on Mersea Island, where a deeply-incised channel cut into London Clay (Eocene) has been infilled by interglacial estuarine silts and clays and now lies buried beneath fluvial gravels. The sediments, which cover a substantial part of the interglacial, can be linked into the terrace sequence of the Thames. Cudmore Grove is located just 10 km to the west of Clacton-on-Sea, the type site of the Lower Palaeolithic Clactonian industry (
  <a rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib81">Oakley and Leakey, 1937</a>), which has been correlated with the Hoxnian interglacial (
  <a rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>; 
  <a rid="bib90 bib139 bib132 bib76 bib11 bib21" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib90 bib139 bib132 bib76 bib11 bib21">Pike and Godwin, 1953; Warren, 1955; Turner and Kerney, 1971; Miller et al., 1979; Bowen et al., 1989; Bridgland et al., 1999</a>). The pollen records from these two sites bear a number of similarities and they were initially attributed to the same interglacial, namely the Hoxnian (cf. 
  <a rid="bib13 bib14 bib98" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib13 bib14 bib98">Bridgland, 1988, 1994; Roe, 1994</a>). However, several lines of evidence suggest that this correlation is not secure. Despite their proximity, we show that the faunal records from the two sites differ significantly, as does their relative sea-level history. These differences indicate that the sites are not of the same age, a conclusion supported by the new aminostratigraphic data presented here that indicate that the sediments at Clacton formed during MIS 11 and those at Cudmore Grove during MIS 9. On the same foreshore, 2 km from the site at Cudmore Grove, another interglacial channel occurs now buried by modern beach shingle. This is the ‘East Mersea Restaurant Site’, which has yielded a limited fauna of non-marine molluscs and vertebrates, including 
  <span class="italic">Hippopotamus</span> indicative of an Ipswichian age (correlated with MIS 5e) (
  <a rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>). Thus channel sediments belonging to four different interglacials (including the Holocene), occur along this limited stretch of coastline. This provides an opportunity to examine faunal, sea level and other differences between the stages within a small geographical region and in particular to define the characteristics of MIS 9 in greater detail.
