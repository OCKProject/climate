 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Local environment inferred from the Ostracoda</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mixed ostracod faunas are typical of a highly transitional inner estuarine environment in which the euryhaline 
  <span class="italic">C. torosa</span> was able to flourish locally alongside fluctuating numbers of freshwater species. The early phase of silty clay deposition (sub-unit 2a) was characterized by conditions poorly suited to ostracod life, probably resulting from the sandy nature of the substrate or current activity. The presence of large numbers of noded 
  <span class="italic">Cyprideis</span> suggests a salinity at ca 5‰ or less, if they are 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast, conditions during the accumulation of the overlying clay and silt dominated beds (sub-units 2b–2d) allowed 
  <span class="italic">C. torosa</span> to thrive. Salinities were also low enough locally to enable 
  <span class="italic">C. neglecta</span> and 
  <span class="italic">I. gibba</span> to survive at all levels of development (
  <a rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib98">Roe, 1994</a>), the latter suggesting that aquatic or bankside vegetation existed within or in proximity to the channel (
  <a rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib75">Meisch, 2000</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Salinities must have increased subsequently, as reflected by an expansion in smooth-valved 
  <span class="italic">C. torosa</span> and a fall in local freshwater populations. Some of the sparse freshwater species were probably transported from sites further upstream. The well-balanced freshwater populations from the overlying sediments at 9.50 m appear to mark a brief decline in saltwater influence. Salinity levels increased again when the uppermost part of the silty clays accumulated.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, the fauna of the silty clays typifies an estuarine section of river, which gradually became more open to marine influence through time. The brief lowering of salinities that took place in the latter part of this episode (at 9.50 m) may reflect a short-lived increase in river discharge, a change in tidal or depositional regime or possibly a small fall in relative sea level. This parallels the changes noted in the diatom floras at the same level.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The limited fauna of the detritus muds (Unit 3), points to a marked change in conditions, which were generally unfavourable for ostracods. The currents which carried sand and shell debris into the site at this time may have restricted their survival. Re-working from the lower silty clays also cannot be excluded.</p>
