  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Samples taken throughout the organic clays (Unit 4) mostly yielded sparse, fragmentary and indeterminable insect remains. However, bulk samples (∼5 kg wet weight) from the detritus muds (Unit 3) exposed in a foreshore trench (
   <a rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>) produced fossil Coleoptera that were well enough preserved to enable some taxa to be identified. The insect remains were recovered from the sediment using the method outlined by 
   <a rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib24">Coope (1986)</a>. Altogether 65 coleopteran taxa were recognised of which 47 could be determined to species level (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The large numbers of species represented by only one individual indicates that the assemblage is only a small subsample of the contemporary beetle fauna. The ecologically heterogeneous assemblage suggests that it was probably brought together in flood debris, some of it swept off the adjacent land surface, and some originating from a slowly moving river. This faunal variety means that the various ecological requirements of the species can be built up into a mosaic picture of the local environment.</p>

    <span class="italic">Hydropsyche contubernalis</span> McL. is usually found in large slow-flowing rivers (
    <a rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib34">Edington and Hildrew, 1995</a>). All the rest of the aquatic beetles are typical of standing or very slowly moving. The large carnivorous dytiscid taxa

    <a rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib50">Hansen, 1987</a>). 
    <span class="italic">Macroplea appendiculata</span> lives permanently underwater feeding mostly on

    <span class="italic">Myriophyllum spicatum</span> and other pond-weeds. 
    <span class="italic">Macronychus quadrituberculatus</span> lives in the fissures of submerged logs or rocks in fairly large, slow-moving rivers, where it probably feeds on algae. It is an extremely rare species in Britain today probably due to the reduction of its habitat by riverine management activities. 
    <span class="italic">Tanysphyrus lemnae</span> is a minute weevil that feeds on the duckweed

Nearby the mature forest consisted mainly of deciduous trees, including oak and ash, as well as coniferous trees such as pine. There is much evidence of dead and rotting timber. Some of the trunks were submerged in water. The presence of beetles that feed on dung and carrion indicates that the area was visited by large herbivorous mammals, perhaps attracted by the presence of

   <a rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib70">Lindroth, 1943</a>). Several of the wood-dependent species (e.g.
