 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Significant fluctuations occur between freshwater and marine diatoms in this subzone. Marine and brackish-water taxa continue to increase in abundance and species diversity, together reaching &gt;60%. Freshwater, halophilous species also increase in importance, especially 
  <span class="italic">Cocconeis pediculus</span> Ehr. and 
  <span class="italic">Nitzschia tryblionella</span> Hantzsch. Freshwater taxa (oligohalobous–indifferent) generally represent &lt;35% of the total assemblage. 
  <span class="italic">Fragilaria</span> spp. fall through ldaz CGD2a to low values in ldaz CGD2b (&lt;3%). 
  <span class="italic">A. granulata</span> declines to 10–15% and is joined at similar values by 
  <span class="italic">Epithemia turgida</span> (Ehr.) Kütz, accompanied by lower frequencies of 
  <span class="italic">Stephanodiscus astraea</span> (Ehr.) Grun.
