 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This upper zone extends from the middle of sub-unit 2c to Unit 3 and is characterized by fluctuations in the frequencies of both brackish and freshwater taxa. At 10.63 m, for example, numbers of smooth-valved 
  <span class="italic">C. torosa</span> increase dramatically, whilst the diversity and frequency of freshwater species decline. Numbers of 
  <span class="italic">C. torosa</span> fall, however, at 9.50 m, with a corresponding rise in the frequencies of freshwater taxa. 
  <span class="italic">C. neglecta</span> dominates the latter, with well-balanced numbers of adults and juveniles and males and females (

  <span class="italic">Sarscypridopsis aculeata</span> (Lilljeborg) also occurs. 
  <span class="italic">C. torosa</span> valve frequencies rise again near the upper part of the unit. The thin detritus muds overlying the silty clays (Unit 3) yielded only a few noded 
  <span class="italic">C. torosa</span> and the occasional broken valve of 
  <span class="italic">C. neglecta</span>.
