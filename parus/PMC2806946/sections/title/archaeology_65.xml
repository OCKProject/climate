 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At least three unstratified flint flakes have been found on the beach at Cudmore Grove towards the southern channel margin (G.R. Ward and P. Spencer, personal communication). All these finds probably originate from the feather-edge of the Cudmore Grove Channel Gravel (Unit 1), from which a single struck flake was recovered

  <a rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#fig5">Fig. 5</a>). A scraper has also been found on the foreshore to the immediate east of the Cudmore Grove sea wall (TM 06891466; 
  <a rid="fig3 fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#fig3 fig4">Figs. 3 and 4</a>). The presence of iron-stained sand within cavities of the scraper suggests it may have been derived from the adjacent Upper sands and gravels (Unit 6). A broken hand-axe has also been recovered from a foreshore exposure of gravel near the ‘Hippopotamus Site’ (TM 06541424; P. Spencer, personal communication). Its relationship to the infill sequence at this site is uncertain.
