 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The base of this zone coincides with the appearance of the organic clays (Unit 4). The basal few centimetres contain sand and shell debris, representing the thin remnant in this core of Unit 3 (
  <a rid="fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#fig7">Fig. 7</a>). The pollen spectra undergo many changes, which begin with a sharp peak in 
  <span class="italic">Ceratopteris</span> spores and a steep rise in 
  <span class="italic">Alnus</span> pollen. These changes coincide with a sharp fall in 
  <span class="italic">Pinus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Quercus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Corylus</span> and Poaceae pollen. 
  <span class="italic">Alnus</span> frequencies continue to rise in the central part of the zone, whereas 
  <span class="italic">Ceratopteris</span> spores decline. 
  <span class="italic">Pinus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Quercus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Corylus</span> pollen frequencies recover slightly, together with Poaceae and 
  <span class="italic">Betula</span>. 
  <span class="italic">Carpinus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Abies</span> and Ericales pollen frequencies also increase in the middle part of the zone. With the exception of 
  <span class="italic">Pinus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Alnus</span>, frequencies of all the major arboreal taxa decrease at the top of the zone to &lt;3%. These changes coincide with another sedimentary change, as the organic clays are replaced at 6.4 m by the grey clays (Unit 5). 
  <span class="italic">Ceratopteris</span> spore frequencies show another sharp increase at this point. Only two samples from this unit yielded pollen.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The samples from this zone yielded abundant macrofossils, including several megaspores of 
  <span class="italic">Azolla filiculoides</span> and three achenes of 
  <span class="italic">Eupatorium cannabinum</span> (
  <a rid="tbl2" ref-type="table" href="#tbl2">Table 2</a>). A tree trunk (over 2 m long and probably 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span>) and several other large pieces of 
  <span class="italic">Alnus</span> wood were recovered from the basal part of the organic sequence elsewhere at the site.
