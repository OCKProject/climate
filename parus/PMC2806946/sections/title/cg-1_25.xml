 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sediments and other microfossils (see below) associated with this zone suggest that a fairly substantial, tidally-influenced river channel now existed. The pollen source area is likely to have been large, including inputs from fluvial and limited marine sources. Boreal-type woodland prevailed in the regional catchment at the start of this phase; 
  <span class="italic">Betula</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Pinus</span> were both widespread, although the latter is likely to be overrepresented due to the buoyancy properties and high pollen productivity of 
  <span class="italic">Pinus</span> grains (cf. 
  <a rid="bib35 bib102" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib35 bib102">FÃ¦gri and Iversen, 1989; Roe and van de Plassche, 2005</a>). Oak, elm, ash and hazel persisted on a limited scale.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The composition of the forest changed subsequently as oak, and then ash, began to expand, out-competing birch in some areas. With this expansion came the colonisation of 
  <span class="italic">Hedera</span> into the forest understorey. The unidentified palynomorph Type X first appears in this zone. This taxon has been reported from several Hoxnian sites (
  <a rid="bib128" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib128">Thomas, 2001</a>) and is believed to have been produced by a forest shrub, possibly a member of the Oleaceae (
  <a rid="bib131" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib131">Turner, 1970</a>). 
  <span class="italic">Alnus</span> too became established, probably near the river margins.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Herb communities were fairly diverse throughout this period and point to the existence of lightly shaded forest-floor habitats or more open areas of grassland. 
  <span class="italic">Pteridium</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Sphagnum</span> confirm the development of damp, slightly acidic soils in parts of the region. Waterside and marsh plants also formed an important part of the flora during this time, probably flourishing near the river. These included sedges, ferns and several marshland herbs (
  <span class="italic">Typha latifolia</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Filipendula</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Sparganium</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Lysimachia</span>). The 
  <span class="italic">Potamogeton</span> pollen record shows that relatively calm, freshwater habitats prevailed locally.
