 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Coleoptera provide abundant evidence for the local presence of trees both living and dead. The Elm bark beetle 
  <span class="italic">Scolytus scolytus</span>, the vector for Dutch Elm disease, is not restricted to 
  <span class="italic">Ulmus</span> but also attacks 
  <span class="italic">Fraxinus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Carpinus</span> and other deciduous trees. 
  <span class="italic">Hylesinus crenatus</span> chiefly attacks 
  <span class="italic">Fraxinus</span> and only exceptionally other broad-leaved trees. Both the adults and larvae of 
  <span class="italic">Agelastica alni</span> (alder leaf beetle) eat the leaves of 
  <span class="italic">Alnus</span>. The larvae of the weevil 
  <span class="italic">Rhynchaenus testaceus</span> mine its leaves. 
  <span class="italic">Stenoscelis submuricatus</span>, the commonest species in this assemblage, bores into the wood of diseased broad-leaved trees. 
  <span class="italic">Rhyncolus elongatus</span> feeds in the trunks and stumps of partly rotting conifers, both 
  <span class="italic">Pinus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Abies</span>, whereas 
  <span class="italic">Hylobius abietis</span> (large pine weevil) attacks both pines and spruces.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evidence of dead or dying trees is provided by a number of species. 
  <span class="italic">Gastrallus immarginatus</span> burrows under dead bark of old oak trees but only rarely other deciduous trees. 
  <span class="italic">Rhysodes sulcatus</span> lives in decaying wood, both deciduous and conifer, mainly in fallen trunks in moist places (
  <a rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib71">Lindroth, 1986</a>). It is extremely rare in Europe having a relict distribution from the times when the old natural forests were more widespread. 
  <span class="italic">Valgus hemipterus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Osmoderma eremita</span> (hermit beetle) and 
  <span class="italic">Dorcus parallelopipedus</span> (lesser stag beetle) develop in decaying wood of deciduous trees. 
  <span class="italic">Prionus coriarius</span> is a large beetle (up to 45Â mm) that lives in rotten trunks and major branches of various broad-leaved trees, less often on conifers; its larvae mostly feed on tree roots. 
  <span class="italic">Anobium punctatum</span> (woodworm beetle) attacks dead wood that is moderately dry but which has often already been attacked by decomposing fungae (
