 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The base of this zone marks the boundary between the silty clays (Unit 2d) and the organic beds (Units 3 and 4). Mesohalobous and halophilous diatoms expand in frequency to &gt;75% of the total assemblage, dominated by the rapid rise of 
  <span class="italic">Actinocyclus normanii</span> (Greg.) Hust., which reaches &gt;80%. At the base of the zone, marine taxa, dominated by 
  <span class="italic">P. sulcata</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Th. excentrica</span>, rise to maximum values (ca 55%), before falling to ca 12% at the top of the zone. Freshwater diatoms show low, erratic frequencies and are dominated by the return of 
  <span class="italic">Fragilaria</span> spp. to values of ca 8%.
