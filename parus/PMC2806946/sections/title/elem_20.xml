 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The pollen percentage diagram (
  <a rid="fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#fig7">Fig. 7</a>) is divided into three pollen assemblage biozones, labelled with the prefix ‘CG’.
 </p>
 <sec id="sec7.2.1" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CG-1 (14.80–12.30 m)</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This basal zone occurs in the sediments of sub-units 2b–2c. The spectra are dominated 
   <span class="italic">Pinus</span> pollen, which rises to 69% at 14.40 m. 
   <span class="italic">Betula</span> pollen also peaks in the lower section, then falls gradually near the upper zone boundary. 
   <span class="italic">Quercus</span> pollen increases steadily through the zone. Of the other tree taxa, 
   <span class="italic">Alnus</span> pollen frequencies are most significant, rising in the middle of the zone. Shrub taxa are poorly represented, with 
   <span class="italic">Corylus</span> the most persistent. Poaceae and Cyperaceae pollen dominate the herbaceous taxa. Lower plant and aquatic pollen types are well represented, attaining peak frequencies of ca 15%.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the exception of several 
   <span class="italic">Typha</span> fruits, plant macrofossils were rare. However, several macrofossils were recovered from the underlying sandy sediments, which contained little or no pollen. These included two fruits of 
   <span class="italic">Elatine hydropiper</span> (at 15.87 and 16.00 m) and an achene of 
   <span class="italic">Ranunculus</span>, subgenus Batrachian (at 15.87 m) (
   <a rid="tbl2" ref-type="table" href="#tbl2">Table 2</a>).

 <sec id="sec7.2.2" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CG-2 (12.30–7.93 m)</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sub-units 2c and 2d continue to the top of this zone. The base of the zone is marked by a sudden rise in the frequency of 
   <span class="italic">Quercus</span> and a small increase in 
   <span class="italic">Corylus</span> pollen. These trends continue to the middle of the zone, where 
   <span class="italic">Quercus</span> achieves peak frequencies (53%). 
   <span class="italic">Pinus</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Betula</span> pollen frequencies decline simultaneously. The frequencies of most taxa stabilise in the upper half of the zone, with 
   <span class="italic">Quercus</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Pinus</span> dominant. 
   <span class="italic">Alnus</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Corylus</span> pollen undergo slight frequency increases. A single 
   <span class="italic">Typha</span> fruit (at 12.20 m) and a bryophyte fragment (at −10.0 m) were the only macrofossils recorded.

 <sec id="sec7.2.3" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CG-3 (7.93–6.27 m)</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The base of this zone coincides with the appearance of the organic clays (Unit 4). The basal few centimetres contain sand and shell debris, representing the thin remnant in this core of Unit 3 (
   <a rid="fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#fig7">Fig. 7</a>). The pollen spectra undergo many changes, which begin with a sharp peak in 
   <span class="italic">Ceratopteris</span> spores and a steep rise in 
   <span class="italic">Alnus</span> pollen. These changes coincide with a sharp fall in 
   <span class="italic">Pinus</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Quercus</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Corylus</span> and Poaceae pollen. 
   <span class="italic">Alnus</span> frequencies continue to rise in the central part of the zone, whereas 
   <span class="italic">Ceratopteris</span> spores decline. 
   <span class="italic">Pinus</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Quercus</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Corylus</span> pollen frequencies recover slightly, together with Poaceae and 
   <span class="italic">Betula</span>. 
   <span class="italic">Carpinus</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Abies</span> and Ericales pollen frequencies also increase in the middle part of the zone. With the exception of 
   <span class="italic">Pinus</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Alnus</span>, frequencies of all the major arboreal taxa decrease at the top of the zone to &lt;3%. These changes coincide with another sedimentary change, as the organic clays are replaced at 6.4 m by the grey clays (Unit 5). 
   <span class="italic">Ceratopteris</span> spore frequencies show another sharp increase at this point. Only two samples from this unit yielded pollen.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The samples from this zone yielded abundant macrofossils, including several megaspores of 
   <span class="italic">Azolla filiculoides</span> and three achenes of 
   <span class="italic">Eupatorium cannabinum</span> (
   <a rid="tbl2" ref-type="table" href="#tbl2">Table 2</a>). A tree trunk (over 2 m long and probably 
   <span class="italic">in situ</span>) and several other large pieces of 
   <span class="italic">Alnus</span> wood were recovered from the basal part of the organic sequence elsewhere at the site.
