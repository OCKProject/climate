 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This beetle assemblage indicates a sluggish river surrounded by a marsh dominated by 
  <span class="italic">Phragmites</span>. Alder trees grew alongside the river. Nearby the mature forest consisted mainly of deciduous trees, including oak and ash, as well as coniferous trees such as pine. There is much evidence of dead and rotting timber. Some of the trunks were submerged in water. The presence of beetles that feed on dung and carrion indicates that the area was visited by large herbivorous mammals, perhaps attracted by the presence of 
  <span class="italic">Glyceria</span> (sweet grass). There is no evidence of saline conditions, as would be indicated by obligate halobiont species.
