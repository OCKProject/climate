 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The absence of pollen in the basal, sand-rich sediments of sub-unit 2a suggests that conditions were initially unfavourable for pollen sedimentation or preservation. However, the fact that these deposits yielded waterside herb macrofossils shows that marshland communities were already established. The occurrence of fruits of 
  <span class="italic">E. hydropiper</span> is noteworthy in implying that interglacial conditions had already become established when Unit 2a accumulated. This species flourishes today in eutrophic, sandy-bottomed, shallow-water habitats with a thin cover of silt and organic detritus (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sediments and other microfossils (see below) associated with this zone suggest that a fairly substantial, tidally-influenced river channel now existed. The pollen source area is likely to have been large, including inputs from fluvial and limited marine sources. Boreal-type woodland prevailed in the regional catchment at the start of this phase; 
   <span class="italic">Betula</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Pinus</span> were both widespread, although the latter is likely to be overrepresented due to the buoyancy properties and high pollen productivity of 
   <span class="italic">Pinus</span> grains (cf. 
   <a rid="bib35 bib102" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib35 bib102">Fægri and Iversen, 1989; Roe and van de Plassche, 2005</a>). Oak, elm, ash and hazel persisted on a limited scale.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The composition of the forest changed subsequently as oak, and then ash, began to expand, out-competing birch in some areas. With this expansion came the colonisation of 
   <span class="italic">Hedera</span> into the forest understorey. The unidentified palynomorph Type X first appears in this zone. This taxon has been reported from several Hoxnian sites (
   <a rid="bib128" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib128">Thomas, 2001</a>) and is believed to have been produced by a forest shrub, possibly a member of the Oleaceae (
   <a rid="bib131" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib131">Turner, 1970</a>). 
   <span class="italic">Alnus</span> too became established, probably near the river margins.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Herb communities were fairly diverse throughout this period and point to the existence of lightly shaded forest-floor habitats or more open areas of grassland. 
   <span class="italic">Pteridium</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Sphagnum</span> confirm the development of damp, slightly acidic soils in parts of the region. Waterside and marsh plants also formed an important part of the flora during this time, probably flourishing near the river. These included sedges, ferns and several marshland herbs (
   <span class="italic">Typha latifolia</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Filipendula</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Sparganium</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Lysimachia</span>). The 
   <span class="italic">Potamogeton</span> pollen record shows that relatively calm, freshwater habitats prevailed locally.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CG-2</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sediments and other microfossil datasets suggest that marine influence became more pronounced as saltwater inflow gradually increased (see Sections 
   <a rid="sec8 sec9 sec10" ref-type="sec" href="#sec8 sec9 sec10">8–10</a> below). An enlargement of the pollen catchment can thus be inferred, as pollen was now carried in from estuarine and marine sources. The sudden increase in 
   <span class="italic">Quercus</span> pollen at the start of the zone may partly reflect this taphonomic change, as 
   <span class="italic">Quercus</span> pollen was introduced from coastal waters. In spite of this overrepresentation, oak was clearly becoming well established in the region, initiating a decline in both birch and pine. Pine probably persisted in some areas but on a reduced scale. 
   <span class="italic">Fraxinus</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Tilia</span> also expanded in the middle of the zone, reflecting the development of well-drained, base-rich soils within the catchment. This was accompanied by the gradual expansion of 
   <span class="italic">Corylus</span> and the first arrival of 
   <span class="italic">Vitis</span>, a shrub of damp, woodland habitats (
   <a rid="bib130 bib131" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib130 bib131">Turner, 1968, 1970</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some open areas persisted during this zone, supporting such genera as 
   <span class="italic">Polygonum</span> and Caryophyllaceae. Some of the Chenopodiaceae and 
   <span class="italic">Plantago</span> pollen may have been carried in from local saltmarshes. Waterside and aquatic plants declined, probably reflecting the continued salinity rise.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CG-3</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The onset of zone CG-3 coincided with a marked change in depositional environment, as the estuarine channel regime of the previous zone was replaced by a much quieter phase of organic clay deposition, associated with a lagoonal backwater. This was associated with the deposition of Unit 4. A thin bed of sand (Unit 3, the detritus muds) accumulated in the intervening period, probably as a lag deposit following a short phase of denudation. This sequence of events appears to have initiated a dramatic change in pollen source area, as the input of regionally derived estuarine pollen (mostly 
   <span class="italic">Quercus</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Pinus</span>) ceased and was replaced by a strong local pollen signal. The influx of 
   <span class="italic">Ceratopteris</span> spores at the start of zone shows that fern communities colonised the site, probably spreading over the damp, exposed surface of the infilled channel. Some of these resistant spores may also have been reworked.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alder now dominated the local woodland and even became rooted at the site, showing that local soils were fairly wet. Drier areas, probably fringing the alder carr, still supported mixed oak woodland during the early part of the zone, with the same suite of taxa that flourished previously. This soon changed, however, as firstly 
   <span class="italic">Carpinus</span> and then boreal trees (
   <span class="italic">Abies</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Pinus</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Betula</span>) began to expand. 
   <span class="italic">Picea</span> was the only conifer not to invade, possibly because of the high clay content of the local soils (cf. 
   <a rid="bib131" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib131">Turner, 1970</a>). The ground vegetation also changed, as Ericaceous plants became more widespread, probably in response to soil acidification.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wetter areas continued to support 
   <span class="italic">Alnus</span> in the latter half of the zone, although there was no longer any input of 
   <span class="italic">Alnus</span> wood to the sediment, possibly because the water was now too deep for the tree to grow. Conditions were now more favourable to waterside, aquatic and semi-aquatic herb communities, including 
   <span class="italic">E. cannabinum</span>, 
   <span class="italic">A. filiculoides</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Chara</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Alisma</span>. All these plants prefer fairly quiet, eutrophic, freshwater conditions, although with the exception of 
   <span class="italic">Azolla</span>, all could tolerate low levels of salt. 
   <span class="italic">Sphagnum</span> too became more widespread, reflecting increasing dampness.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conditions changed again near the end of the zone as the input of organic material ceased and inorganic clays and sands (Unit 5) began to accumulate. 
   <span class="italic">Pinus</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Alnus</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Ceratopteris</span> were still present during this phase, although 
   <span class="italic">Abies</span> appears to have declined in the immediate region. The thermophilous trees also diminished, possibly in response to a progressive shift towards boreal woodland. Because only the more resistant pollen grains are represented in the two uppermost samples it is possible that some of the pollen has been reworked, probably from the underlying organic beds.
