 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fine-grained beds are capped by 4–5 m of sands and gravels, which are exposed in the Cudmore Grove cliffs (Figs. 
  <a rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#fig4">4</a>, 
  <a rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#fig5">5</a> and 
  <a rid="fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#fig6">6</a>A). These were originally assigned to the ‘Mersea Island Gravel’ of the Low-level East Essex Gravel Formation (
  <a rid="bib12 bib13 bib14" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib12 bib13 bib14">Bridgland, 1983, 1988, 1994</a>), which comprised all the diverted Thames gravel aggradations in eastern Essex. This has since been re-termed the ‘Mersea Island Member’ of the Lower Thames Formation (
  <a rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib41">Gibbard, 1999</a>) with Cudmore Grove the designated type locality. Accelerated cliff erosion in recent years has provided excellent exposures of the sands and gravels that comprise two main facies: a lower 2–3 m suite of cross-bedded sands (Unit 6a); and an upper 3 m of mainly clast-supported gravels (Unit 6b) (
  <a rid="fig4 fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#fig4 fig5">Figs. 4 and 5</a>). The lower unit, which forms a sharp contact with the underlying grey clays and organic clays, is best developed in the western part of the cliff exposure, where it comprises large-scale, gently dipping foresets of sand and subsidiary gravel. Individual foresets are 15–50 cm thick and dip at angles of 5–20°. Palaeocurrent measurements show that the prevailing flow direction was towards the north-north-east (
  <a rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>c). In the lower part of this unit the sand-rich facies are locally interbedded with a series of thin (1–5 cm) grey clay horizons (
  <a rid="fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#fig6">Fig. 6</a>B).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sandy beds are truncated by the clast-rich facies of Unit 6b, which thicken progressively towards the sea wall. These too are cross-stratified, particularly in the lower 2 m, although the foresets are smaller than in Unit 6a. In contrast to the lower facies, palaeocurrent measurements show that flow was towards the southeast (
  <a rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>c).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unit 6b shows several signs of periglacial deformation, including a number of ice-wedge casts. At the southwestern end of the exposure the gravelly facies are also interbedded with large lobes of massive, heavily oxidized silty clay (‘brickearth’) (

  <a rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#fig5">Fig. 5</a>), thought to comprise soliflucted London Clay (
