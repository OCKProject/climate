 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The large numbers of species represented by only one individual indicates that the assemblage is only a small subsample of the contemporary beetle fauna. The ecologically heterogeneous assemblage suggests that it was probably brought together in flood debris, some of it swept off the adjacent land surface, and some originating from a slowly moving river. This faunal variety means that the various ecological requirements of the species can be built up into a mosaic picture of the local environment.</p>

   <span class="italic">Oulimnius tuberculatus</span>, represented by a single specimen, is the only beetle indicative of running water, where it lives amongst stones and moss in shallow well-aerated riffles (

   <span class="italic">Hydropsyche contubernalis</span> McL. is usually found in large slow-flowing rivers (
   <a rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib34">Edington and Hildrew, 1995</a>). All the rest of the aquatic beetles are typical of standing or very slowly moving. The large carnivorous dytiscid taxa

   <span class="italic">Ilybius</span> sp.,

   <span class="italic">Cercyon convexiusculus</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Hydrobius fuscipes</span> occur in similar habitats where they feed on decomposing plant material. 
   <span class="italic">Chaetarthria seminulum</span> lives in wet mud, usually beside eutrophic pools or on the muddy banks of slow-flowing streams (
   <a rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib50">Hansen, 1987</a>). 
   <span class="italic">Macroplea appendiculata</span> lives permanently underwater feeding mostly on 
   <span class="italic">Potamogeton</span> but also on 
   <span class="italic">Myriophyllum spicatum</span> and other pond-weeds. 
   <span class="italic">Macronychus quadrituberculatus</span> lives in the fissures of submerged logs or rocks in fairly large, slow-moving rivers, where it probably feeds on algae. It is an extremely rare species in Britain today probably due to the reduction of its habitat by riverine management activities. 
   <span class="italic">Tanysphyrus lemnae</span> is a minute weevil that feeds on the duckweed

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Carabidae are ground beetles that are either predators or general scavengers. All the recovered species live close to still or slowly flowing eutrophic water where the soil is rich in humus and where the vegetation is rather lush and composed of

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This beetle assemblage indicates a sluggish river surrounded by a marsh dominated by 
   <span class="italic">Phragmites</span>. Alder trees grew alongside the river. Nearby the mature forest consisted mainly of deciduous trees, including oak and ash, as well as coniferous trees such as pine. There is much evidence of dead and rotting timber. Some of the trunks were submerged in water. The presence of beetles that feed on dung and carrion indicates that the area was visited by large herbivorous mammals, perhaps attracted by the presence of 
   <span class="italic">Glyceria</span> (sweet grass). There is no evidence of saline conditions, as would be indicated by obligate halobiont species.
