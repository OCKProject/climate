 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The onset of zone CG-3 coincided with a marked change in depositional environment, as the estuarine channel regime of the previous zone was replaced by a much quieter phase of organic clay deposition, associated with a lagoonal backwater. This was associated with the deposition of Unit 4. A thin bed of sand (Unit 3, the detritus muds) accumulated in the intervening period, probably as a lag deposit following a short phase of denudation. This sequence of events appears to have initiated a dramatic change in pollen source area, as the input of regionally derived estuarine pollen (mostly 
  <span class="italic">Quercus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Pinus</span>) ceased and was replaced by a strong local pollen signal. The influx of 
  <span class="italic">Ceratopteris</span> spores at the start of zone shows that fern communities colonised the site, probably spreading over the damp, exposed surface of the infilled channel. Some of these resistant spores may also have been reworked.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alder now dominated the local woodland and even became rooted at the site, showing that local soils were fairly wet. Drier areas, probably fringing the alder carr, still supported mixed oak woodland during the early part of the zone, with the same suite of taxa that flourished previously. This soon changed, however, as firstly 
  <span class="italic">Carpinus</span> and then boreal trees (
  <span class="italic">Abies</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Pinus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Betula</span>) began to expand. 
  <span class="italic">Picea</span> was the only conifer not to invade, possibly because of the high clay content of the local soils (cf. 
  <a rid="bib131" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib131">Turner, 1970</a>). The ground vegetation also changed, as Ericaceous plants became more widespread, probably in response to soil acidification.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wetter areas continued to support 
  <span class="italic">Alnus</span> in the latter half of the zone, although there was no longer any input of 
  <span class="italic">Alnus</span> wood to the sediment, possibly because the water was now too deep for the tree to grow. Conditions were now more favourable to waterside, aquatic and semi-aquatic herb communities, including 
  <span class="italic">E. cannabinum</span>, 
  <span class="italic">A. filiculoides</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Chara</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Alisma</span>. All these plants prefer fairly quiet, eutrophic, freshwater conditions, although with the exception of 
  <span class="italic">Azolla</span>, all could tolerate low levels of salt. 
  <span class="italic">Sphagnum</span> too became more widespread, reflecting increasing dampness.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conditions changed again near the end of the zone as the input of organic material ceased and inorganic clays and sands (Unit 5) began to accumulate. 
  <span class="italic">Pinus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Alnus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Ceratopteris</span> were still present during this phase, although 
  <span class="italic">Abies</span> appears to have declined in the immediate region. The thermophilous trees also diminished, possibly in response to a progressive shift towards boreal woodland. Because only the more resistant pollen grains are represented in the two uppermost samples it is possible that some of the pollen has been reworked, probably from the underlying organic beds.
