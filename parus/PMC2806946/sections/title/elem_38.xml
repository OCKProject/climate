  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ostracods were recovered from the silty clays (Unit 2) and detritus muds (Unit 3) penetrated in borehole CG1. Depths given below refer to this borehole. The organic clays (Unit 4) and the basal sands and gravels (Unit 1) were barren. After wet-sieving, all identifiable fragments retained on 125 μm sieves were counted. Two local assemblage biozones, 1 and 2 were identified in the ostracod diagram (

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This lowermost zone extends from the sandy clays to the shelly silts (sub-units 2a–2c). The sandy clays below 14.00 m yielded a sparse ostracod fauna dominated by juveniles of the euryhaline species 
    <span class="italic">Cyprideis torosa</span> (Jones). Many of the specimens of 
    <span class="italic">C. torosa</span> showed signs of nodal development, a characteristic that has been attributed to salinities (&lt;6‰) at the lowest limit of the species' range (cf. 
    <a rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib75">Meisch, 2000</a>). Freshwater species increase in frequency and become more diverse in the clay-rich sediments at 13.00 m. These include the bottom-burrowing 
    <span class="italic">Candona neglecta</span> Sars and 
    <span class="italic">Pseudocandona marchica</span> Hartwig and the plant-crawling 
    <span class="italic">Ilyocypris gibba</span> (Ramdohr) and

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This upper zone extends from the middle of sub-unit 2c to Unit 3 and is characterized by fluctuations in the frequencies of both brackish and freshwater taxa. At 10.63 m, for example, numbers of smooth-valved 
    <span class="italic">C. torosa</span> increase dramatically, whilst the diversity and frequency of freshwater species decline. Numbers of 
    <span class="italic">C. torosa</span> fall, however, at 9.50 m, with a corresponding rise in the frequencies of freshwater taxa. 
    <span class="italic">C. neglecta</span> dominates the latter, with well-balanced numbers of adults and juveniles and males and females (

    <span class="italic">Sarscypridopsis aculeata</span> (Lilljeborg) also occurs. 
    <span class="italic">C. torosa</span> valve frequencies rise again near the upper part of the unit. The thin detritus muds overlying the silty clays (Unit 3) yielded only a few noded

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Local environment inferred from the Ostracoda</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mixed ostracod faunas are typical of a highly transitional inner estuarine environment in which the euryhaline 
   <span class="italic">C. torosa</span> was able to flourish locally alongside fluctuating numbers of freshwater species. The early phase of silty clay deposition (sub-unit 2a) was characterized by conditions poorly suited to ostracod life, probably resulting from the sandy nature of the substrate or current activity. The presence of large numbers of noded 
   <span class="italic">Cyprideis</span> suggests a salinity at ca 5‰ or less, if they are 
   <span class="italic">in situ</span>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast, conditions during the accumulation of the overlying clay and silt dominated beds (sub-units 2b–2d) allowed 
   <span class="italic">C. torosa</span> to thrive. Salinities were also low enough locally to enable 
   <span class="italic">C. neglecta</span> and 
   <span class="italic">I. gibba</span> to survive at all levels of development (
   <a rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib98">Roe, 1994</a>), the latter suggesting that aquatic or bankside vegetation existed within or in proximity to the channel (
   <a rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib75">Meisch, 2000</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Salinities must have increased subsequently, as reflected by an expansion in smooth-valved 
   <span class="italic">C. torosa</span> and a fall in local freshwater populations. Some of the sparse freshwater species were probably transported from sites further upstream. The well-balanced freshwater populations from the overlying sediments at 9.50 m appear to mark a brief decline in saltwater influence. Salinity levels increased again when the uppermost part of the silty clays accumulated.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, the fauna of the silty clays typifies an estuarine section of river, which gradually became more open to marine influence through time. The brief lowering of salinities that took place in the latter part of this episode (at 9.50 m) may reflect a short-lived increase in river discharge, a change in tidal or depositional regime or possibly a small fall in relative sea level. This parallels the changes noted in the diatom floras at the same level.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The limited fauna of the detritus muds (Unit 3), points to a marked change in conditions, which were generally unfavourable for ostracods. The currents which carried sand and shell debris into the site at this time may have restricted their survival. Re-working from the lower silty clays also cannot be excluded.</p>
