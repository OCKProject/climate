 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ostracods were recovered from the silty clays (Unit 2) and detritus muds (Unit 3) penetrated in borehole CG1. Depths given below refer to this borehole. The organic clays (Unit 4) and the basal sands and gravels (Unit 1) were barren. After wet-sieving, all identifiable fragments retained on 125 μm sieves were counted. Two local assemblage biozones, 1 and 2 were identified in the ostracod diagram (
