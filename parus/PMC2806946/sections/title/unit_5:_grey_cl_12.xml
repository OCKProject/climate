 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Massive, grey clays, 5–30 cm thick, form the uppermost member of the channel-fill sequence (
  <a rid="fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#fig6">Fig. 6</a>B). The contact between the two deposits is variable, sometimes it is marked by a transitional zone of brown-grey clay, but elsewhere it is abrupt. The unit extends laterally towards the eastern part of the site where it rests directly above Unit 2. It finally disappears near borehole 25 (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Units 1–5 together complete the infill sequence of the Cudmore Grove Channel, which we formally define here as the ‘Cudmore Grove Member’ of the Lower Thames Formation (cf. 
  <a rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib41">Gibbard, 1999</a>). Borehole CG1, which includes the thickest representation of most of the sedimentary units, is proposed as the stratotype [TM 0681 1456].
