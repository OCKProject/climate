 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The faunal datasets provide a wealth of information about the local environment and climate associated with the accumulation of the Cudmore Grove interglacial beds, but few groups are biostratigraphically significant. Neither the Coleoptera nor the Ostracoda provide definitive stratigraphical information. Amongst the Mollusca, however, the occurrence of 
  <span class="italic">B. naticina</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. fluminalis</span> is significant, since neither species has been reported in the Lower Gravel or Lower Loam at Swanscombe in Kent (
  <a rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>) or in the Freshwater Beds at Clacton. These horizons are thought to relate to the early-temperate sub-stage of the Hoxnian (
  <a rid="bib62 bib132" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib62 bib132">Kerney, 1971; Turner and Kerney, 1971</a>). During this interglacial in Britain 
  <span class="italic">Corbicula</span> is known only from the late-temperate sub-stage, where it occurs in the Middle Gravel at Swanscombe, the Estuarine Beds at Clacton and in tidally-influenced sediments at East Hyde near Tillingham (
  <a rid="bib101 bib74 bib100" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib101 bib74 bib100">Roe and Preece, 1995; Meijer and Preece, 2000; Roe, 2001</a>). 
  <span class="italic">B. naticina</span> is similarly known only from the upper levels (Middle Gravel and equivalents) at Swanscombe (
  <a rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib62">Kerney, 1971</a>). The occurrence of these species in brackish-water sediments belonging to a late-temperate sub-stage at Cudmore Grove would therefore be consistent with deposition during the Hoxnian. Other evidence presented in this paper suggests, however, that the organic sediments at Cudmore Grove belong to a later temperate stage, probably equivalent to MIS 9 (see below). Sites that have been correlated with this stage, such as Barling in Essex and Hackney Downs in central London, have yielded 
  <span class="italic">Corbicula</span> during the early-temperate sub-stage (
  <a rid="bib22 bib46" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib22 bib46">Bridgland et al., 2001; Green et al., 2006</a>). It would appear that 
  <span class="italic">Corbicula</span> occurred throughout much of MIS 9, in contrast to its more restricted occurrence during MIS 11. In Britain, 
  <span class="italic">B. naticina</span> has not previously been recorded after the Hoxnian, and thus its occurrence at Cudmore Grove represents its first record from the late-temperate sub-stage of the ensuing interglacial.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The best faunal evidence for the age of the interglacial beds comes from the mammal remains. The assemblage lacks any of the ‘indicator species’ that have been found to characterise the Hoxnian (
  <a rid="bib110 bib111 bib95" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib110 bib111 bib95">Schreve, 1997, 2001; Preece et al., 2007</a>) at sites such as Hoxne (
  <a rid="bib122" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib122">Stuart et al., 1993</a>), Barnham (
  <a rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib82">Parfitt, 1998</a>), Beeches Pit, West Stow (
  <a rid="bib95" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib95">Preece et al., 2007</a>), all in Suffolk, Swanscombe (
  <a rid="bib124 bib109" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib124 bib109">Sutcliffe, 1964; Schreve, 1996</a>) and Clacton in Essex (
  <a rid="bib117" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib117">Singer et al., 1973</a>). Thus, in the case of the small mammals, the extinct small mole (
  <span class="italic">Talpa minor</span>), rabbit (
  <span class="italic">Oryctolagus cuniculus</span>), extinct giant beaver (
  <span class="italic">Trogontherium cuvieri</span>) and European pine vole (
  <span class="italic">Microtus</span> (
  <span class="italic">Terricola</span>) 
  <span class="italic">subterraneus</span>) are all absent at Cudmore Grove, despite extensive sieving that led to the recovery of over 1500 mammalian remains. In Britain this assemblage of species only co-existed during the Hoxnian so their absence at Cudmore Grove strongly suggests that this site dates from a younger temperate episode. This is supported in the large mammal assemblage by the occurrence at Cudmore Grove of brown bear (
  <span class="italic">U. arctos</span>), as opposed to cave bear (
  <span class="italic">Ursus spelaeus</span>) known from the Hoxnian.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The distinction first made by 
  <a rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib28">Currant (1989)</a> between the vertebrate assemblages from Hoxnian sites and those from Grays and Cudmore Grove was initially dismissed by 
  <a rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib14">Bridgland (1994)</a>, who suggested that variations in sample size might explain the apparent differences. However, 
  <a rid="bib110" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib110">Schreve (1997)</a> counted 1575 specimens from 27 taxa at Grays, 1622 specimens from 33 taxa at Swanscombe and 952 specimens from 19 taxa at Clacton, compared with 1508 specimens from 18 taxa at Cudmore Grove. These counts demonstrate that all four sites are comparably rich, indicating that the absence of the Hoxnian ‘indicator species’ at Cudmore Grove is biostratigraphically significant, although it is true that the number of large mammals recovered from the other sites is far larger than the comparable total from Cudmore Grove.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the basis of mammalian biostratigraphical evidence, in particular the presence of white-toothed shrews (
  <span class="italic">Crocidura</span> spp.), the Cudmore Grove deposits were originally grouped not only with those of Grays Thurrock (Essex) but also with the lower part of the sequence at Aveley (Essex) and Itteringham (Norfolk) (
  <a rid="bib18 bib28" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib18 bib28">Bridgland et al., 1988; Currant, 1989</a>). However, 
  <span class="italic">Crocidura</span> has now been recovered from deposits of Hoxnian age at Barnham (
  <a rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib82">Parfitt, 1998</a>) and of Last (Ipswichian) Interglacial age at Tornewton Cave, Devon (A.P. Currant, personal communication) so, pending further refinement to species level, the genus can no longer be used as an indicator of age.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Cudmore Grove mammalian assemblage compares most closely with those faunas known from Purfleet and Grays Thurrock in the Lower Thames region (
  <a rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>). These localities have previously been attributed to a wide range of ages but have most recently been assigned to MIS 9 on the basis of terrace stratigraphy (
  <a rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib14">Bridgland, 1994</a>) and mammalian biostratigraphy (
  <a rid="bib110 bib111 bib112" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib110 bib111 bib112">Schreve, 1997, 2001; Schreve et al., 2002</a>). These assemblages are unified not only by the species present but also characterized by some that are absent, where such absence is not related to collection failure. Moreover, all three sites contain remains of water shrew, attributed to 
  <span class="italic">N.</span> cf. 
  <span class="italic">browni</span> on the basis of size. 
  <span class="italic">N. browni</span> was first described by 
  <a rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib54">Hinton (1911)</a> from Grays Thurrock and was considered by him to represent a transitional form between the small early Middle Pleistocene water shrew, 
  <span class="italic">Neomys newtoni</span> and the larger, modern species 
  <span class="italic">Neomys fodiens</span>. Whether this represents a valid species is open to question but relative size may nevertheless serve as a useful biostratigraphic marker (
  <a rid="bib111" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib111">Schreve, 2001</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The remains of water vole (
  <span class="italic">A. terrestris cantiana</span>) from Cudmore Grove are also of biostratigraphical significance, since they show differences from those recovered from Hoxnian sites. 
  <span class="italic">A. terrestris cantiana</span> is characterized by relatively small and permanently growing rootless molars, which display a ‘
  <span class="italic">Mimomys</span>’ enamel differentiation (i.e. the enamel of the trailing (convex) edges is markedly thicker than that of the leading (concave) edges). The modern NW European 
  <span class="italic">Arvicola terrestris terrestris</span>, on the other hand, has relatively larger molars that display a ‘
  <span class="italic">Microtus</span>’ enamel differentiation, with thicker enamel on the leading (concave) edges of the salient angles. Throughout the Middle and Late Pleistocene, an evolutionary trend is apparent in the water vole lineage as the size of the molars increases and the thickened enamel on the convex sides of the molars reduces (
  <a rid="bib126 bib51 bib52 bib121 bib66 bib65" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib126 bib51 bib52 bib121 bib66 bib65">Sutcliffe and Kowalski, 1976; Heinrich, 1982, 1987; Stuart, 1982; van Kolfschoten, 1990; von Koenigswald and van Kolfschoten, 1996</a>). A separation of the Cudmore Grove sample from that of Hoxnian sites has been demonstrated on the basis of this enamel differentiation, using a quotient (SDQ) to express the relative thickness of the enamel on the trailing and leading edges of the molars. The SDQ values for Hoxnian 
  <span class="italic">Arvicola</span> samples of first lower molars fluctuate around 140 (
  <a rid="bib82 bib111 bib95" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib82 bib111 bib95">Parfitt, 1998; Schreve, 2001; Preece et al., 2007</a>, Fig. 27), whereas those from Cudmore Grove have a mean value of 133.36 (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 48, range = 105–147), implying a younger age. The SDQ values for Cudmore Grove accord well with those from other sites attributed to MIS 9, such as Grays Thurrock and Purfleet (
  <a rid="bib111 bib95" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib111 bib95">Schreve, 2001; Preece et al., 2007</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A further trend is also visible in 
  <span class="italic">Arvicola</span>, namely the progressive loss of the ‘
  <span class="italic">Mimomys</span> fold’ in the first lower molar. The earliest forms of 
  <span class="italic">Arvicola</span> from the end of the ‘Cromerian Complex’ retain the ‘
  <span class="italic">Mimomys</span> fold’ and this trait consistently occurs in up to one third of individuals from Hoxnian deposits (
  <a rid="bib82 bib95" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib82 bib95">Parfitt, 1998; Preece et al., 2007</a>, Fig. 27). In later interglacials, that number has dwindled or even disappeared. The evidence from Cudmore Grove is consistent with a post-Hoxnian age, since of the 112 first lower molars recovered, the ‘
  <span class="italic">Mimomys</span> fold’ is present in only 5 specimens (4.46% of the sample).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An upper limit for the age of the Cudmore Grove interglacial is suggested by the presence of 
  <span class="italic">M. sylvanus</span>, which is unknown in Britain from deposits attributed to MIS 7 and later. The length of the Cudmore Grove water vole first lower molars may also be significant, since they are smaller (mean = 3.49 mm, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 33) than samples from localities attributed to MIS 7, such as Pontnewydd Cave (
  <a rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib47">Green, 1984</a>) (3.69 mm, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 3, 
  <a rid="bib110" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib110">Schreve, 1997</a>) and to the Ipswichian (see 
  <a rid="bib95" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib95">Preece et al., 2007</a>, Fig. 27 for details). The distinctive mammalian assemblage from Cudmore Grove therefore differs from those described from several Hoxnian sites that have produced reasonable samples of mammalian remains. The absence of critical Hoxnian ‘indicator species’, the presence of both brown bear and the occurrence of 
  <span class="italic">Arvicola</span> molars with relatively lower SDQ values, all indicate a post-Hoxnian age for the Cudmore Grove interglacial.
