 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mammalian remains suggest a similar range of environments, with woodland and aquatic species particularly well represented. The presence of deciduous or mixed woodland with thick ground cover is suggested by the abundance of bank vole (
  <span class="italic">Clethrionomys glareolus</span>) and wood mouse (
  <span class="italic">Apodemus sylvaticus</span>), with smaller numbers of pygmy shrew (
  <span class="italic">Sorex minutus</span>) and serotine bat (
  <span class="italic">Eptesicus serotinus</span>), for which there are few British Pleistocene records. This is supported by larger mammal taxa such as red squirrel (
  <span class="italic">Sciurus vulgaris</span>), macaque (
  <span class="italic">Macaca sylvanus</span>), beaver (
  <span class="italic">Castor fiber</span>), brown bear (
  <span class="italic">Ursus arctos</span>), badger (
  <span class="italic">Meles meles</span>) and roe deer (
  <span class="italic">Capreolus capreolus</span>). Locally open vegetation is indicated by field vole (
  <span class="italic">Microtus agrestis</span>) and horse (
  <span class="italic">Equus ferus</span>), whereas aquatic habitats are indicated by the abundance of water vole (
  <span class="italic">Arvicola terrestris cantiana</span>), which represents 37% of the mammalian assemblage (MNI = 60), and the high frequency of water shrew (
  <span class="italic">Neomys</span> cf. 
  <span class="italic">browni</span>), which frequent the well-vegetated banks of rivers and lakes with still or slow-flowing water. The presence of bicoloured white-toothed shrew (
  <span class="italic">Crocidura</span> cf. 
  <span class="italic">leucodon</span>), which today has a predominantly southern European distribution, supports the inference that the climate may have been slightly warmer than at present.
