 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Clast lithological analysis has been an important tool in this region for distinguishing deposits of the Thames, which became confluent with the Essex Medway after its diversion into the region during the Anglian (forming the ‘Thames–Medway’), from older, pre-diversion Medway aggradations (
  <a rid="bib12 bib13" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib12 bib13">Bridgland, 1983, 1988</a>). The former contain clasts sourced from the wider catchment of the Thames, including the Weald, whereas the latter comprise lithologies originating from the London Basin (
  <a rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib13">Bridgland, 1988</a>). To ensure compatibility with previous work, samples were analysed using the technique described by 
  <a rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib12">Bridgland (1983: p. 25)</a>. Two samples were examined from the Cudmore Grove Channel Gravel (Unit 1, samples 1a and 1b) and three from Unit 6, the Upper sands and gravels (samples 6a–6c) (
  <a rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#fig4">Fig. 4</a>; 
  <a rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>). At least 400 stones were counted per sample. During counting, the pebbles were divided into three main categories: i) the ‘local’ group, which consists of rocks outcropping in the London Basin; ii) the ‘southern’ group comprising rocks occurring in the area to the south of the North Downs (including Lower Greensand chert); and iii) the ‘exotic’ group, comprising rocks from any other area and including exotic types reworked from within the London Basin (cf.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unit 1</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The basal sands and gravels (Unit 1) recovered from borehole CG1 were found to comprise the same general lithologies (southern, exotic and local) as typical Thames–Medway gravels (
   <a rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib13">Bridgland, 1988</a>; 
   <a rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>). However, proportions of the three types differed significantly. First, the samples included much higher levels of angular (non-Tertiary flint), which gave Tertiary:non-Tertiary flint ratios of 5.36 and 6.22 (ratios from Thames–Medway gravels rarely exceed 1). These ratios are comparable to those recorded by 
   <a rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib12">Bridgland (1983)</a> in the ‘Upper Holland Gravel’ near Clacton, a deposit that is thought to be enriched with distal outwash material (
   <a rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib14">Bridgland, 1994</a>: p. 287). The Unit 1 samples also yielded much higher frequencies of exotics (9.7% and 13.2% of the total) than local Thames–Medway gravels, which typically contain 0.5–2.5% (
   <a rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib12">Bridgland, 1983</a>). In this case, the most probable source is the exotic-rich Kesgrave Member deposits that outcrop widely to the north and west of Mersea Island (
   <a rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, the range of lithologies in the Unit 1 gravels indicates a composition intermediate between Thames–Medway and outwash, with an additional element of Kesgrave material. The gravels may, therefore, have been aggraded by the Thames–Medway itself, downstream of a confluence with a river re-working fluvio-glacial sediments. Alternatively, they could have been deposited by a tributary that was fed by streams re-working older Thames–Medway, fluvio-glacial and Kesgrave deposits.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A single analysis from the Cudmore Grove Channel lag differed from the counts described above in showing a typical Thames–Medway composition (cf. 
   <a rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib18">Bridgland et al., 1988</a>; 
   <a rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>). Unfortunately, no counts were obtained from this marginal deposit in the present study because pebble numbers were too low to obtain a valid sample size. Nevertheless, general observations confirmed that the deposit was indeed much richer in Tertiary flint than the gravels in borehole CG1. It therefore appears that the basal gravel is a composite deposit, the thinner, marginal part of which probably represents a lag derived from older Thames–Medway sediments.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unit 6</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The upper sands and gravels (Unit 6) show some compositional similarities to the Thames–Medway gravels of the Southend and Dengie Peninsulas (cf. 
   <a rid="bib12 bib43" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib12 bib43">Bridgland, 1983; Gibbard et al., 1996</a>). They differ, however, in their marginally higher proportions of exotics, which reach 2.4–4.6% (for comparison, frequencies in the Asheldham Member on the Dengie Peninsula rarely exceed 2.0%). The assemblages nevertheless compare closely with those of gravels found elsewhere on the island, which have also been assigned to the Mersea Island Member (
   <a rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib12">Bridgland, 1983</a>; 
   <a rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>). 
   <a rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib12">Bridgland (1983)</a> attributed their slight enrichment of exotics to the input of additional quartzose material from a tributary, possibly the proto-Blackwater, which joined the Thames–Medway between the Dengie Peninsula and Mersea Island.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Whatever the origin of the exotics, the close similarities shown between the counts from Units 6a and 6b suggest that the same materials were being sourced throughout the aggradation, in spite of the inferred changes in flow direction (
   <a rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>; 
   <a rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>c). This is somewhat surprising, since the upper gravel-rich facies appear to have been deposited by a river flowing from the northeast, a direction that is inconsistent with a Thames–Medway origin. It is therefore possible that these upper gravels were reworked by a smaller river (perhaps a proto-River Colne) from older Thames–Medway material to the north.
