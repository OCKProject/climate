 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sedimentary sequence at Cudmore Grove was examined using a combination of surface mapping, section logging and coring techniques. The exposed parts of the sequence, which include sand and gravel cliffs and foreshore exposures, were mapped along a 0.3 km section extending between Cudmore Grove wood [TM 065 144] and the sea wall [TM 069 147] (

The subsurface stratigraphy was investigated using a series of shallow (ca 1–9 m) borings taken with a hand-auger and a ‘Minute Man’ portable drilling apparatus. A deep (22 m) borehole (CG1) was also excavated with a 10 cm diameter percussion corer to sample the complete Pleistocene sequence (
