 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Avian remains, which are usually under-represented in open sites, are represented by 42 identifiable bones or bone fragments. The presence of garganey (
  <span class="italic">Anas querquedula</span>), gadwall (
  <span class="italic">Anas strepera</span>) and little crake (
  <span class="italic">Porzana parva</span>) suggests summers as warm as that of central Europe at the present-day, in which case the northern boreal breeding whooper swan (
  <span class="italic">Cygnus cygnus</span>) and smew (
  <span class="italic">Mergellus albellus</span>) would probably have been present as winter visitors. These species suggest the presence of an open body of freshwater, with a well-vegetated margin and shallow-water plantlife. A range of passerines, including song thrush (
  <span class="italic">Turdus philomelos</span>), fieldfare (
  <span class="italic">Turdus pilaris</span>), great tit (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>), blue or coal tit (
  <span class="italic">Parus caeruleus</span> or 
  <span class="italic">Parus ater</span>) and willow warbler or chiffchaff (
  <span class="italic">Phylloscopus trochilus</span> or 
  <span class="italic">Phylloscopus collybita</span>) indicate the proximity of woodland. The Sandwich tern (
  <span class="italic">Sterna sandvicensis</span>) suggests the proximity of the coast.
