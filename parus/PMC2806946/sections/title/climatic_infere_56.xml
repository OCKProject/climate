 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This coleopteran assemblage is entirely composed of temperate species some of which have present-day geographical ranges that do not extend as far north as Britain. Of particular importance is the presence of 
  <span class="italic">O. gracilis</span>, which has a strong preference for habitats that heat up rapidly in the summer (
  <a rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib70">Lindroth, 1943</a>). Several of the wood-dependent species (e.g. 
  <span class="italic">R. sulcatus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">V. hemipterus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">R. elongatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">S. submuricatus</span>) are also predominantly ‘southern’ but these inhabitants of old mature forests may now be restricted by anthropogenic reduction of their habitats rather than by climate. However, there is no doubt that this fauna indicates a climate rather warmer than that in southern England today.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the Mutual Climatic Range (MCR) method (
  <a rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib5">Atkinson et al., 1987</a>) it is possible to give quantitative estimates of the thermal climate based on the coleopteran assemblage. Fourteen species in the Cudmore Grove fauna were also present on the MCR database (see 
  <a rid="tbl4" ref-type="table" href="#tbl4">Table 4</a>). This method gave the following estimates, where 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>max</sub> is the mean temperature of the warmest month (July) and 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>min</sub> is the mean temperature of the coldest month(s), namely January and February:
  <div list-type="simple" class="list">
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>
     <span class="italic">T</span>
     <sub>max</sub> lay somewhere between 16 °C and 22 °C
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>
     <span class="italic">T</span>
     <sub>min</sub> lay somewhere between −7 °C and 4 °C
    </p>
   </div>
  </div>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within this range of temperatures it is possible to give a best estimate (
  <a rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib26">Coope et al., 1998</a>). This gives the following figures for the most likely values:

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thus the mean July temperatures were about 2 °C warmer than those of the present day in southeast England and mean January temperatures may have been very slightly colder.</p>
