 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Changes in the diatom assemblages show the probable long-term landward progression of the tidal head and accompanying salt wedge of a palaeo-estuary, with the development of full brackish-water conditions by ldaz CGD2c. Shorter term changes in the diatoms may represent i) major fluctuations in freshwater discharge to the estuary; ii) rises of relative sea level; and iii) sedimentary and/or estuarine–coastal geometry changes. Together these eventually led to the replacement of an estuarine tidal channel and mudflat environment by more isolated conditions, possibly an estuarine embayment or lagoon. Detailed diatom records of this kind are rare from British interglacial sites, although 
  <a rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib77">Mitlehner (1992)</a> provides a skeletal record from the Nar Valley Clay in Norfolk (see Section 
  <a rid="sec16.3" ref-type="sec" href="#sec16.3">16.3</a> below).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the early phase of channel infilling, associated with ldaz CGD1, the dominance of 
  <span class="italic">Aulacoseira</span> spp. and 
  <span class="italic">Fragilaria</span> spp. and the high values of whole diatoms (ca 80%), suggest that eutrophic, freshwater conditions prevailed locally, indicative of a riverine environment with adjacent alkaline freshwater areas. The presence of brackish and marine taxa reflects the penetration of saltwater into the river. 
  <span class="italic">F. pinnata</span> and 
  <span class="italic">F. lapponica</span> (each rising to &gt;12%), have a northerly distribution (
  <a rid="bib145" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib145">de Wolf and Cleveringa, 1994</a>) and the diatom community is consistent with stressed conditions during the early part of an interglacial. 
  <span class="italic">Fragilaria</span> spp. are pioneer diatoms that thrive under conditions of environmental stress, particularly where increasing salinity is involved (
  <a rid="bib118 bib30" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib118 bib30">Stabell, 1985; Denys, 1990</a>), as is 
  <span class="italic">A. granulata</span> (
  <a rid="bib119" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib119">Stachura and Witkowski, 1997</a>). The assemblage as a whole is representative of the upper reaches of a river estuary close to the tidal limit, with salinities of ca 0.5–5‰.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The rapid rise in marine species in ldaz CGD2a, dominated by 
  <span class="italic">P. sulcata</span> and other littoral and lower estuary taxa, shows the influence of tidal action. The rise in broken diatoms over the ldaz CGD1/2a boundary coupled with an increase in species diversity, together suggest the transport and inwashing of diatoms from a range of salinity regimes. The fining in sediment within Unit 2 may be associated with increasing salinity, resulting in flocculation. The continuing dominance of freshwater diatoms indicates that the site remained close to the tidal head in the river.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Above ca 11 m (CGD2b) the diatom flora reflects the effects of the developing estuary, shown by the expansion of the number and frequencies of brackish-water taxa. In the freshwater diatom community, the dominance of 
  <span class="italic">A. granulata</span> and other planktonic taxa is replaced by benthic, epipelic taxa, especially, 
  <span class="italic">E. turgida</span>. This indicates an increase in the extent of shallower, estuarine margin habitats. The fluctuations in marine to freshwater diatoms in ldaz CGD2b also indicate a period of variability in the environmental controls operating in the estuary. The occurrence of such fluctuating freshwater: marine diatom ratios in some estuarine records have been attributed to the effects of storms, river floods and marine surges, combined with the impact of longer term relative sea-level rises (
  <a rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib32">Devoy et al., 1994</a>). The record here shows that the ‘cycles’ in the diatom ratios each represent ca 0.5 m of sediment accumulation with no apparent hiatuses. This sediment thickness, together with its fine texture, suggest that these ‘cycles’ are unlikely to be the result of storms, which might be expected to have produced coarser layers, although it is possible that the channel margin location (for CG0) may have influenced the diatom pattern concentrating diatoms from many habitats and sources. Longer term controls (10
  <span class="sup">1</span>–10
  <span class="sup">2</span> years) are more likely to have caused the observed changes. These include climate variability, leading to changes in freshwater river discharge, and alterations in the tidal prism as the estuary shape changed with rising relative sea level and sediment deposition.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The disappearance of these ‘cycles’ from the diatom record above ca 850 cm coincides with the steady expansion in the importance of brackish-water and marine diatoms. The maintenance of 
  <span class="italic">N. punctata</span>, 
  <span class="italic">N. navicularis</span>, 
  <span class="italic">C. pediculus</span> and other epipelic – epiphytic mesohalobous and halophilous diatoms, indicates the occurrence of mudflat and intertidal conditions. The rising values of 
  <span class="italic">C. belgica</span>, accompanied by many other marine planktonic and tychoplanktonic diatoms at the base of ldaz CGD2c, point to wave and tidal scouring (
  <a rid="bib136" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib136">Vos and de Wolf, 1993</a>) and the proximity of open coastal sandy areas. The site at this time was probably in a lower estuarine setting. The observed changes probably reflect the landward shift in estuary zones with long-term sea-level rise, causing increased exposure to marine influence.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The base of ldaz CDG3 is marked by an increase in broken diatoms and a peak in marine diatoms. The sediments also become more sandy, suggesting an increase in available energy. These samples came from Unit 3, which has yielded rich mammal and molluscan assemblages (see below). Given that these sediments appear to represent a lag or a high-energy flood deposit, erosion and/or re-working of diatoms from proximal marine sources seems likely.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The subsequent collapse of both the marine and freshwater diatom frequencies through ldaz CGD3, suggests a distinct change in conditions, as supported by the development of the organic clays (Unit 4). The rapid rise in 
  <span class="italic">A. normanii</span> coupled with 
  <span class="italic">Fragilaria</span> spp., indicates increased water eutrophication and environmental stress (cf. 
  <a rid="bib118 bib30" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib118 bib30">Stabell, 1985; Denys, 1990</a>). The diatom flora represents the maintenance of fresh-brackish to brackish-water, indicative of isolated or semi-enclosed areas of standing water. This interpretation is consistent with the isolation of the site from the open estuary. The sediment infilling and shallowing of the estuary through the interglacial may now have led to the development of channel cut-offs, sediment barriers and estuarine lagoons.
