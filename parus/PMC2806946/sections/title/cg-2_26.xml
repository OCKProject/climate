 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sediments and other microfossil datasets suggest that marine influence became more pronounced as saltwater inflow gradually increased (see Sections 
  <a rid="sec8 sec9 sec10" ref-type="sec" href="#sec8 sec9 sec10">8â€“10</a> below). An enlargement of the pollen catchment can thus be inferred, as pollen was now carried in from estuarine and marine sources. The sudden increase in 
  <span class="italic">Quercus</span> pollen at the start of the zone may partly reflect this taphonomic change, as 
  <span class="italic">Quercus</span> pollen was introduced from coastal waters. In spite of this overrepresentation, oak was clearly becoming well established in the region, initiating a decline in both birch and pine. Pine probably persisted in some areas but on a reduced scale. 
  <span class="italic">Fraxinus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Tilia</span> also expanded in the middle of the zone, reflecting the development of well-drained, base-rich soils within the catchment. This was accompanied by the gradual expansion of 
  <span class="italic">Corylus</span> and the first arrival of 
  <span class="italic">Vitis</span>, a shrub of damp, woodland habitats (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some open areas persisted during this zone, supporting such genera as 
  <span class="italic">Polygonum</span> and Caryophyllaceae. Some of the Chenopodiaceae and 
  <span class="italic">Plantago</span> pollen may have been carried in from local saltmarshes. Waterside and aquatic plants declined, probably reflecting the continued salinity rise.
