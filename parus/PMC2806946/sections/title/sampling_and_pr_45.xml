 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Small samples for molluscan analysis were taken at regular intervals throughout borehole CG1. Units 1, 2a, 4, 5 and 6 were barren but molluscan assemblages were recovered from sub-units 2c and 2d and Unit 3, whereas a few comminuted fragments were recovered from sub-unit 2b. The detritus muds (Unit 3) were easily the most shelly horizon. Consequently, the residues of large bulk samples from Unit 3 previously analysed for vertebrate remains by John Clayden (see 
  <a rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib57">Holman etÂ al., 1990</a>), were sorted and the frequencies of molluscan taxa estimated (
