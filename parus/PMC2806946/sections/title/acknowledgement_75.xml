 <p>This work was initiated while HMR was at Cambridge University in receipt of an NERC studentship, which is gratefully acknowledged. She thanks Phil Gibbard for his help during the tenure of this studentship and for many valuable discussions. Steve Boreham also provided field assistance and help with clast lithological analysis. We also thank David Bridgland for discussions on the age and origin of the Mersea Island Gravel and artefacts, Graham Ward and Patrick Spencer for their comments on the archaeology, and Eric Robinson and John Whittaker for advice about ostracods. We are grateful to John Clayden and David Harrison for supplying a substantial part of the vertebrate material and Simon Parfitt for kindly providing some of the

We thank Matthew Collins, Rebecca Briant and Francis Wenban-Smith for support for the amino acid analyses, which were funded by NERC, English Heritage and the Wellcome Trust and Eddie Rhodes for access to unpublished OSL data from Aveley and Purfleet.
