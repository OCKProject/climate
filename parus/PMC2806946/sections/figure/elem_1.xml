  <p>Distribution of sand and gravels associated with the Thames and its tributaries in eastern Essex and the eastern area of the Lower Thames region (after 
   <a rid="bib13 bib14" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib13 bib14">Bridgland, 1988, 1994</a>). The distribution of Anglian till and the pre-Anglian gravels of the Thames (‘Kesgrave’ gravels) are indicated. For ease of interpretation, and to enable the various deposits to be related to the diversion of the Thames into the Southend and Dengie Peninsulas during the Anglian Stage, the terminology applied to the gravels follows 
   <a rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib14">Bridgland (1994)</a>. The pre-diversion deposits of the Essex Medway (‘High-level East Essex gravels’), the post-diversion Thames–Medway deposits (‘Low-level East Essex gravels’) and the Thames gravels of the Lower Thames area are all identified separately (cf. 
   <a rid="bib13 bib14" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib13 bib14">Bridgland, 1988, 1994</a>). A more complete overview of the formal nomenclature applied to the gravels is given in the text and in 
   <a rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib41">Gibbard (1999)</a>. Inset (b) shows the distribution of the Mersea Island Member outcrops on Mersea Island (after 
   <a rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib12">Bridgland, 1983</a>); inset (c) shows the palaeocurrent measurements from Units 6a (a) and 6b (b). The location of key sites mentioned in the text is indicated.
