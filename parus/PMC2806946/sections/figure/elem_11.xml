  <p>Palaeodrainage maps of eastern Essex during MIS 11 (a) and MIS 9 (b). Map a) shows the tidally-influenced Thames–Medway flowing between Tillingham (East Hyde) and Clacton during the late-temperate sub-stage of the inferred MIS 11 interglacial. The sequence at Swanscombe is considered to be the upstream equivalent of this channel system (

Map b) depicts a larger, more complex palaeo-estuary inferred for the end of the early-temperate sub-stage of the younger interglacial, when lower estuarine conditions prevailed at Cudmore Grove (after

The Cudmore Grove palaeo-channel is placed in the more northerly part of this estuarine system and is assumed to have formed a tributary of the main Thames–Medway estuary. The dark shading shows the distribution of channel-fill sediments of estuarine character which have been examined for pollen and other microfossils (
