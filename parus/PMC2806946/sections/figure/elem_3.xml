  <p>Section A–C showing the lithostratigraphy of the Cudmore Grove channel-fill sequence and overlying sands and gravels (Unit 6). The location of the boreholes is shown in 
   <a rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>. The position of Unit 3, only a few centimetres thick, at the base of the organic sequence (depicted in black) is indicated. The stratigraphical position of this unit is shown more clearly in 
   <a rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#fig5">Fig. 5</a>. The lateral continuity of sub-units 2c and 2d near boreholes MM6–MM7 is unclear; here the Pleistocene beds are replaced by Holocene estuarine deposits (
   <a rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>) which are compositionally similar to the upper part of the Pleistocene channel-fill sequence and locally indistinguishable. Samples for clast lithological analysis (
   <a rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>) were collected from the cliff sections near borehole CG1 (sampling points a, b, c).
