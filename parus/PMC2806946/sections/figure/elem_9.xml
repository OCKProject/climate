 <div class="caption">
  <p>D/L values of Asx, Glx, Ala, Val; and [Ser]/[Ala] for the Free (FAA; F) and Total Hydrolysable amino acid (THAA; H) fractions of bleached 
   <span class="italic">Bithynia tentaculata</span> opercula from East Mersea Restaurant Site (EMR) and Cudmore Grove (CG), compared with shells from sites correlated with MIS 5e (Bobbitshole, Trafalgar Square), MIS 7 (Aveley, Lion Pit), MIS 9 (Barling, Grays, Hackney, Purfleet) and MIS 11 (Swanscombe, Hoxne, Elveden, Barnham, Clacton and Beeches Pit). For each group, the base of the box indicates the 25th percentile. Within the box, the solid line plots the median and the dashed line shows the mean. The top of the box indicates the 75th percentile. Where more than 9 data points are available, the 10th and 90th percentiles can be calculated (shown by lines below and above the boxes respectively). The results of each duplicate analysis are included in order to provide a statistically significant sample size. The 
   <span class="italic">y</span>-axes for the [Ser]/[Ala] data are plotted in reverse, so that the direction of increased protein degradation for each of the indicators remains the same. Note different scales on the 
   <span class="italic">y</span>-axes.
