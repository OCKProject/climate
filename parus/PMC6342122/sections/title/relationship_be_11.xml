 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Neither baseline CORT levels nor stress‐induced CORT levels were explained by feather CORT levels (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34788-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34788-fig-0003">3</a>a,b), sex, or the “CORT
  <sub>f</sub> x Sex” interaction (Table 
  <a rid="ece34788-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" href="#ece34788-tbl-0002">2</a>d,e), although stress‐induced CORT levels were positively but weakly associated with feather CORT levels (Table 
  <a rid="ece34788-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" href="#ece34788-tbl-0002">2</a>e). However, the increase in plasma CORT in juveniles was significantly and positively related to feather CORT levels (Table 
  <a rid="ece34788-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" href="#ece34788-tbl-0002">2</a>f; Figure 
  <a rid="ece34788-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34788-fig-0003">3</a>c). Moreover, this increase was not significantly affected by sex or the “CORT
  <sub>f</sub> x Sex” interaction, suggesting the effect of feather CORT levels on the increase in plasma CORT did not significantly differ between males and females (Table 
  <a rid="ece34788-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" href="#ece34788-tbl-0002">2</a>f).
