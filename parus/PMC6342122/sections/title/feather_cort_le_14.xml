 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Feather CORT levels and body size</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In previous studies, we found that body size decreases as the degree of urbanization increases in house sparrows (Meillère et al., 
  <a rid="ece34788-bib-0086" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34788-bib-0086">2017</a>; Meillère, Brischoux, Parenteau, et al., 
  <a rid="ece34788-bib-0087" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34788-bib-0087">2015</a>). Although we found a positive correlation between feather CORT levels and the degree of urbanization, we surprisingly did not find any significant relationship between feather CORT levels and body size in juvenile house sparrows. As feather and structural growth occur simultaneously in the nest, our results suggest that CORT exposure during the post‐hatching period is not directly correlated with nestling growth. Previous studies have shown that elevated plasma and feather CORT levels can be correlated with reduced body size and mass in pigeon and sparrow nestlings (Grace, Froud, Meillère, &amp; Angelier, 
  <a rid="ece34788-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34788-bib-0043">2017</a>; Jenni‐Eiermann et al., 
  <a rid="ece34788-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34788-bib-0054">2015</a>). Interestingly, this correlation between CORT levels, body size, and body mass seems to attenuate and even disappear as the nestlings develop, suggesting that nestlings can compensate for a slow initial growth despite stressful or challenging conditions (Grace et al., 
  <a rid="ece34788-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34788-bib-0043">2017</a>; Jenni‐Eiermann et al., 
  <a rid="ece34788-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34788-bib-0054">2015</a>). This may explain why feather CORT levels and juvenile body size were not correlated in our study, although this may also result from a lack of statistical power (tarsus length was only available from 4 sites). Furthermore, CORT is progressively and irreversibly incorporated into feathers during growth and, therefore, feather CORT levels represent a sum of CORT exposure during feather growth (Bortolotti et al., 
  <a rid="ece34788-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34788-bib-0014">2008</a>; Jenni‐Eiermann et al., 
  <a rid="ece34788-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34788-bib-0054">2015</a>; Romero &amp; Fairhurst, 
  <a rid="ece34788-bib-0104" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34788-bib-0104">2016</a>; Will et al., 
  <a rid="ece34788-bib-0122" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34788-bib-0122">2014</a>). Growth and juvenile body size may be affected by acute and temporary stressful events during growth, which are not identifiable in the integrated feather CORT measurement.
