 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All statistical analyses were performed in R 3.4.3 (R Core Team, 
  <a rid="ece34788-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34788-bib-0021">2016</a>). First, to test the correlation of urbanization with feather CORT levels in juveniles, we fitted linear mixed models (LMMs, normal error distribution, identity link function) with “capture site” (a total of 11 sites) as a random factor to control for the non‐independence of individuals captured at the same site. We used “urbanization” (PC1 score) and “capture date” as fixed effects in our model. We did not include the “sex” in this analysis because it was unknown for all individuals that were not bled (60 birds from 7 sites). Second, to test whether developmental stress affects both CORT regulation and growth, we fitted LMMs (normal error distribution, identity link function) with “SMI,” “tarsus length,” “body mass,” “baseline CORT,” “stress‐induced CORT levels,” or “increase in plasma CORT” as response variables. We used “capture site” as a random factor, and “feather CORT level” and “sex” as fixed effects in these models. We verified that all models met the assumptions of equal variances and normal residuals. Baseline CORT levels were log
  <sub>10</sub>‐transformed to ensure the normality of model residuals, but we present non‐transformed values to facilitate interpretation. Feather CORT levels in ng/mm were highly correlated with feather CORT levels in ng/mg (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.837; 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001), and all the results were qualitatively similar when using one measure or the other. Therefore, we only present the feather CORT data expressed in ng/mg in the rest of the manuscript (but see Supporting Information Table 
  <a rid="ece34788-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece34788-sup-0002">S1</a> and Figure 
  <a rid="ece34788-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece34788-sup-0001">S1</a> for all results and graph with feather CORT expressed in ng/mm).
