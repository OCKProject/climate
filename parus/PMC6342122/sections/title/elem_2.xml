  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2013 (June–August), a total of 111 juvenile house sparrows were captured with mist nets at 11 sites in France (Figure 
   <a rid="ece34788-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34788-fig-0001">1</a>; geographic coordinates of the capture sites and sample sizes for each population are summarized in Table 
   <a rid="ece34788-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" href="#ece34788-tbl-0001">1</a>). The 11 sites differed in urbanization level, ranging from sparsely populated areas (e.g., isolated farms, small villages) to highly urbanized city centers. To quantify the degree of urbanization of each capture site, we used the method developed by Liker et al. (
   <a rid="ece34788-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34788-bib-0072">2008</a>) for house sparrows (see also Meillère, Brischoux, Parenteau, et al., 
   <a rid="ece34788-bib-0087" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34788-bib-0087">2015</a>; Meillère et al., 
   <a rid="ece34788-bib-0086" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34788-bib-0086">2017</a>). Briefly, we used digital aerial photographs of 1 km
   <span class="sup">2</span> areas around each capture site that we divided into 100 cells. For each capture site, we extracted five habitat characteristics as follows: mean building density score, number of cells with high building density, mean vegetation density score, number of cells with high vegetation density, and number of cells with roads. Then, we used the PC1 value from a principal component analysis (PCA) of these five variables to attribute an urbanization score to each site (Table 
   <a rid="ece34788-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" href="#ece34788-tbl-0001">1</a>). The PC1 accounted for 93.3% of the total variance and was strongly positively correlated with artificial surfaces (building density and roads; all 
   <span class="italic">r</span> &gt; 0.806) and negatively with vegetation cover (all 
   <span class="italic">r</span> &lt; −0.980).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Feathers were collected from all study sites. The two innermost rectrices of each individual were collected and stored in dry paper envelopes until laboratory analyses. We weighed (high‐resolution balance: ±0.01 mg) and measured the length (digital caliper: ±0.01 mm; see Meillère et al., 
   <a rid="ece34788-bib-0086" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34788-bib-0086">2017</a>) of all feathers. In addition to feather collections, morphological measurements and blood samples were collected at 4 of the 11 sites (two urban and two rural; see Table 
   <a rid="ece34788-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" href="#ece34788-tbl-0001">1</a>). For all juveniles captured at these four sites, body mass (electronic balance: ±0.1 g), wing length (steel rule: ±1 mm), tarsus length, and bill length (caliper: ±0.1 mm) were measured. Additionally, fat and muscle scores were recorded as detailed in Kaiser (
   <a rid="ece34788-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34788-bib-0057">1993</a>), Brown (
   <a rid="ece34788-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34788-bib-0016">1996</a>) and Leloutre, Gouzerh, and Angelier (
   <a rid="ece34788-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34788-bib-0069">2014</a>). For consistency and to avoid potential methodological bias, morphological measurements were all collected by the same person. In addition to morphological measurements, juveniles from these four sites were bled within 3 min of capture (mean ± 
   <span class="italic">SE</span>: 2 min 39 s ± 2 s; range: 1 min 13 s – 3 min 45 s) to quantify baseline CORT concentration (Romero &amp; Reed, 
   <a rid="ece34788-bib-0105" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34788-bib-0105">2005</a>). Following this first blood sample, birds were kept in cloth bags and sampled a second time 30 min after capture to obtain stress‐induced CORT levels (Wingfield, Davey, Peter, &amp; Tobe, 
   <a rid="ece34788-bib-0124" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34788-bib-0124">1994</a>). CORT levels are at a maximum after 30‐min of restraint in this species (Romero, Cyr, &amp; Romero, 
   <a rid="ece34788-bib-0103" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34788-bib-0103">2006</a>), and therefore, this allowed us to assess the CORT stress response (Wingfield et al., 
   <a rid="ece34788-bib-0125" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34788-bib-0125">1998</a>). We defined the “increase in plasma CORT” as the difference between stress‐induced CORT and baseline CORT levels. All blood samples were collected from the alar vein using a 25‐gauge needle and heparinized microcapillary tubes (up to 150 µl for CORT assay). Blood samples were centrifuged (4,500 rpm, 7 min), and plasma and red blood cells were separated (plasma for CORT assay and red blood cells for molecular sexing). Then, they were kept at −20°C until laboratory analyses at the “Centre d'Etudes Biologiques de Chizé” (hereafter CEBC).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess juvenile body condition, we used the “scaled mass index” (SMI) as recommended by Peig &amp; Green (
   <a rid="ece34788-bib-0098" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34788-bib-0098">2009</a>, 
   <a rid="ece34788-bib-0099" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34788-bib-0099">2010</a>). The SMI adjusts the mass of all individuals to that which would be expected if they all had the same body size (Peig &amp; Green, 
   <a rid="ece34788-bib-0098" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34788-bib-0098">2009</a>). We used tarsus length to calculate the SMI because it had the greatest correlation with body mass (tarsus length: 
   <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.588, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001; wing length: 
   <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.313, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.041). The SMI was computed for each individual as follows:

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Molecular sexing and CORT analyses</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sex of juveniles was determined by molecular sexing as detailed in Fridolfsson and Ellegren (
   <a rid="ece34788-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34788-bib-0039">1999</a>). DNA was extracted from blood samples, and PCR reactions were performed in order to amplify genomic DNA. DNA sequences with only the CHDIZ fragment correspond to males, whereas DNA sequences with the CHDIZ and/or the CHDIW fragment correspond to females. Plasma concentrations of CORT were measured in duplicate by radio‐immunoassay, as previously described (Lormée, Jouventin, Trouve, &amp; Chastel, 
   <a rid="ece34788-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34788-bib-0074">2003</a>). Feather CORT assays were conducted at the CEBC by following previously validated methods (Bortolotti et al., 
   <a rid="ece34788-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34788-bib-0014">2008</a>) with minor improvements (see Meillère et al., 
   <a rid="ece34788-bib-0085" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34788-bib-0085">2016</a>). Specifically, 10 ml of methanol (HPLC grade) were added to each feather sample to extract CORT from the whole feather. Then, feathers were incubated at 50°C overnight in a shaking water bath, the methanol was separated from feather material, and the feather remnants were washed before being added to the original methanol extract. Then, feather extracts were analyzed by radio‐immunoassay at the CEBC as previously described (Lormée et al., 
   <a rid="ece34788-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34788-bib-0074">2003</a>). Feather CORT levels were expressed either as ng of CORT per mg of feather (ng/mg) or as ng of CORT per mm of feather (ng/mm). The minimum detectable CORT level was 0.83 ng/ml. All samples were run in three assays, and the intra‐ and inter‐assay coefficients of variation were 7.07% and 9.99%, respectively.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All statistical analyses were performed in R 3.4.3 (R Core Team, 
   <a rid="ece34788-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34788-bib-0021">2016</a>). First, to test the correlation of urbanization with feather CORT levels in juveniles, we fitted linear mixed models (LMMs, normal error distribution, identity link function) with “capture site” (a total of 11 sites) as a random factor to control for the non‐independence of individuals captured at the same site. We used “urbanization” (PC1 score) and “capture date” as fixed effects in our model. We did not include the “sex” in this analysis because it was unknown for all individuals that were not bled (60 birds from 7 sites). Second, to test whether developmental stress affects both CORT regulation and growth, we fitted LMMs (normal error distribution, identity link function) with “SMI,” “tarsus length,” “body mass,” “baseline CORT,” “stress‐induced CORT levels,” or “increase in plasma CORT” as response variables. We used “capture site” as a random factor, and “feather CORT level” and “sex” as fixed effects in these models. We verified that all models met the assumptions of equal variances and normal residuals. Baseline CORT levels were log
   <sub>10</sub>‐transformed to ensure the normality of model residuals, but we present non‐transformed values to facilitate interpretation. Feather CORT levels in ng/mm were highly correlated with feather CORT levels in ng/mg (
   <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.837; 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001), and all the results were qualitatively similar when using one measure or the other. Therefore, we only present the feather CORT data expressed in ng/mg in the rest of the manuscript (but see Supporting Information Table 
   <a rid="ece34788-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece34788-sup-0002">S1</a> and Figure 
   <a rid="ece34788-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece34788-sup-0001">S1</a> for all results and graph with feather CORT expressed in ng/mm).
