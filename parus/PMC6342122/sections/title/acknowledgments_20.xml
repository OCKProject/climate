 <p>We are very grateful to all the volunteer bird ringers for their help in the field and for providing samples: A. Meillère, J. Bauwin, O. Benoit‐Gonin, N. Boileau, R. Garcin, G. Olioso, P. Ollivier, and B. Vollot. Bird processing and feather sampling were performed by trained bird ringers, and authorized by the French Bird Ringing Center (CRBPO, Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle) under the SPOL PASDOM research project and personal CRBPO research program (N°: 335, F. Angelier) including blood sampling authorizations (Comité d'Ethique Poitou Charentes, N°: CE2013‐3). We also thank A. Meillère and P. Fiquet for helping with ringer recruitment for this project. We thank S. Hope and G. Names for correcting the English. Financial support was provided by the Fyssen foundation (grant to F. Angelier), by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR project Urbastress to F. Angelier, ANR‐16‐CE02‐0004‐01), by the CPER ECONAT, and by the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.</p>
