 <div class="title">Model-averaged predicted seasonal occurrence probability of thrushes depending on green ground vegetation cover and month.</div>
 <p>(A) March. (B) June. (C) September. (D) December. Selection of green cover by thrushes significantly varied between seasons (months) at the field scale. The four months were selected because they reflect the greatest changes in habitat selection along the annual cycle. 95%-Bayesian credible intervals are depicted by different coloured belts representing contrasted selection patterns. Circles represent raw data of the entire year. Occurrence probabilities greater than 0.5 indicate selection or preference whereas values lower than 0.5 should be interpreted as avoidance, relative to the other available habitats [
