 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A parcel represents here a vine surface managed in a uniform way, which translates into homogeneous habitat characteristics within that field. It usually displays a different ground vegetation structure as well as a different cultivation mode (e.g. “gobelets” or wires, for a definition see [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref037">37</a>]) from the neighbouring parcels, making parcel delimitation fairly obvious in the field. Whenever a bird was located in a specific vine parcel (meaning on the ground, on a vine plant or flushed from the parcel), the parcel was considered a “presence parcel”. If a bird flock was spread over more than one parcel, we recorded the number of parcels on which birds occurred (multiple presence parcels). We compared each presence parcel (used habitat) to one adjacent “pseudo-absence parcel” (available but unused habitat) [

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170176.g001" href="#pone.0170176.g001">Fig 1B</a>). A pseudo-absence parcel had to be non-used by the same bird species during the same survey. For each observation at the field scale, vegetation structure and vineyard management variables were immediately quantified in the field, both in the presence and in the associated pseudo-absence parcel. Visually estimated ground vegetation structure variables were green cover, brown vegetation cover and mean vegetation height. Vineyard management variables included cultivation mode (gobelets or wires), grape abundance and parcel area. Grape abundance was considered as it may attract frugivores such as thrushes (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given that the quality of a parcel as experienced by the birds might be conditional on semi-natural habitat features in the vicinity, we additionally measured the distance of the presence point locations (red stars in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170176.g001" href="#pone.0170176.g001">Fig 1B</a>) and of random points to the closest landscape structures using GIS ESRI® ArcMap

  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref057">57</a>]; 
  <a rid="pone.0170176.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0170176.t001">Table 1B</a>). More specifically, within each transect buffer zone, we generated as many random points as there were presence points in this buffer zone. Then, each random point was allocated to one presence point in a way to minimize the sum of the distances between random and presence points. The mean and standard deviation of the distances between paired random and presence points were 46.44 ± 32.45 m (range: 1.87–135.05 m). Random points were not forced to lie in the pseudo-absence parcels, because in such a design both random and presence points would mostly be very close to each other, making a potential effect of semi-natural structures very unlikely to be detected.
