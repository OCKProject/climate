 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bird surveys were performed using a line transect sampling method with a cut-off distance of 100 meters on each side (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170176.g001" href="#pone.0170176.g001">Fig 1A</a>). For each of the 10 selected vineyards, one footpath of 1.12 ± 0.10 km (mean ± SE) following the topographic contour lines (whenever possible) was visited twice a month in a randomized order from February 2014 to January 2015, except in April when only 5 transects could be monitored during the second sampling session. During the breeding season (from April to mid-July), surveys only took place between sunrise and 11:00 [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref055">55</a>]. In autumn and winter, sampling was performed between one hour after dawn and one hour before dusk in order to avoid biases caused by birds travelling between feeding and roosting sites [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref033">33</a>]. Surveys only took place under non-adverse weather conditions (no precipitation, no or little wind). Bird counts and habitat characteristics of both actual observation locations (presence) and pseudo-absence locations (see later) were recorded using the application Biolovision v.0.21 (Biolovision SARL, Ardon) on a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy Note 3 SM-N9005, South Korea). Since transects were located on public roads or tracks, no permits were required for bird surveys.

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170176.g001" href="#pone.0170176.g001">Fig 1A</a>) recorded within the area delimited by the 100-m buffer zone around transects, including birds flying relatively close to the ground (ca. ≤ 20 m). Observations of single birds or flocks of a given species were recorded as a single observation point per species. Bird abundance data was summed per species, survey and transect.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A parcel represents here a vine surface managed in a uniform way, which translates into homogeneous habitat characteristics within that field. It usually displays a different ground vegetation structure as well as a different cultivation mode (e.g. “gobelets” or wires, for a definition see [
   <a rid="pone.0170176.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref037">37</a>]) from the neighbouring parcels, making parcel delimitation fairly obvious in the field. Whenever a bird was located in a specific vine parcel (meaning on the ground, on a vine plant or flushed from the parcel), the parcel was considered a “presence parcel”. If a bird flock was spread over more than one parcel, we recorded the number of parcels on which birds occurred (multiple presence parcels). We compared each presence parcel (used habitat) to one adjacent “pseudo-absence parcel” (available but unused habitat) [
   <a rid="pone.0170176.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref056">56</a>] within the 100m-buffer, hence obtaining a paired design (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170176.g001" href="#pone.0170176.g001">Fig 1B</a>). A pseudo-absence parcel had to be non-used by the same bird species during the same survey. For each observation at the field scale, vegetation structure and vineyard management variables were immediately quantified in the field, both in the presence and in the associated pseudo-absence parcel. Visually estimated ground vegetation structure variables were green cover, brown vegetation cover and mean vegetation height. Vineyard management variables included cultivation mode (gobelets or wires), grape abundance and parcel area. Grape abundance was considered as it may attract frugivores such as thrushes (

   <a rid="pone.0170176.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0170176.t001">Table 1B</a>). More specifically, within each transect buffer zone, we generated as many random points as there were presence points in this buffer zone. Then, each random point was allocated to one presence point in a way to minimize the sum of the distances between random and presence points. The mean and standard deviation of the distances between paired random and presence points were 46.44 ± 32.45 m (range: 1.87–135.05 m). Random points were not forced to lie in the pseudo-absence parcels, because in such a design both random and presence points would mostly be very close to each other, making a potential effect of semi-natural structures very unlikely to be detected.
