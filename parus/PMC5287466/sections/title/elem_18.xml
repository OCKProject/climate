 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For pooled species and thrush abundances, species richness and Shannon diversity, grove cover (hedges and woody patches) was the only significant landscape variable occurring in most competitive models (
  <a rid="pone.0170176.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0170176.t002">Table 2A</a>). In all four cases, the effect of grove cover on birds varied according to season (
  <a rid="pone.0170176.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0170176.t002">Table 2B</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170176.g003" href="#pone.0170176.g003">Fig 3</a>). However, notice that after model averaging, the interaction between grove and cosmonth only remained significant for pooled species abundance and Shannon diversity (
  <a rid="pone.0170176.t003" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0170176.t003">Table 3B</a>). Predictions showed a positive effect of increased grove proportion among vineyards for overall bird abundance, thrush abundance, species richness and diversity, with an even stronger positive effect in winter (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170176.g003" href="#pone.0170176.g003">Fig 3</a>). In spite of the very low proportion of groves (mean ± SE: 5.21 ± 3.12% cover per transect), total number of individuals was predicted to at least quadruple in winter (December) whereas it would only increase by a factor of ca. 1.2 in summer (June) with its increase from 0 to 11% (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170176.g003" href="#pone.0170176.g003">Fig 3A</a>). Similarly, species richness would increase by a factor of ca. 2.3 in winter against 1.5 in summer with such a grove proportion enhancement (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170176.g003" href="#pone.0170176.g003">Fig 3C</a>). On the contrary, density of isolated bushes and trees and buildings as well as proportion of natural grassy areas did not have a significant effect (
  <a rid="pone.0170176.t003" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0170176.t003">Table 3A</a>). Furthermore, we did not detect any strong preference of finches for any of the considered landscape variables (“null model” including only the time covariate as best model in

    <span class="italic">Turdus</span> spp. (thrushes). (C) Species richness. (D) Shannon diversity index. The habitat preference for greater grove cover was dependent of season. The two months “June” and “December” were retained for plotting predictions because they reflect the greatest changes in habitat selection between summer and winter (extremes). Shown are model-averaged bird density predictions (per 20 ha) from Poisson regression models (overall habitat selection) with 95%-Bayesian credible intervals (delimited by grey areas). Predicted estimates were allowed to vary with the habitat variable under consideration, while other explanatory variables present in the average model were held constant at their mean values. Circles represent raw data of the entire year.
