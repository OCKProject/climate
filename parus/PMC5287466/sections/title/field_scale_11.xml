 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In field scale analyses, bird occurrence (presence = 1 vs. pseudo-absence = 0 for all species pooled as well as Fringillidae and 
  <span class="italic">Turdus</span> species considered separately) was analysed in relation to the vegetation structure, vineyard management, distances to landscape elements and circular month variables. All explanatory variables were standardized to facilitate model fitting and comparison of effect sizes while checking for collinearity (as above, only the biologically most meaningful of two variables was kept when Spearman |r
  <sub>s</sub>| &gt; 0.7). The same two habitat selection steps as described for the landscape scale were done, but preceded by an additional step due to the larger number of predictors at the field scale compared to the landscape scale; hence the following three steps were conducted:
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, in order to reduce the number of explanatory variables we pre-selected habitat variables. Vineyard management variables and distances to landscape structures showing a trend (
  <span class="italic">P</span> ≤ 0.1) in univariate models were used in the second modelling step. The vegetation structure variables were each tested for the presence of an optimum by including their linear and quadratic effects in a single model, because of a likely trade-off between food abundance (more food in denser vegetation) and accessibility (reduced accessibility in denser vegetation, hence an intermediate vegetation density may be optimal for the birds) [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref024">24</a>]. Quadratic terms were discarded when they met the following two criteria: their 95%-credible intervals included zero and the effect size of the squared effect was smaller than the one of the linear effect. This procedure ensured that no squared effect potentially playing a major role in habitat selection was missed. Linear effects of vegetation structure variables were always included because of their particular interest in this study. These pre-selected variables were then used for the second step. While transect as random effect was suggested to be important at the landscape scale (see above), AICc values and the amount of explained variance suggested to exclude random effects at the field scale. Some random slope models explained up to 6.7% more variance, but mostly the additional variance explained was &lt; 2% and the AICc was always lowest in the model without random effects (ΔAICc &gt; 2).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the second step (corresponding to the first step at the landscape scale), overall habitat preferences were modelled by means of hierarchical logistic regression models (logit-link function) with the random effects ‘transect’ and ‘paired ID’ (identifying pairs of presence and pseudo-absence parcels (for vegetation and management variables) and presence and random points (for distance to landscape structures)). As in the first step of the analysis at the field scale, random effects were not suggested to be important according to AICc and amount of variance explained, neither in the full models, nor in the selected best models (see below). The set of candidate models was created by combining all vegetation structure variables (linear and squared effects retained from the first step) and other variables showing a trend in univariate models in all possible combinations; these models were then ranked according to AICc (using the function ‘dredge’ as for the landscape scale).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Third (corresponding to the second step at the landscape scale), habitat variables occurring in the most parsimonious model (lowest AICc) were investigated for seasonal habitat selection patterns as explained for the landscape scale analyses above. Note that each habitat variable (the linear and, potentially, the quadratic term) was tested individually; e.g. for the pooled species, the most parsimonious model included the predictors green, green
  <span class="sup">2</span> and brown, hence we created two models to test for seasonal effects (one containing green and green
  <span class="sup">2</span>, the other including brown). This approach of partial analyses was adopted because at this stage we were specifically interested in the question whether important habitat variables showed some seasonality in their effect on the outcome variable; including several habitat variables would have led to too many candidate models.
