 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study was carried out in the Rhone river valley in the Canton of Valais (SW Switzerland, 540–780 m a.s.l.). This inner alpine, west-east oriented valley is characterized by a continental climate with little rain, hot summers and cold winters. The south-exposed slopes are dominated by vineyards covering roughly 50 km

  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref037">37</a>] whereas high-intensity fruit tree plantations represent the main agricultural activity on the plain [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref026">26</a>]. Most vineyards in the study area are farmed following the integrated production (IP) protocol involving a reduction in insecticide and acaracide application. Since restriction in herbicide spraying is not mandatory for IP, about 95% of the vine fields still exhibit an almost exclusively mineral appearance due to systematic application of herbicides all over the ground [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref037">37</a>]. Herbicide is applied to limit competition for water between vine plants and ground vegetation, especially under the dry circumstances of Central Valais [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref026">26</a>]. The remaining 5% of the grape production area are still subjected to herbicide application, but only partially, which typically offers a mosaic with ca 50% ground vegetation cover alternating with bare ground patches. This is because most often every second plant row or inter-row is treated to combat ground vegetation. Organic vineyards, where vegetation is allowed to grow over the whole ground surface and where its removal can be performed only mechanically, make up scarcely 2% of the total area [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From February 2014 to January 2015, we surveyed 10 transects evenly distributed between Fully (46°08'43.0"N 7°07'30.5"E) and Leuk (46°19'03.5"N 7°37'59.7"E; see

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170176.g001" href="#pone.0170176.g001">Fig 1A</a>): grove area, natural grassy area, number of isolated bushes and trees as well as number of buildings. Grove is here defined as a surface densely covered with bushes and trees, such as a hedge or a small patch consisting of woody plants. Natural grassy surfaces included surfaces covered with climatic steppe vegetation and grassy vineyard margins. Buildings mainly consisted of sheds among the vineyards. Landscape habitat structures mapped in the field were subsequently quantified into Quantum Geographic Information System version 2.6.1 (QGIS 2015 [
