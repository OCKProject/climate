 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several key findings emerged from this study with respect to the use of vineyards by birds at different spatial scales throughout the year. Overall, bird abundance, species richness and diversity were greater in winter than in summer. At the landscape scale, grove cover (hedges and woody patches) positively influenced bird abundance, species richness and diversity, especially in winter. At the field scale, ground vegetation cover, which undergoes much seasonal variation, appears to constitute the most crucial habitat feature for the avifauna. Finally, bird species-habitat associations also greatly varied according to taxon (thrushes, finches), highlighting the need to consider the distinct resource needs of different guilds if not species, which bears a high relevance for drawing management recommendations for bird-friendly vineyards. While these results originate from only 10 transects and a single region in Switzerland, we are confident that the importance of natural structures and ground vegetation as well as the seasonal variability in habitat selection patterns can be generalized to at least vineyards from other regions [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A higher bird abundance, species richness and diversity in our study area in winter can be explained by two non-mutually exclusive arguments. First, south-exposed slopes devoted to viticulture constitute the first locations released from snow in winter, rendering the soil surface of vine plantations among the most readily accessible foraging sites for birds in adverse, snowy conditions. As noted by Laiolo [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref050">50</a>], woodland birds such as thrushes, chaffinches or great tits 
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span> often look then for weed seeds on the ground and invertebrates in the bark of the vines. Alpine chough 
  <span class="italic">Pyrrhocorax graculus</span>, that make daily movements from the Alpine cliffs to lower elevations in winter, are also attracted by these food sources, exploiting left-over grapes and seeds. Secondly, in winter, many bird species aggregate into larger, intra- and interspecific flocks that move in search for suitable foraging patches [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref032">32</a>]. This social behaviour leads to more numerous and richer bird communities than during the breeding season when birds are territorial.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the fact that our landscape scale analysis relies on only 10 transects while groves were scarce in the matrix (0–11%), these woody structures positively influenced overall bird and thrush abundances, species richness and diversity especially during the winter season. The general preference for grove corroborates earlier findings in a variety of agroecosystems that hedges provide foraging, nesting and sheltering opportunities, as well as song posts for the avifauna [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref001">1</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref071" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref071">71</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref074" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref074">74</a>]. The stronger positive effect of grove in winter might be related to the dominance of forest species which forage in open habitat but rely on woody patches offering sheltering opportunities. Hedges are furthermore known to promote some rare and/or specialist bird species that typically occur among vineyards, such as the cirl bunting 
  <span class="italic">Emberiza cirlus</span> [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref075" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref075">75</a>], the rock bunting 
  <span class="italic">Emberiza cia</span> [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref076" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref076">76</a>] or the red-backed shrike [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref016">16</a>,

  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref073" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref073">73</a>]. However, they are detrimental to open-land species such as the yellow wagtail 
  <span class="italic">Motacilla flava</span> [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref013">13</a>] and the woodlark, which need large open, “homogeneous” habitats void of woody elements [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref052">52</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref077" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref077">77</a>]. Hedgerow structure and composition is also known to affect birds in a species-specific way [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref074" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref074">74</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref078" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref078">78</a>], which might explain why we couldn’t detect any effect of grove presence upon finches at a larger scale. There are pronounced interspecific divergences in the ecological requirements of Fringillidae [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref079" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref079">79</a>] but our dataset was too coarse to model single species responses.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the field scale, an overall seasonal shift in vineyards use by birds was observed with respect to green and brown ground vegetation cover. Vineyards with a green ground vegetation cover of 40–100% were visited more often in winter whereas from spring to late summer birds tended to select parcels with an optimum green ground vegetation cover around 40%, while they avoided 100%-vegetated parcels. The preference for brown ground vegetation cover increased in autumn and winter. The strong winter selection for ground vegetated vineyards is certainly driven by the stock of seeds that are picked up by granivorous birds directly from the weed plants [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref005">5</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref007">7</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref008">8</a>], a preference also detected for overwintering birds in orchards [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref006">6</a>]. Conversely, the spring-summer preference for soils that are only partly covered by vegetation would result from a diet based primarily on ground-dwelling invertebrates (note that a protein-rich food is essential also for chick growth of granivorous bird species) [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref080" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref080">80</a>]. Those ground-dwelling invertebrates are hunted by birds walking among vine rows, which is greatly facilitated by the presence of patches of bare ground [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref037">37</a>]. In this respect, prey accessibility might be as important as prey abundance for determining food availability in terrestrially foraging insectivorous birds. Thus, prey availability during the breeding season would result from a trade-off between invertebrate abundance and accessibility for this category of birds [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref024">24</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref034">34</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref038">38</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Different vegetation structures are selected by ground-foraging bird species according to their foraging strategy [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref035">35</a>]. For instance, thrushes feed principally upon underground-dwelling invertebrates, notably earthworms, although they complete their diet with berries in winter [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref081" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref081">81</a>]. Our projections for thrushes indicate they would avoid vineyards harbouring more than 15% green ground vegetation cover in summer. This is in line with both their basic trophic requirements and the above abundance-accessibility trade-off that drives food resources availability in the warm season in vineyards. The situation is different in winter when 40–100% ground-greened vineyards are preferred by thrush species, probably because vegetation cover determines to a large extent belowground invertebrate communities which might represent a crucial food substitute to berries in late winter. The selection of parcels located next to natural grassy areas might be explained similarly.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For finches, preferred vineyards had ca 60% green ground vegetation cover. Five out of the six species of finches identified in this study are granivores foraging either directly from herbaceous plants or on the ground all over the year; the chaffinch, the sixth species, feeds mainly upon invertebrates in spring-summer but is absent from vineyards during the breeding season [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref032">32</a>]. As a consequence, preference for greater vegetation cover might merely reflect higher seed supply.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Management recommendations and conclusion</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on these results, we first recommend to keep and rehabilitate hedges and patches of woody vegetation beyond the boundaries of the grape production area or between vine parcels, this in order to bolster avian biodiversity at the landscape scale. This is in line with the suggestion by Ceresa et al. [
   <a rid="pone.0170176.ref066" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref066">66</a>] that even a slight increase in grove cover will benefit avian biodiversity. Although this measure is likely to be quite effective in intensively managed vineyard regions presently void of woody structures [

   <a rid="pone.0170176.ref083" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref083">83</a>], if the objective is to ensure the provision of a genuine pest control service by insectivorous birds, then more heterogeneous farmed matrices would be needed [
   <a rid="pone.0170176.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref020">20</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0170176.ref084" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref084">84</a>]. When rehabilitating woody structures, a diverse species composition must be envisioned to provide a broader palette of resources [
   <a rid="pone.0170176.ref077" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref077">77</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another important beneficial measure, to be implemented within the vineyards themselves, is to allow ground vegetation to grow on roughly half of the ground surface, for instance within every second vine row or inter-row. This would represent the best option to sustain bird communities and populations the year-round. Whenever possible, another ideal option would of course be to remove grass mechanically instead of chemically from the «bare ground» row or inter-row, as requested by the organic and biodynamic cultivation protocols. This is because of the potential deleterious effects of herbicide application on plant and invertebrate communities [
   <a rid="pone.0170176.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref041">41</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0170176.ref078" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref078">78</a>], with cascading effects upon avifauna [
   <a rid="pone.0170176.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref053">53</a>], as illustrated for birds in orchards [
   <a rid="pone.0170176.ref085" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref085">85</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0170176.ref086" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref086">86</a>]. Yet, if half of the Valais vineyards would be half-covered by ground vegetation this would already represent an enormous change for biodiversity (currently 95% of the vineyards in the study area have a total mineral appearance due to extensive herbicide treatment [
   <a rid="pone.0170176.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref037">37</a>]).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Boosting biodiversity among vineyards will probably in the future represent an important asset of grape and wine production, notably in terms of ecosystem functioning and service provisioning (e.g. pest control, combatting soil erosion, enhancing soil fertility, etc.) [

   <a rid="pone.0170176.ref087" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref087">87</a>]. Thus, in addition to its intrinsic value for human recreation, the promotion of woody structures and grassy ground cover within and adjacent to vineyard parcels paves the way towards a more sustainable grape and wine industry. Similar issues and solutions might be valid for other agroecosystems, especially for other perennial crops such as orchards [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study confirms that multiple species and scales must be considered when dealing with the sheer complexity inherent to the conservation and restoration of farmland biodiversity.
