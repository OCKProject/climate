 <div class="title">Model-averaged, seasonal relationships between grove cover and bird density at the landscape scale.</div>
 <p>(A) Pooled species. (B) 
  <span class="italic">Turdus</span> spp. (thrushes). (C) Species richness. (D) Shannon diversity index. The habitat preference for greater grove cover was dependent of season. The two months “June” and “December” were retained for plotting predictions because they reflect the greatest changes in habitat selection between summer and winter (extremes). Shown are model-averaged bird density predictions (per 20 ha) from Poisson regression models (overall habitat selection) with 95%-Bayesian credible intervals (delimited by grey areas). Predicted estimates were allowed to vary with the habitat variable under consideration, while other explanatory variables present in the average model were held constant at their mean values. Circles represent raw data of the entire year.
