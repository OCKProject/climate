 <p>(A) Pooled species. (B) 
  <span class="italic">Turdus</span> spp. (thrushes). (C) Fringillidae (finches). (D) Species richness. (E) Shannon diversity. These relationships demonstrate a significant (model-averaged) effect of cosmonth and/or sinmonth on habitat selection (see 
  <a rid="pone.0170176.t003" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0170176.t003">Table 3B</a>). Shown are model-averaged bird density predictions (per 20 ha) from Poisson regression models with 95%-Bayesian credible intervals. The letters on the x-axis stand for the first letter of each month from J: January to D: December.
