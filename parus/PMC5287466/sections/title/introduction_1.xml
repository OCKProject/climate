 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To counteract ongoing farmland biodiversity erosion, a wealth of evidence-based knowledge has been gathered during the last decades about wildlife in agroecosystems. Restoring farmland biodiversity requires information on the ecological requirements of different species at multiple spatial and temporal scales to capture the dynamics and resource needs of entire communities [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref001">1</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref002">2</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To complete their life cycle, birds have to fulfil diverse resource requirements varying between and within seasons. For instance, finding a suitable nesting place in close proximity to good foraging locations for provisioning food to chicks is a challenge commonly faced by parents during reproduction [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref001">1</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref003">3</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref004">4</a>]. In winter, the main issue mostly concerns locating feeding patches offering sufficient food resources, with consequences for survival, especially late in the season when depletion of food supply may cause a “hungry gap”[
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref005">5</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref008">8</a>]. Not only inter-seasonal, but even intra-seasonal shifts in bird-habitat associations involving temporal changes in habitat suitability, food availability or diet have been demonstrated [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref009">9</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref015">15</a>]. As an illustration, Douglas et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref010">10</a>] found that the use of field margins as foraging grounds by yellowhammers 
  <span class="italic">Emberiza citrinella</span> markedly declined with the progress of the season, whilst use of cereal fields augmented, probably as a consequence of impeded food accessibility due to a growing ground vegetation within the field margins.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since resources selection is operated in different habitat types and at different spatial scales to fulfil the crucial ecological requirements that may vary between species, the heterogeneity of the agricultural matrix must be considered at multiple spatial scales [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref016">16</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref018">18</a>]. Increased habitat patchiness is thus known to offer a wider range of resources and to support higher biodiversity than monocultures [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref001">1</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref019">19</a>]. 
  <span class="bold">Landscape-scale heterogeneity</span> mainly affects birds through the proportions of different habitat types present in the overall matrix. Notably, the number of crop types and the relative amounts of woodland, steppe, wetlands strongly influence bird community composition and species richness [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref020">20</a>]. Semi-natural boundary habitats such as field margins, hedges or forest edges are also well recognised to be valuable for birds in case of adequate management [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref001">1</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref021">21</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref022">22</a>]. For example, optimal territories of red-backed shrikes 
  <span class="italic">Lanius collurio</span> seem to harbour around 15–20% hedge cover among extensive mosaics of pasture and cultivation [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref023">23</a>]. 
  <span class="bold">Within fields</span>, sward structure constitutes a key factor for terrestrially-foraging and ground-breeding birds because it dictates both food availability (which is abundance modified by accessibility) and nesting opportunities [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref001">1</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref024">24</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref026">26</a>]. A botanically and structurally (height and cover) diverse sward tends to harbour a higher food abundance and diversity [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref027">27</a>] and makes seeds and invertebrates accessible to a broad range of bird species and foraging guilds [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref001">1</a>]. Massive use of fertilizers has promoted uniformly higher and denser swards, which decreases food diversity, impedes foragers’ mobility, diminishes prey accessibility, and increases (actual or perceived) predation risk [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref028">28</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref030">30</a>], with notorious deleterious effects on population growth rates [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref031">31</a>]. Patches of bare ground among the ground vegetation cover have been associated with higher bird occupancy especially in winter (e.g. [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref032">32</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref035">35</a>]), while an heterogeneous combination of patches of bare ground and vegetation cover appears to be key for terrestrially-feeding insectivorous birds during reproduction, providing support to the view that habitat selection results from a trade-off between food abundance and accessibility, which defines food availability [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref024">24</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref036">36</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref037">37</a>]. Creating undrilled patches in the middle of cereal fields temporally prolongs breeding opportunities for skylarks 
  <span class="italic">Alauda arvensis</span> probably because of enhanced food accessibility for foraging parents [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref038">38</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref039">39</a>]. Hence, habitat selection is scale-dependent and will differ with respect to bird species, underpinning the importance of combining seasonal and spatial information for a better understanding of the actual constraints faced by bird communities occurring in vineyards.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The vegetation structure of vineyards also shows a great geographic and temporal variation with respect to management practice and environmental context. Vineyards can host rare and specialized plant and animal species, especially when they are managed extensively [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref040">40</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref044">44</a>] and/or interspersed with natural elements such as hedgerows and surrounded by dry and warm natural habitat patches [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref042">42</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref045">45</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref049">49</a>]. Viticulture has been shown to be regionally important for birds because it covers large areas, often on naturally biodiversity-rich, south-exposed xeric slopes. Nevertheless, there have been few attempts to study the habitat associations of integral vineyard bird communities on a year-round basis (but see [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref050">50</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref051">51</a>]). In effect, research has been mostly autecological, furthermore focused on the breeding season [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref037">37</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref043">43</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref052">52</a>]. Duarte et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref053">53</a>] demonstrated higher bird abundance, diversity and species richness in mechanically managed, vegetated vineyards compared to mineral and chemically managed viticulture areas, especially for insectivores. In line with these findings, the woodlark 
  <span class="italic">Lullula arborea</span> has been shown to select patchy ground vegetation at the foraging site scale [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref037">37</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we focussed on bird communities occurring in vineyards submitted to a continental climate regime (large variation in conditions between seasons) within a major internal valley in Southwestern Switzerland. We investigated, at two spatial scales, the species-specific habitat associations of multiple bird species that use vineyards as breeding site, as migration stop-over site and as winter habitat. The main emphasis of this study was put on the season-specific effects of habitat characteristics on foraging activities. At the landscape scale, we studied which role marginal, (semi-)natural habitats play for birds within the agricultural matrix. At the field scale, we analysed the importance of ground vegetation structure and vineyard management for birds. By accounting for the broader landscape and assessing circannual variations in habitat selection patterns, our study aims at providing season-specific recommendations for bird-friendly vineyard management both outside and within the production area.</p>
