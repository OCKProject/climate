 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, at both spatial scales, we used model averaging over the set of competitive models (ΔAICc ≤ 2; [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref066" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref066">66</a>]) to estimate coefficients, SE, and p-values for each habitat predictor with the ‘full average’ output from the ‘model.avg’ function (‘MuMIn’ R-package version 1.15.6., [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref065" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref065">65</a>]). Fixed effects always present in the competitive models and/or whose model-averaged p-values were significant were considered to probably influence habitat selection by birds. To get model-averaged predictions (mainly to produce effect plots), we used the Bayesian framework. We drew samples from the joint posterior distributions using the function ‘sim’ (‘arm’ R-package version 1.8–6., [
  <a rid="pone.0170176.ref069" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170176.ref069">69</a>]). The number of samples per joint posterior (i.e. per model, since there is one joint posterior per model) was proportional to the model weights as suggested by Burnham &amp; Anderson 2002. This procedure returns model-averaged posterior distributions for fitted values, which were used to draw effect plots (the mean of the posterior was used as the best fitting line and a 95% interval to depict the uncertainty of the prediction) [
