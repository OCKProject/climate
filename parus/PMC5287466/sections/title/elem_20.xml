 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall habitat selection (pooled species) for ground vegetation cover significantly differed across seasons (Tables 
  <a rid="pone.0170176.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0170176.t002">2D</a> and 
  <a rid="pone.0170176.t003" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0170176.t003">3D</a>). Regarding the green ground vegetation cover, monthly projections for habitat use displayed two distinct selection patterns: in winter (November-March) bird occurrence probability increased linearly with ground vegetation cover, reaching a plateau at around 50%, with parcels covered by &lt; ca 15% green ground vegetation cover being clearly avoided (graphs with blue belts in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170176.g004" href="#pone.0170176.g004">Fig 4A–4C, 4K and 4L</a>). During spring and until late summer (May-September) the pattern was, in contrast, curvilinear, with birds showing a preference for intermediate green ground vegetation cover with an optimum around 15–60%, peaking at ca 40% (see red belts in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170176.g004" href="#pone.0170176.g004">Fig 4E–4I</a>). The habitat preference curves shifted gradually and smoothly from one type to the other (see in April and October, i.e. at the two inter-seasons (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170176.g004" href="#pone.0170176.g004">Fig 4D and 4I</a>). Concerning brown ground vegetation cover, the selection curve significantly changed between summer and winter (Tables 
  <a rid="pone.0170176.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0170176.t002">2D</a> and 
  <a rid="pone.0170176.t003" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0170176.t003">3D</a>), indicating that brown ground vegetation cover was favoured in autumn and winter (September-February; Tables 
  <a rid="pone.0170176.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0170176.t002">2D</a> and

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170176.g005" href="#pone.0170176.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</a>). In March–August the wide credible intervals precluded interpretation (
