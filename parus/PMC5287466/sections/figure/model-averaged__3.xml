  <div class="title">Model-averaged predicted seasonal bird occurrence probability depending on green ground vegetation cover and month.</div>
  <p>From (A) January to (L) December. Selection for green ground vegetation cover by pooled species significantly varied between seasons (months) at the field scale. 95%- Bayesian credible intervals are depicted by different coloured belts representing contrasting selection patterns. Circles represent raw data of the entire year. Occurrence probabilities greater than 0.5 indicate selection or preference whereas values lower than 0.5 should be interpreted as avoidance, relative to the other available habitats [
