  <p>Satellite picture of a typical transect (St-LÃ©onard as an example) surrounded by its arbitrarily defined buffer zone depicting study designs at the two scales considered. (A) Landscape scale with mapped habitat structures. (B) Field scale (B is an excerpt from A): parcels with bird observations depicted by stars (presence data) and parcels with absence of bird observations (pseudo-absence data).
