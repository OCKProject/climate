  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From the overall volunteer monitoring dataset, we obtained 20138 feeding episodes by 120 terrestrial bird species. Among these, we obtained 8903 feeding episodes for the focal 15 resident birds. Feeding episodes were more abundant in winter than in summer, and most abundant in January, followed by February and December, and least abundant in August (
   <a rid="pone.0119324.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0119324.t001">Table 1</a>). Among the 15 target birds, the brown-eared bulbul had the most feeding episodes, followed by the Eurasian tree sparrow and white-cheeked starling (
   <a rid="pone.0119324.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0119324.t001">Table 1</a>). The proportion of unidentified dietary items during all feeding episodes varied greatly among the 15 birds, ranging from 6.2% for the brown-eared bulbul to 87.2% for the Japanese pygmy woodpecker (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ROPs derived from the monitoring data exhibited interspecific and seasonal variations (
   <a rid="pone.0119324.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0119324.g002">Fig. 2</a>), although unidentified dietary items comprised large parts of the feeding episodes for some birds (
   <a rid="pone.0119324.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0119324.t001">Table 1</a>). In general, the items categorized as “seed”, “fleshy fruit”, or “invertebrate” comprised large parts of the bird diets among their identified feeding items. Noticeable seasonal dietary shifts from vegetable materials (mainly “seed” and “fleshy fruit”) to animal diets (mainly “invertebrate”) were detected in many bird species. We found significant differences within the proportions of the five animal diets within the total bird diets (these being invertebrates, birds, fishes, amphibians plus reptiles, and mammals) between the breeding season (from April to September) and the wintering season (from October to March) for 12 out of the 15 target bird species (
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05, one-side Chi-square tests). This trend was particularly obvious in small passerines (e.g., meadow bunting and Japanese white-eye), but the degree was variable between species. By contrast, some birds such as the gray-capped greenfinch and Oriental turtle dove did not exhibit this seasonal shift (one-side Chi-square tests; 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.50 and 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.18, respectively), and they utilized vegetable diets constantly. The shrike also utilized animals constantly as its main diet (
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.09). Vertebrate prey (“amphibian and reptile”, “bird”, and “mammal”) were detected only in two crows, a shrike, a bulbul, and a starling. Human-derived foods comprised part of the diets of two crows and a few birds. In the bulbul and white-eye, flowers comprised large parts of their diet between winter and spring (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The compositions of the foraging locations also varied among bird species and seasons (
   <a rid="pone.0119324.g003" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0119324.g003">Fig. 3</a>). The results showed that some birds were ground-feeders, such as the sparrow, starling, dove, crows, and shrike, whereas others were tree-feeders, such as the bulbul, white-eye, woodpecker, varied tit, and long-tailed tit. The sparrow, great tit, greenfinch, and bunting utilized high herb plants to some degree. For some birds such as the bulbul, woodpecker, great tit, and varied tit, the proportions of foraging on the ground had a tendency to increase from the breeding seasons to the wintering seasons (one-side Chi-square tests,

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The MOPs estimated using Bayesian modeling (
   <a rid="pone.0119324.g004" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0119324.g004">Fig. 4</a>) were generally similar to the results of the ROPs (
   <a rid="pone.0119324.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0119324.g002">Fig. 2</a>), although there were some differences for the birds with large numbers of unidentified items. Overall, the unidentified items tended to be assigned to the items “invertebrate” or “seed.” A major difference in the MOPs compared with the ROPs was the remarkable increase in the vegetative diets of birds, such as the Japanese woodpecker, meadow bunting, and great tit. In these birds, large parts of the unidentified feeding episodes were assigned to “seed” or “fleshy fruit.” By contrast, the unidentified episodes were largely assigned to vegetative diets for the Oriental greenfinch and Oriental turtle dove, which was mainly consistent with their ROPs.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparisons with published stomach analysis data</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each dietary item, we compared the two types of original monitoring data (ROPs and MOPs) with literature-based data (CPs) for eight birds (
   <a rid="pone.0119324.g005" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0119324.g005">Fig. 5</a>). The relationships differed among dietary items and the types of monitoring data (
   <a rid="pone.0119324.g005" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0119324.g005">Fig. 5</a>). In general, there was a positive relationship between monitoring data and stomach analysis data. This relationship was strengthened more when using MOPs (shown by the red marks in 
   <a rid="pone.0119324.g005" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0119324.g005">Fig. 5</a>) rather than ROPs. Root mean square differences were smaller between MOPs and CPs than between ROPs and CPs for the 8 of the 9 dietary items, except fish (
   <a rid="pone.0119324.g005" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0119324.g005">Fig. 5</a>). For seeds, the ROPs were smaller than the proportions obtained in the stomach analysis data; however, these differences became smaller for the MOPs (
   <a rid="pone.0119324.g005" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0119324.g005">Fig. 5B</a>: root mean square difference; ROP = 5.18 vs MOP = 4.95). For the other two plant diets (flowers and leaves), the proportions of the monitoring data greatly exceeded those in the published studies (
   <a rid="pone.0119324.g005" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0119324.g005">Fig. 5D, E</a>). This trend was more obvious in the items from the four vertebrate diets (
   <a rid="pone.0119324.g005" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0119324.g005">Fig. 5F-I</a>). The vertebrate items comprised a very low proportion in the stomach analysis, whereas the proportions from the monitoring data were much higher.
