 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We analyzed the data obtained through volunteer monitoring by the members of the Kanagawa Branch of the Wild Bird Society of Japan between 1977 and 2006 [
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref034">34</a>]. The analyzed data comprised a collection of field observation records, which the members of the branch throughout the prefecture voluntarily documented and sent as paper cards or Microsoft Excel files to the branch office, according to the designated format of the branch. Each observation described the date, location, bird species, number of individuals, bird behavior (e.g., foraging, singing, nesting, and intraspecific and interspecific conflicts), and site environments (e.g., natural forest, urban area, riverbed, and rice field). During the 29-year period, the total number of observers was about 2200, and the total numbers of observation records comprised about 180000 episodes for 380 bird species. In addition, the specific regional observers (currently about 40 members) were obliged to report at least one episode for an observed bird species per month within their own responsible regional blocks (a total of 104 blocks within the prefecture) [
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref033">33</a>] where they were encouraged to describe the avian behaviors in as much detail as possible. In our previous analysis [
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref035">35</a>], we confirmed that the observation effort was equivalent for most bird species and the number of records of bird species in the overall dataset was generally proportional to the emergence rate of birds in the prefecture. This emergence rate of a bird is based on 1560 line censuses, which were conducted on a monthly basis by members of the branch at the 13 routes between 1999 and 2008, independent of focal monitoring. The emergence rate of a bird was calculated as the total number of the censuses that recorded the observation of the bird divided by the total number of the censuses, i.e., 1560.
