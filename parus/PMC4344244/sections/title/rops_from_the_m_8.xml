 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each bird species, we pooled all the feeding episodes across years and divided them by months, and we then calculated the monthly proportion for each of the 11 dietary item categories. We refer to these proportions as the ROPs for the items. Similarly, we calculated the monthly proportions of foraging locations for each bird species.</p>
