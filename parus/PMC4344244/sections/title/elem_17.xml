  <a rid="pone.0119324.g004" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0119324.g004">Fig. 4</a>) were generally similar to the results of the ROPs (
  <a rid="pone.0119324.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0119324.g002">Fig. 2</a>), although there were some differences for the birds with large numbers of unidentified items. Overall, the unidentified items tended to be assigned to the items “invertebrate” or “seed.” A major difference in the MOPs compared with the ROPs was the remarkable increase in the vegetative diets of birds, such as the Japanese woodpecker, meadow bunting, and great tit. In these birds, large parts of the unidentified feeding episodes were assigned to “seed” or “fleshy fruit.” By contrast, the unidentified episodes were largely assigned to vegetative diets for the Oriental greenfinch and Oriental turtle dove, which was mainly consistent with their ROPs.
