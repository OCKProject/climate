 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ROPs derived from the monitoring data exhibited interspecific and seasonal variations (
  <a rid="pone.0119324.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0119324.g002">Fig. 2</a>), although unidentified dietary items comprised large parts of the feeding episodes for some birds (
  <a rid="pone.0119324.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0119324.t001">Table 1</a>). In general, the items categorized as “seed”, “fleshy fruit”, or “invertebrate” comprised large parts of the bird diets among their identified feeding items. Noticeable seasonal dietary shifts from vegetable materials (mainly “seed” and “fleshy fruit”) to animal diets (mainly “invertebrate”) were detected in many bird species. We found significant differences within the proportions of the five animal diets within the total bird diets (these being invertebrates, birds, fishes, amphibians plus reptiles, and mammals) between the breeding season (from April to September) and the wintering season (from October to March) for 12 out of the 15 target bird species (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05, one-side Chi-square tests). This trend was particularly obvious in small passerines (e.g., meadow bunting and Japanese white-eye), but the degree was variable between species. By contrast, some birds such as the gray-capped greenfinch and Oriental turtle dove did not exhibit this seasonal shift (one-side Chi-square tests; 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.50 and 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.18, respectively), and they utilized vegetable diets constantly. The shrike also utilized animals constantly as its main diet (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.09). Vertebrate prey (“amphibian and reptile”, “bird”, and “mammal”) were detected only in two crows, a shrike, a bulbul, and a starling. Human-derived foods comprised part of the diets of two crows and a few birds. In the bulbul and white-eye, flowers comprised large parts of their diet between winter and spring (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The compositions of the foraging locations also varied among bird species and seasons (
  <a rid="pone.0119324.g003" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0119324.g003">Fig. 3</a>). The results showed that some birds were ground-feeders, such as the sparrow, starling, dove, crows, and shrike, whereas others were tree-feeders, such as the bulbul, white-eye, woodpecker, varied tit, and long-tailed tit. The sparrow, great tit, greenfinch, and bunting utilized high herb plants to some degree. For some birds such as the bulbul, woodpecker, great tit, and varied tit, the proportions of foraging on the ground had a tendency to increase from the breeding seasons to the wintering seasons (one-side Chi-square tests, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01).
