 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each dietary item, we compared the two types of original monitoring data (ROPs and MOPs) with literature-based data (CPs) for eight birds (
  <a rid="pone.0119324.g005" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0119324.g005">Fig. 5</a>). The relationships differed among dietary items and the types of monitoring data (
  <a rid="pone.0119324.g005" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0119324.g005">Fig. 5</a>). In general, there was a positive relationship between monitoring data and stomach analysis data. This relationship was strengthened more when using MOPs (shown by the red marks in 
  <a rid="pone.0119324.g005" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0119324.g005">Fig. 5</a>) rather than ROPs. Root mean square differences were smaller between MOPs and CPs than between ROPs and CPs for the 8 of the 9 dietary items, except fish (
  <a rid="pone.0119324.g005" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0119324.g005">Fig. 5</a>). For seeds, the ROPs were smaller than the proportions obtained in the stomach analysis data; however, these differences became smaller for the MOPs (
  <a rid="pone.0119324.g005" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0119324.g005">Fig. 5B</a>: root mean square difference; ROP = 5.18 vs MOP = 4.95). For the other two plant diets (flowers and leaves), the proportions of the monitoring data greatly exceeded those in the published studies (
  <a rid="pone.0119324.g005" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0119324.g005">Fig. 5D, E</a>). This trend was more obvious in the items from the four vertebrate diets (
  <a rid="pone.0119324.g005" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0119324.g005">Fig. 5F-I</a>). The vertebrate items comprised a very low proportion in the stomach analysis, whereas the proportions from the monitoring data were much higher.

   <p>The Y values with black markers indicate ROPs and those with red markers indicate MOPs. Note that ROPs were recalculated after excluding the proportions of unidentified episodes (i.e., black portions in 
    <a rid="pone.0119324.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0119324.g002">Fig. 2</a>). The marker shapes correspond to bird species: circle, bulbul; upward triangle, sparrow; cross, large-billed crow; x-mark, carrion crow; diamond, shrike; downward triangle, magpie; square with x-mark, bunting; asterisk, greenfinch. For each diet item, root mean square differences (RMSDs) between ROPs and CPs are presented in black fonts, and those between MOPs and CPs are presented in red fonts.
