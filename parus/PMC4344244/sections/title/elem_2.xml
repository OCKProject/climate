  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study was conducted in lowland areas of Kanagawa Prefecture, central Japan (35°13′ N to 35°67′ N, 138°92′ E to 139°80′ E; 2416 km
   <span class="sup">2</span>). The area has a temperate climate with a mean annual rainfall of about 1600 mm and a mean annual temperature of about 16°C. Temperate forest comprises about 40% of the overall prefectural area, followed by urban areas and farmland. More detailed information is provided in a previous study [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analysis of the volunteer monitoring data was permitted by Mr. Shigeya Suzuki, a chief of the Kanagawa Branch of the Wild Bird Society of Japan on June 9, 2012. This volunteer monitoring did not involve the capture and breeding of wild birds; thus, no approval was required for animal care and use.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Monitoring dataset and the target bird species</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We analyzed the data obtained through volunteer monitoring by the members of the Kanagawa Branch of the Wild Bird Society of Japan between 1977 and 2006 [
   <a rid="pone.0119324.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref034">34</a>]. The analyzed data comprised a collection of field observation records, which the members of the branch throughout the prefecture voluntarily documented and sent as paper cards or Microsoft Excel files to the branch office, according to the designated format of the branch. Each observation described the date, location, bird species, number of individuals, bird behavior (e.g., foraging, singing, nesting, and intraspecific and interspecific conflicts), and site environments (e.g., natural forest, urban area, riverbed, and rice field). During the 29-year period, the total number of observers was about 2200, and the total numbers of observation records comprised about 180000 episodes for 380 bird species. In addition, the specific regional observers (currently about 40 members) were obliged to report at least one episode for an observed bird species per month within their own responsible regional blocks (a total of 104 blocks within the prefecture) [
   <a rid="pone.0119324.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref033">33</a>] where they were encouraged to describe the avian behaviors in as much detail as possible. In our previous analysis [
   <a rid="pone.0119324.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref035">35</a>], we confirmed that the observation effort was equivalent for most bird species and the number of records of bird species in the overall dataset was generally proportional to the emergence rate of birds in the prefecture. This emergence rate of a bird is based on 1560 line censuses, which were conducted on a monthly basis by members of the branch at the 13 routes between 1999 and 2008, independent of focal monitoring. The emergence rate of a bird was calculated as the total number of the censuses that recorded the observation of the bird divided by the total number of the censuses, i.e., 1560.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Classification of dietary items and the foraging locations of birds</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using all of the observation records, we first extracted all records related to foraging by birds, which were obtained from lowland areas (&lt;500 m altitude) of the prefecture, where we excluded highly urbanized areas and seashores. Next, by probing the descriptions in each of those records, we determined a recorded dietary item and foraging location for each record. The dietary items were classified into 11 categories [seed, fleshy fruit, flower, leaf and bud, invertebrate (including insect, spider, and earthworm), fish, amphibian and reptile, bird, mammal, man-made food (e.g., food waste), and unidentified]. We excluded a very few feeding episodes of uncertain plant or animal materials. For each report, the vertical foraging locations were also determined and classified according to the following 10 categories: ground, puddle, tree, tree trunk, tall grass, short grass, bush, in the air (fly catching), man-made structure (e.g., house roof), and unidentified. The foraging location was defined as the place where the bird caught the dietary item directly. Therefore, if a report only described the location where a bird was handling or processing a dietary item, we treated its foraging location as “unidentified.” In some cases, several dietary items and locations were described in one report, which we separated into different episodes. In the further analysis, we excluded observation records from artificial bird feeders and reports that lacked information on dietary items and foraging locations. In this study, we targeted 15 common, terrestrial resident bird species from 12 families, as shown in 
   <a rid="pone.0119324.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0119324.t001">Table 1</a>. We selected these species because they had large numbers of feeding episodes, which were sufficient to estimate their dietary compositions.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To calculate MOPs, we estimated the expected foraging frequency of each dietary item while considering the existence of “unidentified items” in our data. Our approach to identifying the “unidentified items” was to utilize the relationship between dietary items and foraging locations in the feeding episodes with identified items. We assumed that bird species were observed to forage dietary items at each location randomly with the same probability (by multinomial distributions, i.e., generalization of usual binomial distributions) in both identified and unidentified items. This assumption is marginally too simple but valid because foraging locations are one of the major cause of the variation in the identifiability of dietary items.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our modeling, we also assumed that expected foraging frequencies were seasonally auto-correlated, i.e., foraging frequency in 1 month was similar to that in neighboring months for each dietary item of each bird species. Introducing the seasonal autocorrelation reduced the bias due to low numbers of observations in some months. We did not assume that the magnitudes of seasonal autocorrelation vary from month to month. Because our analysis used a coarse temporal scale, the change of magnitude of seasonal autocorrelation is likely to introduce relatively little bias to our estimation of the expected foraging frequencies.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All of our Bayesian analyses were conducted using the R software suite (version 3.02 [
   <a rid="pone.0119324.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref037">37</a>]) and Just another Gibbs Sampler 3.3.0 [
   <a rid="pone.0119324.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref038">38</a>]. We used informative prior for all estimated parameters (see 
   <a rid="pone.0119324.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0119324.s001">S1 Appendix</a> for details). We calculated monthly MOPs of each dietary item after rounding the estimated frequency to an integer.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stomach analysis data from previous studies</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To examine the validity of the dietary compositions estimated from the monitoring data, we compared these results with the stomach analysis data for birds reported in previous studies of Japanese birds. We collected all the available quantitative dietary data regarding the target birds within the Japanese Archipelago using the following procedures. First, we checked all of the relevant studies in the main ornithological journals of Japan, including Tori (1915–1986), Japanese Journal of Ornithology (1986–2014), Ornithological Science (2002–2014), Strix (1982–2014), Bird Research (2005–2014), Journal of Yamashina Institute of Ornithology (1952–2014), and Bulletin of Applied Ornithology (1980–1990). We also checked agricultural bulletins published between the 1910s and 1950s by the Japanese Ministries of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. In addition, we checked other studies in some cases by tracing citations within the literatures. Next, we selected the studies that included quantitative dietary information related to the focal birds. We focused on stomach analysis data because the selected studies were based almost exclusively on individual-based stomach analysis, apart from a very low number of studies based on direct observations or pellet analysis. In general, these stomach analysis studies used a format that listed a bird species, sample number, sampling location, detected dietary items, and their count numbers (or weights in very few studies), although some studies pooled the results from several individuals in the same month.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the comparison, we focused on the following eight bird species because abundant monitoring and literature data were available: sparrow, bulbul, two crows, greenfinch, magpie, shrike, and bunting (
   <a rid="pone.0119324.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0119324.t001">Table 1</a>). Based on published reports, we calculated the monthly count proportion (CP) for each item. The CP for an item was calculated as the total number of the item detected (pooling across bird individuals from all previous studies) in a month divided by the total number of all items in the same month. The number of parts of plant items (seeds, fruits, flowers, and leaves) and the number of individuals for animal items (invertebrate, bird, fish, amphibian and reptile, and mammal) were counted. When a detected item was uncountable (e.g., resolved or ground after heavy digestion), we counted it as one. Next, for each dietary item, we compared the monthly proportions of the item based on the ROP and the stomach analysis data. In this monthly comparison, we only used the bird—month combinations with more than four individual specimens in the stomach analysis data. To assess the fits between the two types of monitoring-based proportions and the proportions based on the stomach analysis, we calculated root mean square difference between ROPs and CPs, and that between MOPs and CPs. This statistic measures the gap between the two values; a larger value indicates a larger gap.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Note that these stomach analysis-based proportions were also biased in several ways. First, as mentioned earlier, the estimated compositions were inevitably biased due to the variation in diet mode and digestibility. Second, the selected studies only presented the number of each dietary item detected (e.g., the numbers of individual insects or animal species, and the numbers of seed grains or fruits) for each bird. Therefore, the dietary compositions obtained were considerably different from the actual compositions based on the volume, weight, or energy intake. Third, the samples for the stomach analysis were from various localities. Because these sample locations were scattered within the Japanese Archipelago for many of the target bird species, this is expected to average (and offset) the possible bias of locality, and be comparable to the monitoring-based results in Kanagawa Prefecture in central Japan. However, as for the Eurasian tree sparrow, a considerable proportion of the samples were collected from northern parts of Japan, which may cause some bias.</p>
