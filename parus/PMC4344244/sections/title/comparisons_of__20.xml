 <div class="title">Comparisons of the monthly count proportions (CPs) based on the stomach analyses (
  <span class="italic">x</span>-axis) and the monthly observation proportions derived from the monitoring data (
  <span class="italic">y</span>-axis) for each of the 9 dietary categories.

 <p>The Y values with black markers indicate ROPs and those with red markers indicate MOPs. Note that ROPs were recalculated after excluding the proportions of unidentified episodes (i.e., black portions in 
  <a rid="pone.0119324.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0119324.g002">Fig. 2</a>). The marker shapes correspond to bird species: circle, bulbul; upward triangle, sparrow; cross, large-billed crow; x-mark, carrion crow; diamond, shrike; downward triangle, magpie; square with x-mark, bunting; asterisk, greenfinch. For each diet item, root mean square differences (RMSDs) between ROPs and CPs are presented in black fonts, and those between MOPs and CPs are presented in red fonts.
