 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Birds have diversified their food habits during their evolutionary histories [
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref001">1</a>]. Determining a bird’s dietary composition and its seasonal shifts are fundamental for understanding the ecology and evolution of a species [
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref002">2</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref004">4</a>], because they are the basic determinants of its niche and are deeply associated with crucial life events such as breeding and migration. Information about the dietary compositions of birds is also essential for understanding the relationships between birds and other organisms, as well as the various ecological functions they play in ecosystems [
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref005">5</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref007">7</a>]. For example, they can act as insect predators, thereby affecting insect populations and their dietary plants [
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref008">8</a>], facilitate plant reproduction as mutualistic seed dispersers [
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref009">9</a>] or pollinators [
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref010">10</a>], and deter plant reproduction as antagonistic predators of seeds and flowers [
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref011">11</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref012">12</a>]. Thus, quantitative evaluations of bird diets are necessary to understand the structure and behavior of food webs or interaction networks.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite its fundamental importance, it is generally difficult to determine the dietary compositions of birds. Various methods have been used to estimate dietary compositions, which have their own advantages and disadvantages [
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref004">4</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref013">13</a>]. Stomach analysis is a powerful method for obtaining estimates [
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref014">14</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref015">15</a>], but is usually destructive for individual birds, and it is biased owing to variation in the diet mode and digestibility [
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref013">13</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref016">16</a>]. Analyses of dung or pellets are simple methods, but they are also biased because of variability in the digestibility of food items [
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref017">17</a>]. Stable isotope analysis may allow us to estimate the trophic positions of species in a food web [
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref018">18</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref020">20</a>], but it is difficult to identify prey species definitively and prior knowledge of the diet of the target species is needed for ecological interpretation. Recent developments in DNA barcoding allow us to determine diet items directly and can detect otherwise undetected items [
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref021">21</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref022">22</a>]; however, it is still difficult to obtain quantitative estimates (but see [
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref023">23</a>]). Therefore, it is essential to integrate dietary information obtained by several methods for appropriate evaluations of bird diets and their ecological functions [
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref007">7</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref017">17</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref024">24</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Direct observation is a simplistic and primitive method for estimating dietary composition of birds [
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref025">25</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref026">26</a>] and does not require specialized instruments and technical analysis, other than a pair of binoculars or a telescope, and is thus viable for non-professional naturalists. This method is less invasive than other methods such as stomach analysis, and thereby applicable for study of threatened species. This method also can provide us the information on actual foraging behavior and location of the birds, which are essential for understanding their complete foraging ecology, and can guide more comprehensive analysis by other methods. However, this method has the disadvantage of being time consuming, and it is biased owing to variation in the detectability and identifiability of food items [
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref016">16</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref027">27</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here we have developed a method of overcoming the disadvantages of direct observation, by combining the method with a citizen science approach and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. Citizen science is increasingly recognized as an important approach in ornithological research [
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref028">28</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref029">29</a>], and is used mainly for monitoring the broad-scale spatial distributions of birds and long-term changes in their populations [
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref030">30</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref031">31</a>]. The monitoring data produced by citizen scientists have been applied to a limited extent to elucidate some aspects of bird life histories such as breeding [
  <a rid="pone.0119324.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0119324.ref032">32</a>]. However, these data also have the potential to provide information about various other aspects of bird biology and ecology, including their dietary compositions. Direct observations and records of avian feeding by a large numbers of volunteers could overcome the time-consuming nature of this method and provide sufficient material to evaluate dietary compositions, although we should consider and address the possible biases and limitations of this method.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we examined the possibility of using long-term volunteer monitoring data as a source of dietary information for 15 resident bird species from 12 families in Japan. The data were a collection from field observations, which were conducted and reported by volunteers of regional naturalist groups in Kanagawa Prefecture, central Japan. Based on these monitoring data, we calculated two types of dietary compositions for each bird species: “raw observation proportions” (ROPs) and “model-aided observation proportions” (MOPs). The ROPs were simply calculated from the identified observations, but the MOPs also considered the bias of unidentified observations using Bayesian models with additional information related to foraging locations. To examine the validity of these two types of dietary compositions estimated from the volunteer monitoring data, we compared the results with the dietary information obtained for focal birds based on stomach analysis methods, which were reported by previous studies. Finally, we characterized the results produced by these two different methods, and we discussed the potentials and limitations of each method for producing better evaluations of avian diets.</p>
