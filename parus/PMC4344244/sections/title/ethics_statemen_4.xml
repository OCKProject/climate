 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analysis of the volunteer monitoring data was permitted by Mr. Shigeya Suzuki, a chief of the Kanagawa Branch of the Wild Bird Society of Japan on June 9, 2012. This volunteer monitoring did not involve the capture and breeding of wild birds; thus, no approval was required for animal care and use.</p>
