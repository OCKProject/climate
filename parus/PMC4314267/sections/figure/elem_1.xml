  <p>Interactions between (A) egg-laying date (ELD) and the number of days with ≥10 mm of rain during the second half of the nestling period on fledging success (number of fledged young per egg laid), and (B) the number of chicks fledged and the number of days with rain during the entire nestling period on male parental survival. For fledging success, the solid line with dark gray shading represents early breeders (20% quantile; ELD = 10); the dashed line with light gray shading is later breeders (80% quantile; ELD = 21). For male parental survival, the solid line is for nests that fledged a large number of young (80% quantile; fledglings = 6), while the dashed line is for nests with fewer offspring fledged (20% quantile; fledglings = 3). Lines are model predictions with their associated 95% CIs from the respective highest ranked model in Table
