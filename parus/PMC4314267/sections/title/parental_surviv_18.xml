 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For parents, the energetically most demanding period during breeding is when feeding nestlings (Moreno and Hillström 
  <a rid="b33" ref-type="bibr" href="#b33">1992</a>; Newton 
  <a rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" href="#b36">1998</a>) and any factor affecting nestling food provisioning effort may thus affect subsequent parental survival. As prey items become more difficult to find, parents may be forced to increase the time spent foraging and cover greater distances during foraging bouts to avoid starvation of their chicks (Low et al. 
  <a rid="b26" ref-type="bibr" href="#b26">2010</a>), and by increasing investment in their offspring, they may also compromise their own needs (Nilsson 
  <a rid="b37" ref-type="bibr" href="#b37">2002</a>) and get less food for themselves (Markman et al. 
  <a rid="b28" ref-type="bibr" href="#b28">2002</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analyses suggest that parental survival in males was more sensitive than females to the effects of increased rainfall during the period of nestling care. Radford et al. (
  <a rid="b44" ref-type="bibr" href="#b44">2001</a>) showed that female great tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) increased the time spent brooding during rainfall and that this increase accounted for the entire reduction in visitation rates. In the wheatear, only females brood (Conder 
  <a rid="b11" ref-type="bibr" href="#b11">1989</a>) and wheatear females are likely to reduce visitation rates due to increased brooding during adverse weather conditions. This could explain why female parental survival was not reduced when there was more rainfall and at the same time explain why male parental survival should be linked to number of days with rain especially during the first nestling stage (Tables
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a> and 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl2" href="#tbl2">2</a>). As female brooding of nestlings takes place mainly during the early nestling period (chick age ≤5 days; Conder 
  <a rid="b11" ref-type="bibr" href="#b11">1989</a>), increased brooding due to adverse weather may force males to increase their effort to compensate for the reduced provisioning rates of females.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The interaction between rainfall and number of fledged young (Fig.
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">2B</a>) showed that the negative effect of rainfall on male parental survival increased during complete nest failure as compared to successfully fledging young. This was in contrast to our expectation based on the assumption that effort increases with the number of fledglings produced. However, male reproductive effort may be more closely linked to adverse weather conditions than to the number of fledglings produced, especially if the conditions are so bad that the brood is largely reduced or the breeding attempt fails completely. This is because males not only may have to compensate for female reduction in nestling food provisioning; they have to do that in the worst conditions. Thus, the relationship between male parental survival and the number of offspring fledged may largely arise from the fact that high-quality males in good condition can fledge offspring and subsequently survive, while males in poorer condition are more likely to fail at both tasks. Breeding failures were linked to amount of rainfall (data not shown) and a combination of rain and failure likely reflected extremely poor conditions for foraging and nestling food provisioning. We suggest that the effects of rain on male parental survival could be driven by a sexual difference in parental duties during adverse weather conditions. Detailed data on male and female food provisioning rates in relation to rainfall and reproductive parameters could test this hypothesis.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study adds to our knowledge of weather effects on individual fitness by showing that (1) rain during the nestling stage not only relates to fledging success but may also have long-term effects on subsequent juvenile (as measured by recruitment success) and parental survival, (2) rainfall may have different effects on reproductive output and survival depending on when in the nestling stage it rains, and (3) the effect of rainfall is more marked among early than late breeders. In the northern temperate region, climate change scenarios indicate an increasing number of days of heavy rain, greater weather variability, and occurrence of extreme weather events in the future (IPCC 
  <a rid="b19" ref-type="bibr" href="#b19">2013</a>). Our results stress that knowledge of weather effects other than temperature on multiple vital rates are crucial if we want to understand or predict population responses to future climate change.
