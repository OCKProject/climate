 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because rainfall may affect reproduction and survival differently depending on the energetic requirements of the nestlings (see Introduction), we divided the nestling period into two periods based on growth curves for wheatear nestlings (Conder 
  <a rid="b11" ref-type="bibr" href="#b11">1989</a>) and expected development of thermoregulation for altricial species (Whittow 
  <a rid="b61" ref-type="bibr" href="#b61">2000</a>): (1) 0–7 days old; chicks are small but growing, ectothermic and highly dependent on brooding by the female, (2) 8–15 days old; increasing ability to thermoregulate and developing feathers covering most of the body after day 11 and onwards. After 8 days, nestlings likely reach the peak of their energy demand resulting from endothermic thermoregulation and growth and size (combination of high growth and larger body size requiring high energy for basal metabolism, see Low et al. 
  <a rid="b27" ref-type="bibr" href="#b27">2012</a>). Because young wheatears are also dependent on food provisioned by the parents during about 2 weeks after fledging, we also included a third period when fledged young were 16–25 days old.
