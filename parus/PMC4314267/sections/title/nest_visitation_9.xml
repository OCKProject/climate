 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The number of feeding visits per hour was measured for 39 nests between 2007 and 2010 by data-loggers fitted into the entrance hole of the nest, recording all movements by parents in and out of the nest (for further details on the method, see Low et al. 
  <a rid="b25" ref-type="bibr" href="#b25">2008</a>). We derived a base model from Low et al. (
  <a rid="b25" ref-type="bibr" href="#b25">2008</a>) who found that nest visitation rates in this population depend on time of day (linked to prey activity) and ambient temperature. We included hour and its quadratic term, but as the mean hourly temperature closely follows the diurnal nest visitation pattern (Low et al. 
  <a rid="b25" ref-type="bibr" href="#b25">2008</a>), we did not include mean hourly temperature in the base model. We included nestling age and its quadratic term in the base model to account for age-dependent feeding visit rates. Because data were over-dispersed (over-dispersion = 7.5), we included an id-variable containing unique numbers for each observation (i.e., number of visits/hour) as a random factor. We also included nest identity as a random factor to account for dependencies within nests. We used generalized linear mixed models with a Poisson error distribution and a log link function. To investigate whether rainfall across the entire day (i.e., daily rainfall) or rainfall during preceding days affected nest visitation rates, we set up five candidate models including the base model (see above), and models including separately daily rainfall, amount of rainfall one the day before the day of visitation, over the 2 days before, and over the 3 days before. The latter three models also included daily rainfall on the day of visitation. We assessed these by AIC values and AIC weights.
