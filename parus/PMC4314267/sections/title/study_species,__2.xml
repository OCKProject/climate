 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The northern wheatear (hereafter wheatear) is a cavity-breeding farmland bird (e.g., in stone piles at ground level, under roof tiles of buildings). Our study area is a 60 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> heterogeneous agricultural landscape situated southeast of Uppsala in southern central Sweden (59°50′N, 17°50′E) and consists of 230 territory sites that have been occupied by wheatears at least once since 1993. Each year 120–180 pairs breed in the area. In a smaller core area (∼40 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>, 150 sites, 80–90 pairs per year), each territory site has been visited at least every third to 5th day throughout the breeding season to collect detailed data on demographic parameters.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The wheatear is a ground-foraging insectivore: preferring areas with short or sparse vegetation as their foraging strategies are adapted to such habitats (Conder 
  <a rid="b11" ref-type="bibr" href="#b11">1989</a>) and such habitats are related to high invertebrate availability (Tye 
  <a rid="b57" ref-type="bibr" href="#b57">1992</a>). Habitats with short ground vegetation layers (e.g., grazed pastures; hereafter short field layers) also have lower nest predation risk (Schneider et al. 
  <a rid="b49" ref-type="bibr" href="#b49">2012</a>), higher fledgling production (Pärt 
  <a rid="b40" ref-type="bibr" href="#b40">2001a</a>,
  <a rid="b41" ref-type="bibr" href="#b41">b</a>), and higher adult survival (Low et al. 
  <a rid="b26" ref-type="bibr" href="#b26">2010</a>) than habitats with tall and dense field layers (e.g., crops and unmanaged grasslands). The difference in adult survival is related to a habitat-specific difference in workload due to longer foraging flights in habitats with tall field layers (Low et al. 
  <a rid="b26" ref-type="bibr" href="#b26">2010</a>). Hence, height of the field layer is an important component of habitat quality (Arlt and Pärt 
  <a rid="b2" ref-type="bibr" href="#b2">2007</a>; Arlt et al. 
  <a rid="b4" ref-type="bibr" href="#b4">2008</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wheatears in this population migrate from sub-Saharan Africa and arrive at the study area in early to mid-April and the earliest individuals start laying eggs in the beginning of May. Hatching starts in the later part of May and both males and females participate in the care of nestlings. Young nestlings are altricial and dependent on brooding by the female to maintain body temperature. Nestlings were aged based on photos of known hatch-date nestlings of different ages, and hatching date was calculated from chick age. We recorded clutch size (number of eggs or number of chicks + unhatched eggs within 2 days of hatching), number of fledged young (number of ringed chicks minus number of dead chicks in the nest after fledging), and nest success (≥1 fledged young or intense warning calls from parents at the time of fledging at about 15 days of age). These proxies are generally accurate because most chick death comes from nest predation (Pärt 
  <a rid="b40" ref-type="bibr" href="#b40">2001a</a>). Nest predation almost always results in complete nest failure with removal of offspring from or destruction of the nest and parents will only warning call when offspring are still alive (Pärt 
  <a rid="b40" ref-type="bibr" href="#b40">2001a</a>; Schneider et al. 
  <a rid="b49" ref-type="bibr" href="#b49">2012</a>). Because we were interested in factors other than predation, we restricted our analyses to nests that were not preyed upon (i.e., successful nests and intact failed nests where the young had not been removed). Egg-laying date (i.e., the date the first egg was laid relative to 1 May) was estimated for all breeding attempts based on chick hatching dates (88% of all breeding attempts) and clutch size (either known, for 30% of all breeding attempts, or otherwise we assume a clutch size of six which is the mean for this population, see Öberg et al. 
  <a rid="b38" ref-type="bibr" href="#b38">2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We ringed nestlings and adults with a unique combination of color-rings and a numbered metal ring (∼60% of adults from all established pairs, ∼90% nestlings that subsequently fledged). We aged adult birds as yearling or older based on their plumage characteristics (Pärt 
  <a rid="b40" ref-type="bibr" href="#b40">2001a</a>). Recruitment success and apparent parental survival was determined by re-sighting ringed birds in subsequent years. To minimize the potentially confounding effect of dispersal on recruitment and survival, we only estimated apparent parental survival and recruitment success for breeding attempts in the core part of the study area, using the surrounding 2 km area as a buffer zone for re-sighting of individuals (Arlt and Pärt 
  <a rid="b3" ref-type="bibr" href="#b3">2008</a>; Arlt et al. 
  <a rid="b4" ref-type="bibr" href="#b4">2008</a>; Low et al. 
  <a rid="b26" ref-type="bibr" href="#b26">2010</a>). Previous analyses have shown that restricting estimates to breeding attempts in the core zone, with subsequent re-sighting from the entire study area, results in unbiased estimates of adult and juvenile survival with respect to breeding habitat, sex, and age (Arlt et al. 
  <a rid="b4" ref-type="bibr" href="#b4">2008</a>; Low et al. 
  <a rid="b26" ref-type="bibr" href="#b26">2010</a>). Re-sighting probability for adults in this population is high (mean ± SE: males 0.98 ± 0.01; females 0.89 ± 0.03; Low et al. 
  <a rid="b26" ref-type="bibr" href="#b26">2010</a>), and because our survival estimates are unbiased with respect to individual and habitat covariates (Low et al. 
  <a rid="b26" ref-type="bibr" href="#b26">2010</a>), we estimated apparent survival estimates using return rates; this allowed us greater flexibility in a GLMM modeling framework (see below). Thus, while the relative effects of explanatory variables on survival will be largely unbiased, survival will be slightly underestimated because detection is not perfect.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We categorized territories according to their field layer height (FLH) and vegetation growth throughout the breeding season, as either short or tall (see also Pärt 
  <a rid="b40" ref-type="bibr" href="#b40">2001a</a>; Arlt and Pärt 
  <a rid="b2" ref-type="bibr" href="#b2">2007</a>). Field layers in short territories (farmyards and grazed pastures) were kept 5 cm or shorter throughout the breeding season while field layers in tall territories (crop fields, ungrazed pastures, and unmanaged grasslands) usually were short at territory establishment but grew to 15 cm or more at the time of chick rearing.
