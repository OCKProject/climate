 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our detailed individual-based data enabled us to investigate how different demographic components were related to variation in rainfall (independent of temperature) during nestling care. Rainfall during the nestling period not only reduced fledging success, but also recruitment success and apparent male parental survival (Fig.
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">1</a>), although there was no clear effect on female parental survival. The amount of rainfall reduced visitation rates (Fig.
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">3</a>), which suggests chicks received less food during rain events and thus potentially explains the reduced fledging success and subsequent juvenile survival (i.e., recruitment success). Our results confirm previous studies showing the negative effects of rainfall on the production of fledglings (Siikamäki 
  <a rid="b51" ref-type="bibr" href="#b51">1996</a>; Dawson and Bortolotti 
  <a rid="b14" ref-type="bibr" href="#b14">2000</a>; Franklin et al. 
  <a rid="b16" ref-type="bibr" href="#b16">2000</a>; Rodríguez and Bustamante 
  <a rid="b47" ref-type="bibr" href="#b47">2003</a>; Arlettaz et al. 
  <a rid="b1" ref-type="bibr" href="#b1">2010</a>). But more importantly, we show that effects of rainfall during the nestling stage may have long-term effects on fitness such as recruitment and parental survival probabilities. We also found the effect of rainfall on reproductive performance to be stronger for early as compared to late breeders (Fig.
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">2A</a>), whereas there was no support for an interaction between field layer height (reflecting territory quality) and rainfall on investigated components of fitness.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Visitation rates</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Daily rainfall reduced parental visitation rates by ∼22% during days with heavy rain (e.g., &gt;20 mm; Fig.
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">3</a>). Similarly, other studies have shown nestling provisioning rates to decline with increasing amount of rain (e.g., Dawson and Bortolotti 
   <a rid="b14" ref-type="bibr" href="#b14">2000</a>; Radford et al. 
   <a rid="b44" ref-type="bibr" href="#b44">2001</a>; Geiser et al. 
   <a rid="b17" ref-type="bibr" href="#b17">2008</a>; Arlettaz et al. 
   <a rid="b1" ref-type="bibr" href="#b1">2010</a>). Visitation rates may be reduced by rainfall either through increased time spent brooding to compensate for increased thermoregulatory demands of the young (Radford et al. 
   <a rid="b44" ref-type="bibr" href="#b44">2001</a>) or through the commonly suggested reduction in prey availability during rainfall (Avery and Krebs 
   <a rid="b5" ref-type="bibr" href="#b5">1984</a>; Veistola et al. 
   <a rid="b58" ref-type="bibr" href="#b58">1997</a>). Lower visitation rates may in turn result in less food provisioned to chicks. Changes in visitation rates could be compensated for by changes in load size (i.e., the amount of food delivered per nest visit, Grieco 
   <a rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" href="#b18">2002</a>) although some studies suggest that also load size may decrease when it is raining (Dawson and Bortolotti 
   <a rid="b14" ref-type="bibr" href="#b14">2000</a>; Arlettaz et al. 
   <a rid="b1" ref-type="bibr" href="#b1">2010</a>). The combined results of reduced food visitation rates and reduced reproductive performance strongly suggest that rainfall affects the amount and possibly quality of food (Arlettaz et al. 
   <a rid="b1" ref-type="bibr" href="#b1">2010</a>) provided to nestlings.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fledging and recruitment success</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The negative effect of rainfall on fledging success was stronger in the later part of the nestling period when the overall energy demands of the nestlings are expected to be the highest. This suggests that food shortages during the period with highest net energy demand for offspring (because of growth, body size, and endothermic metabolism) may reduce their condition below a threshold from which they cannot recover. Younger nestlings, on the other hand, are ectothermic and hence may be able to reduce their metabolism to low levels during periods of adverse weather conditions. Furthermore, young nestlings are often brooded by the female (Conder 
   <a rid="b11" ref-type="bibr" href="#b11">1989</a>), and during poor weather conditions, females may increase their time spent brooding to protect the young (Radford et al. 
   <a rid="b44" ref-type="bibr" href="#b44">2001</a>; own observations).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By contrast, recruitment success was related to the number of days of rainfall during the first half of the nestling period. Rainfall effects may not only increase the risk of mortality for nestlings but may also reduce growth rates (Conder 
   <a rid="b11" ref-type="bibr" href="#b11">1989</a>; Keller and van Noordwijk 
   <a rid="b20" ref-type="bibr" href="#b20">1994</a>; Siikamäki 
   <a rid="b51" ref-type="bibr" href="#b51">1996</a>; Veistola et al. 
   <a rid="b58" ref-type="bibr" href="#b58">1997</a>; Dawson and Bortolotti 
   <a rid="b14" ref-type="bibr" href="#b14">2000</a>). Fledgling body condition has been shown to strongly affect probability of juvenile survival to the next year (Sullivan 
   <a rid="b56" ref-type="bibr" href="#b56">1989</a>; Lindén et al. 
   <a rid="b23" ref-type="bibr" href="#b23">1992</a>; Naef-Daenzer et al. 
   <a rid="b34" ref-type="bibr" href="#b34">2001</a>; Low and Pärt 
   <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2009</a>). As the ability to compensate reduced growth during adverse weather may be lower for young as compared to old nestlings (Geiser et al. 
   <a rid="b17" ref-type="bibr" href="#b17">2008</a>; but see Siikamäki 
   <a rid="b51" ref-type="bibr" href="#b51">1996</a>), it is possible that effects of rain during the early nestling stage may be manifested as reduced survival after fledging.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results also indicate a stronger effect of rainfall for nests hatched early than late in the breeding season (Fig.
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">2A</a>). Fledging and recruitment success is generally lower for nests hatched late in the breeding season (Öberg et al. 
   <a rid="b38" ref-type="bibr" href="#b38">2014</a>) and thus, effects further reducing reproductive performance may be more difficult to detect (lower statistical power). However, nestlings hatched early in the season may also be more sensitive to rainfall. Early breeding individuals produce on average larger clutches and have larger broods than late breeders (Öberg et al. 
   <a rid="b38" ref-type="bibr" href="#b38">2014</a>), potentially requiring an effort beyond the parent's capacity when feeding young during poor environmental conditions thus causing brood reduction through nestling mortality (Siikamäki 
   <a rid="b51" ref-type="bibr" href="#b51">1996</a>). If this is true, difference in fitness between early and late breeders may disappear in years with heavy rain early in the season, reducing the advantages of early breeding.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Parental survival</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For parents, the energetically most demanding period during breeding is when feeding nestlings (Moreno and Hillström 
   <a rid="b33" ref-type="bibr" href="#b33">1992</a>; Newton 
   <a rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" href="#b36">1998</a>) and any factor affecting nestling food provisioning effort may thus affect subsequent parental survival. As prey items become more difficult to find, parents may be forced to increase the time spent foraging and cover greater distances during foraging bouts to avoid starvation of their chicks (Low et al. 
   <a rid="b26" ref-type="bibr" href="#b26">2010</a>), and by increasing investment in their offspring, they may also compromise their own needs (Nilsson 
   <a rid="b37" ref-type="bibr" href="#b37">2002</a>) and get less food for themselves (Markman et al. 
   <a rid="b28" ref-type="bibr" href="#b28">2002</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analyses suggest that parental survival in males was more sensitive than females to the effects of increased rainfall during the period of nestling care. Radford et al. (
   <a rid="b44" ref-type="bibr" href="#b44">2001</a>) showed that female great tits (
   <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) increased the time spent brooding during rainfall and that this increase accounted for the entire reduction in visitation rates. In the wheatear, only females brood (Conder 
   <a rid="b11" ref-type="bibr" href="#b11">1989</a>) and wheatear females are likely to reduce visitation rates due to increased brooding during adverse weather conditions. This could explain why female parental survival was not reduced when there was more rainfall and at the same time explain why male parental survival should be linked to number of days with rain especially during the first nestling stage (Tables
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a> and 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl2" href="#tbl2">2</a>). As female brooding of nestlings takes place mainly during the early nestling period (chick age ≤5 days; Conder 
   <a rid="b11" ref-type="bibr" href="#b11">1989</a>), increased brooding due to adverse weather may force males to increase their effort to compensate for the reduced provisioning rates of females.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The interaction between rainfall and number of fledged young (Fig.
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">2B</a>) showed that the negative effect of rainfall on male parental survival increased during complete nest failure as compared to successfully fledging young. This was in contrast to our expectation based on the assumption that effort increases with the number of fledglings produced. However, male reproductive effort may be more closely linked to adverse weather conditions than to the number of fledglings produced, especially if the conditions are so bad that the brood is largely reduced or the breeding attempt fails completely. This is because males not only may have to compensate for female reduction in nestling food provisioning; they have to do that in the worst conditions. Thus, the relationship between male parental survival and the number of offspring fledged may largely arise from the fact that high-quality males in good condition can fledge offspring and subsequently survive, while males in poorer condition are more likely to fail at both tasks. Breeding failures were linked to amount of rainfall (data not shown) and a combination of rain and failure likely reflected extremely poor conditions for foraging and nestling food provisioning. We suggest that the effects of rain on male parental survival could be driven by a sexual difference in parental duties during adverse weather conditions. Detailed data on male and female food provisioning rates in relation to rainfall and reproductive parameters could test this hypothesis.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study adds to our knowledge of weather effects on individual fitness by showing that (1) rain during the nestling stage not only relates to fledging success but may also have long-term effects on subsequent juvenile (as measured by recruitment success) and parental survival, (2) rainfall may have different effects on reproductive output and survival depending on when in the nestling stage it rains, and (3) the effect of rainfall is more marked among early than late breeders. In the northern temperate region, climate change scenarios indicate an increasing number of days of heavy rain, greater weather variability, and occurrence of extreme weather events in the future (IPCC 
   <a rid="b19" ref-type="bibr" href="#b19">2013</a>). Our results stress that knowledge of weather effects other than temperature on multiple vital rates are crucial if we want to understand or predict population responses to future climate change.
