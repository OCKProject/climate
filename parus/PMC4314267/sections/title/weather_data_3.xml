Because we did not have data on hourly rainfall patterns for the whole study period, we could not investigate the details of how rain may be associated with reproductive performance and survival (e.g., several hours of continuous vs. short heavy rain). Instead, we used four daily based rainfall metrics measured during the nestling period (i.e., from day of hatching to day of fledging at 15 days of age for each individual nest): (1) total sum of rainfall (mm), (2) number of days with rain (i.e., &gt;0 mm), because the duration of rainfall may be as important than the amount of rain (Dawson and Bortolotti
