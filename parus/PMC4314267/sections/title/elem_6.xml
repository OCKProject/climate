 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reproductive success and survival</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test whether variation in fitness was related to variation in rainfall during individual nestling periods, we used data from 1994 to 2012 on fledging success (number of fledged young/clutch size from nests that were not preyed upon, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 495), recruitment success (number of recruits/number of fledged young from successful nests, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 665), and apparent parental survival (
  <span class="italic">n</span>
  <sub>males</sub> = 714 and 
  <span class="italic">n</span>
  <sub>females</sub> = 741). The influence of the rainfall metrics on the three fitness components was analyzed using generalized linear mixed models in R (R Development Core Team 
  <a rid="b43" ref-type="bibr" href="#b43">2012</a>) with a binomial distribution (i.e., for fledging and recruitment success accounting for the number of trials per individual, clutch size or number fledged per nest), and logit link (function “lmer” in the package lme4; Bates et al. 
  <a rid="b6" ref-type="bibr" href="#b6">2012</a>). We used this approach for analyzing fledging success rather than a nest survival analysis (e.g., Mayfield 
  <a rid="b29" ref-type="bibr" href="#b29">1975</a>) because we rarely had accurate data on the timing of individual offspring death within the nest, and most complete nest failures were removed from our analyses because they resulted from predation (see also Schneider et al. 
  <a rid="b49" ref-type="bibr" href="#b49">2012</a>; Öberg et al. 
  <a rid="b38" ref-type="bibr" href="#b38">2014</a>). Analyses were implemented in an information-theoretic framework (Burnham and Anderson 
  <a rid="b9" ref-type="bibr" href="#b9">2002</a>). We used a two-step approach for model selection to reduce model complexity. First, we identified which of the four different rain variables best explained variation in the fitness component of interest (step 1). The resulting highest ranked model was then used as a basis for examining the role of additional covariates, including disentangling the potentially confounding effects of temperature (step 2).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Step 1 – Assessing rainfall-fitness correlations</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each fitness component, we created a candidate model set, where we varied rainfall variables while holding constant variables known to be important in influencing each respective fitness component (based on Öberg et al. 
   <a rid="b38" ref-type="bibr" href="#b38">2014</a> where relative variable importance weights were &gt;0.60), which included: (1) for fledging success – field layer height (short/tall), female age (yearling/older), egg-laying date (the date the first egg was laid relative to 1 May), and an age*egg-laying date interaction, (2) for recruitment success – field layer height, female age, nest type (roof vs. ground), and egg-laying date, and (3) for female and male parental survival – field layer height, nest success (successful/failed), and egg-laying date. Although egg-laying date does not appear to influence adult survival (Öberg et al. 
   <a rid="b38" ref-type="bibr" href="#b38">2014</a>), we included this factor in the base models because any seasonal pattern in rainfall may hide a potential relationship between survival and egg-laying date. Similarly, age did not appear to influence adult survival (Low et al. 
   <a rid="b26" ref-type="bibr" href="#b26">2010</a>), but due to a higher proportion of young breeders in tall habitats (tall vs. short; females: 48 vs. 35%, 
   <span class="italic">χ</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 11.7, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001; males: 39% vs. 26%, 
   <span class="italic">χ</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 12.2, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001), we included age to avoid any confounding effects of this variable on parental survival. For both fledging and recruitment success, female age was unknown in ∼20% of the breeding attempts, so we used the known male age in these cases because male and female age is highly correlated in this population (likelihood ratio, 
   <span class="italic">χ</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 79.44, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001, 
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 820; see also Öberg et al. 
   <a rid="b38" ref-type="bibr" href="#b38">2014</a>). For female parental survival analyses, we only used females of known age. In all models, we included year and individual identity as random effects; except for the fledging success analysis where the individual random effect resulted in some models not converging and so it was excluded. This omission was unlikely to have influenced our overall results, as the term did not improve AIC (Akaike's information criterion) in less complex fledging success models where convergence occurred.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the variables known to influence each respective fitness component as a base, we created models for each rainfall measure (see above) during periods of different nestling ages: the entire nestling period (when chicks were 0–15 days of age), the first half of the nestling period (0–7 days), and the second half of the nestling period (8–15 days); for recruitment success and parental survival, there was one additional model for each rainfall measure during the early postfledging period (16–25 days). Thus, the candidate model set contained 13 models for fledging success (base + 4 rain variables x 3 periods) and 17 models for recruitment success and parental survival (base + 4 rain metrics x 4 periods). The initial analyses included the rainfall measure only as a linear term, as visualization of the raw data showed no obvious nonlinear relationships between rainfall and the fitness components of interest (not shown). All models in the candidate set were then ranked by AIC, with the highest ranked model (smallest AIC; 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1" href="#sd1">Table S1</a>) used as the base model for the next step in the analyses of each fitness component providing the addition of a rainfall variable improved AIC by &gt;2 (Burnham and Anderson 
   <a rid="b9" ref-type="bibr" href="#b9">2002</a>). For female parental survival, the effect of rainfall on model fit was extremely weak (ΔAIC &lt; 2; 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1" href="#sd1">Table S1</a>); thus, we concluded that there was little support for an effect of rainfall on female parental survival and did not perform any further analysis on this fitness component.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Step 2 – Disentangling temperature and rainfall and assessing rainfall–covariate interactions</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We built new candidate model sets for each fitness component based on the highest ranked model from step 1. First, to account for potential effects of temperature on variation in fitness components, we included mean temperature during the same time period as for the rain variable. Temperature and rainfall were correlated but Pearson's correlation coefficients never exceeded 0.4, and the variance inflation factor (VIF) for our fixed effects was always &lt;1.7 (a VIF &gt; 2 suggests problems with collinearity; Zuur et al. 
   <a rid="b62" ref-type="bibr" href="#b62">2009</a>). Second, we included an interaction between field layer height and rainfall to investigate whether habitat quality may buffer individuals from effects of rainfall. Third, we included an interaction between egg-laying date and rainfall to investigate whether rainfall-related effects on fitness differ for early and late breeding individuals. Finally, we included the interaction between number of fledged young and rainfall in models of male parental survival. If rainfall effects on survival are mediated through an increase in effort, individuals with many young (i.e., higher effort) should be more vulnerable to rainfall. Including all combinations of those additional covariates resulted in candidate sets of nine models for fledging and recruitment success, and 17 models for male parental survival. Models were compared based on AIC values and AIC weights (Burnham and Anderson 
   <a rid="b9" ref-type="bibr" href="#b9">2002</a>). As a validation for the model selection in step 1, we then reran all of the top-ranked models in step 2 with the different rainfall parameters from step 1; in no cases did the model fit improve with other rainfall data, supporting the step 1 model selection procedure. We then also checked our assumption that the relationship between rainfall and fitness was linear by comparing the full model with a model that included a quadratic rainfall term; with the exception of fledging success, the quadratic term did not improve model fit. We report the quadratic rainfall effect for fledging success below.
