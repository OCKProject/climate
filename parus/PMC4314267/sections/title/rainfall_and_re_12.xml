 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Variation in recruitment success was best explained by the number of days with rain during the entire nestling period (NumDays
  <sub>NestFull</sub>; 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1" href="#sd1">Table S1</a>); this variable had substantially more support than the base model and models with other rainfall variables. When dividing the entire nestling period into two parts, there was more support for an effect of rain on juvenile survival during the early nestling period (NumDays
  <sub>Nest1</sub>) than during the second half (NumDays
  <sub>Nest2</sub>; 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1" href="#sd1">Table S1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The step 2 covariate analysis revealed only weak support for an effect of average temperature during the nestling stage, while the number of days with rain was still negatively related to juvenile survival (Tables
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a> and 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl2" href="#tbl2">2</a>; Fig.
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">1B</a>). There was no clear support for any interactive effects between rainfall and field layer height or egg-laying date (Table
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a>).
