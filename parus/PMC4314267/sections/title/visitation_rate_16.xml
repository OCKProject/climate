 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Daily rainfall reduced parental visitation rates by ∼22% during days with heavy rain (e.g., &gt;20 mm; Fig.
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">3</a>). Similarly, other studies have shown nestling provisioning rates to decline with increasing amount of rain (e.g., Dawson and Bortolotti 
  <a rid="b14" ref-type="bibr" href="#b14">2000</a>; Radford et al. 
  <a rid="b44" ref-type="bibr" href="#b44">2001</a>; Geiser et al. 
  <a rid="b17" ref-type="bibr" href="#b17">2008</a>; Arlettaz et al. 
  <a rid="b1" ref-type="bibr" href="#b1">2010</a>). Visitation rates may be reduced by rainfall either through increased time spent brooding to compensate for increased thermoregulatory demands of the young (Radford et al. 
  <a rid="b44" ref-type="bibr" href="#b44">2001</a>) or through the commonly suggested reduction in prey availability during rainfall (Avery and Krebs 
  <a rid="b5" ref-type="bibr" href="#b5">1984</a>; Veistola et al. 
  <a rid="b58" ref-type="bibr" href="#b58">1997</a>). Lower visitation rates may in turn result in less food provisioned to chicks. Changes in visitation rates could be compensated for by changes in load size (i.e., the amount of food delivered per nest visit, Grieco 
  <a rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" href="#b18">2002</a>) although some studies suggest that also load size may decrease when it is raining (Dawson and Bortolotti 
  <a rid="b14" ref-type="bibr" href="#b14">2000</a>; Arlettaz et al. 
  <a rid="b1" ref-type="bibr" href="#b1">2010</a>). The combined results of reduced food visitation rates and reduced reproductive performance strongly suggest that rainfall affects the amount and possibly quality of food (Arlettaz et al. 
  <a rid="b1" ref-type="bibr" href="#b1">2010</a>) provided to nestlings.
