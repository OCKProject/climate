  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The northern wheatear (hereafter wheatear) is a cavity-breeding farmland bird (e.g., in stone piles at ground level, under roof tiles of buildings). Our study area is a 60 km
   <span class="sup">2</span> heterogeneous agricultural landscape situated southeast of Uppsala in southern central Sweden (59°50′N, 17°50′E) and consists of 230 territory sites that have been occupied by wheatears at least once since 1993. Each year 120–180 pairs breed in the area. In a smaller core area (∼40 km
   <span class="sup">2</span>, 150 sites, 80–90 pairs per year), each territory site has been visited at least every third to 5th day throughout the breeding season to collect detailed data on demographic parameters.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The wheatear is a ground-foraging insectivore: preferring areas with short or sparse vegetation as their foraging strategies are adapted to such habitats (Conder 
   <a rid="b11" ref-type="bibr" href="#b11">1989</a>) and such habitats are related to high invertebrate availability (Tye 
   <a rid="b57" ref-type="bibr" href="#b57">1992</a>). Habitats with short ground vegetation layers (e.g., grazed pastures; hereafter short field layers) also have lower nest predation risk (Schneider et al. 
   <a rid="b49" ref-type="bibr" href="#b49">2012</a>), higher fledgling production (Pärt 
   <a rid="b40" ref-type="bibr" href="#b40">2001a</a>,
   <a rid="b41" ref-type="bibr" href="#b41">b</a>), and higher adult survival (Low et al. 
   <a rid="b26" ref-type="bibr" href="#b26">2010</a>) than habitats with tall and dense field layers (e.g., crops and unmanaged grasslands). The difference in adult survival is related to a habitat-specific difference in workload due to longer foraging flights in habitats with tall field layers (Low et al. 
   <a rid="b26" ref-type="bibr" href="#b26">2010</a>). Hence, height of the field layer is an important component of habitat quality (Arlt and Pärt 
   <a rid="b2" ref-type="bibr" href="#b2">2007</a>; Arlt et al. 
   <a rid="b4" ref-type="bibr" href="#b4">2008</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wheatears in this population migrate from sub-Saharan Africa and arrive at the study area in early to mid-April and the earliest individuals start laying eggs in the beginning of May. Hatching starts in the later part of May and both males and females participate in the care of nestlings. Young nestlings are altricial and dependent on brooding by the female to maintain body temperature. Nestlings were aged based on photos of known hatch-date nestlings of different ages, and hatching date was calculated from chick age. We recorded clutch size (number of eggs or number of chicks + unhatched eggs within 2 days of hatching), number of fledged young (number of ringed chicks minus number of dead chicks in the nest after fledging), and nest success (≥1 fledged young or intense warning calls from parents at the time of fledging at about 15 days of age). These proxies are generally accurate because most chick death comes from nest predation (Pärt 
   <a rid="b40" ref-type="bibr" href="#b40">2001a</a>). Nest predation almost always results in complete nest failure with removal of offspring from or destruction of the nest and parents will only warning call when offspring are still alive (Pärt 
   <a rid="b40" ref-type="bibr" href="#b40">2001a</a>; Schneider et al. 
   <a rid="b49" ref-type="bibr" href="#b49">2012</a>). Because we were interested in factors other than predation, we restricted our analyses to nests that were not preyed upon (i.e., successful nests and intact failed nests where the young had not been removed). Egg-laying date (i.e., the date the first egg was laid relative to 1 May) was estimated for all breeding attempts based on chick hatching dates (88% of all breeding attempts) and clutch size (either known, for 30% of all breeding attempts, or otherwise we assume a clutch size of six which is the mean for this population, see Öberg et al. 
   <a rid="b38" ref-type="bibr" href="#b38">2014</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We ringed nestlings and adults with a unique combination of color-rings and a numbered metal ring (∼60% of adults from all established pairs, ∼90% nestlings that subsequently fledged). We aged adult birds as yearling or older based on their plumage characteristics (Pärt 
   <a rid="b40" ref-type="bibr" href="#b40">2001a</a>). Recruitment success and apparent parental survival was determined by re-sighting ringed birds in subsequent years. To minimize the potentially confounding effect of dispersal on recruitment and survival, we only estimated apparent parental survival and recruitment success for breeding attempts in the core part of the study area, using the surrounding 2 km area as a buffer zone for re-sighting of individuals (Arlt and Pärt 
   <a rid="b3" ref-type="bibr" href="#b3">2008</a>; Arlt et al. 
   <a rid="b4" ref-type="bibr" href="#b4">2008</a>; Low et al. 
   <a rid="b26" ref-type="bibr" href="#b26">2010</a>). Previous analyses have shown that restricting estimates to breeding attempts in the core zone, with subsequent re-sighting from the entire study area, results in unbiased estimates of adult and juvenile survival with respect to breeding habitat, sex, and age (Arlt et al. 
   <a rid="b4" ref-type="bibr" href="#b4">2008</a>; Low et al. 
   <a rid="b26" ref-type="bibr" href="#b26">2010</a>). Re-sighting probability for adults in this population is high (mean ± SE: males 0.98 ± 0.01; females 0.89 ± 0.03; Low et al. 
   <a rid="b26" ref-type="bibr" href="#b26">2010</a>), and because our survival estimates are unbiased with respect to individual and habitat covariates (Low et al. 
   <a rid="b26" ref-type="bibr" href="#b26">2010</a>), we estimated apparent survival estimates using return rates; this allowed us greater flexibility in a GLMM modeling framework (see below). Thus, while the relative effects of explanatory variables on survival will be largely unbiased, survival will be slightly underestimated because detection is not perfect.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We categorized territories according to their field layer height (FLH) and vegetation growth throughout the breeding season, as either short or tall (see also Pärt 
   <a rid="b40" ref-type="bibr" href="#b40">2001a</a>; Arlt and Pärt 
   <a rid="b2" ref-type="bibr" href="#b2">2007</a>). Field layers in short territories (farmyards and grazed pastures) were kept 5 cm or shorter throughout the breeding season while field layers in tall territories (crop fields, ungrazed pastures, and unmanaged grasslands) usually were short at territory establishment but grew to 15 cm or more at the time of chick rearing.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We obtained local weather data from the Ultuna Climate Station (59°82′N, 17°65′E; 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://grodden.evp.slu.se/slu_klimat/index.html" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://grodden.evp.slu.se/slu_klimat/index.html</span>) recorded as daily amount of rainfall in millimeters (mm) and average daily temperature. Because we did not have data on hourly rainfall patterns for the whole study period, we could not investigate the details of how rain may be associated with reproductive performance and survival (e.g., several hours of continuous vs. short heavy rain). Instead, we used four daily based rainfall metrics measured during the nestling period (i.e., from day of hatching to day of fledging at 15 days of age for each individual nest): (1) total sum of rainfall (mm), (2) number of days with rain (i.e., &gt;0 mm), because the duration of rainfall may be as important than the amount of rain (Dawson and Bortolotti 
   <a rid="b14" ref-type="bibr" href="#b14">2000</a>; Radford et al. 
   <a rid="b44" ref-type="bibr" href="#b44">2001</a>), (3) the longest sequence of consecutive days with rain, because the duration of rainfall may have larger impact if rain falls several days in a row and birds cannot recover condition, and (4) number of days with heavy rain (≥10 mm; after Skagen and Adams

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nestling age</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because rainfall may affect reproduction and survival differently depending on the energetic requirements of the nestlings (see Introduction), we divided the nestling period into two periods based on growth curves for wheatear nestlings (Conder 
   <a rid="b11" ref-type="bibr" href="#b11">1989</a>) and expected development of thermoregulation for altricial species (Whittow 
   <a rid="b61" ref-type="bibr" href="#b61">2000</a>): (1) 0–7 days old; chicks are small but growing, ectothermic and highly dependent on brooding by the female, (2) 8–15 days old; increasing ability to thermoregulate and developing feathers covering most of the body after day 11 and onwards. After 8 days, nestlings likely reach the peak of their energy demand resulting from endothermic thermoregulation and growth and size (combination of high growth and larger body size requiring high energy for basal metabolism, see Low et al. 
   <a rid="b27" ref-type="bibr" href="#b27">2012</a>). Because young wheatears are also dependent on food provisioned by the parents during about 2 weeks after fledging, we also included a third period when fledged young were 16–25 days old.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reproductive success and survival</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test whether variation in fitness was related to variation in rainfall during individual nestling periods, we used data from 1994 to 2012 on fledging success (number of fledged young/clutch size from nests that were not preyed upon, 
    <span class="italic">n</span> = 495), recruitment success (number of recruits/number of fledged young from successful nests, 
    <span class="italic">n</span> = 665), and apparent parental survival (
    <span class="italic">n</span>
    <sub>males</sub> = 714 and 
    <span class="italic">n</span>
    <sub>females</sub> = 741). The influence of the rainfall metrics on the three fitness components was analyzed using generalized linear mixed models in R (R Development Core Team 
    <a rid="b43" ref-type="bibr" href="#b43">2012</a>) with a binomial distribution (i.e., for fledging and recruitment success accounting for the number of trials per individual, clutch size or number fledged per nest), and logit link (function “lmer” in the package lme4; Bates et al. 
    <a rid="b6" ref-type="bibr" href="#b6">2012</a>). We used this approach for analyzing fledging success rather than a nest survival analysis (e.g., Mayfield 
    <a rid="b29" ref-type="bibr" href="#b29">1975</a>) because we rarely had accurate data on the timing of individual offspring death within the nest, and most complete nest failures were removed from our analyses because they resulted from predation (see also Schneider et al. 
    <a rid="b49" ref-type="bibr" href="#b49">2012</a>; Öberg et al. 
    <a rid="b38" ref-type="bibr" href="#b38">2014</a>). Analyses were implemented in an information-theoretic framework (Burnham and Anderson 
    <a rid="b9" ref-type="bibr" href="#b9">2002</a>). We used a two-step approach for model selection to reduce model complexity. First, we identified which of the four different rain variables best explained variation in the fitness component of interest (step 1). The resulting highest ranked model was then used as a basis for examining the role of additional covariates, including disentangling the potentially confounding effects of temperature (step 2).

    <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Step 1 – Assessing rainfall-fitness correlations</div>
    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each fitness component, we created a candidate model set, where we varied rainfall variables while holding constant variables known to be important in influencing each respective fitness component (based on Öberg et al. 
     <a rid="b38" ref-type="bibr" href="#b38">2014</a> where relative variable importance weights were &gt;0.60), which included: (1) for fledging success – field layer height (short/tall), female age (yearling/older), egg-laying date (the date the first egg was laid relative to 1 May), and an age*egg-laying date interaction, (2) for recruitment success – field layer height, female age, nest type (roof vs. ground), and egg-laying date, and (3) for female and male parental survival – field layer height, nest success (successful/failed), and egg-laying date. Although egg-laying date does not appear to influence adult survival (Öberg et al. 
     <a rid="b38" ref-type="bibr" href="#b38">2014</a>), we included this factor in the base models because any seasonal pattern in rainfall may hide a potential relationship between survival and egg-laying date. Similarly, age did not appear to influence adult survival (Low et al. 
     <a rid="b26" ref-type="bibr" href="#b26">2010</a>), but due to a higher proportion of young breeders in tall habitats (tall vs. short; females: 48 vs. 35%, 
     <span class="italic">χ</span>
     <span class="sup">2</span> = 11.7, 
     <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001; males: 39% vs. 26%, 
     <span class="italic">χ</span>
     <span class="sup">2</span> = 12.2, 
     <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001), we included age to avoid any confounding effects of this variable on parental survival. For both fledging and recruitment success, female age was unknown in ∼20% of the breeding attempts, so we used the known male age in these cases because male and female age is highly correlated in this population (likelihood ratio, 
     <span class="italic">χ</span>
     <span class="sup">2</span> = 79.44, 
     <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001, 
     <span class="italic">n</span> = 820; see also Öberg et al. 
     <a rid="b38" ref-type="bibr" href="#b38">2014</a>). For female parental survival analyses, we only used females of known age. In all models, we included year and individual identity as random effects; except for the fledging success analysis where the individual random effect resulted in some models not converging and so it was excluded. This omission was unlikely to have influenced our overall results, as the term did not improve AIC (Akaike's information criterion) in less complex fledging success models where convergence occurred.
    </p>
    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the variables known to influence each respective fitness component as a base, we created models for each rainfall measure (see above) during periods of different nestling ages: the entire nestling period (when chicks were 0–15 days of age), the first half of the nestling period (0–7 days), and the second half of the nestling period (8–15 days); for recruitment success and parental survival, there was one additional model for each rainfall measure during the early postfledging period (16–25 days). Thus, the candidate model set contained 13 models for fledging success (base + 4 rain variables x 3 periods) and 17 models for recruitment success and parental survival (base + 4 rain metrics x 4 periods). The initial analyses included the rainfall measure only as a linear term, as visualization of the raw data showed no obvious nonlinear relationships between rainfall and the fitness components of interest (not shown). All models in the candidate set were then ranked by AIC, with the highest ranked model (smallest AIC; 
     <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1" href="#sd1">Table S1</a>) used as the base model for the next step in the analyses of each fitness component providing the addition of a rainfall variable improved AIC by &gt;2 (Burnham and Anderson 
     <a rid="b9" ref-type="bibr" href="#b9">2002</a>). For female parental survival, the effect of rainfall on model fit was extremely weak (ΔAIC &lt; 2; 
     <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1" href="#sd1">Table S1</a>); thus, we concluded that there was little support for an effect of rainfall on female parental survival and did not perform any further analysis on this fitness component.

    <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Step 2 – Disentangling temperature and rainfall and assessing rainfall–covariate interactions</div>
    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We built new candidate model sets for each fitness component based on the highest ranked model from step 1. First, to account for potential effects of temperature on variation in fitness components, we included mean temperature during the same time period as for the rain variable. Temperature and rainfall were correlated but Pearson's correlation coefficients never exceeded 0.4, and the variance inflation factor (VIF) for our fixed effects was always &lt;1.7 (a VIF &gt; 2 suggests problems with collinearity; Zuur et al. 
     <a rid="b62" ref-type="bibr" href="#b62">2009</a>). Second, we included an interaction between field layer height and rainfall to investigate whether habitat quality may buffer individuals from effects of rainfall. Third, we included an interaction between egg-laying date and rainfall to investigate whether rainfall-related effects on fitness differ for early and late breeding individuals. Finally, we included the interaction between number of fledged young and rainfall in models of male parental survival. If rainfall effects on survival are mediated through an increase in effort, individuals with many young (i.e., higher effort) should be more vulnerable to rainfall. Including all combinations of those additional covariates resulted in candidate sets of nine models for fledging and recruitment success, and 17 models for male parental survival. Models were compared based on AIC values and AIC weights (Burnham and Anderson 
     <a rid="b9" ref-type="bibr" href="#b9">2002</a>). As a validation for the model selection in step 1, we then reran all of the top-ranked models in step 2 with the different rainfall parameters from step 1; in no cases did the model fit improve with other rainfall data, supporting the step 1 model selection procedure. We then also checked our assumption that the relationship between rainfall and fitness was linear by comparing the full model with a model that included a quadratic rainfall term; with the exception of fledging success, the quadratic term did not improve model fit. We report the quadratic rainfall effect for fledging success below.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nest visitation rates</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The number of feeding visits per hour was measured for 39 nests between 2007 and 2010 by data-loggers fitted into the entrance hole of the nest, recording all movements by parents in and out of the nest (for further details on the method, see Low et al. 
    <a rid="b25" ref-type="bibr" href="#b25">2008</a>). We derived a base model from Low et al. (
    <a rid="b25" ref-type="bibr" href="#b25">2008</a>) who found that nest visitation rates in this population depend on time of day (linked to prey activity) and ambient temperature. We included hour and its quadratic term, but as the mean hourly temperature closely follows the diurnal nest visitation pattern (Low et al. 
    <a rid="b25" ref-type="bibr" href="#b25">2008</a>), we did not include mean hourly temperature in the base model. We included nestling age and its quadratic term in the base model to account for age-dependent feeding visit rates. Because data were over-dispersed (over-dispersion = 7.5), we included an id-variable containing unique numbers for each observation (i.e., number of visits/hour) as a random factor. We also included nest identity as a random factor to account for dependencies within nests. We used generalized linear mixed models with a Poisson error distribution and a log link function. To investigate whether rainfall across the entire day (i.e., daily rainfall) or rainfall during preceding days affected nest visitation rates, we set up five candidate models including the base model (see above), and models including separately daily rainfall, amount of rainfall one the day before the day of visitation, over the 2 days before, and over the 3 days before. The latter three models also included daily rainfall on the day of visitation. We assessed these by AIC values and AIC weights.
