 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to compare dispersal rates across different African buffalo dispersal studies (Halley et al., 
  <a rid="ece35145-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35145-bib-0046">2002</a>; van Hooft et al., 
  <a rid="ece35145-bib-0082" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35145-bib-0082">2003</a>), we used a crude measure of number of individuals dispersing per year from the LS and CB. During the course of the four‐year study, 304 female African buffalo were captured and tracked—137 in the LS herd and 167 in the CB herds. Throughout the study period, 93 individuals (30.6%) dispersed, 54 from the LS herd and 39 from the CB area. Thus, 39.4% of LS animals and 23.4% of CB animals dispersed throughout the study period.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Owing to mortalities and dispersal, not all animals were in the study, or in their herd of origin, for the full study period of four years. Annual dispersal rates for each herd were therefore calculated as the number of dispersers observed in each herd, divided by the number of “buffalo‐years‐at‐risk” of dispersal from that herd. The number of buffalo‐years‐at‐risk of dispersal was calculated by scoring, for each buffalo, the duration from its first capture until it either died or left the herd. These individual observation periods were then added up for all buffalo observed in the herd, to give the total number of buffalo‐years‐at‐risk of dispersing. Dispersal rates thus expressed the annual per‐capita “risk” or likelihood of dispersing from a given herd, analogous to incidence rates in epidemiological studies.</p>
