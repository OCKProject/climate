 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dispersal rates</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The annual dispersal rate for the LS herd was higher at 19.2% than the annual dispersal rate of 14.5% in the CB area. This is much higher than the crude estimate one would arrive at by simply dividing the fraction of animals that dispersed (here, 30.6%) by the study duration of four years, that is, 7.6% overall, or 9.9% and 5.9% for the LS and CB herds, respectively. These crude estimates would be misleading because they erroneously assume that all buffalo, including dispersers and nondispersers, were observed in their herds of origin. Mean dispersal distance as determined by distance dispersed from the last capture location for the LS herd was 35.80 km (range: 2.23‐110.19 km, n = 52), while the mean dispersal distance from the CB herds was 25.68 km (range: 0.55‐98.81 km, n = 39) (Supporting information Figure
