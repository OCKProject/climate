 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adult dispersal was common in female African buffalo and appeared to be driven by resource restriction. Buffalo dispersed after the dry season, following prolonged resource restriction, and individuals in poor body condition were more likely to disperse. By contrast, none of the infectious diseases we diagnosed directly affected dispersal decisions in female adult buffalo. Buffalo thus appear to disperse as a mechanism for escaping resource limitation, which could occur due to external factors such as drought resulting in intraspecific competition in areas where buffalo populations are approaching seasonal carrying capacities. Matthysen (
  <a rid="ece35145-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35145-bib-0063">2012</a>) suggests that increased population density can modify habitat quality, influencing dispersal propensity, for example, western bluebirds (
  <span class="italic">Sialia mexicana</span>) produce more aggressive young with high dispersal propensity when nest cavities are limited (Potticary &amp; Duckworth, 
  <a rid="ece35145-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35145-bib-0071">2018</a>). Kapota et al. (
  <a rid="ece35145-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35145-bib-0056">2016</a>) in an experiment, restricting food sources, found an increased dispersal propensity in golden jackals (
  <span class="italic">Canis aureus</span>); however, under the same conditions red foxes (
  <span class="italic">Vulpes vulpes</span>) did not show an increased dispersal propensity. 
  <span class="italic">Erigone arctica</span> and 
  <span class="italic">E. dentiplapis</span> when starved also showed a decreased propensity to disperse (Bonte, Lukáč, &amp; Lens, 
  <a rid="ece35145-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35145-bib-0012">2008</a>), while increased density dependence did not impact female red deer (
  <span class="italic">Cervus elaphus</span>), but decreased male dispersal propensity and increased dispersal distance (Loe, Mysterud, Veiberg, &amp; Langvatn, 
  <a rid="ece35145-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35145-bib-0061">2009</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We observed slightly differing patterns in the study herds. In the LS herd, young buffalo were more likely to disperse, whereas both young buffalo and buffalo in poor condition were more likely to disperse in the CB herds. This pattern matches predictions from theoretical explorations of dispersal rates. For instance, Bonte and De La Peña (
  <a rid="ece35145-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35145-bib-0011">2009</a>) argued that dispersal rates would increase for individuals with higher body condition when there is connectivity across metapopulations as well as environmental variation and that individuals in good body condition may disperse to take advantage of low‐density areas that could offer increased breeding opportunities. Young buffalo in the LS herd were in relatively good condition but may have faced strong intraspecific competition for resources due to the hierarchical social structure of buffalo herds (Mloszewski, 
  <a rid="ece35145-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35145-bib-0067">1983</a>; Sinclair, 
  <a rid="ece35145-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35145-bib-0080">1977</a>). Bonte and De La Peña (
  <a rid="ece35145-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35145-bib-0011">2009</a>) predict that individuals in low body condition will disperse more frequently when mortality is high, and there is limited variation. Ryan, Knechtel, and Getz (
  <a rid="ece35145-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35145-bib-0078">2007</a>) theorized that a lack of resources associated with low rainfall years would lead to individual female buffalo becoming nonreproductive or dispersing to better habitat. This alternate pattern may explain why individuals in poor condition in the more resource‐limited CB herd were willing to risk dispersal; that is, both herds experience condition‐dependent dispersal (Ims &amp; Hjermann, 
  <a rid="ece35145-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35145-bib-0052">2001</a>). However, the underlying mechanisms differ.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Animal movements such as migration and dispersal offer individuals the opportunity to flee from infected habitats and thereby avoid highly infected individuals not able to migrate or disperse (Altizer, Bartel, &amp; Han, 
  <a rid="ece35145-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35145-bib-0002">2011</a>; Hall, Altizer, &amp; Bartel, 
  <a rid="ece35145-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35145-bib-0045">2014</a>). Conversely, it has been suggested that stressful movements, such as dispersal and migration, could potentially lower immunological function, making individuals more susceptible to infection (Bonte et al., 
  <a rid="ece35145-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35145-bib-0013">2012</a>). We found no direct effect of infectious diseases on the likelihood of dispersal in our study. However, the relationship we found between dispersal and condition, and the fact that schistosome burden in the data set with the full set of predictors contributed to the top model without having a direct effect, points to the possibility that some infectious diseases, especially chronic infections, could indirectly impact dispersal if they negatively affect body condition, for example, bovine tuberculosis (Caron et al., 
  <a rid="ece35145-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35145-bib-0020">2003</a>) and GI parasites (Beechler et al., 
  <a rid="ece35145-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35145-bib-0008">2017</a>; Budischak et al., 
  <a rid="ece35145-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35145-bib-0018">2012</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we have reported one of the most extensive studies on dispersal in a large mammal species, recording 550 buffalo years and 93 dispersal events over a four‐year observation period. Although there has been a number of studies showing a link between resource limitation and dispersal large ungulates (Gaillard et al., 
  <a rid="ece35145-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35145-bib-0036">2008</a>; Loe et al., 
  <a rid="ece35145-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35145-bib-0061">2009</a>), our study revealed, for the first time, a tight link between resource limitation and dispersal decisions in a subtropical, social ungulate. Adult buffalo appear to disperse in an attempt to outrun unfavourable resource conditions, which can cause loss of body condition and potentially, fitness. In the context of subtropical climates, where season and interannual variation in forage availability are largely driven by rainfall patterns, our results suggest that dispersal patterns for buffalo and possibly other large herbivores may change fundamentally due to anthropogenic climate change and surface water management. Most (80%) climate projections suggest that southern Africa will have increased temperatures, reduced rainfall, and later onset of rains (James &amp; Washington, 
  <a rid="ece35145-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35145-bib-0053">2013</a>). Our study suggests that such changes would increase adult dispersal rates in African buffalo, with likely consequences for disease spread. As such, future research should address effects of dispersal on fitness‐related variables such as lifetime reproductive potential, survival, genetic diversity of offspring, and resistance to infection.
