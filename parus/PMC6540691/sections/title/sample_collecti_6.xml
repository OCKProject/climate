 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Age, condition, pregnancy, and lactation status were recorded for all recaptured buffalo, and the experimental individuals received the Panacur bolus. Blood was collected via jugular venipuncture into 10‐ml EDTA‐coated vacutainer tubes, placed on ice, and transported to Veterinary Wildlife Services (VWS) laboratory in Skukuza, KNP. Feces were collected rectally and transported back to the laboratory in a cooler with ice packs. Age was determined by tooth eruption up to 5 years and then judged by tooth wear (Grimsdell,
