 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the purpose of this study, we defined dispersers as “individual buffalo that were recorded outside of their herd of origin's home range and were joined with another herd, not returning to their herd of origin for at least one season.” A limitation of this study is that individual buffalo were not monitored from conception, and therefore, a distinction between natal and adult dispersal cannot be made. For each herd, GPS locations from the satellite collars were mapped in ArcMap 10.1 (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc., Redlands, CA) and home ranges estimated for each of the original herds using a minimum convex polygon (Worton, 
  <a rid="ece35145-bib-0086" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35145-bib-0086">1987</a>) in Hawth's Tools (Beyer, 
  <a rid="ece35145-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35145-bib-0010">2004</a>). This analysis assumed that buffalo with satellite collars accurately reflected the position of the entire herd. Home ranges were estimated separately for the wet season (October to March) and the dry season (April to September) in each year from September 2009 to August 2012.
