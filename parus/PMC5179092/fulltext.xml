We used satellite tracking to study na&#x000ef;ve migrating common cuckoos. Juvenile cuckoos left breeding sites in Finland moving slowly and less consistently directed than adult cuckoos. Migration of the juveniles (N = 5) was initiated later than adults (N = 20), was directed toward the southwest&#x02013;significantly different from the initial southeast direction of adults&#x02013;and included strikingly long Baltic Sea crossings (N = 3). After initial migration of juvenile cuckoos toward Poland, the migration direction changed and proceeded due south, directly toward the winter grounds, as revealed by a single tag transmitting until arrival in Northwest Angola where northern adult cuckoos regularly winter. Compared to adults, the juvenile travelled straighter and faster, potentially correcting for wind drift along the route. That both migration route and timing differed from adults indicates that juvenile cuckoos are able to reach proper wintering grounds independently, guided only by their innate migration programme.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Danish Council for Independent Research</institution></funding-source><award-id>1323-00048B</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thorup</surname><given-names>Kasper</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Danish National Research Foundation</institution></funding-source><award-id>DNRF96</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thorup</surname><given-names>Kasper</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Czech Science Foundation</institution></funding-source><award-id>P506/12/2404</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sama&#x00161;</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004412</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGY69/07</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grim</surname><given-names>Tom&#x000e1;&#x00161;</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004412</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGY83/12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grim</surname><given-names>Tom&#x000e1;&#x00161;</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award006"><funding-source><institution>Academy of Finland</institution></funding-source><award-id>#138049</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thomson</surname><given-names>Robert L.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award007"><funding-source><institution>Research Council of Norway</institution></funding-source><award-id>218144</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fossoy</surname><given-names>Frode</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>KT, MLV, and MW were supported by The Danish Council for Independent Research through support to the MATCH project (1323-00048B) and Danish National Research Foundation through support to the Center for Macroecology, Evolution and Climate (DNRF96).

Juvenile long-distance migrants of most nocturnal land-birds presumably migrate solitarily and without guidance from adults [<xref rid="pone.0168940.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0168940.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Documenting whether juvenile migrants travel independently of adults and whether they follow the same routes as adults has not been possible for smaller species because the necessary technology was unavailable [<xref rid="pone.0168940.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Similarly, lack of suitable technology has hindered the study of how the inherited spatiotemporal guiding programme unfolds in free-flying individuals, for instance in route learning [<xref rid="pone.0168940.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and dealing with wind drift [<xref rid="pone.0168940.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Common cuckoos <italic>Cuculus canorus</italic> are long-distance migrants wintering in Tropical Africa [<xref rid="pone.0168940.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Because the cuckoo is an obligate brood parasite, there is presumably no contact between young and their biological parents after egg laying. It is thus assumed that soon after fledging, young cuckoos travel on their own [<xref rid="pone.0168940.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], but to date this conjecture has not been supported with data. Therefore, young are thought to travel on their first migration without learning from experienced birds [<xref rid="pone.0168940.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Of more than 19,000 common cuckoos ringed in Europe, only two birds ringed as young have been recorded from south of the Sahara (in Cameroon and Togo; [<xref rid="pone.0168940.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168940.s003">S1 Table</xref>). Moreover, such single-point data provide no information on the route travelled.</p><p>Here, we map for the first time the movements and migration of juvenile cuckoos after fledging from nests in Finland using satellite-based radio telemetry. We describe the spatiotemporal progress of the first migration of the juveniles and compare this with the migration of experienced conspecifics. Our specific aims are to determine whether juvenile and adult cuckoos follow the same route and whether juveniles are potentially guided by experienced conspecifics on migration. We focus our analyses on spatiotemporal overlap in migration routes with adult cuckoos from nearby breeding grounds in North Scandinavia (northern adults; [<xref rid="pone.0168940.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]). In addition, we investigate the spatiotemporal overlap with published tracks of adult cuckoos from South Scandinavia (southern adults; [<xref rid="pone.0168940.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]), because our data showed that the initial migration of the juvenile cuckoos deviated from the northern adults, and that juveniles travelled toward stopover sites used by southern adults. To investigate spatiotemporal overlap between juveniles and adults, we specifically compare (i) initial migration direction, (ii) sea-crossing, (iii) geometry of tracks, including longitudes (northern adults only) and straightness (all adults), and (iv) timing of autumn migration periods.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Catching and satellite tagging of cuckoos was permitted by Regional Environmental Centres in Ruokolahti (KASELY/353/07.01/2010) and Oulu (POPELY/166/07.01/2014) and by the Finnish Museum of Natural History (ringing permits 2784, 2836, 2973).

Individual stopover sites were estimated as average locations within the stationary periods as described in [<xref rid="pone.0168940.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Due to non-daily transmissions, departure and arrival dates were rarely strictly identifiable, and we used last and first (respectively) days within the region/site. We defined arrival on the winter grounds as when the birds reached the southernmost stationary position.</p><p>We calculated initial migration directions using the mean flight directions after individuals crossed a distance of 100 km (Number of juveniles, N<sub>Y</sub> = 5; Number of adults, N<sub>A</sub> = 20) from breeding sites. For two juveniles and one adult from Finland, the initial movements were considered pre-migratory movements, but the general direction in which the birds left the breeding grounds was consistent from these movements. The directedness of sample orientations for the individuals of each group was tested with a Rayleigh test. The difference in initial direction between juveniles and adults was tested with a Watson-Williams test (tests based on distances 20&#x02013;500 km led to similar results except that the directions of juveniles were more scattered at 20 km).</p><p>We judged sea-crossing behaviour directly from the maps. Because positions are spaced in time, proof of actual sea-crossings can be hard to obtain. We considered accurate positions over water or islands that connected positions over land on both sides of the Baltic Sea to be proof of a sea-crossing. We estimated potential individual sea-crossing distances as consecutive loxodromic distances between the last location before crossing, and the first location after crossing the Baltic. We subtracted the parts of these distances that occurred over continental land. We also compared the potential sea-crossing distances, irrespective of whether sea-crossing was considered proven or not, between adults and juveniles based on the shortest routes.</p><p>Differences in the geometry of juvenile and adult tracks were also tested. First, longitudes of migration routes were compared between the juveniles (N<sub>Y</sub> = 3) and northern adult cuckoos (N<sub>NA</sub> = 6) at the southernmost latitude of migration where there were still three juvenile cuckoos migrating (55&#x000b0;N, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168940.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). Second, for latitudes ranging from the North European stopovers to the southern edge of Sahel (7&#x000b0;N) where the adults followed a detoured route, we compared route deviations in the juvenile (N<sub>Y</sub> = 1) and the adults (N<sub>A</sub> = 10, only from year 2010). We calculated deviations from the direct loxodromic route from breeding to wintering grounds for each individual. Interpolated locations were calculated on the loxodromic routes using the latitudes of the location estimates of each track and the longitudes of the loxodromic routes at each of these latitudes. Route deviations were calculated as the horizontal distance from the location estimates of the tracks to the interpolated locations and tested using a Wilcoxon test. For the migration leg south of the Sahel (7&#x000b0;N), we only compared directions to the winter grounds of juvenile and adult cuckoos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168940.g001">Fig 1D</xref>) because there was no detour in adults and other differences could not be tested due to low sample size (N<sub>Y</sub> = 1; N<sub>A</sub> = 16).</p><p>Evaluation of differences in total migration duration and timing of the different stages for juveniles and adult cuckoos was based on descriptive measures because of low sample sizes (<xref rid="pone.0168940.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168940.s004">S2 Table</xref>).

The stopover of the one juvenile reaching the Sahel was in North-East Nigeria, about 840 km west of that used by adult birds but on the same latitudinal range.

Our results suggest that young common cuckoos possess an innate migration programme enabling successful migration to wintering grounds independently of adults. The migration pattern of juvenile common cuckoos was similar to that of adults, including stopover and wintering latitudes. In contrast to adults, juveniles left the breeding sites slowly and with less consistently directed movements. Also, their flight directions differed and sea-crossings were more extensive than in adult birds. Migration was more westerly in juvenile birds; initially on a southwest course which later turned south from the stopover in North-Central Europe. Timing of migration for juveniles was later than adults throughout the period, however, after the stopover in North-Central Europe, migration to wintering grounds was completed faster by juveniles, resulting in the arrival at the winter grounds shortly after adults.</p><p>Some juvenile cuckoos showed extensive pre-migratory movements that have not been characteristic in adult cuckoos. These pre-migratory movements in the juvenile birds resulted in initial dispersal across vast areas prior to directed migration. Such dispersal may be related to exploration of potential future breeding sites [<xref rid="pone.0168940.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], training orientation senses [<xref rid="pone.0168940.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0168940.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] or finding future stopover sites [<xref rid="pone.0168940.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], but our data do not allow separation of these possibilities.</p><p>Juvenile cuckoos also showed extensive sea-crossings, uncharacteristic of migration in adult cuckoos. Extended sea-crossings by juveniles may seem surprising, but assuming that fewer predators are hunting at sea, this could be a predator-avoidance strategy. This driver has been suggested for bar-tailed godwit <italic>Limosa lapponica</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0168940.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] with juvenile birds potentially more at risk than adults. However, given the apparent mortality during sea-crossing (two juveniles stopped transmitting during the extended crossings) and the generally shorter crossings in adults, these sea-crossings appear disadvantageous. Similar longer sea-crossings were found in juvenile Eurasian honey buzzards <italic>Pernis apivorus</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0168940.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0168940.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and Egyptian vultures [<xref rid="pone.0168940.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] compared to adults, also with higher apparent mortality for juveniles.</p><p>The initial south-westerly orientation fits the migration direction of redstarts, the cuckoo&#x02019;s local host species. However, juvenile cuckoos apparently migrated before redstarts [<xref rid="pone.0168940.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] making it unlikely that the juveniles followed their foster parents. In Europe, migration direction changed clockwise in adults whereas in juveniles it changed counter-clockwise, resulting in southward directed movements in both groups before leaving Europe. It seems unlikely that the different migration in juveniles was caused by them belonging to a separate cuckoo gens, characterised by laying blue eggs, using another migration route [<xref rid="pone.0168940.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This is supported by the fact that the migration of the two adults, presumably from the same gens as the juveniles, did not differ markedly from the other adults.</p><p>The differences in orientation that we found between juveniles and adults imply that young cuckoos change their route in later migrations&#x02013;likely before their second year since tracks of second year cuckoos show migration route orientation similar to older adults [<xref rid="pone.0168940.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Age-specific route orientations suggest an adaptive change only available to adults. Age-dependent differences in migration strategies, likely arising from social learning added to the genetic programme, are documented in a few larger, mostly diurnally, migrating species such as the Eurasian honey buzzards <italic>Pernis apivorus</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0168940.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0168940.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Our study suggests the potential of juvenile birds to travel straight south even when facing crosswinds. This contrasts with expectations that juveniles are expected to be less able to compensate for crosswinds compared to adults [<xref rid="pone.0168940.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Juveniles are also generally expected to show more scattered flight directions than adults during autumn migration [<xref rid="pone.0168940.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0168940.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0168940.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0168940.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Nevertheless, the straight southward directed part of the route and the faster migration of the juvenile cuckoo suggests it relied on inherited directional guiding to reach the wintering area. Potential compensation could be based on simple (sign) navigation using celestial and geomagnetic cues as found in displaced juvenile songbirds [<xref rid="pone.0168940.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0168940.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, the completed autumn migration of the juvenile cuckoo suggests that the genetic migration programme allowed it to reach the population-specific winter grounds despite traveling in different directions and timing than adults. Life-time tracks of inexperienced birds displaced over a suite of distances are needed to understand whether learning or innate programme or a combination is required for flexibility <italic>en route</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec010"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0168940.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Supplementary Wind Analysis.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0168940.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0168940.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Tracking Data.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0168940.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0168940.s003"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Number of ringed common cuckoos per country and country where southernmost recovery was obtained.</title><p>Ringing periods are shown in the country column.
