 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Five juvenile cuckoos were considered to have reached independence and to have departed the breeding grounds (i.e. positions &gt;20 km from the breeding grounds). Of these, two individuals covered considerable distances during pre-migratory movements (1541 and 832 km; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168940.g001" href="#pone.0168940.g001">Fig 1B</a>). Movement was initially toward southwest and two of three birds leaving Finland evidently crossed the Baltic Sea for extended distances (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168940.g001" href="#pone.0168940.g001">Fig 1B</a>). The single juvenile cuckoo tag transmitting after the juveniles left Northern Europe revealed straight southward migration from Northern Europe (183°). From Poland this bird stopped over in the Sahel before reaching the wintering area in Angola (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168940.g001" href="#pone.0168940.g001">Fig 1A</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The initial movement direction of juveniles was 230° (100 km from breeding sites: N = 5, r = 0.98, P = 0.002; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168940.g001" href="#pone.0168940.g001">Fig 1C</a>), which was significantly different (P &lt; 0.001, F
  <sub>1, 23</sub> = 27.8) from the initial direction of all adults of 143° (N = 20, r = 0.86, P &lt; 0.001; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168940.g001" href="#pone.0168940.g001">Fig 1C</a>). Potential sea-crossing distances in juvenile birds (N = 3, 765 ± 264 km [mean ± SD]; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168940.g001" href="#pone.0168940.g001">Fig 1B</a>) were longer than those of northern adult birds (N = 6, 263 ± 333 km) that to a large degree circumvented the Baltic Sea, and also longer than those of southern adults (N = 14, 204 ± 46 km). The North-Central European stopover used by the juvenile birds was in the same area as that used by southern adults, which was 600 km west of the area used by northern adults. The stopover of the one juvenile reaching the Sahel was in North-East Nigeria, about 840 km west of that used by adult birds but on the same latitudinal range. The juvenile bird wintered in the same area as the Scandinavian adults, west of where the Finnish adult wintered in Congo (

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In northern Europe, the juveniles (N = 3) migrated further west than the northern adults (N = 6, t = -6.9, df = 7, P &lt; 0.001, two sample t-test). From the North European stopovers to the southern edge of the Sahel, adult birds (N = 10) migrated less directly (for all individuals, positions were significantly, P &lt; 0.001, east of the direct loxodromic route, except for one individual that was not significantly different, P = 0.20) than the juvenile (P = 0.08, N = 10 positions). Positions of the adults were east of those of the juvenile (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168940.g001" href="#pone.0168940.g001">Fig 1A</a>). After leaving the Sahel, the adult birds changed direction to southwest and the winter grounds (N = 16, α = 200°, r = 0.98, P &lt; 0.001), while the juvenile flew toward 176° (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168940.g001" href="#pone.0168940.g001">Fig 1D</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Migration duration was similar for the juvenile (from initiation to Angola in 134 days) and adults (N = 16 tracks, 131 ± 22 days, 95% CI: 120–141 days). Juveniles timed all migration stages later than adults, on average. For the initiation of migration, there was a clear difference (strongly supported by the bootstrap replicates with fewer than 1 in 1000 showing as large a difference). The juvenile migrated faster after leaving Europe and arrived at a similar time as adults to the final winter grounds (

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168940.g002" href="#pone.0168940.g002">Fig 2</a>; no difference in bootstrap replicates). Compared to the adults, initiation of migration was delayed (on average 34 ± 7 days; 
  <a rid="pone.0168940.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0168940.t001">Table 1</a>) by pre-migratory movements in two juveniles, but the juvenile completing autumn migration showed no pre-migratory movements (
