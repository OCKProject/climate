  <a rid="pone.0168940.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref019">19</a>]. Several birds moved back and forth for some time after independence with no consistent direction of movement. We termed this the pre-migration period and defined it as the period after reaching independence until movement was consistently southward (

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Timing (mean date ± SD) and duration (days) of different stages during autumn migration of adult and juvenile cuckoos. NC = North Central. Data on North Swedish adults from [
     <a rid="pone.0168940.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref012">12</a>] and Danish and South Swedish adults from [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We defined a stopover as when a bird interrupted migration for more than five days. Individual stopover sites were estimated as average locations within the stationary periods as described in [
  <a rid="pone.0168940.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref013">13</a>]. Due to non-daily transmissions, departure and arrival dates were rarely strictly identifiable, and we used last and first (respectively) days within the region/site. We defined arrival on the winter grounds as when the birds reached the southernmost stationary position.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We calculated initial migration directions using the mean flight directions after individuals crossed a distance of 100 km (Number of juveniles, N
  <sub>Y</sub> = 5; Number of adults, N
  <sub>A</sub> = 20) from breeding sites. For two juveniles and one adult from Finland, the initial movements were considered pre-migratory movements, but the general direction in which the birds left the breeding grounds was consistent from these movements. The directedness of sample orientations for the individuals of each group was tested with a Rayleigh test. The difference in initial direction between juveniles and adults was tested with a Watson-Williams test (tests based on distances 20–500 km led to similar results except that the directions of juveniles were more scattered at 20 km).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We judged sea-crossing behaviour directly from the maps. Because positions are spaced in time, proof of actual sea-crossings can be hard to obtain. We considered accurate positions over water or islands that connected positions over land on both sides of the Baltic Sea to be proof of a sea-crossing. We estimated potential individual sea-crossing distances as consecutive loxodromic distances between the last location before crossing, and the first location after crossing the Baltic. We subtracted the parts of these distances that occurred over continental land. We also compared the potential sea-crossing distances, irrespective of whether sea-crossing was considered proven or not, between adults and juveniles based on the shortest routes.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Differences in the geometry of juvenile and adult tracks were also tested. First, longitudes of migration routes were compared between the juveniles (N
  <sub>Y</sub> = 3) and northern adult cuckoos (N
  <sub>NA</sub> = 6) at the southernmost latitude of migration where there were still three juvenile cuckoos migrating (55°N, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168940.g001" href="#pone.0168940.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</a>). Second, for latitudes ranging from the North European stopovers to the southern edge of Sahel (7°N) where the adults followed a detoured route, we compared route deviations in the juvenile (N
  <sub>Y</sub> = 1) and the adults (N
  <sub>A</sub> = 10, only from year 2010). We calculated deviations from the direct loxodromic route from breeding to wintering grounds for each individual. Interpolated locations were calculated on the loxodromic routes using the latitudes of the location estimates of each track and the longitudes of the loxodromic routes at each of these latitudes. Route deviations were calculated as the horizontal distance from the location estimates of the tracks to the interpolated locations and tested using a Wilcoxon test. For the migration leg south of the Sahel (7°N), we only compared directions to the winter grounds of juvenile and adult cuckoos (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168940.g001" href="#pone.0168940.g001">Fig 1D</a>) because there was no detour in adults and other differences could not be tested due to low sample size (N
  <sub>Y</sub> = 1; N
  <sub>A</sub> = 16).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evaluation of differences in total migration duration and timing of the different stages for juveniles and adult cuckoos was based on descriptive measures because of low sample sizes (
  <a rid="pone.0168940.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0168940.t001">Table 1</a>, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168940.s004" href="#pone.0168940.s004">S2 Table</a>). We estimated the mean difference and standard deviation in timing based on all pair-wise inter-age-class differences and compared observed mean difference by randomly resampling from pooled adult and juvenile timing (1,000 bootstrap replicates). Potential effects of wind during migration were considered for initial migration as well as for the migration from North-Central Europe to the sub-Sahel (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168940.s001" href="#pone.0168940.s001">S1 File</a>). We used R 3.1.2 [
