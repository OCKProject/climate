 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evidence about actual migration in solitary, nocturnal migrant birds is scarce and even mapping the spatiotemporal migration routes of individuals has only been accomplished for a few species [
  <a rid="pone.0168940.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref001">1</a>]. Juvenile long-distance migrants of most nocturnal land-birds presumably migrate solitarily and without guidance from adults [

  <a rid="pone.0168940.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref004">4</a>]. Documenting whether juvenile migrants travel independently of adults and whether they follow the same routes as adults has not been possible for smaller species because the necessary technology was unavailable [
  <a rid="pone.0168940.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref005">5</a>]. Similarly, lack of suitable technology has hindered the study of how the inherited spatiotemporal guiding programme unfolds in free-flying individuals, for instance in route learning [
  <a rid="pone.0168940.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref006">6</a>] and dealing with wind drift [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Common cuckoos 
  <span class="italic">Cuculus canorus</span> are long-distance migrants wintering in Tropical Africa [
  <a rid="pone.0168940.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref008">8</a>]. Because the cuckoo is an obligate brood parasite, there is presumably no contact between young and their biological parents after egg laying. It is thus assumed that soon after fledging, young cuckoos travel on their own [
  <a rid="pone.0168940.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref009">9</a>], but to date this conjecture has not been supported with data. Therefore, young are thought to travel on their first migration without learning from experienced birds [
  <a rid="pone.0168940.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref010">10</a>]. Of more than 19,000 common cuckoos ringed in Europe, only two birds ringed as young have been recorded from south of the Sahara (in Cameroon and Togo; [

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168940.s003" href="#pone.0168940.s003">S1 Table</a>). Moreover, such single-point data provide no information on the route travelled.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we map for the first time the movements and migration of juvenile cuckoos after fledging from nests in Finland using satellite-based radio telemetry. We describe the spatiotemporal progress of the first migration of the juveniles and compare this with the migration of experienced conspecifics. Our specific aims are to determine whether juvenile and adult cuckoos follow the same route and whether juveniles are potentially guided by experienced conspecifics on migration. We focus our analyses on spatiotemporal overlap in migration routes with adult cuckoos from nearby breeding grounds in North Scandinavia (northern adults; [
  <a rid="pone.0168940.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref012">12</a>]). In addition, we investigate the spatiotemporal overlap with published tracks of adult cuckoos from South Scandinavia (southern adults; [
  <a rid="pone.0168940.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref013">13</a>]), because our data showed that the initial migration of the juvenile cuckoos deviated from the northern adults, and that juveniles travelled toward stopover sites used by southern adults. To investigate spatiotemporal overlap between juveniles and adults, we specifically compare (i) initial migration direction, (ii) sea-crossing, (iii) geometry of tracks, including longitudes (northern adults only) and straightness (all adults), and (iv) timing of autumn migration periods.
