 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Catching and satellite tagging of cuckoos was permitted by Regional Environmental Centres in Ruokolahti (KASELY/353/07.01/2010) and Oulu (POPELY/166/07.01/2014) and by the Finnish Museum of Natural History (ringing permits 2784, 2836, 2973). Catching was carried out on private lands with permission from landowners. The study did not involve any endangered or protected species. Adults were caught with mist nets and young were taken in nest boxes. Blood sampling for sexing the cuckoos was permitted by the Finnish National Animal Experiment Board (permits ESAVI/2846/04.10.03/2012 and ESAVI/3221/04.10.07/2013). All sampling procedures and experimental manipulations were reviewed as part of obtaining the above-mentioned permits.</p>
