 <p>Tracks of juveniles from Finland (red), northern adults (N adults; North Sweden and Finland; blue) and southern adults (S adults; Denmark and South Sweden; grey) with tagging and wintering sites (green and white triangles, respectively), and end of transmission (white circles) indicated. (A) Migration from breeding to wintering grounds and (B) details of initial movements with different red tinge for each juvenile cuckoo. Best quality locations for each duty cycle (dots) connected with lines. Horizontal lines at 55°N and 50°N indicate the band used to define entering and leaving, respectively, the NC Europe stopover. The line at 7°N defines leaving the Sahel. (C) Initial travel directions from breeding sites after moving 100 km and (D) travel directions (N and S adults; black) after leaving the Sahel. Each dot indicates the direction of one individual. Lines are group mean directions with 95% confidence interval. Data on North Swedish adults from [
