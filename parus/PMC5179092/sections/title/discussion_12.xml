 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study provides the first detailed tracking data describing the first migration in a smaller, nocturnal long-distance migrant. Our results suggest that young common cuckoos possess an innate migration programme enabling successful migration to wintering grounds independently of adults. The migration pattern of juvenile common cuckoos was similar to that of adults, including stopover and wintering latitudes. In contrast to adults, juveniles left the breeding sites slowly and with less consistently directed movements. Also, their flight directions differed and sea-crossings were more extensive than in adult birds. Migration was more westerly in juvenile birds; initially on a southwest course which later turned south from the stopover in North-Central Europe. Timing of migration for juveniles was later than adults throughout the period, however, after the stopover in North-Central Europe, migration to wintering grounds was completed faster by juveniles, resulting in the arrival at the winter grounds shortly after adults.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some juvenile cuckoos showed extensive pre-migratory movements that have not been characteristic in adult cuckoos. These pre-migratory movements in the juvenile birds resulted in initial dispersal across vast areas prior to directed migration. Such dispersal may be related to exploration of potential future breeding sites [

  <a rid="pone.0168940.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref026">26</a>] or finding future stopover sites [
  <a rid="pone.0168940.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref027">27</a>], but our data do not allow separation of these possibilities.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Juvenile cuckoos also showed extensive sea-crossings, uncharacteristic of migration in adult cuckoos. Extended sea-crossings by juveniles may seem surprising, but assuming that fewer predators are hunting at sea, this could be a predator-avoidance strategy. This driver has been suggested for bar-tailed godwit 
  <span class="italic">Limosa lapponica</span> [
  <a rid="pone.0168940.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref028">28</a>] with juvenile birds potentially more at risk than adults. However, given the apparent mortality during sea-crossing (two juveniles stopped transmitting during the extended crossings) and the generally shorter crossings in adults, these sea-crossings appear disadvantageous. Similar longer sea-crossings were found in juvenile Eurasian honey buzzards 
  <span class="italic">Pernis apivorus</span> [
  <a rid="pone.0168940.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref029">29</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0168940.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref030">30</a>] and Egyptian vultures [
  <a rid="pone.0168940.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref020">20</a>] compared to adults, also with higher apparent mortality for juveniles.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The initial south-westerly orientation fits the migration direction of redstarts, the cuckoo’s local host species. However, juvenile cuckoos apparently migrated before redstarts [
  <a rid="pone.0168940.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref031">31</a>] making it unlikely that the juveniles followed their foster parents. In Europe, migration direction changed clockwise in adults whereas in juveniles it changed counter-clockwise, resulting in southward directed movements in both groups before leaving Europe. It seems unlikely that the different migration in juveniles was caused by them belonging to a separate cuckoo gens, characterised by laying blue eggs, using another migration route [
  <a rid="pone.0168940.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref032">32</a>]. This is supported by the fact that the migration of the two adults, presumably from the same gens as the juveniles, did not differ markedly from the other adults.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The differences in orientation that we found between juveniles and adults imply that young cuckoos change their route in later migrations–likely before their second year since tracks of second year cuckoos show migration route orientation similar to older adults [
  <a rid="pone.0168940.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref013">13</a>]. Age-specific route orientations suggest an adaptive change only available to adults. Age-dependent differences in migration strategies, likely arising from social learning added to the genetic programme, are documented in a few larger, mostly diurnally, migrating species such as the Eurasian honey buzzards 
  <span class="italic">Pernis apivorus</span> [
  <a rid="pone.0168940.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref029">29</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0168940.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref030">30</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study suggests the potential of juvenile birds to travel straight south even when facing crosswinds. This contrasts with expectations that juveniles are expected to be less able to compensate for crosswinds compared to adults [
  <a rid="pone.0168940.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref033">33</a>]. Juveniles are also generally expected to show more scattered flight directions than adults during autumn migration [
  <a rid="pone.0168940.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref013">13</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0168940.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref027">27</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0168940.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref029">29</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0168940.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref034">34</a>]. Nevertheless, the straight southward directed part of the route and the faster migration of the juvenile cuckoo suggests it relied on inherited directional guiding to reach the wintering area. Potential compensation could be based on simple (sign) navigation using celestial and geomagnetic cues as found in displaced juvenile songbirds [
  <a rid="pone.0168940.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref007">7</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0168940.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref035">35</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, the completed autumn migration of the juvenile cuckoo suggests that the genetic migration programme allowed it to reach the population-specific winter grounds despite traveling in different directions and timing than adults. Life-time tracks of inexperienced birds displaced over a suite of distances are needed to understand whether learning or innate programme or a combination is required for flexibility
