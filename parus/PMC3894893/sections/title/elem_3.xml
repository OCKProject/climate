 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Six basic approaches might be considered for inferring genetic change: ‘animal model’ analyses, common-garden studies, comparison to model predictions, experimental evolution, space-for-time substitutions, and molecular genetic change (Table 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a>). Each of these methods has its own strengths and weaknesses, and some allow more robust inferences than do others.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Animal model analyses</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This quantitative genetic approach is based on temporal changes in estimates of mean breeding values (i.e., ‘genotypic values’) for phenotypic traits. The strength of this approach is that it specifically quantifies genetic shifts while controlling for plasticity (e.g., Réale et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b87" href="#b87">2003</a>). A major limitation is that doing so requires pedigree data, which is usually available only in long-term studies of individually marked (or genotyped) vertebrate populations (e.g., Réale et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b87" href="#b87">2003</a>; Charmantier et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" href="#b16">2008</a>). Additional shortcomings can include problems in the estimation and interpretation of changes in mean breeding values. In particular, it sometimes can be difficult to ascertain whether observed trends – or the lack thereof – are biologically meaningful as opposed to methodological artifacts (Postma 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b84" href="#b84">2006</a>; Hadfield et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">2010</a>). When these problems can be overcome by suitable data and appropriate methods, the animal model remains one of the best approaches for evaluating the genetic basis of phenotypic change in a climate change context. In the present special issue, animal models are emphasized in the contributions of Charmantier and Gienapp (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">2014</a>), Boutin and Lane (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" href="#b10">2014</a>), and Teplitsky and Millien (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Common-garden studies</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to isolate genetic contributions to trait differences, individuals of known family background can be reared/raised/grown under common laboratory or field conditions (Conover and Schultz 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">1995</a>; Blanquart et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" href="#b8">2013</a>). In allochronic contexts, this approach can be implemented in two basic procedures. First, populations for which common-garden studies were conducted in the past can be re-analyzed with new common-garden studies in the present. This approach was used to demonstrate climate-associated genetic shifts in the phenology of pitcher-plant mosquitoes (
   <span class="italic">Wyeomyia smithii</span>; Bradshaw and Holzapfel 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" href="#b11">2001</a>). A difficulty in implementing such studies that the past common-garden environment needs to be very accurately replicated in the new experiment. Second, organisms with dormant stages, such as aquatic invertebrates with resting eggs (e.g., 
   <span class="italic">Daphnia</span>, Cousyn et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" href="#b20">2001</a>) or plants with long-lasting seeds (e.g., Franks et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">2007</a>), can be resurrected from the past for direct comparison to individuals from the present. In either procedure, it is important to control for maternal effects and to recognize that genotype-by-environment interactions can make extrapolation to the natural environment difficult. In the present special issue, allochronic common-garden studies figure most heavily in the contributions of Stoks et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b100" href="#b100">2014</a>) and Franks et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" href="#b31">2014</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparison to model predictions</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This approach compares observed phenotypic trends to predictions from evolutionary models, such as the breeder's equation or its multivariate equivalent (Lynch and Walsh 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b70" href="#b70">1998</a>). Specifically, selection and additive genetic (co)variances are measured and used to predict evolutionary responses. If observed trends match predicted trends, then adaptive genetic change is inferred (e.g., Swain et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b102" href="#b102">2007</a>; Crozier et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">2011</a>). Several concerns attend this method. First, it is difficult to accurately measure selection in nature (Kingsolver et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b55" href="#b55">2001</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b56" href="#b56">2012</a>; Kruuk et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b58" href="#b58">2003</a>; Hersch and Phillips 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b44" href="#b44">2004</a>; Morrissey and Hadfield 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b76" href="#b76">2012</a>). Second, it is even more difficult to accurately estimate additive genetic (co)variances (Lynch and Walsh 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b70" href="#b70">1998</a>), not the least because they vary with environmental conditions (Hoffmann and Merilä 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" href="#b46">1999</a>). Third, a large number of other assumptions attend these predictive models (Merilä et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b75" href="#b75">2001</a>; Morrissey et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b77" href="#b77">2010</a>). Given these difficulties, it is perhaps not surprising that predicted and observed evolutionary responses are often (although not always) poorly matched in natural populations (Merilä et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b75" href="#b75">2001</a>; Kruuk et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b59" href="#b59">2008</a>). In the present special issue, comparisons to model predictions are mentioned by Crozier and Hutchings (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">2014</a>) and models of evolution in response to climate change are reviewed by Kopp and Matuszewskib (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b57" href="#b57">2014</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Experimental evolution</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The basic idea here is to establish experimental populations exposed to different environmental conditions, such as warming temperature (e.g., Van Doorslaer et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b108" href="#b108">2007</a>), increasing CO
   <sub>2</sub> (e.g., Collins and Bell 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">2004</a>), or acidification (e.g., Lohbeck et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b68" href="#b68">2012</a>). After a period of evolution under these conditions, the different populations can be compared under common conditions to quantify any genetically based phenotypic change, and they can be genotyped to uncover its genetic underpinnings (Kawecki et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b53" href="#b53">2012</a>). A major strength of this approach is that, with appropriate replication and controls, it can confirm evolution in response to a specific environmental factor (discussed in more detail later). One limitation of this approach is that logistical constraints often restrict it to small organisms with short generation times. Another limitation is that it cannot provide confirmation that evolution has actually occurred in natural (as opposed to experimental) populations – it is instead a ‘proof-of-principle’ inferential method. This last concern can be somewhat lessened by conducting experiments with natural populations in natural environments – such as in the case of experimental introductions (Reznick and Ghalambor 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b91" href="#b91">2005</a>). In the present special issue, the utility of experimental evolution studies in the context of climate change is especially highlighted by Reusch (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b89" href="#b89">2014</a>) and Collins et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">2004</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Space-for-time substitution</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most environmental factors that vary in time also vary in space, and – as explained above – inferences in space (synchronic) are far easier than inferences in time (allochronic). A tempting approach therefore has been to find spatial associations between environmental factors and phenotypes that match the temporal associations for which inferences are desired. If common-garden or reciprocal transplant studies show a genetic basis for phenotypic differences in space, then it might seem reasonable to infer the same for the variation in time. The limitation, of course, is that demonstrating an effect in one situation does not necessarily mean that the same effect holds in another situation (as is the case for experimental evolution), and temporal – as opposed to spatial – environmental changes might be occurring faster than evolution can respond. Fukami and Wardle (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">2010</a>) provide a good account of the assumptions and potential problems related to space-for-time substitution in ecological studies, many of which are relevant also for evolutionary studies. At present, space-for-time substitutions are the most common – and sometimes only – basis for inference in some taxonomic groups, such as fish (Crozier and Hutchings 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">2014</a>), marine animals and plants (Reusch 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b89" href="#b89">2014</a>), and amphibians and reptiles (Urban et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b107" href="#b107">2014</a>), as well as in the context of Bergmann's Rule (Teplitsky and Millien 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b103" href="#b103">2014</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Molecular genetic approaches</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A demonstration of shifts in allele frequency confirms that evolution has occurred – but genomes contain thousands to millions of loci, making shifts at some of them inevitable in all situations. A major difficulty then – much more so than when considering phenotypes – is to determine the specific shifts that are relevant. To this end, investigators usually focus on loci known or thought to influence phenotypes or be under selection, or on closely linked neutral loci (Hoffmann and Daborn 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b45" href="#b45">2007</a>; Reusch and Wood 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b90" href="#b90">2008</a>). However, because the genetic basis of most traits is not known, it is difficult to know in advance which genes or genomic regions to consider. An alternative is to employ genome scans based on candidate genes or anonymous loci, but their relevance to adaptive phenotypic change often remains uncertain (e.g., Storz 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b101" href="#b101">2005</a>). To date, the frequencies of some well-characterized genetic polymorphisms have been shown to shift with climate change (e.g., Umina et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b106" href="#b106">2005</a>; Balanyá et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" href="#b3">2006</a>); but even in these cases, the relevant phenotypic traits and selective mechanisms are not well understood (see more about inferring selection below). In addition to searching for shifts in allele frequencies, comparative analyses of gene expression can be used to search for evidence of genetic effects related to population differentiation (e.g., Roberge et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b92" href="#b92">2007</a>), including climate change responses. Advances in genomic technologies, together with new insights into the genetic basis of traits (Olson-Manning et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b80" href="#b80">2012</a>; Wolkovich et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b113" href="#b113">2012</a>), hold promise for future efforts to infer molecular genetic changes driven by climate change (Franks and Hoffmann 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" href="#b29">2012</a>). In the present special issue, genetic shifts are considered most often by Schilthuizen and Kellermann (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b95" href="#b95">2014</a>) and Franks et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" href="#b31">2014</a>).
