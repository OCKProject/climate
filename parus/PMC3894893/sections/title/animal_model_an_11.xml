 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As described above, this quantitative genetic approach can determine the extent to which a phenotypic trend has a quantitative genetic basis. By extension, the portion of the phenotypic trend not explained by genetic change is likely to result from plasticity. Plasticity is thus inferred by excluding or removing genetic effects. In an early example of this approach from a climate change context, RÃ©ale et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b87" href="#b87">2003</a>) estimated that 62% of the change in parturition date in a population of red squirrels (
  <span class="italic">Tamiasciurus hudsonicus</span>) was due to plasticity. Even more dramatically, Charmantier et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" href="#b16">2008</a>) showed that phenological changes in Great tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) in Oxford were the result of plasticity, rather than genetic change. Hence, with the caveats and limitations listed earlier, animal model approaches can evaluate plastic versus genetic contributions to phenotypic change. In the present special issue, this approach is considered in the most depth by Charmantier and Gienapp (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">2014</a>) and Boutin and Lane (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" href="#b10">2014</a>).
