 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to isolate genetic contributions to trait differences, individuals of known family background can be reared/raised/grown under common laboratory or field conditions (Conover and Schultz 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">1995</a>; Blanquart et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" href="#b8">2013</a>). In allochronic contexts, this approach can be implemented in two basic procedures. First, populations for which common-garden studies were conducted in the past can be re-analyzed with new common-garden studies in the present. This approach was used to demonstrate climate-associated genetic shifts in the phenology of pitcher-plant mosquitoes (
  <span class="italic">Wyeomyia smithii</span>; Bradshaw and Holzapfel 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" href="#b11">2001</a>). A difficulty in implementing such studies that the past common-garden environment needs to be very accurately replicated in the new experiment. Second, organisms with dormant stages, such as aquatic invertebrates with resting eggs (e.g., 
  <span class="italic">Daphnia</span>, Cousyn et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" href="#b20">2001</a>) or plants with long-lasting seeds (e.g., Franks et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">2007</a>), can be resurrected from the past for direct comparison to individuals from the present. In either procedure, it is important to control for maternal effects and to recognize that genotype-by-environment interactions can make extrapolation to the natural environment difficult. In the present special issue, allochronic common-garden studies figure most heavily in the contributions of Stoks et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b100" href="#b100">2014</a>) and Franks et al. (
