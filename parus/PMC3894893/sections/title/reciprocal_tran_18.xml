 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most direct test for the adaptive significance of a phenotypic change is to reciprocally transplant individuals between environments (Endler

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" href="#b8">2013</a>). This approach is obviously difficult in an allochronic context, but it can be implemented in some situations. In particular, adaptive evolution is confirmed if contemporary genotypes have higher fitness in the contemporary environment than do resurrected genotypes from past environments (e.g., Decaestecker et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" href="#b23">2007</a>). Given that resurrection is feasible for only a small subset of organisms, an alternative approach is to use laboratory or mesocosm experiments to test contemporary genotypes in simulated present and past environments. Higher fitness in the former implies that adaptation to present environments has reduced fitness (owing to trade-offs) in past environments. On the other hand, failure to find higher fitness in present than in past environments does not mean that adaptive evolution is absent â€“ because fitness trade-offs are not always evident between environments (Bennett and Lenski 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" href="#b7">2007</a>; Blanquart et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" href="#b8">2013</a>). Note that this approach can be used (with the usual caveats) to assess the adaptive significance of genetic differences (by using individuals from common-garden experiments), plastic differences (by using individuals from experimental manipulations), and their combination (by using individuals captured from the wild).
