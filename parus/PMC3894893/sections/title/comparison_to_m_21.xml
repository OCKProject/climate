 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A long tradition in evolutionary biology – particularly in paleontology – has been the use of null models of evolutionary change (e.g., Brownian motion or genetic drift) to infer the role (or not) of natural selection (review: Sheets and Mitchell 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b96" href="#b96">2001</a>). Specifically, natural selection is typically inferred when the rate or directionality of change exceeds the confidence bounds of a null model. A limitation of this approach is its low inferential power even when strong external evidence supports the role of selection (Bell et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" href="#b5">2006</a>). More recently, increased inferential power has come from formally comparing alternative models with and without natural selection (e.g., Clegg et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" href="#b17">2008</a>; Hunt et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b48" href="#b48">2008</a>). This null model approach is not very common in the context of contemporary climate change, although Crozier et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">2011</a>) might be considered in this class.
