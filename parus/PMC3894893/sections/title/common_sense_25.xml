 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The easiest, and certainly still the most common, approach for inferring a specific environmental driver is through existing knowledge and intuition. For example, if (1) organisms reproduce when particular resources become available in the spring, (2) climate change is causing those resources to become available earlier, and (3) the organisms are reproducing earlier, we might feel safe in assuming that climate change is the cause of the observed phenotypic change. Although intuition often might be correct, it is not inevitably or always simplistically so. For example, climate warming is generally assumed to advance the spring phenology of temperate organisms, whereas it actually retards the emergence of alpine ground squirrels (
