 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When a common-garden experiment, as described above, fails to confirm a genetic basis for trait differences, a common conclusion is that the differences observed in nature must result from plasticity. As is the case for animal models, inferences in this approach thus involve excluding or removing genetic effects. Limitations (see also above) include the infeasibility of allochronic common-garden studies for most organisms and the possibility of genotype-by-environment interactions that can make results in a specific common garden misleading with respect to nature (e.g., Winkler and Van Buskirk

These concerns are lessened, although not eliminated, by the use of multiple testing environments, particularly those relevant to the natural situation. In the present special issue, common-garden approaches are particularly common among the studies reviewed by Franks et al. (
