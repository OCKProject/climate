 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This quantitative genetic approach is based on temporal changes in estimates of mean breeding values (i.e., ‘genotypic values’) for phenotypic traits. The strength of this approach is that it specifically quantifies genetic shifts while controlling for plasticity (e.g., Réale et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b87" href="#b87">2003</a>). A major limitation is that doing so requires pedigree data, which is usually available only in long-term studies of individually marked (or genotyped) vertebrate populations (e.g., Réale et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b87" href="#b87">2003</a>; Charmantier et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" href="#b16">2008</a>). Additional shortcomings can include problems in the estimation and interpretation of changes in mean breeding values. In particular, it sometimes can be difficult to ascertain whether observed trends – or the lack thereof – are biologically meaningful as opposed to methodological artifacts (Postma

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">2010</a>). When these problems can be overcome by suitable data and appropriate methods, the animal model remains one of the best approaches for evaluating the genetic basis of phenotypic change in a climate change context. In the present special issue, animal models are emphasized in the contributions of Charmantier and Gienapp (
