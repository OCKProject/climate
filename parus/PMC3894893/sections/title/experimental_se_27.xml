 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Experimental studies are often deemed necessary to conclusively isolate the role of a particular environmental factor in shaping a particular ecological or evolutionary response (Bender et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" href="#b6">1984</a>). The best manifestation in the context of climate change would be to experimentally manipulate a specific candidate driver in nature, such as through artificial warming of the environment experience by a natural population. With appropriate replication and controls, and following the confirmation of genetic or plastic change and its adaptive significance (as above), exceptionally strong evidence thus would be provided for causal effects. This approach is obviously difficult to apply in nature, and so most such studies instead use controlled laboratory or mesocosm settings (e.g., Van Doorslaer et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b108" href="#b108">2007</a>). Although such studies are extremely informative, their relevance to nature is sometimes uncertain. And, of course, experimental manipulations cannot conclusively confirm the specific driver of phenotypic/genetic changes in other (nonexperimental) populations â€“ although ambiguity is lessened if responses are consistent across replicates/contexts and are very similar to those in natural populations.
