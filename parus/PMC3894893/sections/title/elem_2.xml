   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Animal model analyses</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This quantitative genetic approach is based on temporal changes in estimates of mean breeding values (i.e., ‘genotypic values’) for phenotypic traits. The strength of this approach is that it specifically quantifies genetic shifts while controlling for plasticity (e.g., Réale et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b87" href="#b87">2003</a>). A major limitation is that doing so requires pedigree data, which is usually available only in long-term studies of individually marked (or genotyped) vertebrate populations (e.g., Réale et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b87" href="#b87">2003</a>; Charmantier et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" href="#b16">2008</a>). Additional shortcomings can include problems in the estimation and interpretation of changes in mean breeding values. In particular, it sometimes can be difficult to ascertain whether observed trends – or the lack thereof – are biologically meaningful as opposed to methodological artifacts (Postma 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b84" href="#b84">2006</a>; Hadfield et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">2010</a>). When these problems can be overcome by suitable data and appropriate methods, the animal model remains one of the best approaches for evaluating the genetic basis of phenotypic change in a climate change context. In the present special issue, animal models are emphasized in the contributions of Charmantier and Gienapp (
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">2014</a>), Boutin and Lane (
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" href="#b10">2014</a>), and Teplitsky and Millien (

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Common-garden studies</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to isolate genetic contributions to trait differences, individuals of known family background can be reared/raised/grown under common laboratory or field conditions (Conover and Schultz 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">1995</a>; Blanquart et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" href="#b8">2013</a>). In allochronic contexts, this approach can be implemented in two basic procedures. First, populations for which common-garden studies were conducted in the past can be re-analyzed with new common-garden studies in the present. This approach was used to demonstrate climate-associated genetic shifts in the phenology of pitcher-plant mosquitoes (
    <span class="italic">Wyeomyia smithii</span>; Bradshaw and Holzapfel 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" href="#b11">2001</a>). A difficulty in implementing such studies that the past common-garden environment needs to be very accurately replicated in the new experiment. Second, organisms with dormant stages, such as aquatic invertebrates with resting eggs (e.g., 
    <span class="italic">Daphnia</span>, Cousyn et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" href="#b20">2001</a>) or plants with long-lasting seeds (e.g., Franks et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">2007</a>), can be resurrected from the past for direct comparison to individuals from the present. In either procedure, it is important to control for maternal effects and to recognize that genotype-by-environment interactions can make extrapolation to the natural environment difficult. In the present special issue, allochronic common-garden studies figure most heavily in the contributions of Stoks et al. (
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b100" href="#b100">2014</a>) and Franks et al. (

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparison to model predictions</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This approach compares observed phenotypic trends to predictions from evolutionary models, such as the breeder's equation or its multivariate equivalent (Lynch and Walsh 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b70" href="#b70">1998</a>). Specifically, selection and additive genetic (co)variances are measured and used to predict evolutionary responses. If observed trends match predicted trends, then adaptive genetic change is inferred (e.g., Swain et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b102" href="#b102">2007</a>; Crozier et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">2011</a>). Several concerns attend this method. First, it is difficult to accurately measure selection in nature (Kingsolver et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b55" href="#b55">2001</a>, 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b56" href="#b56">2012</a>; Kruuk et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b58" href="#b58">2003</a>; Hersch and Phillips 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b44" href="#b44">2004</a>; Morrissey and Hadfield 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b76" href="#b76">2012</a>). Second, it is even more difficult to accurately estimate additive genetic (co)variances (Lynch and Walsh 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b70" href="#b70">1998</a>), not the least because they vary with environmental conditions (Hoffmann and Merilä 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" href="#b46">1999</a>). Third, a large number of other assumptions attend these predictive models (Merilä et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b75" href="#b75">2001</a>; Morrissey et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b77" href="#b77">2010</a>). Given these difficulties, it is perhaps not surprising that predicted and observed evolutionary responses are often (although not always) poorly matched in natural populations (Merilä et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b75" href="#b75">2001</a>; Kruuk et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b59" href="#b59">2008</a>). In the present special issue, comparisons to model predictions are mentioned by Crozier and Hutchings (
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">2014</a>) and models of evolution in response to climate change are reviewed by Kopp and Matuszewskib (
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b57" href="#b57">2014</a>).

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Experimental evolution</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The basic idea here is to establish experimental populations exposed to different environmental conditions, such as warming temperature (e.g., Van Doorslaer et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b108" href="#b108">2007</a>), increasing CO
    <sub>2</sub> (e.g., Collins and Bell 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">2004</a>), or acidification (e.g., Lohbeck et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b68" href="#b68">2012</a>). After a period of evolution under these conditions, the different populations can be compared under common conditions to quantify any genetically based phenotypic change, and they can be genotyped to uncover its genetic underpinnings (Kawecki et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b53" href="#b53">2012</a>). A major strength of this approach is that, with appropriate replication and controls, it can confirm evolution in response to a specific environmental factor (discussed in more detail later). One limitation of this approach is that logistical constraints often restrict it to small organisms with short generation times. Another limitation is that it cannot provide confirmation that evolution has actually occurred in natural (as opposed to experimental) populations – it is instead a ‘proof-of-principle’ inferential method. This last concern can be somewhat lessened by conducting experiments with natural populations in natural environments – such as in the case of experimental introductions (Reznick and Ghalambor 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b91" href="#b91">2005</a>). In the present special issue, the utility of experimental evolution studies in the context of climate change is especially highlighted by Reusch (
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b89" href="#b89">2014</a>) and Collins et al. (
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">2004</a>).

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Space-for-time substitution</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most environmental factors that vary in time also vary in space, and – as explained above – inferences in space (synchronic) are far easier than inferences in time (allochronic). A tempting approach therefore has been to find spatial associations between environmental factors and phenotypes that match the temporal associations for which inferences are desired. If common-garden or reciprocal transplant studies show a genetic basis for phenotypic differences in space, then it might seem reasonable to infer the same for the variation in time. The limitation, of course, is that demonstrating an effect in one situation does not necessarily mean that the same effect holds in another situation (as is the case for experimental evolution), and temporal – as opposed to spatial – environmental changes might be occurring faster than evolution can respond. Fukami and Wardle (
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">2010</a>) provide a good account of the assumptions and potential problems related to space-for-time substitution in ecological studies, many of which are relevant also for evolutionary studies. At present, space-for-time substitutions are the most common – and sometimes only – basis for inference in some taxonomic groups, such as fish (Crozier and Hutchings 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">2014</a>), marine animals and plants (Reusch 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b89" href="#b89">2014</a>), and amphibians and reptiles (Urban et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b107" href="#b107">2014</a>), as well as in the context of Bergmann's Rule (Teplitsky and Millien 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b103" href="#b103">2014</a>).

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Molecular genetic approaches</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A demonstration of shifts in allele frequency confirms that evolution has occurred – but genomes contain thousands to millions of loci, making shifts at some of them inevitable in all situations. A major difficulty then – much more so than when considering phenotypes – is to determine the specific shifts that are relevant. To this end, investigators usually focus on loci known or thought to influence phenotypes or be under selection, or on closely linked neutral loci (Hoffmann and Daborn 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b45" href="#b45">2007</a>; Reusch and Wood 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b90" href="#b90">2008</a>). However, because the genetic basis of most traits is not known, it is difficult to know in advance which genes or genomic regions to consider. An alternative is to employ genome scans based on candidate genes or anonymous loci, but their relevance to adaptive phenotypic change often remains uncertain (e.g., Storz 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b101" href="#b101">2005</a>). To date, the frequencies of some well-characterized genetic polymorphisms have been shown to shift with climate change (e.g., Umina et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b106" href="#b106">2005</a>; Balanyá et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" href="#b3">2006</a>); but even in these cases, the relevant phenotypic traits and selective mechanisms are not well understood (see more about inferring selection below). In addition to searching for shifts in allele frequencies, comparative analyses of gene expression can be used to search for evidence of genetic effects related to population differentiation (e.g., Roberge et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b92" href="#b92">2007</a>), including climate change responses. Advances in genomic technologies, together with new insights into the genetic basis of traits (Olson-Manning et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b80" href="#b80">2012</a>; Wolkovich et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b113" href="#b113">2012</a>), hold promise for future efforts to infer molecular genetic changes driven by climate change (Franks and Hoffmann 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" href="#b29">2012</a>). In the present special issue, genetic shifts are considered most often by Schilthuizen and Kellermann (
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b95" href="#b95">2014</a>) and Franks et al. (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Approaches for inferring plastic change</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We now focus on methods for inferring when plastic changes have contributed to temporal changes in mean phenotype. In doing so, it is important to remember that plasticity can have a genetic basis and can evolve (West-Eberhard 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b110" href="#b110">2003</a>) and that both plastic and genetic effects can contribute to a phenotypic trend. The two alternatives are therefore not mutually exclusive but rather potential (co)contributors to a given change: ‘cogradient variation’ provides an illuminating example (Conover and Schultz 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">1995</a>). Five basic approaches might be considered for inferring plasticity: ‘animal model’ analyses, common-garden studies, experimental manipulations, fine-grained population responses, and measures of individual plasticity (Table 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a>). As was the case for genetic inferences (above), each approach for inferring plasticity has strengths and weaknesses, and some allow more robust inferences than do others.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Animal model analyses</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As described above, this quantitative genetic approach can determine the extent to which a phenotypic trend has a quantitative genetic basis. By extension, the portion of the phenotypic trend not explained by genetic change is likely to result from plasticity. Plasticity is thus inferred by excluding or removing genetic effects. In an early example of this approach from a climate change context, Réale et al. (
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b87" href="#b87">2003</a>) estimated that 62% of the change in parturition date in a population of red squirrels (
    <span class="italic">Tamiasciurus hudsonicus</span>) was due to plasticity. Even more dramatically, Charmantier et al. (
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" href="#b16">2008</a>) showed that phenological changes in Great tits (
    <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) in Oxford were the result of plasticity, rather than genetic change. Hence, with the caveats and limitations listed earlier, animal model approaches can evaluate plastic versus genetic contributions to phenotypic change. In the present special issue, this approach is considered in the most depth by Charmantier and Gienapp (
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">2014</a>) and Boutin and Lane (

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When a common-garden experiment, as described above, fails to confirm a genetic basis for trait differences, a common conclusion is that the differences observed in nature must result from plasticity. As is the case for animal models, inferences in this approach thus involve excluding or removing genetic effects. Limitations (see also above) include the infeasibility of allochronic common-garden studies for most organisms and the possibility of genotype-by-environment interactions that can make results in a specific common garden misleading with respect to nature (e.g., Winkler and Van Buskirk 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b112" href="#b112">2012</a>). These concerns are lessened, although not eliminated, by the use of multiple testing environments, particularly those relevant to the natural situation. In the present special issue, common-garden approaches are particularly common among the studies reviewed by Franks et al. (

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Whether in the laboratory or the field, the experimental manipulation of an environmental factor, such as temperature, can be used to quantify plasticity. The tempting inference then is that variation in the same factor in nature will produce the same phenotypic response – and so plasticity can explain similar environment–trait associations in nature. This indirect ‘proof-of-principle’ approach is limited in having to assume that the relevant environmental factors have been identified and applied at the correct life history stage. If not, failure to find sufficiently explanatory plastic responses could simply mean that the experimental conditions failed to accurately mimic the natural conditions. Alternatively, strong plastic responses in the laboratory might be swamped in nature by other effects – including ‘countergradient’ genetic differences (Conover and Schultz 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">1995</a>). For these and probably other reasons, experimental studies often do a poor job of predicting observed trends in natural populations (Wolkovich et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b113" href="#b113">2012</a>). In the present special issue, papers paying particular attention to experimental manipulations include Franks et al. (

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Environmental factors, such as temperature, do not change in a temporally constant fashion; they instead include a stochastic component that introduces substantial year-to-year variation around any coarse-scale temporal trend. In the present special issue, Crozier and Hutchings (
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">2014</a>) present temperature data that illustrate this phenomenon. This year-to-year environmental variation can be assessed for correlations with year-to-year variation in phenotypes so as to develop a yard-stick for plasticity (e.g., Phillimore et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b83" href="#b83">2010</a>) – because genetic changes are not expected to be so fine-grained. An important limitation of this approach is the difficulty in verifying whether the change that took place really was the result of plasticity. Also, the relative importance of factors influencing fine- and coarse-grained variation could be quite different. In the present special issue, taxa where fine-grained population responses are frequently considered include birds (Charmantier and Gienapp 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">2014</a>), mammals (Boutin and Lane

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Individual plasticity in nature</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When individual organisms live through multiple occurrences of a given event, investigators can measure within-individual among-event associations between environmental variables and phenotypes. For example, individual birds might breed earlier in warmer years. The resulting estimates of individual plasticity are considerably more natural than those derived from the experimental laboratory-based approach mentioned above. If extrapolation of individual plasticity to the population level can explain temporal trends in mean phenotypes, then plasticity might be considered a sufficient explanation for the population trend (Przybylo et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b85" href="#b85">2000</a>; Schiegg et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b94" href="#b94">2002</a>; Brommer et al.

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b88" href="#b88">2006</a>). A practical limitation of this approach is that it can be applied only in situations where phenotypes of individuals can be tracked across multiple events. Other limitations are that within-individual plasticity might (or might not) be constrained in relation to developmental plasticity, the causes of individual-level and population-level trends might be different, and confirmation of individual plasticity does not rule out the possibility that evolution has also occurred. Several papers in the present special issue discuss the virtues of measuring individual plasticity in nature (e.g., Boutin and Lane 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" href="#b10">2014</a>; Charmantier and Gienapp 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">2014</a>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each of the above approaches has been used to infer genetic or plastic responses to climate change, but each also has a series of limitations. An important question thus becomes: ‘Which approaches allow the strongest inferences regarding genetic or plastic effects?’ These inferences can come in two basic forms: evidence for a particular effect (genetic change or plasticity) or evidence against a particular effect. The distinction between these forms of inference is important because evidence for or against a particular effect does not necessarily provide evidence for or against the other effect. In particular, evidence that genetic change has taken place does not by itself indicate that plasticity has been unimportant, just as evidence for plasticity does not by itself indicate that genetic change has been unimportant.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When it comes to genetically based phenotypic change, strong inferences are possible through the use of animal models – although interpretational problems can occur (Postma 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b84" href="#b84">2006</a>; Hadfield et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">2010</a>; Charmantier and Gienapp 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">2014</a>). However, given that such analyses are possible for only a tiny fraction of the situations where inferences are desired, other approaches are necessary. Common-garden studies also allow strong inferences, although they are possible in only some organisms in allochronic contexts. Specifically, the demonstration of phenotypic differences in a common-garden environment confirms that genetic change has taken place, although genotype-by-environment interactions can complicate extrapolations to nature. Such interactions also mean that the 
   <span class="italic">failure</span> to demonstrate differences in a common-garden environment is not strictly speaking bullet-proof evidence 
   <span class="italic">against</span> genetic change. Molecular approaches can provide direct evidence that genetic change has occurred but, again, failure to find such differences does not mean that they are absent (they could be present at some nonsurveyed genomic regions) and links to adaptive phenotypes are often uncertain. The other approaches (comparison to model predictions, experimental evolution, space-for-time replacement) provide supporting evidence that amounts to ‘proof-of-principle’ but they cannot confirm that observed changes in nature have been genetic.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When it comes to plasticity, the problem is different – one cannot directly demonstrate that past changes were plastic. Stated another way, demonstrating that plasticity 
   <span class="italic">could</span> achieve an observed phenotypic trend does not mean that plasticity actually 
   <span class="italic">did</span> cause that trend. So the best approach here is to show that plasticity could explain the observed trend while also showing that genetic change cannot. Animal models provide a solid route to this inference – because they can disprove genetic change in a phenotype, while also documenting sufficiently explanatory individual plasticity (Réale et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b87" href="#b87">2003</a>; Charmantier et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" href="#b16">2008</a>). Again, however, this approach will be accessible to only a small number of researchers working on a limited set of organisms. Reasonably strong inferences can also come from common-garden experiments showing that genetic change cannot explain a given phenotypic trend (with the above caveats), in combination with other approaches (experimental studies, fine-grained population responses, or individual plasticity) showing that plasticity could explain them. By themselves, however, these latter approaches fall into the ‘proof-of-principle’ category.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the foregoing assessment makes clear, no single approach will be a panacea. The best route to strong and robust inference is therefore to use a combination of methods.</p>
