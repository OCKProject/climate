 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each of the above approaches has been used to infer genetic or plastic responses to climate change, but each also has a series of limitations. An important question thus becomes: ‘Which approaches allow the strongest inferences regarding genetic or plastic effects?’ These inferences can come in two basic forms: evidence for a particular effect (genetic change or plasticity) or evidence against a particular effect. The distinction between these forms of inference is important because evidence for or against a particular effect does not necessarily provide evidence for or against the other effect. In particular, evidence that genetic change has taken place does not by itself indicate that plasticity has been unimportant, just as evidence for plasticity does not by itself indicate that genetic change has been unimportant.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When it comes to genetically based phenotypic change, strong inferences are possible through the use of animal models – although interpretational problems can occur (Postma 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b84" href="#b84">2006</a>; Hadfield et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">2010</a>; Charmantier and Gienapp 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">2014</a>). However, given that such analyses are possible for only a tiny fraction of the situations where inferences are desired, other approaches are necessary. Common-garden studies also allow strong inferences, although they are possible in only some organisms in allochronic contexts. Specifically, the demonstration of phenotypic differences in a common-garden environment confirms that genetic change has taken place, although genotype-by-environment interactions can complicate extrapolations to nature. Such interactions also mean that the 
  <span class="italic">failure</span> to demonstrate differences in a common-garden environment is not strictly speaking bullet-proof evidence 
  <span class="italic">against</span> genetic change. Molecular approaches can provide direct evidence that genetic change has occurred but, again, failure to find such differences does not mean that they are absent (they could be present at some nonsurveyed genomic regions) and links to adaptive phenotypes are often uncertain. The other approaches (comparison to model predictions, experimental evolution, space-for-time replacement) provide supporting evidence that amounts to ‘proof-of-principle’ but they cannot confirm that observed changes in nature have been genetic.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When it comes to plasticity, the problem is different – one cannot directly demonstrate that past changes were plastic. Stated another way, demonstrating that plasticity 
  <span class="italic">could</span> achieve an observed phenotypic trend does not mean that plasticity actually 
  <span class="italic">did</span> cause that trend. So the best approach here is to show that plasticity could explain the observed trend while also showing that genetic change cannot. Animal models provide a solid route to this inference – because they can disprove genetic change in a phenotype, while also documenting sufficiently explanatory individual plasticity (Réale et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b87" href="#b87">2003</a>; Charmantier et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" href="#b16">2008</a>). Again, however, this approach will be accessible to only a small number of researchers working on a limited set of organisms. Reasonably strong inferences can also come from common-garden experiments showing that genetic change cannot explain a given phenotypic trend (with the above caveats), in combination with other approaches (experimental studies, fine-grained population responses, or individual plasticity) showing that plasticity could explain them. By themselves, however, these latter approaches fall into the ‘proof-of-principle’ category.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the foregoing assessment makes clear, no single approach will be a panacea. The best route to strong and robust inference is therefore to use a combination of methods.</p>
