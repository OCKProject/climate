 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Studies seeking evolutionary inference face the three basic challenges introduced above. One challenge is to understand the proximate causes of phenotypic change: that is, to what degree do the observed shifts reflect genetic and/or plastic changes. Another challenge is to understand the ultimate cause at a basic level: that is, natural selection, sexual selection, genetic drift, or gene flow. The third challenge is to establish the ultimate cause at a specific level: that is, the precise environmental driver, such as commercial fishing, climate change, or pollution.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each of the above inferences might be desired in synchronic (i.e., spatial) or allochronic (i.e., longitudinal or temporal) contexts. Synchronic studies compare different populations sampled at approximately the same time, whereas allochronic studies compare the same population sampled at different points in time (Hendry and Kinnison 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" href="#b41">1999</a>). Most inferential methods are easier to implement in the synchronic case because representatives from the different populations can be reared/raised/grown together under specific conditions and because direct assessments of selection can be implemented 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span>. Studies of contemporary climate change, however, are generally allochronic (i.e., we wish to infer whether a population in the present differs from the same population in the past), a context where inferential methods are harder to implement. In particular, individuals from different times usually cannot be reared/raised/grown together, and past selective regimes are hard to infer with any degree of precision. Similar difficulties attend other allochronic situations, such as evolution in response to commercial fisheries (e.g., Kuparinen and Merilä 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b60" href="#b60">2007</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b61" href="#b61">2008</a>) and biological invasions (e.g., Bacigalupe 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" href="#b2">2009</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If responses to climate change could be assessed synchronically, the present paper would be unnecessary because the various methods have been much discussed and evaluated (e.g., Endler 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" href="#b26">1986</a>; Kawecki and Ebert 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b52" href="#b52">2004</a>; Blanquart et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" href="#b8">2013</a>). By contrast, methods for inference in allochronic contexts have not been treated in as much detail, including in relation to climate change. In the following sections, we first focus on proximate causes by outlining different approaches for inferring genetic versus plastic changes in allochronic studies. We then address the challenges encountered when attempting to infer ultimate causes in the same context: that is, whether natural selection is the general driver and whether climate change is the specific driver.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An addition point to bear in mind – although not one we here consider in detail – is that phenotypic constancy in the face of environmental change can also represent an important response to climate change – and can be considered in the contexts of ‘phenotypic buffering’ (in the context of plasticity – Reusch 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b89" href="#b89">2014</a>) or ‘genetic compensation’ (in the context of genetic change – Conover and Schultz 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">1995</a>; Grether 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" href="#b37">2005</a>).
