 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As opposed to the previous questions, it is not particularly helpful to here rank the different approaches for the quality of inference they can provide â€“ because each has major inferential limitations. Experimental studies are obviously the best way to demonstrate causation but these are difficult to implement in natural populations and can only conclusively demonstrate causation within the experiment itself. The other approaches are more relevant to natural populations, but are correlational. Thus, the most convincing cases are built based on combined evidence from observational and experimental studies.</p>
