 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A demonstration of shifts in allele frequency confirms that evolution has occurred – but genomes contain thousands to millions of loci, making shifts at some of them inevitable in all situations. A major difficulty then – much more so than when considering phenotypes – is to determine the specific shifts that are relevant. To this end, investigators usually focus on loci known or thought to influence phenotypes or be under selection, or on closely linked neutral loci (Hoffmann and Daborn

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b90" href="#b90">2008</a>). However, because the genetic basis of most traits is not known, it is difficult to know in advance which genes or genomic regions to consider. An alternative is to employ genome scans based on candidate genes or anonymous loci, but their relevance to adaptive phenotypic change often remains uncertain (e.g., Storz 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b101" href="#b101">2005</a>). To date, the frequencies of some well-characterized genetic polymorphisms have been shown to shift with climate change (e.g., Umina et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b106" href="#b106">2005</a>; Balanyá et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" href="#b3">2006</a>); but even in these cases, the relevant phenotypic traits and selective mechanisms are not well understood (see more about inferring selection below). In addition to searching for shifts in allele frequencies, comparative analyses of gene expression can be used to search for evidence of genetic effects related to population differentiation (e.g., Roberge et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b92" href="#b92">2007</a>), including climate change responses. Advances in genomic technologies, together with new insights into the genetic basis of traits (Olson-Manning et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b80" href="#b80">2012</a>; Wolkovich et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b113" href="#b113">2012</a>), hold promise for future efforts to infer molecular genetic changes driven by climate change (Franks and Hoffmann 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" href="#b29">2012</a>). In the present special issue, genetic shifts are considered most often by Schilthuizen and Kellermann (
