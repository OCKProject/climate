 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If a given phenotypic change is adaptive, it was likely driven by selection – and so one inferential approach is to measure selection in nature. Specifically, adaptation can be inferred when selection acting during a phenotypic change would be predicted to favor that change (e.g., Swain et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b102" href="#b102">2007</a>; Crozier et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">2011</a>). Note, however, that measuring contemporary selection is not sufficient for inferring past selection – because selection can vary through time (Siepielski et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b97" href="#b97">2009</a>; Siepielski et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b98" href="#b98">2011</a>). Implementing this approach therefore requires long-term datasets of selection. An additional limitation is that the direction of phenotypic change could correspond to the estimated direction of selection without the two being causally linked (Merilä et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b75" href="#b75">2001</a>) – although the estimation of selection on breeding values can reduce this concern (Hadfield et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b76" href="#b76">2012</a>; see above). Also, as noted earlier, accurate estimates of selection are extremely difficult to obtain in most natural populations.
