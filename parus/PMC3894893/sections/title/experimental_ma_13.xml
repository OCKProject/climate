 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Whether in the laboratory or the field, the experimental manipulation of an environmental factor, such as temperature, can be used to quantify plasticity. The tempting inference then is that variation in the same factor in nature will produce the same phenotypic response – and so plasticity can explain similar environment–trait associations in nature. This indirect ‘proof-of-principle’ approach is limited in having to assume that the relevant environmental factors have been identified and applied at the correct life history stage. If not, failure to find sufficiently explanatory plastic responses could simply mean that the experimental conditions failed to accurately mimic the natural conditions. Alternatively, strong plastic responses in the laboratory might be swamped in nature by other effects – including ‘countergradient’ genetic differences (Conover and Schultz
