 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This approach compares observed phenotypic trends to predictions from evolutionary models, such as the breeder's equation or its multivariate equivalent (Lynch and Walsh 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b70" href="#b70">1998</a>). Specifically, selection and additive genetic (co)variances are measured and used to predict evolutionary responses. If observed trends match predicted trends, then adaptive genetic change is inferred (e.g., Swain et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b102" href="#b102">2007</a>; Crozier et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">2011</a>). Several concerns attend this method. First, it is difficult to accurately measure selection in nature (Kingsolver et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b55" href="#b55">2001</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b56" href="#b56">2012</a>; Kruuk et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b58" href="#b58">2003</a>; Hersch and Phillips 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b44" href="#b44">2004</a>; Morrissey and Hadfield 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b76" href="#b76">2012</a>). Second, it is even more difficult to accurately estimate additive genetic (co)variances (Lynch and Walsh 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b70" href="#b70">1998</a>), not the least because they vary with environmental conditions (Hoffmann and Merilä 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" href="#b46">1999</a>). Third, a large number of other assumptions attend these predictive models (Merilä et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b75" href="#b75">2001</a>; Morrissey et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b77" href="#b77">2010</a>). Given these difficulties, it is perhaps not surprising that predicted and observed evolutionary responses are often (although not always) poorly matched in natural populations (Merilä et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b75" href="#b75">2001</a>; Kruuk et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b59" href="#b59">2008</a>). In the present special issue, comparisons to model predictions are mentioned by Crozier and Hutchings (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">2014</a>) and models of evolution in response to climate change are reviewed by Kopp and Matuszewskib (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b57" href="#b57">2014</a>).
