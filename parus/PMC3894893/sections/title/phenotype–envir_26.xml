 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another common inferential approach is to 
  <span class="italic">quantify</span> the association between trait change and specific aspects of climate change (e.g., Quinn and Adams 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b86" href="#b86">1996</a>; Crozier et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">2011</a>). If a tight correlation is found, especially across multiple independent locations/populations, support for that environmental driver is enhanced. Ideally, multiple potential drivers would be simultaneously assessed so as to determine their independent and interactive effects. A difficulty in implementing this approach is that evolution, and sometimes plasticity, cannot perfectly track environmental change (Quinn and Adams 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b86" href="#b86">1996</a>; Both and Visser 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" href="#b9">2001</a>), and so the failure to find a tight trait–environment association does not necessarily mean that the environmental factor is unimportant. This problem can be partially circumvented by also adding a complementary space-for-time replacement (e.g., Phillimore et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b83" href="#b83">2010</a>). If, for instance, temperature is suspected to be the primary factor driving temporal changes in phenotype, similar associations might be expected across spatial temperature gradients. Of course, we return here to the above-mentioned concern that temporal and spatial drivers might not be the same (see also Fukami and Wardle 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">2010</a>).
