 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Environmental factors, such as temperature, do not change in a temporally constant fashion; they instead include a stochastic component that introduces substantial year-to-year variation around any coarse-scale temporal trend. In the present special issue, Crozier and Hutchings (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">2014</a>) present temperature data that illustrate this phenomenon. This year-to-year environmental variation can be assessed for correlations with year-to-year variation in phenotypes so as to develop a yard-stick for plasticity (e.g., Phillimore et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b83" href="#b83">2010</a>) â€“ because genetic changes are not expected to be so fine-grained. An important limitation of this approach is the difficulty in verifying whether the change that took place really was the result of plasticity. Also, the relative importance of factors influencing fine- and coarse-grained variation could be quite different. In the present special issue, taxa where fine-grained population responses are frequently considered include birds (Charmantier and Gienapp 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">2014</a>), mammals (Boutin and Lane 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" href="#b10">2014</a>), and fish (Crozier and Hutchings 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">2014</a>).
