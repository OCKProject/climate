 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The basic idea here is to establish experimental populations exposed to different environmental conditions, such as warming temperature (e.g., Van Doorslaer et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b108" href="#b108">2007</a>), increasing CO
  <sub>2</sub> (e.g., Collins and Bell 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">2004</a>), or acidification (e.g., Lohbeck et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b68" href="#b68">2012</a>). After a period of evolution under these conditions, the different populations can be compared under common conditions to quantify any genetically based phenotypic change, and they can be genotyped to uncover its genetic underpinnings (Kawecki et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b53" href="#b53">2012</a>). A major strength of this approach is that, with appropriate replication and controls, it can confirm evolution in response to a specific environmental factor (discussed in more detail later). One limitation of this approach is that logistical constraints often restrict it to small organisms with short generation times. Another limitation is that it cannot provide confirmation that evolution has actually occurred in natural (as opposed to experimental) populations – it is instead a ‘proof-of-principle’ inferential method. This last concern can be somewhat lessened by conducting experiments with natural populations in natural environments – such as in the case of experimental introductions (Reznick and Ghalambor 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b91" href="#b91">2005</a>). In the present special issue, the utility of experimental evolution studies in the context of climate change is especially highlighted by Reusch (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b89" href="#b89">2014</a>) and Collins et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">2004</a>).
