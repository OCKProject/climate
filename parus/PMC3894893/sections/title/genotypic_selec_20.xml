 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analogous to the phenotypic selection approach, investigators can ask whether observed shifts in allele frequency correspond to selection on those alleles. This selection can be estimated either directly or indirectly. Directly, one can genotype individuals and then measure their fitness (e.g., Fournier-Level et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" href="#b28">2011</a>) or, if individuals cannot be tracked in this manner, allele frequency differences can be measured between age groups. These approaches are attended by many of the same issues that were discussed immediately above for phenotypic selection. Indirectly, one can test for genomic signatures of past selection (e.g., Storz 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b101" href="#b101">2005</a>; Foll and Gaggiotti 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" href="#b27">2008</a>). Limitations here are that it can be difficult to ascertain the relative contributions of selection as opposed to other factors (e.g., population structure and recombination), and when the past selection took place (Barrett and Hoekstra 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" href="#b4">2011</a>; Nachman and Payseur 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b78" href="#b78">2012</a>). An additional limitation of these genotypic approaches is that selection at the genotypic level does not necessarily reflect selection at the phenotypic level. For example, selection on polygenic traits can be very difficult to detect at the individual loci that influence those traits (McKay and Latta 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b73" href="#b73">2002</a>; Le Corre and Kremer 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b65" href="#b65">2012</a>).
