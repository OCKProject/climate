 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When individual organisms live through multiple occurrences of a given event, investigators can measure within-individual among-event associations between environmental variables and phenotypes. For example, individual birds might breed earlier in warmer years. The resulting estimates of individual plasticity are considerably more natural than those derived from the experimental laboratory-based approach mentioned above. If extrapolation of individual plasticity to the population level can explain temporal trends in mean phenotypes, then plasticity might be considered a sufficient explanation for the population trend (Przybylo et al.

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b88" href="#b88">2006</a>). A practical limitation of this approach is that it can be applied only in situations where phenotypes of individuals can be tracked across multiple events. Other limitations are that within-individual plasticity might (or might not) be constrained in relation to developmental plasticity, the causes of individual-level and population-level trends might be different, and confirmation of individual plasticity does not rule out the possibility that evolution has also occurred. Several papers in the present special issue discuss the virtues of measuring individual plasticity in nature (e.g., Boutin and Lane
