 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most environmental factors that vary in time also vary in space, and – as explained above – inferences in space (synchronic) are far easier than inferences in time (allochronic). A tempting approach therefore has been to find spatial associations between environmental factors and phenotypes that match the temporal associations for which inferences are desired. If common-garden or reciprocal transplant studies show a genetic basis for phenotypic differences in space, then it might seem reasonable to infer the same for the variation in time. The limitation, of course, is that demonstrating an effect in one situation does not necessarily mean that the same effect holds in another situation (as is the case for experimental evolution), and temporal – as opposed to spatial – environmental changes might be occurring faster than evolution can respond. Fukami and Wardle (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">2010</a>) provide a good account of the assumptions and potential problems related to space-for-time substitution in ecological studies, many of which are relevant also for evolutionary studies. At present, space-for-time substitutions are the most common – and sometimes only – basis for inference in some taxonomic groups, such as fish (Crozier and Hutchings

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b107" href="#b107">2014</a>), as well as in the context of Bergmann's Rule (Teplitsky and Millien
