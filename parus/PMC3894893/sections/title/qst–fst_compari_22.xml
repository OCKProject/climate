 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This approach is also rooted in null model thinking. Specifically, theory predicts that selection will cause patterns of quantitative trait variation to differ from patterns of neutral marker variation (Lande 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b63" href="#b63">1992</a>; McKay and Latta 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b73" href="#b73">2002</a>; Leinonen et al.

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b111" href="#b111">2008</a>). In particular, divergent selection is often inferred when the among-population proportion of genetically based trait variance (Q
  <sub>ST</sub>) exceeds the among-population proportion of neutral marker divergence (F
  <sub>ST</sub>). This approach has a number of limitations. Of particular concern, the accurate estimation of Q
  <sub>ST</sub> requires a common-garden study (e.g., Leinonen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b67" href="#b67">2008</a>), which is difficult to implement in an allochronic context. Also in play is the previously noted problem that genotype-by-environment interactions can make inferences misleading with respect to natural populations. A partial solution to this problem can come from using natural populations to estimate the phenotypic Q
  <sub>ST</sub> analog (P
  <sub>ST</sub>: Leinonen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b66" href="#b66">2006</a>), although interpretation remains difficult (Brommer 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" href="#b12">2011</a>). Many additional concerns attend Q
  <sub>ST</sub>–F
  <sub>ST</sub> comparisons (Hendry 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" href="#b40">2002</a>; Leinonen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b67" href="#b67">2008</a>; Edelaar et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">2011</a>), although some of these can be reduced through careful planning or by adopting improved approaches (e.g., Ovaskainen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b81" href="#b81">2011</a>; Karhunen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b51" href="#b51">2013</a>). To date, however, Q
  <sub>ST</sub>–F
  <sub>ST</sub> comparisons have not been much used in the context of contemporary climate change.
