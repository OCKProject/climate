 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Approaches for inferring plastic change</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We now focus on methods for inferring when plastic changes have contributed to temporal changes in mean phenotype. In doing so, it is important to remember that plasticity can have a genetic basis and can evolve (West-Eberhard 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b110" href="#b110">2003</a>) and that both plastic and genetic effects can contribute to a phenotypic trend. The two alternatives are therefore not mutually exclusive but rather potential (co)contributors to a given change: ‘cogradient variation’ provides an illuminating example (Conover and Schultz 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">1995</a>). Five basic approaches might be considered for inferring plasticity: ‘animal model’ analyses, common-garden studies, experimental manipulations, fine-grained population responses, and measures of individual plasticity (Table 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a>). As was the case for genetic inferences (above), each approach for inferring plasticity has strengths and weaknesses, and some allow more robust inferences than do others.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Animal model analyses</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As described above, this quantitative genetic approach can determine the extent to which a phenotypic trend has a quantitative genetic basis. By extension, the portion of the phenotypic trend not explained by genetic change is likely to result from plasticity. Plasticity is thus inferred by excluding or removing genetic effects. In an early example of this approach from a climate change context, Réale et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b87" href="#b87">2003</a>) estimated that 62% of the change in parturition date in a population of red squirrels (
   <span class="italic">Tamiasciurus hudsonicus</span>) was due to plasticity. Even more dramatically, Charmantier et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" href="#b16">2008</a>) showed that phenological changes in Great tits (
   <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) in Oxford were the result of plasticity, rather than genetic change. Hence, with the caveats and limitations listed earlier, animal model approaches can evaluate plastic versus genetic contributions to phenotypic change. In the present special issue, this approach is considered in the most depth by Charmantier and Gienapp (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">2014</a>) and Boutin and Lane (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" href="#b10">2014</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Common-garden studies</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When a common-garden experiment, as described above, fails to confirm a genetic basis for trait differences, a common conclusion is that the differences observed in nature must result from plasticity. As is the case for animal models, inferences in this approach thus involve excluding or removing genetic effects. Limitations (see also above) include the infeasibility of allochronic common-garden studies for most organisms and the possibility of genotype-by-environment interactions that can make results in a specific common garden misleading with respect to nature (e.g., Winkler and Van Buskirk 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b112" href="#b112">2012</a>). These concerns are lessened, although not eliminated, by the use of multiple testing environments, particularly those relevant to the natural situation. In the present special issue, common-garden approaches are particularly common among the studies reviewed by Franks et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" href="#b31">2014</a>) and Stoks et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b100" href="#b100">2014</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Experimental manipulations</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Whether in the laboratory or the field, the experimental manipulation of an environmental factor, such as temperature, can be used to quantify plasticity. The tempting inference then is that variation in the same factor in nature will produce the same phenotypic response – and so plasticity can explain similar environment–trait associations in nature. This indirect ‘proof-of-principle’ approach is limited in having to assume that the relevant environmental factors have been identified and applied at the correct life history stage. If not, failure to find sufficiently explanatory plastic responses could simply mean that the experimental conditions failed to accurately mimic the natural conditions. Alternatively, strong plastic responses in the laboratory might be swamped in nature by other effects – including ‘countergradient’ genetic differences (Conover and Schultz 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">1995</a>). For these and probably other reasons, experimental studies often do a poor job of predicting observed trends in natural populations (Wolkovich et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b113" href="#b113">2012</a>). In the present special issue, papers paying particular attention to experimental manipulations include Franks et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" href="#b31">2014</a>), Collins et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">2004</a>), and Urban et al. (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fine-grained population responses</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Environmental factors, such as temperature, do not change in a temporally constant fashion; they instead include a stochastic component that introduces substantial year-to-year variation around any coarse-scale temporal trend. In the present special issue, Crozier and Hutchings (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">2014</a>) present temperature data that illustrate this phenomenon. This year-to-year environmental variation can be assessed for correlations with year-to-year variation in phenotypes so as to develop a yard-stick for plasticity (e.g., Phillimore et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b83" href="#b83">2010</a>) – because genetic changes are not expected to be so fine-grained. An important limitation of this approach is the difficulty in verifying whether the change that took place really was the result of plasticity. Also, the relative importance of factors influencing fine- and coarse-grained variation could be quite different. In the present special issue, taxa where fine-grained population responses are frequently considered include birds (Charmantier and Gienapp 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">2014</a>), mammals (Boutin and Lane 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" href="#b10">2014</a>), and fish (Crozier and Hutchings 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">2014</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Individual plasticity in nature</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When individual organisms live through multiple occurrences of a given event, investigators can measure within-individual among-event associations between environmental variables and phenotypes. For example, individual birds might breed earlier in warmer years. The resulting estimates of individual plasticity are considerably more natural than those derived from the experimental laboratory-based approach mentioned above. If extrapolation of individual plasticity to the population level can explain temporal trends in mean phenotypes, then plasticity might be considered a sufficient explanation for the population trend (Przybylo et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b85" href="#b85">2000</a>; Schiegg et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b94" href="#b94">2002</a>; Brommer et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" href="#b13">2005</a>; Nussey et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b79" href="#b79">2005</a>; Reed et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b88" href="#b88">2006</a>). A practical limitation of this approach is that it can be applied only in situations where phenotypes of individuals can be tracked across multiple events. Other limitations are that within-individual plasticity might (or might not) be constrained in relation to developmental plasticity, the causes of individual-level and population-level trends might be different, and confirmation of individual plasticity does not rule out the possibility that evolution has also occurred. Several papers in the present special issue discuss the virtues of measuring individual plasticity in nature (e.g., Boutin and Lane 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" href="#b10">2014</a>; Charmantier and Gienapp 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">2014</a>).
