 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The goshawk, 
  <span class="italic">Accipiter gentilis,</span> is a widespread species inhabiting North America and Eurasia [
  <a rid="B1-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-animals-09-00141">1</a>,
  <a rid="B2-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-animals-09-00141">2</a>]. Its abundance in Europe fluctuated throughout the first half of the 20th century due to the persecution of raptors by hunters and forest management practices finally crashing in the 1950s and 1960s due to the usage of highly toxic pesticides (DDT) in agriculture [
  <a rid="B3-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-animals-09-00141">3</a>,
  <a rid="B4-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-animals-09-00141">4</a>,
  <a rid="B5-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-animals-09-00141">5</a>,
  <a rid="B6-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-animals-09-00141">6</a>,
  <a rid="B7-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-animals-09-00141">7</a>]. Since the 1970s, the European population of goshawks started to rise moderately [
  <a rid="B3-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-animals-09-00141">3</a>,
  <a rid="B8-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-animals-09-00141">8</a>], yet this trend was not consistent for all countries. For example, in the UK, the goshawk went extinct in the 1980s. It was reintroduced, and its population grew in number; a systematic growth in the forest cover was conducive to this process of population restoration [
  <a rid="B5-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-animals-09-00141">5</a>,
  <a rid="B9-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-animals-09-00141">9</a>]. On the contrary, in Finland and Sweden, a decrease in goshawk abundance was recorded in the years 1980–2010 [
  <a rid="B10-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-animals-09-00141">10</a>,
  <a rid="B11-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-animals-09-00141">11</a>]. A population decrease was also noted in Poland in the last decade [
  <a rid="B12-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-animals-09-00141">12</a>]. Similarly, in the USA, the population trend was equivocal [
  <a rid="B13-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-animals-09-00141">13</a>,
  <a rid="B14-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-animals-09-00141">14</a>], and many authors pointed to the potentially negative influence of forest management practices on goshawk populations, both in Europe and in North America [
  <a rid="B6-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-animals-09-00141">6</a>,
  <a rid="B14-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-animals-09-00141">14</a>,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Population densities in Poland in the last thirty years were between 0.5–10 pairs/100 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>, and generally, the highest numbers were found in areas with a high forest cover [
  <a rid="B17-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-animals-09-00141">17</a>]. Yet, the record density in Poland, one of the highest in the world (16.3 pairs/100 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>), was recorded in the 1980s in the field-forest mosaic of central Poland (in the vicinity of Rogów village), an area with very low forest cover [
  <a rid="B18-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-animals-09-00141">18</a>,
  <a rid="B19-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-animals-09-00141">19</a>,
  <a rid="B20-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-animals-09-00141">20</a>,
  <a rid="B21-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-animals-09-00141">21</a>]. Goshawks in this area preyed mainly on domestic pigeons, 
  <span class="italic">Columbia livia domestica</span>, and poultry, which together constituted over 70% of all their consumed biomass [
  <a rid="B19-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-animals-09-00141">19</a>,
  <a rid="B22-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-animals-09-00141">22</a>,
  <a rid="B23-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-animals-09-00141">23</a>]. This high availability of anthropogenic food was probably the factor that allowed this population to reach such a high density [
  <a rid="B19-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-animals-09-00141">19</a>]. On the other hand, the population was illegally persecuted, as birds were shot and trapped and their nests were cut down by local farmers [
  <a rid="B24-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-animals-09-00141">24</a>,
  <a rid="B25-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-animals-09-00141">25</a>]. Such practices took place across the whole of Poland (despite legal protection of goshawks since 1976; before this, raptors were treated as pests) [
  <a rid="B4-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-animals-09-00141">4</a>,
  <a rid="B25-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-animals-09-00141">25</a>], as in other countries [
  <a rid="B4-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-animals-09-00141">4</a>,
  <a rid="B26-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-animals-09-00141">26</a>,
  <a rid="B27-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-animals-09-00141">27</a>,
  <a rid="B28-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-animals-09-00141">28</a>]. In Poland, there is no reimbursement for damages done by raptors (on the contrary to, for instance, wolves (
  <span class="italic">Canis lupus</span>), lynxes (
  <span class="italic">Lynx lynx)</span>, and brown bears (
  <span class="italic">Ursus arctos</span>), while race pigeons (whose rings were often found in goshawk pellets) can be very valuable).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This central Poland study area is where the goshawk population has been studied long term for almost 40 years [

  <a rid="B32-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32-animals-09-00141">32</a>] and where a population drop followed the record density found in the 1980s [
  <a rid="B24-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-animals-09-00141">24</a>,
  <a rid="B30-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-animals-09-00141">30</a>]. In our current study (2011–2018), we continued the long-term monitoring of the goshawk population in central Poland. We compared data obtained in the current study with analogical data obtained in the previous study periods [
  <a rid="B19-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-animals-09-00141">19</a>,
  <a rid="B23-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-animals-09-00141">23</a>,
  <a rid="B24-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-animals-09-00141">24</a>,
  <a rid="B29-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-animals-09-00141">29</a>,
  <a rid="B31-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-animals-09-00141">31</a>]. Therefore, we were able to analyse crucial environmental factors (i.e., the main and complementary prey availability and changes in the forest structure) that may have influenced the population density of the goshawk, its breeding parameters, and its diet composition.
