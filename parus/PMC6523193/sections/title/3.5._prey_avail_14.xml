 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We were not able to obtain data regarding the pigeon and poultry availability from the previous decades. However, the number of farms that had domestic pigeons and poultry available for goshawks decreased even within the last study period between 2011 and 2018. The number of farms with domestic pigeons dropped by 34% (from 64 in 2011 to 42 in 2018), and those with poultry dropped by 33% (from 182 to 122 farms). The interviewed farmers confirmed that small-scale pigeon and poultry production has been limited in the last 30 years. Neither in 2011 nor in 2018 were domestic rabbits recorded as available to goshawks. If present, they were kept in cages; however farmers reported that most of them had ceased rabbit breeding by the beginning of the 1990s. </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A far as other food sources are concerned, the small game density was very low in 2011â€“2018 (
