  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The current population densities (2011–2018) of goshawk were 0.76 pairs/10 km
   <span class="sup">2</span> of total area and 3.3 pairs/10 km
   <span class="sup">2</span> of forested area. Between 6 and 11 (mean 8.0, SD = 1.7) breeding pairs were recorded each year. The number of breeding pairs decreased when compared with the two previous study periods (

   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05 for all comparisons between the three study periods). This means that, in comparison to the first study period (1982–1992), the population has decreased by almost 50%. Such a decrease in the number of breeding pairs was recorded in all forest complexes (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the years 2011–2018, goshawks produced on average 1.6 fledglings per breeding pair (SD = 1.07) and 2.0 (SD = 0.69) per successful pair. The breeding success was 76% (SD = 7.2). Compared to previous study periods, these parameters seemed to be similar or decrease (
   <a rid="animals-09-00141-t003" ref-type="table" href="#animals-09-00141-t003">Table 3</a>). However, it was only possible to compare the number of juveniles between two periods (2001–2003 and 2011–2018; for 1982–1992, the detailed data were unavailable), for which no statistical differences were found (Mann–Whitney U-test, number of fledglings per breeding pair: Z = 0.87, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &gt; 0.5; number of fledglings per successful pair: Z = 1.52,

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Currently (2011–2018), goshawks tend to build their nests on Scots pines most often (ca. 46%), and larch and back alder were also important nesting trees. As compared to previous study periods, the share of Scots pine as a nesting tree dropped (chi-square test, χ
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 28.39, df = 2, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0001), while the share of larch (χ
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 22.97, df = 2, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0001) and black alder (χ
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 11.84, df = 2, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.005, 
   <a rid="animals-09-00141-t004" ref-type="table" href="#animals-09-00141-t004">Table 4</a>) rose. The current mean nesting tree age was 84 years (SD = 18.4), the tree trunk diameter was 48 cm (SD = 12.1), and the height of nest placement was 21 m (SD = 2.2, 
   <a rid="animals-09-00141-t004" ref-type="table" href="#animals-09-00141-t004">Table 4</a>). In the years 2011–2018, goshawks built 37 nests and they bred 64 times, equaling to 1.7 breeding attempts per one nest. This value was lower for the first time period (1982–1992) at 1.1 breeding attempts per one nest (goshawks built 163 nests and bred 177 times).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the current study period (2011–2018), goshawks preyed mainly on domestic pigeons and poultry, which accounted for 24.1% of their total prey items (N = 1065) and 49.2% of the biomass consumed (211,664 g in total). From among wild birds, wood pigeons 
   <span class="italic">Columba palumbus</span> and Eurasian jays 
   <span class="italic">Garrulus glandarius</span> were most important. Mammals accounted for 11.5% of their prey items and 3.7% of their biomass, including small prey and, in some cases, carrion. Amphibians, reptiles, and insects were found in very few pellets (

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As compared to the previous study periods, a decrease in the share of domestic pigeons (from 38% of all prey items in 1982–1992 to 22.8% now) was recorded (chi-square test, χ
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 78.42, df = 2, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0001). The same was evident in the case of poultry, which, in the first period, constituted over 10% of all biomass, while recently, it was just 3.3%. The share of small game (brown hare, European rabbit, pheasant, and grey partridge) in the current study was the lowest from all three study periods (χ
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 22.03, df = 2, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0001). On the contrary, the share of Eurasian jay (χ

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We were not able to obtain data regarding the pigeon and poultry availability from the previous decades. However, the number of farms that had domestic pigeons and poultry available for goshawks decreased even within the last study period between 2011 and 2018. The number of farms with domestic pigeons dropped by 34% (from 64 in 2011 to 42 in 2018), and those with poultry dropped by 33% (from 182 to 122 farms). The interviewed farmers confirmed that small-scale pigeon and poultry production has been limited in the last 30 years. Neither in 2011 nor in 2018 were domestic rabbits recorded as available to goshawks. If present, they were kept in cages; however farmers reported that most of them had ceased rabbit breeding by the beginning of the 1990s. </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A far as other food sources are concerned, the small game density was very low in 2011–2018 (
   <a rid="animals-09-00141-t0A2" ref-type="table" href="#animals-09-00141-t0A2">Table A2</a>) and dropped notably as compared to the 1980s. Brown hares and grey partridges became very rare, while European rabbits went extinct in the area (
