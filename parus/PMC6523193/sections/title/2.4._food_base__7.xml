 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The food base assessment included (i) anthropogenic food (domestic pigeons and poultry) as the main food component in the 1980s [

  <span class="italic">Oryctolagus cuniculus</span>, pheasant 
  <span class="italic">Phasianus colchicus</span>, and grey partridge

  <span class="italic">Corvus cornix</span>, rook

  <a rid="B51-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51-animals-09-00141">51</a>]. Whenever it was possible, we did the assessment in the same sampling areas and with the same method as it was done in the past study periods.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The availability of anthropogenic food (domestic pigeons, domestic ducks 
  <span class="italic">Anas platyrhynchos domesticus</span>, domestic geese 
  <span class="italic">Anser anser domesticus</span>, helmeted guineafowl 
  <span class="italic">Numida meleagris</span>, and domestic rabbit 
  <span class="italic">Oryctolagus cuniculus domesticus</span>) was not assessed for the two previous study periods. Now, it was assessed on the basis of door-to-door surveys supported by direct observations and along 22 transects (about 30 km in total) that run through villages. This was undertaken twice, in the summers of 2011 and 2018. All villages and farms that were located up to ca. 2 km from the forest complexes (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="animals-09-00141-f001" href="#animals-09-00141-f001">Figure 1</a>) were included. A minimal number of farms that “offered” anthropogenic food was counted. The farms where the animals were kept in enclosed areas (which means they were not available to goshawks) were not counted. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the first study period (1982–1992), a belt assessment was done to estimate the small game density [
  <a rid="B52-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52-animals-09-00141">52</a>,
  <a rid="B53-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53-animals-09-00141">53</a>]. With a low density, this method became inefficient, so spot light counts along transects intersecting open areas (mainly arable lands) were undertaken to assess the brown hare density (N/km
  <span class="sup">2</span>). They were done every year in December (2011–2017). The same route of ca. 40 km was repeated each year, and the detection distance was stable (200 m on one side). The counts were completed in favourable weather conditions (i.e., no rain, snow, or fog). Also, in the case of Galliforms, an alternative method was used. The counting of calling males (without playback) in spring was used to assess the density of grey partridges and pheasants. The first (2011–2013) section of work was undertaken in one sampling area of 1 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>, and in the years 2014–2018, a second sampling area (1 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) was included (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="animals-09-00141-f001" href="#animals-09-00141-f001">Figure 1</a>). Both were located in open, arable land. The work was completed in the early mornings on three consecutive days in favourable weather conditions (i.e., no rain or wind). The maximum result from one of the three days was adopted as the final density (N ♂ km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) in a given year. Rabbit colonies were searched mainly in the field and forest ecotone, and in the fields, all earlier localities of colonies were checked; hunters, farmers, and employees of the Experimental Forest Station in Rogów were surveyed.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the case of magpies and hooded crows, occupied nests (in buffer strips, groups of trees/shrubs, or single trees) were searched every year in spring 2011–2018 in a sampling area of 1060 ha (arable land) located in the centre of the study area (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="animals-09-00141-f001" href="#animals-09-00141-f001">Figure 1</a>). The nests of rooks and western jackdaw were searched across the whole study area. The density of breeding pairs was obtained. Hooded crows, rooks, and jackdaws were studied in the first (1998–1992) and current study periods. For magpies, the same methodology as in the past [
  <a rid="B54-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54-animals-09-00141">54</a>] was applied.
