 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Currently (2011–2018), goshawks tend to build their nests on Scots pines most often (ca. 46%), and larch and back alder were also important nesting trees. As compared to previous study periods, the share of Scots pine as a nesting tree dropped (chi-square test, χ
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 28.39, df = 2, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0001), while the share of larch (χ
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 22.97, df = 2, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0001) and black alder (χ
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 11.84, df = 2,

  <a rid="animals-09-00141-t004" ref-type="table" href="#animals-09-00141-t004">Table 4</a>) rose. The current mean nesting tree age was 84 years (SD = 18.4), the tree trunk diameter was 48 cm (SD = 12.1), and the height of nest placement was 21 m (SD = 2.2, 
  <a rid="animals-09-00141-t004" ref-type="table" href="#animals-09-00141-t004">Table 4</a>). In the years 2011–2018, goshawks built 37 nests and they bred 64 times, equaling to 1.7 breeding attempts per one nest. This value was lower for the first time period (1982–1992) at 1.1 breeding attempts per one nest (goshawks built 163 nests and bred 177 times).
