 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The current population densities (2011–2018) of goshawk were 0.76 pairs/10 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> of total area and 3.3 pairs/10 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> of forested area. Between 6 and 11 (mean 8.0, SD = 1.7) breeding pairs were recorded each year. The number of breeding pairs decreased when compared with the two previous study periods (
