  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2.1. Study Area</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The studies were undertaken in a lowland area of central Poland in the area of the Experimental Forest Station of Warsaw University of Life Sciences in the vicinity of Rogów village (51° 49’ 17,98 N, 19° 53’ 54, 15 E). This region is affected by the mild oceanic climate of Western Europe and the harsh and dry continental climate of Eastern Europe and Asia. The duration of the growing season is approximately 210 days; the total precipitation is 600 mm per year; and the mean ambient temperature ranges from –4°C in January to +18°C in July. The study area comprised ca. 105 km
   <span class="sup">2</span> of field and forest mosaic. Forests accounted for 25% of the area (approx. 2400 ha) and formed seven complexes (70–1000 ha) (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="animals-09-00141-f001" href="#animals-09-00141-f001">Figure 1</a>). The remaining area included arable lands (59%), orchards (5%), grasslands (5%), and scattered buildings [
   <a rid="B33-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-animals-09-00141">33</a>]. Most of the forests (83% of their area) grew on rich, moderately moist soil. The main forest-forming species was Scots pine, 
   <span class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</span>, but its share has dropped in the last decades as the species structure of stands has adjusted to habitat types. On the contrary, the share of larch 
   <span class="italic">Larix</span> spp. and broadleaved species rose. Also, the share of older stands, which are best for goshawks to build their nests, has increased in recent decades (

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mean stand age and stand volume has increased in recent decades, and in January 2009, it reached 71 years and 281 m
   <span class="sup">3</span>/ha, as compared to 51 years and 213 m
   <span class="sup">3</span>/ha in 1978. The annual harvest in the years 2014–2017 was rather low (4.9 m

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2.2. Inventory of Goshawk Population and Measurements of Nesting Trees</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each year (2011–2018, January–March), all known nests were visited in all seven forest complexes. Courtship displays, as well as the presence of single birds, were noted. From the beginning of April to early May, newly built nests were searched by two people equipped with binoculars (10 × 42) and handheld transceivers, walking 50–200 m apart, depending on the stand type and age and visibility. All stands, except areas with newly planted trees and sapling stands, were searched. After the breeding season (in autumn), areas where nests might have been missed (i.e., where calls of adult or young birds were heard during the breeding season) were checked again. All nests that were located were recorded on the map of stands (1:10,000) and recorded on a GPS receiver (Garmin 62sc, Garmin 62sc, Garmin International, Inc., Olathe, KS).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All occupied nests were visited in June and July to estimate the number of fledglings. The reasons for brood loss were determined when possible. The criteria for breeding were similar to the previous periods (1982–1992 and 2001–2003) and were as follow: (i) mating behavior (calls and flights of two birds) in the vicinity of a new/rebuilt nest, (ii) incubating a female on a nest/remnants of goshawk eggs below the new/rebuilt nests, and (iii) the presence of chicks and fledglings on the/next to the nest or their remnants in the vicinity of a nesting tree. On this basis, we calculated the number of nesting attempts per one nest, i.e., the number of breeding cases divided by the number of nests used for breeding. The breeding success (percent of pairs that successfully produced at least one fledgling as referred to all breeding pairs) and the number of fledglings were calculated, both for successful pairs and for all known breeding pairs.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Measurements of the nesting trees were completed in November and December. The tree species were determined, and the height of the nest placement and the tree diameter at a 1.3 m height were measured. The altimeter SILVA Clino Master, Spencer Loggers Tape, and caliper Haglof Mantax Precision were used.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Diet composition was assessed on the basis of an analysis of the plucking remains, pellets, and other prey remains and were collected on average every two weeks (from April to July) in the vicinity of nests (50 m radius). For each nest, we pooled all prey remains collected during the visits in one breeding season. In the laboratory, prey remains were systematically assigned with the aid of keys [

   <a rid="B40-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-animals-09-00141">40</a>]. Bird presence was detected mostly on the basis of feathers from plucking sites, while pellets were used mainly to detect other prey. We tried to avoid the double counting of prey detected with the two methods at one nest, i.e., we counted birds from pellets only in cases when we found bird remnants (mainly skulls) of species that were not detected on the basis of feathers from plucking sites. The mean prey body mass was adopted on the basis of the literature [

   <a rid="B44-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44-animals-09-00141">44</a>]. For bigger animals (assumingly eaten as carrion), the mean daily food requirement (200 g) was adopted as consumed biomass, while for insects, 1 g was adopted as a body mass for all species. The diet composition was presented as the share of a given taxon in a total number of prey items or consumed biomass.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The availability of anthropogenic food (domestic pigeons, domestic ducks 
   <span class="italic">Anas platyrhynchos domesticus</span>, domestic geese

   <span class="italic">Numida meleagris</span>, and domestic rabbit 
   <span class="italic">Oryctolagus cuniculus domesticus</span>) was not assessed for the two previous study periods. Now, it was assessed on the basis of door-to-door surveys supported by direct observations and along 22 transects (about 30 km in total) that run through villages. This was undertaken twice, in the summers of 2011 and 2018. All villages and farms that were located up to ca. 2 km from the forest complexes (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="animals-09-00141-f001" href="#animals-09-00141-f001">Figure 1</a>) were included. A minimal number of farms that “offered” anthropogenic food was counted. The farms where the animals were kept in enclosed areas (which means they were not available to goshawks) were not counted. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the first study period (1982–1992), a belt assessment was done to estimate the small game density [

   <a rid="B53-animals-09-00141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53-animals-09-00141">53</a>]. With a low density, this method became inefficient, so spot light counts along transects intersecting open areas (mainly arable lands) were undertaken to assess the brown hare density (N/km
   <span class="sup">2</span>). They were done every year in December (2011–2017). The same route of ca. 40 km was repeated each year, and the detection distance was stable (200 m on one side). The counts were completed in favourable weather conditions (i.e., no rain, snow, or fog). Also, in the case of Galliforms, an alternative method was used. The counting of calling males (without playback) in spring was used to assess the density of grey partridges and pheasants. The first (2011–2013) section of work was undertaken in one sampling area of 1 km
   <span class="sup">2</span>, and in the years 2014–2018, a second sampling area (1 km
   <span class="sup">2</span>) was included (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="animals-09-00141-f001" href="#animals-09-00141-f001">Figure 1</a>). Both were located in open, arable land. The work was completed in the early mornings on three consecutive days in favourable weather conditions (i.e., no rain or wind). The maximum result from one of the three days was adopted as the final density (N ♂ km
   <span class="sup">2</span>) in a given year. Rabbit colonies were searched mainly in the field and forest ecotone, and in the fields, all earlier localities of colonies were checked; hunters, farmers, and employees of the Experimental Forest Station in Rogów were surveyed.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the case of magpies and hooded crows, occupied nests (in buffer strips, groups of trees/shrubs, or single trees) were searched every year in spring 2011–2018 in a sampling area of 1060 ha (arable land) located in the centre of the study area (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="animals-09-00141-f001" href="#animals-09-00141-f001">Figure 1</a>). The nests of rooks and western jackdaw were searched across the whole study area. The density of breeding pairs was obtained. Hooded crows, rooks, and jackdaws were studied in the first (1998–1992) and current study periods. For magpies, the same methodology as in the past [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The normality of data distribution was checked with the Shapiro–Wilk test. To compare the abundance of breeding pairs in the three study periods, the Kruskal–Wallis test with the post hoc Mann Whitney test were used. The detailed data on the number of offspring were unavailable for the first period (1982–1992), so we only compared data for the second study period (2001–2003) with current data using the Mann–Whitney U-test. The percentage of trees of different species on which goshawks placed their nests and the diet composition in the three study periods were compared by means of a chi-square test, with a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (
