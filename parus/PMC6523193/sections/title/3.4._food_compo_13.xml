 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the current study period (2011–2018), goshawks preyed mainly on domestic pigeons and poultry, which accounted for 24.1% of their total prey items (N = 1065) and 49.2% of the biomass consumed (211,664 g in total). From among wild birds, wood pigeons 
  <span class="italic">Columba palumbus</span> and Eurasian jays 
  <span class="italic">Garrulus glandarius</span> were most important. Mammals accounted for 11.5% of their prey items and 3.7% of their biomass, including small prey and, in some cases, carrion. Amphibians, reptiles, and insects were found in very few pellets (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As compared to the previous study periods, a decrease in the share of domestic pigeons (from 38% of all prey items in 1982–1992 to 22.8% now) was recorded (chi-square test, χ
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 78.42, df = 2, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0001). The same was evident in the case of poultry, which, in the first period, constituted over 10% of all biomass, while recently, it was just 3.3%. The share of small game (brown hare, European rabbit, pheasant, and grey partridge) in the current study was the lowest from all three study periods (χ
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 22.03, df = 2, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0001). On the contrary, the share of Eurasian jay (χ
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 47.79, df = 2, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0001) and wood pigeon (χ
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 46.26, df = 2, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0001) increased (
