 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, our study showed that anthropogenic food (poultry and domestic pigeons) plays a key role for the goshawk population in the transformed habitats of the field and forest mosaic, even though the hunting birds were persecuted by local farmers. The birds built their nests in small forest complexes, but much of their prey was caught in open spaces in the vicinity of farmsteads. Consequently, what has led to the observed population decrease is the current limited anthropogenic food base, as a result of political and socioeconomic changes that have affected polish farmland. As medium-sized mammals and birds (i.e., small game and most corvid species) are not abundant (or absent, like forest grouses), they could not replace the staple food of anthropogenic origin when it was removed. This study showed the complex way in which socioeconomic changes in agriculture influence the raptor population, both positively (with fewer cases of persecution since the small scale production of poultry and pigeons is no longer important and widespread) and negatively (by influencing the food base directly; in this case, by limiting anthropogenic food source availability; and indirectly, by changes in farming practices that have led to a decrease in small-game prey availability). Even though farmers have now stopped persecuting goshawks, this has not counterbalanced the anthropogenic food base loss.</p>
