 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the years 2011–2018, goshawks produced on average 1.6 fledglings per breeding pair (SD = 1.07) and 2.0 (SD = 0.69) per successful pair. The breeding success was 76% (SD = 7.2). Compared to previous study periods, these parameters seemed to be similar or decrease (

However, it was only possible to compare the number of juveniles between two periods (2001–2003 and 2011–2018; for 1982–1992, the detailed data were unavailable), for which no statistical differences were found (Mann–Whitney U-test, number of fledglings per breeding pair: Z = 0.87,
