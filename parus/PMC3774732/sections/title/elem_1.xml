  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study involved the sampling of a small amount of blood of free-ranging bird nestlings, c. 10 µL per nestling, taken from the ulnar vain. The work was conducted according to Polish legal guidelines. All procedures of bird handling and blood sampling were approved by the Local Ethical Committee for Animal Experiments in Łódź (Permit Number: 1/ŁB 530/2011) and the Director of State Office for Environment Protection (Permit Number: DOP-OZGIZ.6401.03.41.2011.dł), the latter being given at the national level. At each location, the study was carried out with permission of relevant land managers: the Director of Łódź Botanic Garden, the Director of Łódź Zoological Garden and the Director of Łódź Forestry Administration Unit. The permit to band birds was given by the National Central Office for Bird Ringing, Museum and Institute of Zoology, Warsaw.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study of variation in the H/L ratio of nestlings was carried out in 2005–2006 and 2010–2012 for blue tits and in 2010–2012 for great tits, as part of a long-term project (initiated in 1999) on the breeding ecology of nest-box populations of common hole-nesting birds in central Poland. The study system is localized around the city of Łódź and encompasses two 10 km-distant areas differing in habitat types: a parkland site with c. 200 nest-boxes and a woodland site with c. 300 nest-boxes. Wooden nest-boxes with removable front wall 
   <a rid="pone.0074226-Lambrechts1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Lambrechts1">[61]</a> were used.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The parkland site (51°45’N; 19°24’E) consists of two units, Łódź Botanic Garden (67 ha) and neighboring Łódź Zoological Garden (17 ha). Both the gardens belong to a large parkland area extending to the east and, partly, north of the study area, within the western part of the city of Łódź; the whole area is a remnant of an ancient deciduous forest dominated by hornbeam 
   <span class="italic">Carpinus betulus</span> and oaks 
   <span class="italic">Quercus robur</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Quercus petrea</span>. The vegetation of the Zoological Garden descends from that forest, but it has been heavily fragmented by paths, buildings and fenced, deforested exposition spaces for animals. There are some small patches artificially wooded with Scots pines 
   <span class="italic">Pinus silvestris</span>, birches 
   <span class="italic">Betula</span> and some exotic tree species. Only some very limited fragments of the Botanic Garden consist of forest patches, mostly with birches as predominating trees. The vegetation of the most part of this garden has been formed artificially for the purpose of plant exposition, so that the tree cover is patchy with a large area of tree-free spaces. Tree patches are a mosaic of different deciduous and coniferous trees, in large part exotic species. Both gardens possess networks of pedestrian pathways and children playgrounds for visitors. They are very popular leisure time spaces for inhabitants of Łódź and tourists, and may be very crowded during spring and summer. South and south-east sides of the Botanic Garden border on highly urbanized area of the town with numerous blocks of flats.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The woodland study site (51°50’N; 19°29’E), the Łagiewniki Forest, is a rich deciduous forest of considerable size, c. 1250 ha, located N-E of Łódź 
   <a rid="pone.0074226-KurowskiJK1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-KurowskiJK1">[62]</a>. Some fragments of the forest that were chopped down in the 1940 s have subsequently been reforested. The majority of the forest comes directly from the ancient deciduous woodland typical for the geographical area of central Europe. It represents different plant communities, mostly oak and hornbeam forests. In the c.120 ha nest-box supplied study area that is located in the central part of the forest, oaks are dominating tree species. The tree age structure is mature with all age-classes represented, and many trees as old as c. 200 years present. Some dead tree logs are usually maintained at places where they have grown.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to the differences in the structure of the tree cover and human influence, the parkland and woodland study areas differ with respect to some other factors of ecological importance 
   <a rid="pone.0074226-Marciniak1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Marciniak1">[11]</a>. The Łagiewniki Forest has rich animal communities, including predatory birds and mammals. No predatory mammals regularly occur in the gardens, with one pair of the sparrowhawk 
   <span class="italic">Accipiter nisus</span> breeding in this area in some years. A consistent feature of the study sites is that tree-crown-leaf-eating caterpillars are more numerous in the woodland than in the parkland 
   <a rid="pone.0074226-Marciniak1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Marciniak1">[11]</a>. The abundance of caterpillars was monitored using the frassfall-collecting method

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data on weather for Łódź, mean temperature and total rainfall for May, as the month when the nestling stage of the first clutch of tits occurs, were extracted from the TuTiempo.net climate data archive -

In addition, the number of rainy days was calculated from records of daily rainfall in the same archive. The weather in May was highly variable among the years of the study (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0074226-t001" href="#pone-0074226-t001">Table 1</a>). In 2012, we recorded the local temperature in May in both study sites using DS1921G Thermochron iButton loggers. The loggers were set up under randomly drawn nest-boxes; 12 loggers in the forest site and 8 in the parkland site. Temperature was recorded to the nearest 0.5°C every hour. Mean and maximum daily temperatures for each logger were used to calculate corresponding monthly means and those were treated as unit data points to compare mean and maximum temperatures between the study sites.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the breeding season, the nest-boxes were inspected once a week to record variables describing breeding: species, laying date, clutch size and so on. Because a frequency of genuine second broods is low, especially in blue tits, variable between years and difficult to discriminate from repeat broods, we decided to pool second and repeat broods into the late-brood category that was analyzed for comparison with first broods. Except this simple comparison of the H/L ratio between first and late broods, this study focused mostly on first brood nestlings.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On day 13–14 after hatching, the nestlings were individually banded, measured and sampled for blood, usually between 09∶00 and 14∶00 H. All nestlings in every brood were measured (wing length to the nearest 1 mm) and weighed (to the nearest 0.1 g), while only a random subsample of 3–5 nestlings blind-drawn out of same-age nestlings from every brood was designated for taking blood samples (c. 10 µL taken from the ulnar vain) that were used to prepare blood smears on individually numbered microscope slides. The smears were dried in the field and stained in the laboratory using a commercial Microscopy Hemacolor kit (Merck Chemicals). The number of heterophils and lymphocytes for every blood smear was counted to sum up to 100 cells, applying a microscope under 1000x magnification with oil immersion. All microscope counts of blood cells were conducted by the same person (JS), with independent counts of heterophils and lymphocytes being highly repeatable (r
   <sub>i</sub> = 0.78±0.11 SE, F
   <sub>9,20</sub> = 11.94, P&lt;0.00001 in blue tits, and r
   <sub>i</sub> = 0.79±0.10 SE, F
   <sub>9,20</sub> = 12.17, P&lt;0.00001 in great tits). The ratio of the number of heterophils to the number of limphocytes (H/L ratio) was then calculated. Because some smears were faulty or non-readable, we finally analyzed smears for 649 nestlings from 175 blue tit broods (including only 7 late broods) and 607 nestlings from 206 great tit broods (including 41 late broods).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The individual H/L ratios were ln-transformed (ln (1+H/L)) to meet assumptions of analyses, but are presented in a non-transformed form in the figures and the text. Because the H/L ratios of nestlings from the same brood are not independent, the ln-transformed H/L ratios were analyzed using mixed linear models, with brood Id included as a random factor controlling for clustering; degrees of freedom were estimated by the Satterthwaite method 
   <a rid="pone.0074226-Heck1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Heck1">[64]</a>. Effects of different factors on the H/L ratio were modeled in an ANCOVA style by first fitting a model that included wing length as an age-controlling covariate and all factors of interest. We previously confirmed that wing length is a reliable and precise measure of age in average trophic conditions 
   <a rid="pone.0074226-Babura3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Babura3">[48]</a>. The covariate was removed from the model when non-significant or retained when significant to produce the final model presented in the paper 
   <a rid="pone.0074226-Crawley1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Crawley1">[65]</a>. The comparison of the H/L ratios between first-brood nestling blue tits and great tits did not include the wing-length covariate because of a distinct difference in body size between these species; species identity was the main factor in this comparison, with year and site providing only a background. The year and site factors were basic factors in within-species analyses.
