 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Variation in the heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratio reported in this study revealed significant inter-species, inter-site and year-to-year differences. The H/L ratio in nestling blue tits was higher than in great tits. In both species, the H/L ratio was higher in the urban parkland site than in the forest site. In the blue tit, but not in the great tit, the ratio was significantly variable between years. In addition to these patterns, a notable part of the total variance in the H/L ratio lies between broods, 89% for blue tits and 72% in great tits, as shown for the first clutch by estimation of intraclass correlations

  <a rid="pone.0074226-Nadolski1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Nadolski1">[66]</a>. This suggests that nestlings from the same brood tend to be non-randomly similar to one another with respect to the individual H/L ratio.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the H/L ratio was shown to be a reliable indicator of different kinds of stress influencing birds 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Ots1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Ots1">[18]</a>,

  <a rid="pone.0074226-Moreno1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Moreno1">[44]</a>, some difficulties with interpretations are likely to arise. The H/L ratio is an index dependent on changes in two cell kinds engaged in immune response; heterophils are phagocytes involved in the first-line innate defense against infections, while lymphocytes are involved in the highly specific acquired defense 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Davis1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Davis1">[45]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Campbell1">[67]</a>. Since different cellular components of the immune system may develop along different trajectories with the growth of an organism, the age must be included in all comparisons in the case of studying the H/L ratio of nestlings 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Johnstone1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Johnstone1">[42]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Dehnhard1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Dehnhard1">[68]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moreover, even if comparisons concern nestlings of the same age, the H/L ratio and the level of circulating corticosterone as stress indicators respond to different types of environmental stressors, at a different rate and on different time scales 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Johnstone1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Johnstone1">[42]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Muller1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Muller1">[49]</a>. Glucocorticoids are biochemical mediators directly involved in stress reactions; their blood concentration may be elevated immediately after a stressor starts to influence an organism, whereas changes in leucocyte profiles leading to changes in the H/L ratio last longer 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Johnstone1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Johnstone1">[42]</a>. Muller et al 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Muller1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Muller1">[49]</a> found that in nestling Eurasian kestrels 
  <span class="italic">Falco tinnunculus</span> the level of corticosterone responded with elevation to severe starvation and anthropogenic disturbances, while the H/L ratio increased in response to prolonged food-related, ectoparasitic, social and ecological stressors. Both these stress indicators responded to very severe stressors, potentially threatening to nestling survival. Because in studies on poultry it was found that intense stress may stimulate an increase in the number of heterophils and a decrease in the number of limphocytes, Maxwell 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Maxwell1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Maxwell1">[69]</a> postulated that the H/L ratio is a good indicator of chronic mild to moderate stress.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several experimental studies on birds included the nestling H/L ratio as one of response variables

  <a rid="pone.0074226-Babura6" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Babura6">[60]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Hrak1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Hrak1">[70]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Naguib1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Naguib1">[72]</a>. Some brood-size manipulations were reported not to affect the H/L ratio of nestlings 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Hrak1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Hrak1">[70]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Naguib1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Naguib1">[72]</a>, while the remaining ones produced significant effects, with nestlings in enlarged broods usually showing an elevated H/L ratio 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Suorsa1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Suorsa1">[32]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Ilmonen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Ilmonen1">[47]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Babura6" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Babura6">[60]</a>. Brood-size manipulations change parental effort, amount and quality of food, feeding rate and social interactions between nest-mates; all these factors enhance stress in enlarged broods and may weaken stress in reduced broods 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Babura6" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Babura6">[60]</a>. The provision of extra-food makes rearing conditions easier, thus potentially reducing stress. We conducted previously such an experiment on great tits and found that nestlings in broods supplemented with additional food had a lower H/L ratio than nestlings in non-manipulated control broods 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Babura3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Babura3">[48]</a>. In both types of experiments physiological stress seems to be directly or indirectly related to food and its distribution among nestlings.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Also ecological correlates of the H/L ratio suggest that food mediates in generating stress affecting nestlings. Hoi-Leitner et al. 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-HoiLeitner1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-HoiLeitner1">[46]</a> found a negative correlation between granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratios in nestling serins 
  <span class="italic">Serinus serinus</span> and the abundance of food in breeding territories and nestling growth indices, which leads to the conclusion that better nutrition results in lower stress indicators. Moreno et al. 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Moreno1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Moreno1">[44]</a> showed negative relations of stress indicators (the H/L ratio and stress proteins HSP60) with indicators of nestling nutrition. Suorsa et al. 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Suorsa1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Suorsa1">[32]</a> revealed in nestling Eurasian treecreepers 
  <span class="italic">Certhia familiaris</span> that broods in larger, less fragmented forest patches, where foraging is more efficient, were characterized by a lower H/L ratio. Because habitats and years tend to differ in the amounts and the availability of food in relation to specific abiotic and biotic conditions, it would be expected that indicators of stress should display corresponding patterns of spatio-temporal variation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Accordingly, the patterns we report here seem reasonable. The higher average H/L ratio in nestling blue tits than in nestling great tits may suggest that the former are more sensitive to environmental stressors than the latter, which is consistent with the ecology of both these species. Although both species are commonly described as ecologically similar to each other, the blue tit is more than the great tit specialized in the preference for deciduous breeding habitats and in feeding nestlings with tree canopy caterpillars 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Perrins2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Perrins2">[52]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Babura4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Babura4">[53]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Cramp1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Cramp1">[73]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Babura7" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Babura7">[74]</a>. In our study system, we previously found that the food of nestling great tits contained a lower percentage of caterpillars than in the case of blue tits and that the proportion of caterpillars in the diet was lower in the parkland than in the forest in great tits, whereas there was no difference in blue tits 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Michalski1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Michalski1">[82]</a>. This suggests that in generally worse trophic conditions of the parkland site great tits preyed more frequently on alternative prey, while blue tits kept foraging on caterpillars, probably at some cost that might generate additional stress. In accordance with this, there seems to exist a slight tendency for the difference in the H/L ratio between nestling blue tits and great tits to be larger in the parkland site than in the forest site (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074226-g001" href="#pone-0074226-g001">Fig. 1</a>). It seems probable that such subtle inter-specific differences in the H/L ratios are detectable only when both species are studied in the same sites and years.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lower average H/L values found in the forest site than in the park site are likely to be caused by the availability of food. Caterpillars, the key food of nestling tits 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Perrins2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Perrins2">[52]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Babura4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Babura4">[53]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Perrins3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Perrins3">[55]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Cholewa1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Cholewa1">[75]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-GarciaNavas1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-GarciaNavas1">[76]</a>, are more than twice as abundant in the forest site than in the park site, as shown in this study and previous papers 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Marciniak1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Marciniak1">[11]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Babura2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Babura2">[25]</a>. This factor certainly makes rearing conditions more comfortable for parental birds and, therefore, for nestlings. In addition to the low abundance of caterpillars, the parkland site has also a very fragmented tree-cover and great numbers of human visitors who spend their leisure time there. Habitat fragmentation is known to impose difficulties on foraging birds 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Nour1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Nour1">[57]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Hinsley1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Hinsley1">[58]</a> and was shown to elevate stress in nestlings 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Suorsa1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Suorsa1">[32]</a>. Human activity may interfere with feeding visits of parents at their nests and, thus, is likely to disturb the rate of nestling feeding.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Besides food, the inter-habitat difference in the H/L ratios could potentially result from some other habitat-specific effects. Because of tree-cover fragmentation, nest-boxes in our park habitat might be overheated as a result of more intense insolation than in the forest site. However, even in the very warm May 2012, mean maximum temperature did not differ between the sites, with mean monthly temperature being slightly higher in the parkland site than in the forest. This excludes a possibility of overheating as a major stressor.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although inter-habitat differences in physiological parameters seem more interesting than inter-year differences, the latter are also a notable components of natural variation that need to be examined. Variation in the H/L ratio among years, in this study found in blue tits, but not in great tits, may also be associated with differences in food availability. The availability of caterpillars for foraging adult birds depends not only on the prey abundance but also on prevailing external conditions, with rainfall being a hindering factor in prey collecting 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Radford1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Radford1">[77]</a>. In comparison with a very high density of caterpillars in 2003–2004 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Marciniak1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Marciniak1">[11]</a>, their abundance was rather low in 2005–2006 and middle in 2010–2012. As a consequence of weather prevailing during the nestling stage of breeding, conditions for foraging and feeding nestlings were better in 2005–2006 and 2011 than in 2010 and 2012. The extreme weather during the nestling period may affect food availability and regularity of feeding visits, which would impact on nestlings as a stressor. This would be consistent with the H/L ratio variation among years in the blue tit. In the case of great tits, we did not study the H/L ratio in 2005 and 2006, and the values in 2010–2012 did not significantly differ among years. Although some spatial and temporal patterns were revealed in different physiological characteristics of nestling birds

  <a rid="pone.0074226-Kaliski1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Kaliski1">[79]</a>, we are not aware of any other study showing variation of the H/L ratio in relation to different habitats and years. Indication of the existence of some spatio-temporal variation in great tit nestlings may be inferred from the data shown by Norte et al. 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Norte1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Norte1">[80]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Though we expected that nestling H/L ratios should be lower in genuine first broods than in repeat and second broods (late broods), we did not find any difference. However, samples of late broods were small for both tit species, which reduced power of analyses. Timing of hatching did not affect the H/L ratio in another study on great tit nestlings 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Norte2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Norte2">[81]</a>, but it was significant in kestrels 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Muller1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Muller1">[49]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To sum up, consistent patterns of variation in the H/L ratio of nestling blue tits and great tits support the idea that the ratio can be used as an indicator of physiological stress that is generated by food-related stressors differing in space and time. The inter-species difference in the H/L ratio reflects a difference in ecological sensitivity between blue tits and great tits.</p>
