 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study of variation in the H/L ratio of nestlings was carried out in 2005–2006 and 2010–2012 for blue tits and in 2010–2012 for great tits, as part of a long-term project (initiated in 1999) on the breeding ecology of nest-box populations of common hole-nesting birds in central Poland. The study system is localized around the city of Łódź and encompasses two 10 km-distant areas differing in habitat types: a parkland site with c. 200 nest-boxes and a woodland site with c. 300 nest-boxes. Wooden nest-boxes with removable front wall 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Lambrechts1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Lambrechts1">[61]</a> were used.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The parkland site (51°45’N; 19°24’E) consists of two units, Łódź Botanic Garden (67 ha) and neighboring Łódź Zoological Garden (17 ha). Both the gardens belong to a large parkland area extending to the east and, partly, north of the study area, within the western part of the city of Łódź; the whole area is a remnant of an ancient deciduous forest dominated by hornbeam 
  <span class="italic">Carpinus betulus</span> and oaks 
  <span class="italic">Quercus robur</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Quercus petrea</span>. The vegetation of the Zoological Garden descends from that forest, but it has been heavily fragmented by paths, buildings and fenced, deforested exposition spaces for animals. There are some small patches artificially wooded with Scots pines 
  <span class="italic">Pinus silvestris</span>, birches 
  <span class="italic">Betula</span> and some exotic tree species. Only some very limited fragments of the Botanic Garden consist of forest patches, mostly with birches as predominating trees. The vegetation of the most part of this garden has been formed artificially for the purpose of plant exposition, so that the tree cover is patchy with a large area of tree-free spaces. Tree patches are a mosaic of different deciduous and coniferous trees, in large part exotic species. Both gardens possess networks of pedestrian pathways and children playgrounds for visitors. They are very popular leisure time spaces for inhabitants of Łódź and tourists, and may be very crowded during spring and summer. South and south-east sides of the Botanic Garden border on highly urbanized area of the town with numerous blocks of flats.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The woodland study site (51°50’N; 19°29’E), the Łagiewniki Forest, is a rich deciduous forest of considerable size, c. 1250 ha, located N-E of Łódź 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-KurowskiJK1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-KurowskiJK1">[62]</a>. Some fragments of the forest that were chopped down in the 1940 s have subsequently been reforested. The majority of the forest comes directly from the ancient deciduous woodland typical for the geographical area of central Europe. It represents different plant communities, mostly oak and hornbeam forests. In the c.120 ha nest-box supplied study area that is located in the central part of the forest, oaks are dominating tree species. The tree age structure is mature with all age-classes represented, and many trees as old as c. 200 years present. Some dead tree logs are usually maintained at places where they have grown.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to the differences in the structure of the tree cover and human influence, the parkland and woodland study areas differ with respect to some other factors of ecological importance 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Marciniak1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Marciniak1">[11]</a>. The Łagiewniki Forest has rich animal communities, including predatory birds and mammals. No predatory mammals regularly occur in the gardens, with one pair of the sparrowhawk 
  <span class="italic">Accipiter nisus</span> breeding in this area in some years. A consistent feature of the study sites is that tree-crown-leaf-eating caterpillars are more numerous in the woodland than in the parkland 
  <a rid="pone.0074226-Marciniak1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0074226-Marciniak1">[11]</a>. The abundance of caterpillars was monitored using the frassfall-collecting method

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data on weather for Łódź, mean temperature and total rainfall for May, as the month when the nestling stage of the first clutch of tits occurs, were extracted from the TuTiempo.net climate data archive - 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/LODZ/124650.htm" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/LODZ/124650.htm</span>. In addition, the number of rainy days was calculated from records of daily rainfall in the same archive. The weather in May was highly variable among the years of the study (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0074226-t001" href="#pone-0074226-t001">Table 1</a>). In 2012, we recorded the local temperature in May in both study sites using DS1921G Thermochron iButton loggers. The loggers were set up under randomly drawn nest-boxes; 12 loggers in the forest site and 8 in the parkland site. Temperature was recorded to the nearest 0.5°C every hour. Mean and maximum daily temperatures for each logger were used to calculate corresponding monthly means and those were treated as unit data points to compare mean and maximum temperatures between the study sites.
