 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the breeding season, the nest-boxes were inspected once a week to record variables describing breeding: species, laying date, clutch size and so on. Because a frequency of genuine second broods is low, especially in blue tits, variable between years and difficult to discriminate from repeat broods, we decided to pool second and repeat broods into the late-brood category that was analyzed for comparison with first broods. Except this simple comparison of the H/L ratio between first and late broods, this study focused mostly on first brood nestlings.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On day 13–14 after hatching, the nestlings were individually banded, measured and sampled for blood, usually between 09∶00 and 14∶00 H. All nestlings in every brood were measured (wing length to the nearest 1 mm) and weighed (to the nearest 0.1 g), while only a random subsample of 3–5 nestlings blind-drawn out of same-age nestlings from every brood was designated for taking blood samples (c. 10 µL taken from the ulnar vain) that were used to prepare blood smears on individually numbered microscope slides. The smears were dried in the field and stained in the laboratory using a commercial Microscopy Hemacolor kit (Merck Chemicals). The number of heterophils and lymphocytes for every blood smear was counted to sum up to 100 cells, applying a microscope under 1000x magnification with oil immersion. All microscope counts of blood cells were conducted by the same person (JS), with independent counts of heterophils and lymphocytes being highly repeatable (r
  <sub>i</sub> = 0.78±0.11 SE, F
  <sub>9,20</sub> = 11.94, P&lt;0.00001 in blue tits, and r
  <sub>i</sub> = 0.79±0.10 SE, F
  <sub>9,20</sub> = 12.17, P&lt;0.00001 in great tits). The ratio of the number of heterophils to the number of limphocytes (H/L ratio) was then calculated. Because some smears were faulty or non-readable, we finally analyzed smears for 649 nestlings from 175 blue tit broods (including only 7 late broods) and 607 nestlings from 206 great tit broods (including 41 late broods).
