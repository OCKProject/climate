 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The analysis of inter-species variation in first brood at the background of the year and site factors showed that nestling blue tits had 16% higher mean H/L ratio than nestling great tits (mixed model ANOVA: F
  <sub>1,384.599</sub> = 10.458, p = 0.001) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074226-g001" href="#pone-0074226-g001">Fig. 1</a>). In both species, significant intraclass correlations of H/L ratios were found (ICC = 0.89, Wald Z
  <sub>1</sub> = 8.17, P&lt;0.0001 for blue tits, and ICC = 0.72, Wald Z
  <sub>1</sub> = 7.98, P&lt;0.0001 for great tits, as calculated for the first clutch data).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In first brood nestling blue tits, the H/L ratio differed between sites and years (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0074226-t002" href="#pone-0074226-t002">Table 2</a>). Because there was no interaction between the site and year factors (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0074226-t002" href="#pone-0074226-t002">Table 2</a>), the main effects can be considered separately. The average H/L ratio was c. 30% higher in the parkland site than in the forest (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074226-g001" href="#pone-0074226-g001">Fig. 1</a>). With respect to temporal variation, the lowest mean H/L value was recorded in 2005 and the highest values, c. twice as high as in 2005, were found in 2010 and 2012, with middle values found in 2006 and 2011 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074226-g002" href="#pone-0074226-g002">Fig. 2</a>). The Fisher LSD test showed that significant differences occurred between 2005 and 2010 (p = 0.007), 2005 and 2012 (p = 0.006) as well as between 2006 and 2010 (p = 0.05), and between 2006 and 2012 (p = 0.04), with all other pairwise differences being non-significant.
