 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PESI is about integration and presentation of data. To do this effectively a common framework is needed to support the establishment and promotion of controlled vocabularies and metadata standards that enable effective integration of data and best practices. PESI sets out to provide a taxonomic backbone for Europe, at the heart of which is an annotated synonymised checklist of species. The prime focus has been to identify appropriate standards to support this task. In addition to ensuring that data held within PESI are successfully integrated, it is important that our data are accessible and interoperable with other initiatives. We have therefore looked at protocols, data models, controlled vocabularies and ontologiesthat will facilitate this interoperability, working closely with external organisations involved with biodiversity informatics to assist in the process of developing standards and resources for data exchange and data validation.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More specifically PESI focused on:</p>
 <div list-type="bullet" class="list" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Defining PESI as an annotated checklist, listing the range of different taxonomic products, differentiating between standard taxonomies and standards used to exchange taxonomic information and build consensus biological classifications (Suppl. material 
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1605069" href="#S1605069">11</a>).
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Examining the rationale, logistics and challenges to coordinate a set of independent initiatives that collectively catalogue nomenclatural acts according to the different codes of nomenclature, allowing a differentiation between nomenclature and taxonomy and proposing a strategy for linking nomenclators to PESI (Suppl. material 
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1605070" href="#S1605070">12</a>). For this purpose a series of workshops was organised in collaboration with 
    <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.e-taxonomy.eu/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">EDIT</span>, including a "GNOMA" workshop, to develop a common terminology and define common services and formats for a 'Global Nomenclators Architecture' (Suppl. material 
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1605057" href="#S1605057">13</a>), and workshops focused on identifying strategies for populating ZooBank, the developing registry for animal names (
    <a rid="B1605059" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1605059">Pyle and Michel 2008</a>), inviting ICZN commissioners, data managers from a number of large zoological databases, representatives from Zoological Record, and representatives from other nomenclatural databases regarding common issues such as the registration of new species names (Suppl. material 
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1605058" href="#S1605058">14</a>) (see also section 'Outlooks').

   <p>Outlining the success in reaching agreements between key players in the global community and specifically detailing how standards would be used to exchange taxonomic data, in particular by using the

   </p>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PESI researched and proposed standards for working with data associated with biological organisms, including:</p>
 <div list-type="bullet" class="list" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>A management classification integrating the schemes used in the component datasets.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>An informal classification using informal names for higher groupings familiar to the non-expert (terms such as: snails, butterflies, dragonflies).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>A scheme for Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs) that can be applied to biological names (and other entities) to allow machine-level matching of equivalents.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>A vocabulary of approved terms to cover occurrence status of organisms.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>A controlled set of terms for geographical areas, including European marine regions.</p>

  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tdwg.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Biodiversity Information Standards</span> organisation (TDWG) in association with

It is important to use a simple solution to make it easy for data providers to submit their data to PESI. It also provides the mechanism for PESI data to be passed to third parties, such as GBIF or other European taxonomy and biodiversity projects.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Controlled vocabularies developed and recommended for occurrence status, taxon status, nomenclatural status and geographical regions in use in the PESI data warehouse and PESI Portal are listed as an appendix in the PESI Focal Point Handbook (Suppl. material

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PESI partners organised sessions and presented papers at the annual conferences of the Biodiversity Standards Organisation (TDWG) and, most importantly, made use of these occasions to further the development of PESI objectives through networking with the leading participants in the development of biodiversity informatics standards. A significant outcome from these activities is the ‘Montpellier Declaration’. This is an agreement, proposed by PESI, between major biodiversity informatics projects to use a standard approach to sharing data (discussed in Suppl. material 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1605071" href="#S1605071">15</a>). More recently, at the TDWG 2013 meeting in Florence, PESI partners took the lead on establishing the

In addition to the RDA charter, the importance of developing a next generation names infrastructure, provisionally called "Global Names Europe" (GN-EU), was put forward by PESI partners (i) as participants of the ‘
