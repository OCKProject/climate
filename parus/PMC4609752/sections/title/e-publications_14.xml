 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The PESI project recognises the need to link the conventional scientific publications to the species databases to provide users with a more comprehensive resource. To that end the project engaged with major publishers of scientific journals to understand how their online information systems were developing, and to explain how the species databases were evolving. A first workshop was held on 16th July 2009 in Amsterdam inviting key publishers, including PLoS, InterResearch, Allen Press, CRC Press (Taylor &amp; Francis), Oxford University Press, Scopus, Science Direct, Elsevier, ISI Web of Science of Thomson Reuters, OvidSP (Biological Abstracts), Wiley, ProQuest (part of Cambridge), and JSTOR (Suppl. material

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The process of contacting publishers revealed that most publishers were very limited in the functionality they had on their websites, and constrained by the limitations of the commercially provided software they used to provide added functionality. A first step in that regard has been the initiation of a special 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ploscollections.org/article/browse/issue/info:doi/10.1371/issue.pcol.v02.i20" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">PLoS ONE Collection</span> of scientific papers arising from the 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.marinespecies.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">World Register of Marine Species</span> (WoRMS). WoRMS is a superset of the European Register of Marine Species, which is one of the three primary European species databases that form the core of the PESI project. At present, more than 19 papers have been published (
  <a rid="B1640657" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1640657">Costello et al. 2013b</a>). Each paper should be directly linked to the WoRMS database so readers will get openaccess to the primary data and information.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A similar approach was followed later on by Fauna Europaea in collaboration with 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pensoft.net/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Pensoft</span>, supported by the FP-7 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://vbrant.eu/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">ViBRANT</span> project, starting the publishing of so-called '
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pensoft.net/news.php?n=420&amp;SESID=3pnfntkrsb6cn1onqa560aqkq3" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Contributions on Fauna Europaea</span>' as a special series of the 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biodiversitydatajournal.com/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Biological Data Journal</span> (BDJ), with 10 data papers published so far. Euro+Med from the beginning took a distinctive approach towards updating the database. For instance, all occurrence records for a species in Euro+Med must have been published in a peer-reviewed paper. To accommodate miscellaneous new data, a series of "Euro+Med Notulae" was initiated in 2005 (

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another conclusion of this publishers workshop was that an important, practical, option to link to a wider range of journals would be the use of RSS feeds, because this would provide no or little action on the side of the journal. Such a system would need the feeds to be aware of what species (or higher taxonomic) names to search and match to the published papers. The 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gbif.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Global Biodiversity Information Facility</span> (GBIF) communicated their advances on developing a relevant tool. The usefulness of such a tool should be tested. For example, if species or taxonomic names are not apparent in the titles, abstracts and keywords of journal articles, they may be overlooked. Alternatively, papers of very peripheral relevance may be fed to the species database and overwhelm the editors and readers. In the latter case additional filters could be placed to constrain the RSS feed. The PESI partners intend to explore these options further on when the GBIF tool becomes available, a collaboration highlighted at the

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The highest priority journals for species databases to be linked are those describing new species, and rationalising species nomenclatures (e.g. identifying synonyms or reclassifying species). One of the leading taxonomic journals in this field is 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Zootaxa</span>, which publishes almost five times more new species than the next ranked journals (

The PESI project started a regular dialogue with this journal, which led to the invitation of the Zootaxa Chief Editor (Dr Zhi-Qiang Zhang), to a follow-up 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.e-taxonomy.net/node/805" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">EDIT third publishers workshop</span> in Copenhagen on 7-8 October 2010 (Suppl. material 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1604993" href="#S1604993">27</a>), jointly organised by EDIT and PESI. EDIT had proposed a new 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.europeanjournaloftaxonomy.eu/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">European Journal of Taxonomy</span> (EJT) that would integrate existing small journals in Europe, and thus have the resources to modernise their publication processes. This is now established (
  <a rid="B1640686" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1640686">Bénichou L et al. 2012</a>). However, only a few journals appeared willing to lose their identity by joining EJT. Zootaxa's Chief Editor proposed a complementary approach to journal ‘integration’. In this ‘aggregation’ approach, a common portal would be established using open-source Open Journal Systems software. This would manage editorial processes (i.e., paper submission, assignment of referees, editorial decisions), and publication (e.g., when online, when open access) and archiving. Importantly, each paper, past and future, would be indexed by species names and classification, and geographic area studied, so as to directly link papers with species in the PESI databases. This portal would be called 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biotaxa.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Biotaxa</span> and is now operational and serving 30 journals, including those that describe 30% of all new species each year. We envisage that moving the editorial process of taxonomic publishing online by providing a permanent low-cost portal for publication and by archiving an intimately linked with the expert-edited species databases will revolutionise the taxonomic publications process (see also 'Outlooks' section).
