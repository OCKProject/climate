 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">e-Services for users and dissemination</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PESI has built an interactive, multilingual web portal to carry out the dissemination of the developed species names service and to support the use of the pan-European species data in the e-science domain. This includes relevant supplementary data, such as (region-based) occurrence details, literature and DNA sequence information, and applies dynamic links to other pertinent data services. Additionally, web services allow users to link PESI-functions into desktop applications as well as service-oriented information infrastructures and hereby establish enhanced access to species names, GUIDs, occurrence details and the hierarchical classification. The PESI web portal provides the interface to the European Taxonomic Backbone.</p>
