 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to creating a network of taxonomic experts, PESI has developed a network of regional (often national) focal points. These focal points (either individuals or organisations) complement the taxonomic network through: (1) liaising with national governmental bodies on the implementation of European standards relevant to, for instance, national and European regulations and environmental monitoring, (2) collecting and transferring local expertise and applied tools, (3) lobbying and public policy assistance at national and European level, and (4) supporting closer collaboration of scientific contributor and user communities across Europe. Focal points contribute country-specific information about species, relevant databases, local literature, experts, professional societies and major users such as government organisations.</p>
