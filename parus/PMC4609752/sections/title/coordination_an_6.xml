 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PESI has technically integrated the pan-European species registers into an e-infrastructure by creating a joint access (middle) layer, the PESI data warehouse. This includes an index of species names associated with a number of attributes, such as synonyms, their place in the management classification and their geographical distribution. This data content results from the integration of the earlier pan-European checklists into a unified directory, following advanced routines on data verification and harmonisation. These routines are laid down in the PESI Common Data Model store (PESI CDM-store), an instance of the

The PESI data warehouse not only hosts the integrated Taxonomic Backbone for Europe, but also allows unambiguous cross-links to, and compatibility with, other biodiversity information services, such as persistent identifiers, standardised vocabularies and exchange formats. Therefore this component is crucial to secure the stability of the European Taxonomic Backbone and to link PESI with global e-gateways.
