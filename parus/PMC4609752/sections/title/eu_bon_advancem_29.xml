 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because taxonomic information provides the primary identification of an object and is a prerequisite to make other biodiversity data discoverable and available, the evaluation of the state and trends of biodiversity is only possible with help of an elaborated taxonomy. Accordingly the 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.eubon.eu/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">EU BON</span> project, by developing a webportal for enabling an integrated access to European biodiversity data (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">EU BON supports advances on the PESI work program, focussing on improving the pan-European terrestrial (

For this purpose the gaps in taxonomic data and knowledge will be further analysed with help of the connected expert networks, for instance as part of the Fauna Europaea data papers preparations. More fundamentally, technical solutions will be needed to advance the experts' data management tools (or 'virtual workbenches') with improved annotation functions, allowing easy review and uptake of discrepancies that might be found to occur between the pan-European checklists and other resources (like regional checklists, observation/monitor data or newly published names). This feature will increase the quality of the pan-European checklists data, speedingup the harvesting of all 'names in use' and close the 'delay gap' between the publication of new names and the actual integration into the pan-European checklists. Presumably, implementing such advanced taxonomic workbenches and publishing tools will also motivate experts to become more engaged in working on taxonomic databases and on editing, updating and annotating existing datasets.
