 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PESI contributes to the development of a next generation linked open-data names architecture, expanding the inter-platform operability and making the workflow orchestration and task automation more efficient between associated name services (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1613529" href="#F1613529">20</a>). In the short term, this can result in: (i) the implementation of a common nomenclatural reference system (
  <a rid="B1605059" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1605059">Pyle and Michel 2008</a>), supporting the disambiguation of taxonomic information and advancing the common access to important resources, like taxonomic literature, and in (ii) the set up of an open taxonomic indexing system, supporting a communal book-keeping of taxon names, increasing the integration and resolution of taxonomic information (
  <a rid="B1623808" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1623808">Patterson et al. 2010</a>). PESI could profit from such achievements to re-organise some of its internal workflows, such as the management of data from distributed taxonomic resources (e.g., regional checklists), by increasing the portal functions, stretching out to additional external resources and information types, and by optimising the uptake of new taxa names (provided by publishers) as an integrated routine of the data editing process.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the longer term a next generation names architecture is developing feedback mechanisms to automate the cross-annotation of different workflows using taxonomic information. This further virtualisation provides a number of advantages. Firstly, because most biological information (observations and knowledge) is linked to names, this will significantly increase the shared use and discovery of biological information. Secondly, because every virtual interaction provides a virtual documentation, this will enable the generation and accumulation of new 'information facts', finally resulting in a novel data ecosystem, also called 'big data' science.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, virtualisation and automation aren't self-evident processes. They need a careful monitoring of the existing information environment and an exact knowledge on the amount of virtualisation and automation required, together with a defined strategy on the relevant infrastructural changes to be made. PESI is considering these steps, provisionally called 
  <span class="italic">Global Names Architecture</span> (GNA), in close collaboration with important international contributors in this domain, like

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Taxonomic decisions are based on consideration of data in an interpretive framework. The selection of what data are used, how it is weighted, and the philosophical framework for interpretation, all are individual choices made by the taxonomist. The choice is based on a taxonomist's skills, past experience, data availability, educational background, and the structure of diversity in the organisms under study. Thus, many taxonomists have a natural scepticism towards 'big data' attempts, as they see this a limiting their ability to make taxonomic judgements. However, in the case of a 
  <span class="italic">Global Names Architecture</span> (GNA), taxonomy would benefit greatly from an infrastructure handling nomenclature (name description), science (postulating species concepts) and taxonomic practice (all names in use) as discrete systems (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1642909" href="#F1642909">21</a>). Indeed, such a synthesis is the main hope for creating a more unified, testable taxonomic framework. EU-nomen will provide continuing support on establishing GNA, especially on developing a 
  <span class="italic">Global Names Usage Bank</span> (GNUB), securing the further 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ipni.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">International Plant Names Index</span> (IPNI), 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.indexfungorum.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Index Fungorum</span> (IF), 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.algaebase.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">AlgaeBase</span>, and 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://zoobank.org" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">ZooBank</span> implementations.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As an example, 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://zoobank.org" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">ZooBank</span> is the official online nomenclatural registry for zoology, under the auspices of the 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iczn.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">International Commission for Zoological Nomenclature</span> (ICZN). It is a registration system for new and legacy scientific names for animals, which comprise by far the greatest number of described taxa of any organismal group. PESI and ZooBank have had a closely paralleled, collaborative development (see also 'Results') and it is envisioned that they will become tightly linked in future perspectives.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After beginning in 2008 as a stand-alone system, like many other current nomenclatural and taxonomic sources, it was seen that ZooBank’s effectiveness would be exponentially increased if it were developed as a service within the 
  <span class="italic">Global Names Architecture</span> (GNA), operating on top of the 
  <span class="italic">Global Names Usage Bank</span> (GNUB, 
  <a rid="B1642899" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1642899">Pyle and Michel 2009</a>). The new GNUB-based ZooBank was publicly launched on September 4, 2012 (coinciding with the amendment to the ICZN Code supporting electronic publication). It has been highly successful, increasing its growth ten-fold, with a current rate of 5000 entries/month. It is the most visible representation of the GNUB system.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ZooBank is the forerunner model for GNUB-based registration systems that can be developed in other nomenclatural domains. In addition there are many other services that GNUB can facilitate, leveraging the power of a robust code-based nomenclatural ‘skeleton’ and a usage-based ‘body’. Some of the GNUB services are indicated in the ZooBank interface shown in Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1642608" href="#F1642608">22</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GNUB/GNA provides a single shared platform for all cross-links, such that anytime a record is indexed in GNA, it is automatically cross-linked to all other data systems that are indexed in GNA. Unlike most existing biodiversity data initiatives, the components of GNA (particularly GNUB) are not intended to provide novel information; rather, GNUB is an index of core facts that are shared across all of biology. Nothing in GNUB is original or novel content; it merely represents a structured way of organizing information to facilitate broader data integration among other databases that do contain original information. Thus, the GNUB index does not compete with other data resources; but rather serves as a core infrastructure for cross-linking (and thereby empowering) other biological data sources.</p>
