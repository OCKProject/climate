 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PESI is participating in innovative biodiversity-informatics projects, developing and staging the ongoing virtualisation of the biodiversity research domain, building virtual tools and workbenches, including the collective use of data from multiple sources, and the automation of workflows of various tasks and processes.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The pan-European checklists have been applying automation for around 15 years since the initial versions of their data management systems. This has included implementing advanced virtual workbenches, including largely automated data-entry and data cleaning routines, which has eliminated a lot of manual processing. PESI continued this practice by installing automated routines for, among others, assembling the PESI Data Warehouse and for supporting the validation of checklists by means of the automated mapping tools (see Results).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More efficiency in workflow automation is obtained when restrictions of distributed architectures are further reduced, enhancing cross-platform operationability. This requires a broad set of infrastructural adaptations, including the harmonisation and standardisation of APIs, data exchange formats and ontologies. As part of the 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://vbrant.eu/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">ViBRANT</span> project, PESI contributed to the development of a common publishing platform for taxonomists, driving the (virtual) integration of some major biodiversity information delivery platforms (see: Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1613552" href="#F1613552">15</a>). As a consequence, the reciprocal uptake of metadata standards and controlled vocabularies has been enhanced, as well as the use of other platform-specific services on running certain tasks, like e-Publishing and taxonomic key generation.
