 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Already from the earliest stage, because of the extended geographic scope of the pan-European checklists, experts and institutes of European neighbourhood countries (including Russia) have been involved in the checklist work programs. Consequently, enhancing the range and collaboration towards a full Palearctic coverage follows the footprints of earlier projects, like

Such an extension seems inevitable, considering the practical necessity of assessing biodiversity as a borderless science and taking into account the European Union economic and political arguments, aiming a further exploitation of the potentials on cooperation in science, technology and innovation with outer-EU partners (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For two centuries, the Natural History Institutes in Eastern European and Central Asian countries have accumulated an extensive knowledge and huge collections on the flora and fauna of this wide region. The integration and implementation of this information into existing global or European biodiversity databasing initiatives is, however, inadequate because of a suboptimal use of shared virtual and social infrastructures. The proposed "Flora/Fauna/Mycota Palearctica" project will solve this impediment by intensifying the existing collaboration with 
  <span class="italic">EU-nomen</span> partners, by extending the partnership towards Northern Africa and Central Asian countries, and by effecting a common work program, integrating available taxonomic resources into a uniform system and the associated experts into a corresponding network. The accumulated information, freely accessible for the world community, will significantly advance the global and regional capacity on (future) biodiversity assessments.
