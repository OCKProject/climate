 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Special cases of automated workflows are Virtual Research Environments (VREs), which will provide the next generation of shared research environments. Virtual labs provide an interactive environment in which researchers can access, collect, integrate and explore large amounts of data from multiple resources for analysis, data mining, and visualisation, supported by automated workflows and standardised web services.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PESI is involved in e-Science projects developing virtual labs for scientists (as part of BioVeL) and fishery agencies (as part of 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.i-marine.eu/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">iMarine</span>), guiding the accurate application of taxonomy and connecting the related web services, to accelerate the access, integration and application of taxonomic names as critical meta-data (
  <a rid="B1623348" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1623348">GÃ¼ntsch et al. 2014</a>, 
  <a rid="B1640469" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1640469">Vanden Berghe et al. 2015</a>). Virtual labs components are proposed to advance biodiversity web portal functions, allowing users a more direct and interactive environment for examining biodiversity data. This could include the extension of the species information, showing additional species features or occurence predictions obtained by executing customised analytical pipelines, which could be performed 'live' or in pre-analysis.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An example of how virtual labs could increase the analytical value of biodiversity portals is given in Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1623403" href="#F1623403">16</a>, showing the potential distributional capacity of

    <div content-type="species" class="named-content">sculpturalis</div>

  </span>, an invasive species in Piemonte (Italy), now also captured in Liguria (
  <a rid="B1623363" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1623363">Quaranta et al. 2014</a>). The species distribution predictions can be obtained very rapidly by operating the BioVel virtual labs. The results firstly shows that in general, compared to the source areas in the US and Japan, the circumstances are suboptimal for

    <div content-type="genus" class="named-content">Megachile</div>
    <div content-type="species" class="named-content">sculpturalis</div>
   </div>
  </span> in Europe (which would show as deep red areas). Secondly it seems that the preferred habitat for 
  <span class="italic">
   <div content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">
    <div content-type="genus" class="named-content">Megachile</div>
    <div content-type="species" class="named-content">sculpturalis</div>
   </div>
  </span> in Europe is becoming smaller due to climate change over the next decennia. At least in Piemonte the species will probably disappear. Such insights, easily obtained from applying VREs, could be very important for all sorts of biodiversity managers and environmental controllers.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other instances of interactive environments can be found in advanced biodiversity data portals. As part of the Focal Points workplans, PESI stimulates the sharing of best practices on portal development, especially regarding taxonomic checklist governance, data exchange and sophisticated web tools. As an example, the Romanian PESI Focal Point receives dedicated support from the 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mybiosis.info" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">myBiOSis portal</span>. The myBiOSis system allows an integrated view of a flexible selection of frequently-used web applications within a single user interface (template), thus easily accommodating the requirements of various projects and usertypes. Although the original myBiOSis modules are developed for recording species occurrences and phenotypic features (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1633125" href="#F1633125">17</a>), a next step forward is the development of research toolkits (as Virtual Labs) that could take advantage of the accumulative body of biodiversity data, integrating local applications, as well as remotely distributed automated workflows, and supercomputing facilities. A prototype of such an interactive research environment, examining the cumulative impact of anthropogenic stressors on the ecosystems, including both environmental data as well as biotic interactions, is scheduled as part of a recently started 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">UBA</span> project (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1633131" href="#F1633131">18</a>) (
  <a rid="B1635961" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1635961">Eilers and Raabe 2015</a>). Since cumulative impact assessments deal with present and near future scenarios, there is a good potential, not only in opening new research paths, but also in helping decision-makers to take effective measures in protection and conservation.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similarly the 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.azoresbioportal.angra.uac.pt/index.php?lang=pt" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Azores Bioportal</span> (ABP) provides a regional e-infrastructure for the Azores Islands (
  <a rid="B1637121" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1637121">Borges et al. 2010</a>). ABP was the first Biodiversity Portal in Portugal, starting in 2008, offering easy access to island biodiversity data and inspiring the creation of a national equivalent e-infrastructure named 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uc.pt/en/iii/infrastructures/porbiota" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">PORBIOTA </span>that will be funded between 2015-2020 (also in association with LifeWatch Europe). The ABP is a key e-infrastructure for the integrated management of biodiversity data of the Azores, delivering a large number of specialised services and tools supporting research, policy, education and nature conservation. International collaboration is well supported. As an example, data collated by the ABP project are relevant in contributing to the

  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ipbes.net/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">IPBES</span> platform and the Azorean and Madeira islands taxonomic checklists are validated against the pan-European checklists.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A marine virtual research environment (VRE) has been created as the first operating component of the 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lifewatch.eu/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">LifeWatch Research Infrastructure</span> (ESFRI). It has been organised through a bottom-up approach from the participating states. The main services designed are: (1) VRE entry page &amp; VRE components (virtual laboratories); (2) VRE calculation tools and biotic indices; (3) VRE derived products as base layers; (4) Biosensor data collaborative platform; (5) Taxonomic Backbone &amp; species traits; 6) VRE training event &amp; marine LW follow up meetings. The components that are strictly related to PESI are (2) and (5). The later is based on the taxonomic backbone developed in the course of 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.marinespecies.org" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">WoRMS</span> (World Register of Marine Species) and PESI, while the former on PESI and ViBRANT projects. Another innovative virtual laboratory under development is the one on the 3D representations of micro-CT scanning's of macro-organisms. This laboratory will offer a suit of galleries of interactive 3D representations allowing the user to have access to both morphological and anatomical representations. In its current version the Marine LW VRE is offered through a single portal:
