 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Indexing biodiversity is a global challenge. PESI contributes to worldwide efforts on preparing global catalogues (like CoL) and supports relevant name services (like GBIF-ECAT) on increasing the resolving power for integrating biodiversity data.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More particularly, PESI has extended the pan-European checklists geographic scope by involving Focal Points from outer European Union territories, with the ultimate intention of covering the whole Palearctic (see 'Outlooks' section). The Palearctic is the largest biogeographic area of the world, containing a very rich and unique flora and fauna within a vastly diverse environment of unique habitats, especially in biogeographic transition and refuge zones regions, like the Caucasus. Integrating the available taxonomic expertise, data and resources into shared research infrastructures is crucial for globalising biodiversity assessments.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PESI partners from Eastern European countries, up to Russia and the Caucasus, are actively involved in carrying out aspects of the PESI work plan. To progress the participation of Caucasus partners a proposal was drafted to the European Commission

Unfortunately this proposal was not funded in this round.
