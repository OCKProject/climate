  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.eu-nomen.eu/portal/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">PESI Portal</span>, a service webportal developed during the project phase of PESI (May 2008 to May 2011). Surrounding this core, PESI includes the interactions with the geographic focal point networks, a network of taxonomic experts and global species databases.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PESI merges data from multiple sources and publishes it online. This requires a mapping between the different schemas used by the different data sources and/or an implementation of standards within those data sources. A pragmatic approach was taken for the main databases. A bespoke procedure was developed at the 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bgbm.org/en/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Botanic Garden and Botanical Museum Berlin-Dahlem</span> (BGBM) using the

These data are merged with ERMS and additional data provided by these checklists (such as distribution details) in the PESI Data Warehouse. This procedure is repeated periodically to keep the data warehouse synchronised with the source databases. The 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.vliz.be/en/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Flanders Marine Institute</span> (VLIZ), that manages the portal, adds further information (such as images, vernacular names and priority status) and gathers information from other portals, such as the 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.marinespecies.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">World Register of Marine Species</span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order for the data sets to be merged in this way they need to share common vocabularies for some fields – these include: taxon status, nomenclatural status and occurrence status. PESI provides species lists based on geographic regions and European legislation (e.g. the Habitat Directive, Birds Directive, CITES and IUCN (conservation status) directives). The resulting dataset includes a total of nearly 450,000 scientific names (which include 240,000 valid species and infraspecific names) and 190,800 vernacular names in 117 languages. In the 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.eu-nomen.eu/portal/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">PESI portal</span>, each species has its own result page including a map of its geographical distribution, and many have deep links to additional data (photos, videos, literature, global prioritised species databases). The portal further includes: a Taxon Search Tool, a Taxon Match Tool (for users to match their species names against the names in PESI to check spelling, synonymy and classificaiton), a metadata database on taxonomic resources and expertise (provided by focal point partners all over Europe and adjacent countries), Web Services and links to existing nomenclators.

These initiatives built up expert networks to fulfil the project objectives and played an important role in helping to identify and consolidate the European taxonomic expert community. Other sources of taxonomic expertise are also included, such as the community of the EDIT Network of Excellence (EU FP6). PESI has reviewed and developed long-term strategies and plans for the sustainability of the contributing communities systems in terms of ownership and support of individual experts and institutions.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PESI makes a significant addition to the species registers through the expansion of the network of expertise towards Eastern Europe. In addition to providing more comprehensive data for the pan-European species registers, this expansion has overcome the separation of knowledge and taxonomic practice over decades. Another achievement is the closer collaboration of the taxonomic societies, especially with respect to improving taxonomic coverage and addressing long-term maintenance and upgrading of the taxonomy.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Coordination and integration of European focal point networks</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to creating a network of taxonomic experts, PESI has developed a network of regional (often national) focal points. These focal points (either individuals or organisations) complement the taxonomic network through: (1) liaising with national governmental bodies on the implementation of European standards relevant to, for instance, national and European regulations and environmental monitoring, (2) collecting and transferring local expertise and applied tools, (3) lobbying and public policy assistance at national and European level, and (4) supporting closer collaboration of scientific contributor and user communities across Europe. Focal points contribute country-specific information about species, relevant databases, local literature, experts, professional societies and major users such as government organisations.</p>

 <sec sec-type="Coordination of taxonomic meta-data standard assessment" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Coordination of taxonomic meta-data standard assessment</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In biology, taxon names provide anchors that allow information about organisms to be linked. A taxonomic name, typically a species name, is attached to every primary data object (field observation, specimen, genetic data, etc.). Therefore names, together with their organisation into taxonomic classifications, are understood as core (meta-)data for biological information systems. There are many challenges in integrating data sources that contain taxonomic names and classifications, particularly where the sources extend over different biological kingdoms or national boundaries. Names may be erroneously assigned or incomplete and so searches based on exact character matching against names in current use may fail. Names that are synonyms or old combinations no longer in current use may occur in museum and herbarium specimen catalogues or in legislative lists. Names with orthographical errors occur in legislative lists on national or international level and some of them are often in use by certain taxonomists. There may also be disagreement amongst experts on the identity of specimens and on the taxonomic constituents of genera and the arrangement of classifications. The partners involved in PESI have extensive experience with handling such problems and PESI has produced practical solutions for many of these issues. The availability of authoritative taxonomic metadata standards is of particular relevance where species are directly linked to societal issues such as conservation and environmental control. PESI promotes harmonisation and certification of taxonomic metadata standards of prioritised taxa that are listed in various EU regulations and legislative lists. To address these issues, PESI had the following objectives:</p>
  <div list-type="bullet" class="list" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>To prepare a roadmap (conceptual development and strategic plan) for the application of taxonomic standards within Europe, with the purpose of overcoming the instability and inconsistency of taxon names (and concepts) and attached data. This work addressed technical, linguistic, educational and legal barriers to progress in defining and implementing appropriate standards.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>To promote co-operation between PESI and other networks and organisations. This optimised the cross-linking of European biodiversity resources using approved taxonomic data standards, and improved data quality and consistency. This facilitated discovery and exchange of biodiversity data, both within Europe, and between Europe and globally.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>To work closely with relevant standards organisations to identify appropriate authoritative standards and schemes and to ensure their adoption within the European biodiversity community. Work included development of a management classification scheme, utilisation of globally unique identifiers for names (GUIDs) and support for nomenclators (such as

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Coordination and integration of information e-infrastructures</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PESI has technically integrated the pan-European species registers into an e-infrastructure by creating a joint access (middle) layer, the PESI data warehouse. This includes an index of species names associated with a number of attributes, such as synonyms, their place in the management classification and their geographical distribution. This data content results from the integration of the earlier pan-European checklists into a unified directory, following advanced routines on data verification and harmonisation. These routines are laid down in the PESI Common Data Model store (PESI CDM-store), an instance of the 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cybertaxonomy.eu/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">EDIT Platform for Cybertaxonomy</span>. The PESI data warehouse not only hosts the integrated Taxonomic Backbone for Europe, but also allows unambiguous cross-links to, and compatibility with, other biodiversity information services, such as persistent identifiers, standardised vocabularies and exchange formats. Therefore this component is crucial to secure the stability of the European Taxonomic Backbone and to link PESI with global e-gateways.
