 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The terrestrial and freshwater Focal Point Networks in PESI originate from focal point partners within

  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.emplantbase.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Euro+Med PlantBase</span>. This integrated Focal Point network proceeded from groundwork carried out in the pan-European checklist programmes (like Fauna Europaea NAS) and was further explored in the FP6 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.e-taxonomy.eu/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">EDIT</span> Network of Excellence (Suppl. material 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1604994" href="#S1604994">8</a>) as a vehicle to annotate taxonomic data more generally. The marine focal points originate from marine networks constructed during FP6 Networks of Excellence (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.marbef.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">MarBEF</span>/
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.marbef.org/data/erms.php" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">ERMS</span>) and other marine projects. PESI comprises a total of 34 contracted Focal Point partners and 24 associated, non-contracted, Focal Points being members of the consortium from 47 countries (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1604995" href="#F1604995">5</a>). In addition to the expert networks (organised around a taxonomic group), the Focal Point networks in PESI provide a complementary organisation of taxonomic expertise according to their geographical, national and regional focus (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1605055" href="#F1605055">6</a>). A Focal Point Working Group committee was created in the initial project year to define the Focal Point working programme, set up the tasks, assist the Focal Points in networking processes and in preparing the activities/deliverables. The committee also prepared a plan for sharing and distribution of the reserved seed money budget among the Focal Points to ensure their ability to perform the activities described in the work programme (Suppl. material 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1604988" href="#S1604988">9</a>) further detailed in a Focal Points Handbook (Suppl. material

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the botanical community, the PESI Focal Point network built on the existing infrastructure of a regional advisory network for 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.emplantbase.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Euro+Med Plantbase</span>. The former Euro+Med PlantBase editorial centres, each of them responsible for the coordination of a share of vascular plant families, became the PESI Botanical Focal Points: Berlin (Euro+Med PlantBase secretariat), Bratislava, Palermo and Sevilla, plus Helsinki as a non-contracting partner. The Berlin Botanical Focal Point established and maintained the connection with the regional advisory network, consisting of 85 floristic and taxonomic botanical experts, mostly based at botanical institutions all over Europe, Northern Africa, the Levant and the Caucasian countries. The regional advisers are responsible for 64 major areas (countries) and 48 minor subdivisions (mostly individual islands). Euro+Med PlantBase now has 190 vascular plant families online, corresponding to 95% of the European Flora of Vascular Plants. The Helsinki FP took care of linking grid-map data from the 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.luomus.fi/en/atlas-florae-europaeae-afe-distribution-vascular-plants-europe" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Atlas Flora Europaeae</span> with the map services of the PESI web Portal.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A selection of the 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.faunaeur.org/focal_point.php" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Fauna Europaea Focal Points</span> agreed to become PESI Focal Point partners, others became associate, non-contracted Focal Points. The network of Marine National Focal Points aims at the continuous communication, information exchange and harmonisation of taxonomic data and practices followed by the systematists involved. Only through this process it was possible for the European taxonomic experts on marine taxa to join forces and avoid further fragmentation after the end of the Networks of Excellence, within the 6th European Framework Programme.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over three years the entire process resulted in two major achievements: a) it created the largest network of taxonomists in Europe through the National Focal Points, and b) produced a massive amount of information on all kinds of existing nomenclators, museum catalogues, existing taxonomic expertise, societies and systematists assemblages, taxonomic information publishing gates, etc., which are now available through the single multilingual portal of PESI, which can, in turn, be used by any member of the National Focal Point network. However, the overall achievement is that the defragmentation of the European taxonomic community was encountered and that the process paved the way for this community towards a cohesive and challenging framework in the future. The next successful steps are already visible through a number of projects and initiatives (e.g. LifeWatch, EU BON, and COST action applications).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At this moment the public 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.eu-nomen.eu/portal/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">PESI Portal</span> includes a large number of taxonomic-related data provided by the Focal Points. These data comprise contact and expertise details of nearly 2,000 experts and more than 500 organizations (from professional institutions to amateur societies) in Europe, in addition to the European Taxonomic Workforce (ETW) and EDIT Expert Database (see above, Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1613486" href="#F1613486">3</a>). It also contains almost 2,000 scientific publications in 700 journals and more than 100 URLs of websites with information on local fauna and flora. In addition there are 190,800 vernacular names of species and higher taxa in 117 languages. To keep the Focal Point Networks active, a Focal Point sustainability plan was drawn (Suppl. material 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1604869" href="#S1604869">7</a>) from a questionnaire that was completed and returned by 23 Focal Point partners. Regarding future coordination and management ambitions for grouped Focal Point networks, we derived a draft plan based on their answers (Suppl. material 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1892394" href="#S1892394">37</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PESI has a significant outreach to eastern European countries and beyond, connecting local knowledge networks to pan-European expertise and supporting the implementation of relevant e-Infrastructures for information management. For example, the Ukraine PESI Focal Point was selected as
