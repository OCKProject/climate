 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PESI is well situated within the EC infrastructural and policy development. This is partly due to the fact that many end-users, stakeholders and EC directives (like 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">INSPIRE</span>) adopted PESI as a European standard. Therefore major European biodiversity programs, like 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lifewatch.eu/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">LifeWatch</span> and

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For establishing standards and sharing resources, PESI makes use of a huge network of taxonomic specialists in all European countries. Together with principal partners (like 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cetaf.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">CETAF</span>), PESI contributes to the objective on establishing an integrated taxonomic (working) community for Europe, operating as one virtual workforce representing a shared knowledge network.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, PESI is selected by diverse EC bodies (like 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geant.net/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">GÉANT</span>) to outreach European biodiversity e-Infrastructures for the Eastern Partnership countries, thus extending the current geographic scope of the pan-European checklists, finally covering the whole Palearctica ("Flora/Fauna Palearctica").
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PESI contributes to ongoing e-infrastructural developments, like

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Part of the PESI future progress lies in its potential to further engage and organise the taxonomic community participation as a vital, virtual workforce including (i) the instalment of proper expert network governance, (ii) the application of proper ownership licences, (iii) the use of appropriate mechanisms for acknowledging expert contributions, (iv) the ability to function as an efficient 'knowledge hub', supporting biodiversity research and decision making more generally, (v) the successful involvement of more open and dynamically organised social networks and communities, like non-professional taxonomists and citizen scientists.</p>

   <span class="italic">Network governance</span>
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considering the overall decline of taxonomy as a scientific discipline, the maintenance of a basic (taxonomic) expertise capacity will be essential to satisfy the knowledge needs for a wide range of biodiversity-related information services in the near future, including the pan-European checklists. In PESI we moved forward from the efforts of 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.e-taxonomy.eu/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">EDIT</span> on establishing a collaborative workforce, adding the integrated PESI expert networks into a single EDIT Expert Database and by defining more sophisticated social networking standards. To support the process of expert network integration, the SMEBD licensing model was applied. Further, the role of taxonomic institutes on the sustainable hosting of the taxonomic databases was studied (
   <a rid="B1607713" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1607713">Costello et al. 2014</a>) as well as the need for a federal facility, offering secretarial support on the expert network functioning.

   <span class="italic">Accreditation and data papers</span>
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An important vehicle for authoring metadata provenance, providing a clear recognition of all contributors and enabling the receipt of credits as a formal scientific publication by means of citation, are 'data papers'. Data papers also play an important role in the publication of small bits and pieces of information, like new distributions, which would otherwise be difficult to publish (termed 'micro-publication'). Data papers allow a more flexible/dynamic way of expert involvement within the process of data collation and reviewing, because contributions are more easily acknowledgeable than is currently the case. Finally, by using novel e-publishing tools, the process of manuscript drafting is highly automated, being more convenient for the editors, but also enabling a direct cross-indexing with other relevant metadata resources, supporting feedback mechanisms in foreseen name annotation workflows (see also 'next generation name infrastructure' subsection, below).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PESI already supports the publishing of data papers accompanying the WoRMS, Fauna Europaea and Euro+Med updating process (see 'Results'). More emphasis will be put on this work within the 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.eubon.eu/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">EU BON</span> project, to trigger expert participation, to automate the dissemination and back-linking (tagging) of taxon names (within data papers) to external resources (

   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biodiversityknowledge.eu/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">BiodiversityKnowledge</span> (KNEU) is proposed as a governance structure for this NoK. PESI is involved in the development and testing of the BiodiversityKnowledge prototype, improving the knowledge flow between biodiversity knowledge holders and users in Europe, a process recently concluded (Suppl. material 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1607333" href="#S1607333">28</a>) and waiting for further H2020 application. A challenging issue in a Network of Knowledge involvement would be the implementation of the applicable sociology, motivating the actual experts participation in cross-disciplinary inventories and assuring a proper scientific reward system.

   <span class="italic">Non-professional taxonomists and citizen scientists</span>
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Currently around 50% of the experts contributing to the updating of the pan-European checklists includes professional taxonomists. However, the contributions of non-professional taxonomists will significantly increase in the near future. PESI should effectively anticipate this development by implementing relevant social networking mechanisms, including mentoring, educational and accreditation systems, in close collaboration with taxonomic institutes and societies.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An associated exercise is the adequate integration of efforts of voluntary biodiversity recorders, who provide a major contribution to the continuing monitoring of Europe's biodiversity. During PESI an ESF networking proposal was submitted entitled “Citizens Monitoring Biodiversity (CMD)” to optimise the involvement of the volunteer biodiversity observation community into the European biodiversity programs (
   <a rid="B1613428" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1613428">Boumans and Jong 2009</a>). This ESF proposal was awarded, but constrained by the formal country convergence criteria and needs a follow-up.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Indexing biodiversity is a global challenge. PESI contributes to worldwide efforts on preparing global catalogues (like CoL) and supports relevant name services (like GBIF-ECAT) on increasing the resolving power for integrating biodiversity data.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More particularly, PESI has extended the pan-European checklists geographic scope by involving Focal Points from outer European Union territories, with the ultimate intention of covering the whole Palearctic (see 'Outlooks' section). The Palearctic is the largest biogeographic area of the world, containing a very rich and unique flora and fauna within a vastly diverse environment of unique habitats, especially in biogeographic transition and refuge zones regions, like the Caucasus. Integrating the available taxonomic expertise, data and resources into shared research infrastructures is crucial for globalising biodiversity assessments.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PESI partners from Eastern European countries, up to Russia and the Caucasus, are actively involved in carrying out aspects of the PESI work plan. To progress the participation of Caucasus partners a proposal was drafted to the European Commission

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PESI is participating in innovative biodiversity-informatics projects, developing and staging the ongoing virtualisation of the biodiversity research domain, building virtual tools and workbenches, including the collective use of data from multiple sources, and the automation of workflows of various tasks and processes.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The pan-European checklists have been applying automation for around 15 years since the initial versions of their data management systems. This has included implementing advanced virtual workbenches, including largely automated data-entry and data cleaning routines, which has eliminated a lot of manual processing. PESI continued this practice by installing automated routines for, among others, assembling the PESI Data Warehouse and for supporting the validation of checklists by means of the automated mapping tools (see Results).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More efficiency in workflow automation is obtained when restrictions of distributed architectures are further reduced, enhancing cross-platform operationability. This requires a broad set of infrastructural adaptations, including the harmonisation and standardisation of APIs, data exchange formats and ontologies. As part of the 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://vbrant.eu/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">ViBRANT</span> project, PESI contributed to the development of a common publishing platform for taxonomists, driving the (virtual) integration of some major biodiversity information delivery platforms (see: Fig. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1613552" href="#F1613552">15</a>). As a consequence, the reciprocal uptake of metadata standards and controlled vocabularies has been enhanced, as well as the use of other platform-specific services on running certain tasks, like e-Publishing and taxonomic key generation.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In its original stage, the PESI infrastructure implemented two gateways to European biodiversity based on the taxon-level information provided by the participating checklists:</p>
  <div list-type="bullet" class="list" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>a feature-rich web-portal offering convenient human-readable access</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>a webservice layer, which has a small and effective set of methods for retrieving XML-encoded information that can be further processed by machines on any platform using any programming language.</p>
   </div>
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both webportal and webservices are optimised for a usage scenario with requests on individual objects (e.g. a particular name or taxon, information related to a particular identifier, etc.). However, we believe that PESI services will play an increasingly important role in workflow-driven systems. In this context, PESI will, for example, be used to expand a taxon name query to include its synonyms when combining independent scientific services that use different taxonomies. For this purpose several measures should be taken, including: (i) the extension of existing service layers supporting the retrieval of massive amounts of data, (ii) the optimisation of services for performance and reliability to ensure their usefulness in a workflow environment, and (iii) the optimisation of the PESI data warehouse structure for efficient output-oriented queries.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With these extensions, new workflow-oriented scientific applications can be realised and add further value to the PESI infrastructure. Both the EC-FP7

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other instances of interactive environments can be found in advanced biodiversity data portals. As part of the Focal Points workplans, PESI stimulates the sharing of best practices on portal development, especially regarding taxonomic checklist governance, data exchange and sophisticated web tools. As an example, the Romanian PESI Focal Point receives dedicated support from the 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mybiosis.info" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">myBiOSis portal</span>. The myBiOSis system allows an integrated view of a flexible selection of frequently-used web applications within a single user interface (template), thus easily accommodating the requirements of various projects and usertypes. Although the original myBiOSis modules are developed for recording species occurrences and phenotypic features (Fig. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1633125" href="#F1633125">17</a>), a next step forward is the development of research toolkits (as Virtual Labs) that could take advantage of the accumulative body of biodiversity data, integrating local applications, as well as remotely distributed automated workflows, and supercomputing facilities. A prototype of such an interactive research environment, examining the cumulative impact of anthropogenic stressors on the ecosystems, including both environmental data as well as biotic interactions, is scheduled as part of a recently started 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">UBA</span> project (Fig.

   <a rid="B1635961" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1635961">Eilers and Raabe 2015</a>). Since cumulative impact assessments deal with present and near future scenarios, there is a good potential, not only in opening new research paths, but also in helping decision-makers to take effective measures in protection and conservation.

The ABP is a key e-infrastructure for the integrated management of biodiversity data of the Azores, delivering a large number of specialised services and tools supporting research, policy, education and nature conservation. International collaboration is well supported. As an example, data collated by the ABP project are relevant in contributing to the

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A marine virtual research environment (VRE) has been created as the first operating component of the 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lifewatch.eu/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">LifeWatch Research Infrastructure</span> (ESFRI). It has been organised through a bottom-up approach from the participating states. The main services designed are: (1) VRE entry page &amp; VRE components (virtual laboratories); (2) VRE calculation tools and biotic indices; (3) VRE derived products as base layers; (4) Biosensor data collaborative platform; (5) Taxonomic Backbone &amp; species traits; 6) VRE training event &amp; marine LW follow up meetings. The components that are strictly related to PESI are (2) and (5). The later is based on the taxonomic backbone developed in the course of

Another innovative virtual laboratory under development is the one on the 3D representations of micro-CT scanning's of macro-organisms. This laboratory will offer a suit of galleries of interactive 3D representations allowing the user to have access to both morphological and anatomical representations. In its current version the Marine LW VRE is offered through a single portal:
