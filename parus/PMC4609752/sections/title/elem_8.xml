PESI comprises a total of 34 contracted Focal Point partners and 24 associated, non-contracted, Focal Points being members of the consortium from 47 countries (Fig. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1604995" href="#F1604995">5</a>). In addition to the expert networks (organised around a taxonomic group), the Focal Point networks in PESI provide a complementary organisation of taxonomic expertise according to their geographical, national and regional focus (Fig. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1605055" href="#F1605055">6</a>). A Focal Point Working Group committee was created in the initial project year to define the Focal Point working programme, set up the tasks, assist the Focal Points in networking processes and in preparing the activities/deliverables. The committee also prepared a plan for sharing and distribution of the reserved seed money budget among the Focal Points to ensure their ability to perform the activities described in the work programme (Suppl. material 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1604988" href="#S1604988">9</a>) further detailed in a Focal Points Handbook (Suppl. material

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the botanical community, the PESI Focal Point network built on the existing infrastructure of a regional advisory network for 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.emplantbase.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Euro+Med Plantbase</span>. The former Euro+Med PlantBase editorial centres, each of them responsible for the coordination of a share of vascular plant families, became the PESI Botanical Focal Points: Berlin (Euro+Med PlantBase secretariat), Bratislava, Palermo and Sevilla, plus Helsinki as a non-contracting partner. The Berlin Botanical Focal Point established and maintained the connection with the regional advisory network, consisting of 85 floristic and taxonomic botanical experts, mostly based at botanical institutions all over Europe, Northern Africa, the Levant and the Caucasian countries. The regional advisers are responsible for 64 major areas (countries) and 48 minor subdivisions (mostly individual islands). Euro+Med PlantBase now has 190 vascular plant families online, corresponding to 95% of the European Flora of Vascular Plants. The Helsinki FP took care of linking grid-map data from the

The network of Marine National Focal Points aims at the continuous communication, information exchange and harmonisation of taxonomic data and practices followed by the systematists involved. Only through this process it was possible for the European taxonomic experts on marine taxa to join forces and avoid further fragmentation after the end of the Networks of Excellence, within the 6th European Framework Programme.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over three years the entire process resulted in two major achievements: a) it created the largest network of taxonomists in Europe through the National Focal Points, and b) produced a massive amount of information on all kinds of existing nomenclators, museum catalogues, existing taxonomic expertise, societies and systematists assemblages, taxonomic information publishing gates, etc., which are now available through the single multilingual portal of PESI, which can, in turn, be used by any member of the National Focal Point network. However, the overall achievement is that the defragmentation of the European taxonomic community was encountered and that the process paved the way for this community towards a cohesive and challenging framework in the future. The next successful steps are already visible through a number of projects and initiatives (e.g. LifeWatch, EU BON, and COST action applications).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At this moment the public 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.eu-nomen.eu/portal/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">PESI Portal</span> includes a large number of taxonomic-related data provided by the Focal Points. These data comprise contact and expertise details of nearly 2,000 experts and more than 500 organizations (from professional institutions to amateur societies) in Europe, in addition to the European Taxonomic Workforce (ETW) and EDIT Expert Database (see above, Fig. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1613486" href="#F1613486">3</a>). It also contains almost 2,000 scientific publications in 700 journals and more than 100 URLs of websites with information on local fauna and flora. In addition there are 190,800 vernacular names of species and higher taxa in 117 languages. To keep the Focal Point Networks active, a Focal Point sustainability plan was drawn (Suppl. material 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1604869" href="#S1604869">7</a>) from a questionnaire that was completed and returned by 23 Focal Point partners. Regarding future coordination and management ambitions for grouped Focal Point networks, we derived a draft plan based on their answers (Suppl. material

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PESI is about integration and presentation of data. To do this effectively a common framework is needed to support the establishment and promotion of controlled vocabularies and metadata standards that enable effective integration of data and best practices. PESI sets out to provide a taxonomic backbone for Europe, at the heart of which is an annotated synonymised checklist of species. The prime focus has been to identify appropriate standards to support this task. In addition to ensuring that data held within PESI are successfully integrated, it is important that our data are accessible and interoperable with other initiatives. We have therefore looked at protocols, data models, controlled vocabularies and ontologiesthat will facilitate this interoperability, working closely with external organisations involved with biodiversity informatics to assist in the process of developing standards and resources for data exchange and data validation.</p>

    <p>Import. The source checklists are parsed and transformed into the internal CDM data structure using the import layer of the EDIT platform.

Level 2 (structural integrity) checks the completeness and appropriateness of data belonging to individual objects. Level 3 (referential integrity) checks the correctness of relations between objects. The different quality levels and rules have been jointly developed on a common

   <span class="italic">The PESI GUID strategy</span>
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The publication of taxonomic data in web portals (for human consumption) is an important aspect of the PESI infrastructure. However, providing information in machine-readable form is becoming increasingly important, because this makes the information reusable in a wide range of potential applications (e.g. as part of the taxonomic backbone in species information systems). PESI addresses this aspect by including a SOAP-compliant web-service interface into its portal implementation. In addition, REST-full services have been implemented, providing light-weight interfaces to the PESI backbone, like

As prerequisite, the technical partners had to agree on a common approach for handling identifiers (Suppl. material 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1605798" href="#S1605798">21</a>). The agreed system consists of UUIDs implemented by the contributing checklists in parallel to their local identifier system. These UUIDs are propagated through the merging process and finally published using the 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?dtc/04-10-08" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">OMG LSID protocol</span>. Aside from its LSID, each taxon (also) has a persistent HTTP-URI identifier using the LSID as part of its syntax and redirecting to a web-representation of this taxon. With this architectural approach, PESI can adopt additional identifier-protocols in the future with comparably little effort by adding functionality at portal level.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The agreement on a common identifier system had to include clear rules as to when changes to an object imply issuing a new identifier. To ensure consistent application, these rules have to work at a machine level - the operations that turn an existing taxonomic object into a new one had to be defined. The PESI approach has been recognised by the “

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The PESI project recognises the need to link the conventional scientific publications to the species databases to provide users with a more comprehensive resource. To that end the project engaged with major publishers of scientific journals to understand how their online information systems were developing, and to explain how the species databases were evolving. A first workshop was held on 16th July 2009 in Amsterdam inviting key publishers, including PLoS, InterResearch, Allen Press, CRC Press (Taylor &amp; Francis), Oxford University Press, Scopus, Science Direct, Elsevier, ISI Web of Science of Thomson Reuters, OvidSP (Biological Abstracts), Wiley, ProQuest (part of Cambridge), and JSTOR (Suppl. material 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1604863" href="#S1604863">5</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The process of contacting publishers revealed that most publishers were very limited in the functionality they had on their websites, and constrained by the limitations of the commercially provided software they used to provide added functionality. A first step in that regard has been the initiation of a special 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ploscollections.org/article/browse/issue/info:doi/10.1371/issue.pcol.v02.i20" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">PLoS ONE Collection</span> of scientific papers arising from the 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.marinespecies.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">World Register of Marine Species</span> (WoRMS). WoRMS is a superset of the European Register of Marine Species, which is one of the three primary European species databases that form the core of the PESI project. At present, more than 19 papers have been published (
   <a rid="B1640657" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1640657">Costello et al. 2013b</a>). Each paper should be directly linked to the WoRMS database so readers will get openaccess to the primary data and information.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A similar approach was followed later on by Fauna Europaea in collaboration with 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pensoft.net/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Pensoft</span>, supported by the FP-7

   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biodiversitydatajournal.com/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Biological Data Journal</span> (BDJ), with 10 data papers published so far. Euro+Med from the beginning took a distinctive approach towards updating the database. For instance, all occurrence records for a species in Euro+Med must have been published in a peer-reviewed paper. To accommodate miscellaneous new data, a series of "Euro+Med Notulae" was initiated in 2005 (

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another conclusion of this publishers workshop was that an important, practical, option to link to a wider range of journals would be the use of RSS feeds, because this would provide no or little action on the side of the journal. Such a system would need the feeds to be aware of what species (or higher taxonomic) names to search and match to the published papers. The 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gbif.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Global Biodiversity Information Facility</span> (GBIF) communicated their advances on developing a relevant tool. The usefulness of such a tool should be tested. For example, if species or taxonomic names are not apparent in the titles, abstracts and keywords of journal articles, they may be overlooked. Alternatively, papers of very peripheral relevance may be fed to the species database and overwhelm the editors and readers. In the latter case additional filters could be placed to constrain the RSS feed. The PESI partners intend to explore these options further on when the GBIF tool becomes available, a collaboration highlighted at the

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The highest priority journals for species databases to be linked are those describing new species, and rationalising species nomenclatures (e.g. identifying synonyms or reclassifying species). One of the leading taxonomic journals in this field is 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Zootaxa</span>, which publishes almost five times more new species than the next ranked journals (

The PESI project started a regular dialogue with this journal, which led to the invitation of the Zootaxa Chief Editor (Dr Zhi-Qiang Zhang), to a follow-up 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.e-taxonomy.net/node/805" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">EDIT third publishers workshop</span> in Copenhagen on 7-8 October 2010 (Suppl. material 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1604993" href="#S1604993">27</a>), jointly organised by EDIT and PESI. EDIT had proposed a new 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.europeanjournaloftaxonomy.eu/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">European Journal of Taxonomy</span> (EJT) that would integrate existing small journals in Europe, and thus have the resources to modernise their publication processes. This is now established (
   <a rid="B1640686" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1640686">Bénichou L et al. 2012</a>). However, only a few journals appeared willing to lose their identity by joining EJT. Zootaxa's Chief Editor proposed a complementary approach to journal ‘integration’. In this ‘aggregation’ approach, a common portal would be established using open-source Open Journal Systems software. This would manage editorial processes (i.e., paper submission, assignment of referees, editorial decisions), and publication (e.g., when online, when open access) and archiving. Importantly, each paper, past and future, would be indexed by species names and classification, and geographic area studied, so as to directly link papers with species in the PESI databases. This portal would be called 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biotaxa.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Biotaxa</span> and is now operational and serving 30 journals, including those that describe 30% of all new species each year. We envisage that moving the editorial process of taxonomic publishing online by providing a permanent low-cost portal for publication and by archiving an intimately linked with the expert-edited species databases will revolutionise the taxonomic publications process (see also 'Outlooks' section).
