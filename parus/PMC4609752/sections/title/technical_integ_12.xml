 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">International infrastructures for the production, maintenance, and publication of taxonomic checklists are highly heterogeneous with regard to scope, information models, workflows, and implementation. The PESI project recognised from the beginning that an effort for integrating European checklist information into a single unified system would need an “information broker” responsible for merging disparate and potentially conflicting information, performing data quality measures, and streamlining the process of data publication from the individual checklist to the common European information portal and service layer.</p>

The Platform is based on the 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cybertaxonomy.eu/blog/cdm" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">EDIT Common Data Model</span> (CDM), which is an agreed and comprehensive object-oriented information model covering the taxonomic workflow from fieldwork to data publication in electronic form and on paper (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1605461" href="#F1605461">7</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model can be deployed using almost any Database Management System (DBMS). Application programmers can develop all kinds of systems (e.g. portals, editor software, import and export functions) using well defined APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) exposed as a Java Library (

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For its deployment as the central merging facility in PESI, the BGBM-team extended the platform and its library (Suppl. material 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1605795" href="#S1605795">19</a>) with methods for:
 </p>
 <div list-type="bullet" class="list" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>importing data from the existing pan-European checklists,</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>merging them into a single taxonomy across organism groups,</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>quality control at different levels,</p>

   <p>creation of detailed reports for feedback to the checklist managers,</p>

  <div class="list-item">
   <p>mapping of the vocabularies used by the individual checklists to the agreed PESI vocabularies (e.g. status values, geographic regions),</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>export of the consolidated checklist into the PESI data warehouse.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With these methods, a data publication cycle in PESI is performed in three basic phases (Fig.

  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Import. The source checklists are parsed and transformed into the internal CDM data structure using the import layer of the EDIT platform. This step also involves data quality control at three levels. Level 1 (syntax of terms) checks the syntactical correctness of individual terms. Level 2 (structural integrity) checks the completeness and appropriateness of data belonging to individual objects. Level 3 (referential integrity) checks the correctness of relations between objects. The different quality levels and rules have been jointly developed on a common

   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Merging. The individual taxonomic trees are merged into a single taxonomy, which is later used for data publication. This merging involves a final data quality assessment (level 4) for the detection of overlaps and conflicts between the different checklists. Again, a transcript is produced and fed back to the checklists managers responsible for resolving the conflicts or defining priority rules.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Export. All data are exported into a Data Warehouse Structure optimized for data publication purposes. From the FTPserver hosted at the BGBM the data are harvested for publication at VLIZ.</p>

  <span class="italic">The PESI GUID strategy</span>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The publication of taxonomic data in web portals (for human consumption) is an important aspect of the PESI infrastructure. However, providing information in machine-readable form is becoming increasingly important, because this makes the information reusable in a wide range of potential applications (e.g. as part of the taxonomic backbone in species information systems). PESI addresses this aspect by including a SOAP-compliant web-service interface into its portal implementation. In addition, REST-full services have been implemented, providing light-weight interfaces to the PESI backbone, like 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biodiversitycatalogue.org/services/79" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">EU BON taxonomic backbone UTIS</span>. As prerequisite, the technical partners had to agree on a common approach for handling identifiers (Suppl. material 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1605798" href="#S1605798">21</a>). The agreed system consists of UUIDs implemented by the contributing checklists in parallel to their local identifier system. These UUIDs are propagated through the merging process and finally published using the 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?dtc/04-10-08" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">OMG LSID protocol</span>. Aside from its LSID, each taxon (also) has a persistent HTTP-URI identifier using the LSID as part of its syntax and redirecting to a web-representation of this taxon. With this architectural approach, PESI can adopt additional identifier-protocols in the future with comparably little effort by adding functionality at portal level.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The agreement on a common identifier system had to include clear rules as to when changes to an object imply issuing a new identifier. To ensure consistent application, these rules have to work at a machine level - the operations that turn an existing taxonomic object into a new one had to be defined. The PESI approach has been recognised by the “

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The EDIT Platform for Cybertaxonomy is continuously improved by an international team of developers, coordinated by the Biodiversity Informatics Research Group of the BGBM. It is the basis for an increasing number of checklists on different scales as well as geographic and taxonomic scopes. In addition, several new EU e-infrastructure projects have the EDIT-Platform integrated as an important technological component:</p>
