 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Despite the traditional role of scholarly publications to serve as the primary vehicle for disseminating and reusing peer-reviewed scientific findings, it was recognised in PESI that scholarly publishing cannot persist anymore as just a method of communicating final results, because of the obstacle it is for efficient data sharing, reproducibility and reuse (see section e-Publications). Rather, scholarly publishing should become a part of the scientific process itself (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">EU-nomen will contribute to the further integration of scholarly publishing services as an integral and interlinked part of the whole data gathering, data mobilisation and research process, synchronised with data sources, data aggregators, attribution and annotation services, and ontology frameworks. Technically this integration of the publishing and research processes will partly be achieved through a commonly developed and shared API library, based on community-agreed data exchange formats.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On expert engagement, a special role in the process will be played by the "data paper" concept as an important instrument of data mobilisation, publication and community involvement (

Next-generation data papers will be generated and submitted from metadata registries of data repositories to scholarly journals "at the click of a button", via APIs. Currently the only workflow of this kind is piloted by the
