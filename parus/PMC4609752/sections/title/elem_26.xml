 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Environments are changing rapidly all over the planet, making it imperative that we have our systems for communicating biological information working efficiently and reliably. Data based on proper identification of taxa are essential to monitor changes in nature; information needs to be integrated on the dynamics on species existence (migration, extinction, intrusion) and on instability of the associated ecosystems. Ongoing, critical environmental assessments are important to document and control critical disorders, like the decline of (native) pollinator species, the impact of algal blooms, the effect of overexploitation and the invasion of pest species. Taxonomy is a foundational science, but its reliable application is hindered by the limited knowledge of many aspects of biodiversity and the relative disorganisation and inaccessibility of taxonomic information. PESI contributes to the synthesis and access to existing taxonomic knowledge by maintaining a network of outstanding experts and by taking care about the delivery of persistent standards and data integration routines, securing a high-level access to biodiversity data.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The biodiversity community, in anticipation of the European Commission H2020 call for larger, more integrated networks, is: (i) pushing biodiversity research as an innovative information science (
  <a rid="B1630995" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1630995">Hardisty 2013</a>), by profiling biodiversity informatics as a joint movement (e.g.

  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gbif.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">GBIF </span>and 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.eubon.eu/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">EU BON</span>. PESI is on this roadmap (e.g., as "
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://h2020.myspecies.info/content/pesi-plus-pesi-inspire-lifewatch-eu-bon" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">PESI Plus</span>"), stressing the need for a sustainable, long-term initiative, taking care of the delivery of sustained taxonomic indexes and reference files, both globally and for Europe (
  <a rid="B1607288" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1607288">Hussey et al. 2008</a>). In addition, PESI supports the development and implementation of key informatics advancements, making scattered biodiversity data more readily available and useful, and transforming the current knowledge and understanding of biodiversity to a next level. The subsections below highlight some outlooks on trends and practices addressing the relevance and involvment of 'EU-nomen' components.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <span class="italic">Annotation workflows</span>
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PESI contributes to the development of a next generation linked open-data names architecture, expanding the inter-platform operability and making the workflow orchestration and task automation more efficient between associated name services (Fig. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1613529" href="#F1613529">20</a>). In the short term, this can result in: (i) the implementation of a common nomenclatural reference system (
   <a rid="B1605059" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1605059">Pyle and Michel 2008</a>), supporting the disambiguation of taxonomic information and advancing the common access to important resources, like taxonomic literature, and in (ii) the set up of an open taxonomic indexing system, supporting a communal book-keeping of taxon names, increasing the integration and resolution of taxonomic information (
   <a rid="B1623808" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1623808">Patterson et al. 2010</a>). PESI could profit from such achievements to re-organise some of its internal workflows, such as the management of data from distributed taxonomic resources (e.g., regional checklists), by increasing the portal functions, stretching out to additional external resources and information types, and by optimising the uptake of new taxa names (provided by publishers) as an integrated routine of the data editing process.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the longer term a next generation names architecture is developing feedback mechanisms to automate the cross-annotation of different workflows using taxonomic information. This further virtualisation provides a number of advantages. Firstly, because most biological information (observations and knowledge) is linked to names, this will significantly increase the shared use and discovery of biological information. Secondly, because every virtual interaction provides a virtual documentation, this will enable the generation and accumulation of new 'information facts', finally resulting in a novel data ecosystem, also called 'big data' science.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, virtualisation and automation aren't self-evident processes. They need a careful monitoring of the existing information environment and an exact knowledge on the amount of virtualisation and automation required, together with a defined strategy on the relevant infrastructural changes to be made. PESI is considering these steps, provisionally called 
   <span class="italic">Global Names Architecture</span> (GNA), in close collaboration with important international contributors in this domain, like 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gbif.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">GBIF</span>, 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.catalogueoflife.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">CoL</span> and

   <span class="italic">Global Names Achitecture &amp; Global Names Usage Bank</span>
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Taxonomic decisions are based on consideration of data in an interpretive framework. The selection of what data are used, how it is weighted, and the philosophical framework for interpretation, all are individual choices made by the taxonomist. The choice is based on a taxonomist's skills, past experience, data availability, educational background, and the structure of diversity in the organisms under study. Thus, many taxonomists have a natural scepticism towards 'big data' attempts, as they see this a limiting their ability to make taxonomic judgements. However, in the case of a 
   <span class="italic">Global Names Architecture</span> (GNA), taxonomy would benefit greatly from an infrastructure handling nomenclature (name description), science (postulating species concepts) and taxonomic practice (all names in use) as discrete systems (Fig. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1642909" href="#F1642909">21</a>). Indeed, such a synthesis is the main hope for creating a more unified, testable taxonomic framework. EU-nomen will provide continuing support on establishing GNA, especially on developing a 
   <span class="italic">Global Names Usage Bank</span> (GNUB), securing the further 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ipni.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">International Plant Names Index</span> (IPNI), 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.indexfungorum.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Index Fungorum</span> (IF), 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.algaebase.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">AlgaeBase</span>, and 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://zoobank.org" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">ZooBank</span> implementations.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As an example, 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://zoobank.org" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">ZooBank</span> is the official online nomenclatural registry for zoology, under the auspices of the 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iczn.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">International Commission for Zoological Nomenclature</span> (ICZN). It is a registration system for new and legacy scientific names for animals, which comprise by far the greatest number of described taxa of any organismal group. PESI and ZooBank have had a closely paralleled, collaborative development (see also 'Results') and it is envisioned that they will become tightly linked in future perspectives.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After beginning in 2008 as a stand-alone system, like many other current nomenclatural and taxonomic sources, it was seen that ZooBank’s effectiveness would be exponentially increased if it were developed as a service within the 
   <span class="italic">Global Names Architecture</span> (GNA), operating on top of the 
   <span class="italic">Global Names Usage Bank</span> (GNUB, 
   <a rid="B1642899" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1642899">Pyle and Michel 2009</a>). The new GNUB-based ZooBank was publicly launched on September 4, 2012 (coinciding with the amendment to the ICZN Code supporting electronic publication). It has been highly successful, increasing its growth ten-fold, with a current rate of 5000 entries/month. It is the most visible representation of the GNUB system.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ZooBank is the forerunner model for GNUB-based registration systems that can be developed in other nomenclatural domains. In addition there are many other services that GNUB can facilitate, leveraging the power of a robust code-based nomenclatural ‘skeleton’ and a usage-based ‘body’. Some of the GNUB services are indicated in the ZooBank interface shown in Fig. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1642608" href="#F1642608">22</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GNUB/GNA provides a single shared platform for all cross-links, such that anytime a record is indexed in GNA, it is automatically cross-linked to all other data systems that are indexed in GNA. Unlike most existing biodiversity data initiatives, the components of GNA (particularly GNUB) are not intended to provide novel information; rather, GNUB is an index of core facts that are shared across all of biology. Nothing in GNUB is original or novel content; it merely represents a structured way of organizing information to facilitate broader data integration among other databases that do contain original information. Thus, the GNUB index does not compete with other data resources; but rather serves as a core infrastructure for cross-linking (and thereby empowering) other biological data sources.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">e-Publishing perspectives</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Despite the traditional role of scholarly publications to serve as the primary vehicle for disseminating and reusing peer-reviewed scientific findings, it was recognised in PESI that scholarly publishing cannot persist anymore as just a method of communicating final results, because of the obstacle it is for efficient data sharing, reproducibility and reuse (see section e-Publications). Rather, scholarly publishing should become a part of the scientific process itself (
   <a rid="B1640845" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1640845">Costello 2009</a>, 
   <a rid="B1633348" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1633348">Costello et al. 2013</a>,

   <a rid="B1633338" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1633338">Piwowar and Vision 2013</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">EU-nomen will contribute to the further integration of scholarly publishing services as an integral and interlinked part of the whole data gathering, data mobilisation and research process, synchronised with data sources, data aggregators, attribution and annotation services, and ontology frameworks. Technically this integration of the publishing and research processes will partly be achieved through a commonly developed and shared API library, based on community-agreed data exchange formats.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On expert engagement, a special role in the process will be played by the "data paper" concept as an important instrument of data mobilisation, publication and community involvement (
   <a rid="B1633348" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1633348">Costello et al. 2013a</a>,
   <a rid="B1633377" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1633377">Chavan and Penev 2011</a>). Next-generation data papers will be generated and submitted from metadata registries of data repositories to scholarly journals "at the click of a button", via APIs. Currently the only workflow of this kind is piloted by the 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biodiversitydatajournal.com/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Biodiversity Data Journal</span> (BDJ), which has the option to submit complex manuscripts in XML through the

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">EU BON advancements</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because taxonomic information provides the primary identification of an object and is a prerequisite to make other biodiversity data discoverable and available, the evaluation of the state and trends of biodiversity is only possible with help of an elaborated taxonomy. Accordingly the 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.eubon.eu/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">EU BON</span> project, by developing a webportal for enabling an integrated access to European biodiversity data (
   <a rid="B1637397" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1637397">Hoffmann et al. 2014</a>), recognise the importance of proper taxonomic metadata standards to evaluate common issues in biological research and conservation, for instance to generate Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBV) (
   <a rid="B1637942" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1637942">Pereira et al. 2013</a>), also supporting the improvement of policy reporting (

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">EU BON supports advances on the PESI work program, focussing on improving the pan-European terrestrial (

For this purpose the gaps in taxonomic data and knowledge will be further analysed with help of the connected expert networks, for instance as part of the Fauna Europaea data papers preparations. More fundamentally, technical solutions will be needed to advance the experts' data management tools (or 'virtual workbenches') with improved annotation functions, allowing easy review and uptake of discrepancies that might be found to occur between the pan-European checklists and other resources (like regional checklists, observation/monitor data or newly published names). This feature will increase the quality of the pan-European checklists data, speedingup the harvesting of all 'names in use' and close the 'delay gap' between the publication of new names and the actual integration into the pan-European checklists. Presumably, implementing such advanced taxonomic workbenches and publishing tools will also motivate experts to become more engaged in working on taxonomic databases and on editing, updating and annotating existing datasets.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Already from the earliest stage, because of the extended geographic scope of the pan-European checklists, experts and institutes of European neighbourhood countries (including Russia) have been involved in the checklist work programs. Consequently, enhancing the range and collaboration towards a full Palearctic coverage follows the footprints of earlier projects, like

Such an extension seems inevitable, considering the practical necessity of assessing biodiversity as a borderless science and taking into account the European Union economic and political arguments, aiming a further exploitation of the potentials on cooperation in science, technology and innovation with outer-EU partners (
   <a rid="B1637685" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1637685">Sonnenburg et al. 2012</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For two centuries, the Natural History Institutes in Eastern European and Central Asian countries have accumulated an extensive knowledge and huge collections on the flora and fauna of this wide region. The integration and implementation of this information into existing global or European biodiversity databasing initiatives is, however, inadequate because of a suboptimal use of shared virtual and social infrastructures. The proposed "Flora/Fauna/Mycota Palearctica" project will solve this impediment by intensifying the existing collaboration with 
   <span class="italic">EU-nomen</span> partners, by extending the partnership towards Northern Africa and Central Asian countries, and by effecting a common work program, integrating available taxonomic resources into a uniform system and the associated experts into a corresponding network. The accumulated information, freely accessible for the world community, will significantly advance the global and regional capacity on (future) biodiversity assessments.
