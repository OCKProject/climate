  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, the overall prevalence of avian haemosporidia was 21.1%, higher than previously reported in Japan (10.6–14.9%) (
   <a rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib27">Murata, 2002</a>,

   <a rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib52">Yoshimura et al., 2014</a>). However, it is difficult to directly compare this study with others, as several conditions such as detection method, target species, location and other factors were different. For example, 
   <a rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib31">Nagata (2006)</a> did not include 
   <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span> for analysis. Another study showed very high prevalence of 59.6%, assumedly due to the high bird and mosquito density in Minami Daitō Island of Okinawa prefecture (
   <a rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib29">Murata et al., 2008b</a>). Also, it is well known that prevalence greatly differs among avian species because of the difference in immune responses, habitat and various other factors (
   <a rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib18">Imura et al., 2012</a>, 
   <a rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib38">Quillfeldt et al., 2011</a>, 
   <a rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib47">Valkiūnas, 2005</a>, 
   <a rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib52">Yoshimura et al., 2014</a>). Lastly, an important factor that needs to be discussed is the fact that these samples are from injured and rescued wild birds. These birds were rescued for various reasons (e.g. window collision, immobility and injury) and tend to have symptoms such as concussion, bone fracture and anemia. Body condition factors and immune reactions were not tested in this study, but in previous studies, there are reports that birds in poor body conditions are more likely to be infected by parasites compared to healthy birds, although there is variation between species (
   <a rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib7">Dawson and Bortolotti, 2000</a>, 
   <a rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib24">Meixell et al., 2016</a>, 
   <a rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib12">Fleskes et al., 2017</a>). It is however difficult to distinguish whether the individual is more likely to get infected when body conditions are poor, or vice versa. Also, some individuals stay in the facilities for long terms, depending on the type and degree of injury or condition. This means that those individuals have a higher chance of getting infected within the facility. Because of the general lack of data on the genetic diversity of avian malaria in Japan, it is difficult to separate individuals that were infected before and after being rescued. It is therefore important to achieve samples as soon as possible after the birds are rescued.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analysis of migratory status</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, the prevalence among migratory birds (i.e. wintering visitors, migratory breeders, passage visitors) was higher compared to resident breeders, being 31.6% and 17.0% respectively. Notably, in both 
   <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span>, the prevalence of avian haemosporidia was significantly higher in wintering visitors, birds that breed north of the Kanto region and migrate to the Kanto region in the winter (
   <a rid="tbl2" ref-type="table" href="#tbl2">Table 2</a>). The haemosporidia prevalence of birds in the Russian Far East is very high (63.9%), where a high proportion of wintering visitors from the Kanto region migrate for breeding. This high prevalence is thought to be due to the high density of vectors in the Russian Far East (
   <a rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib37">Palinauskas et al., 2005</a>). Bloodsucking activities of vectors in the Tundra and northern areas are more rigorous compared to lower latitudes (
   <a rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib41">Rubtsov, 1990</a>). For these reasons, there is a high chance that wintering visitors were infected in their breeding grounds, where they have a high contact with the vectors due to high vector densities. However, the high prevalence is Russian Far East is seen across all 3 genera of haemosporidia (
   <a rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib37">Palinauskas et al., 2005</a>), which is incoherent with the fact that there was no significant difference in migratory and resident prevalence for 
   <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When Eurasian coot (
   <span class="italic">Fulica atra</span>) and Anseriformes were removed from analysis, there was no significant difference among migratory status in 
   <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> sp. and 
   <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span> sp., respectively. Furthermore, when both were removed from data set for analysis, there was no significant difference in the overall prevalence. These might show that the significantly high prevalence in wintering visitors was due to a bias caused by these species. There are few reports of the prevalence in Eurasian coot, but the 
   <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span> prevalence in Anseriformes is known to be high (
   <a rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib39">Ramey et al., 2015</a>,

   <a rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib12">Fleskes et al., 2017</a>). Reasons are not sufficiently discussed, but probable reasons are due to differences in immune response, habitat environment, host specificity and occurring vector species (
   <a rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib47">Valkiūnas, 2005</a>, 
   <a rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib38">Quillfeldt et al., 2011</a>,

   <a rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib52">Yoshimura et al., 2014</a>). The prevalence in Ural owls (
   <span class="italic">Strix uralensis</span>) was particularly high compared to other species, presumably due to similar reasons as mentioned above. While certain patterns in migratory statuses may be seen and possibilities such as vector abundance and fauna exposure cannot be ruled out, general surveys such as this study need to be aware and careful of biases that may come from host specific factors.

   <a rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib8">Ejiri et al., 2011a</a>). 
   <span class="italic">Culiseta</span> spp. are found in the holarctic (
   <a rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib23">Medvedev, 2009</a>), but in Japan, the only known species (
   <span class="italic">C. kanayamensis</span> and 
   <span class="italic">C. nipponica</span>) are found solely in Aomori and Hokkaido prefectures (
   <a rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib34">Ono, 1969</a>, 
   <a rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib9">Ejiri et al., 2011b</a>, 
   <a rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib21">Maekawa et al., 2016</a>), the northern-most parts of Japan. Although there have been no reports of avian malaria from 
   <span class="italic">Culiseta</span> spp. in Japan, Stellar's sea eagle (
   <span class="italic">Haliaeetus pelagicus</span>) and other bird DNA were detected from this mosquito genus (
   <a rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib9">Ejiri et al., 2011b</a>). Also, in a previous study, SW5 was reported in Red-crowned crane (
   <span class="italic">Grus japonensis</span>) (
   <a rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib52">Yoshimura et al., 2014</a>), a resident breeder that is found only in Hokkaido, Japan. Thus, the lineages SW2 and SW5 might be transmitted in Northern Japan of further north. Interestingly, a new lineage FULATR01 found from Eurasian coot (
   <span class="italic">Fulica atra</span>) in this study was very close to SW2 (difference of only one base). If such difference is small enough to maintain the same lifecycle including vector species, this lineage may also only be transferred in the far north. Most individuals of Eurasian coot, which both FULATR01 and SW5 were detected, are wintering visitors in the Kanto region and breed in Northern Japan. However, there is a small population that breeds in the Kanto region (
   <a rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib14">Hashimoto and Sugawa, 2013</a>). In the Kanto region, avian blood has been detected from infected mosquitoes, meaning that the host-vector-parasite lifecycle is preserved in this area (
   <a rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib10">Ejiri et al., 2009</a>, 
   <a rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib20">Kim et al., 2009</a>). We were not able to distinguish whether the individuals in this study were migratory or resident individuals, but due to the possible vector specificity of these lineages, there is a high possibility that the individuals in this study are migratory and were infected in areas further north. However, there is a possibility that there are vector species other than 
   <span class="italic">Culiseta</span> spp. that are capable of transmitting these discussed species of 
   <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span>. Further research is needed to justify this hypothesis. Of the high percentage of SW5 found in this study, the majority (5 of 8 individuals) were from Eurasian coot. Some lineages are known to have low host specificity and yet still have a high prevalence in a certain species (
   <a rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib15">Hellgren et al., 2009</a>), which may be the case for this lineage.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4 lineages (PADOM02, SGS1, UPUPA02 and YWT4) were found from resident breeders and have previously been reported from host species of other countries. SGS1 has been detected from vectors across many countries including 3 mosquito species (
   <span class="italic">Culex sasai</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Lutzia vorax</span>) in Japan and is known to have a wide vector, host and geographical range (
   <a rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib46">Tsuda, 2017</a>). The vector species of the other 3 lineages have not been found in Japan, but also have a high chance that they may be wide-ranged lineages. The lineage CXPIP10 from Yellow bittern (
   <span class="italic">Ixobrychus sinensis</span>) was detected from an avian host for the first time. This lineage has been previously detected in 
   <span class="italic">Culex</span> spp. of Spain and Japan (
   <a rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib46">Tsuda, 2017</a>). Because of insufficient host information, the range of this lineage is unknown, but there is a high possibility that it is transmitted between vector and host in Japan.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2 lineages (CXPIP09 and CXPIP12) were found from resident breeders and have been previously detected from mosquito species in Japan (
   <a rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib10">Ejiri et al., 2009</a>, 
   <a rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib9">Ejiri et al., 2011b</a>, 
   <a rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib19">Kim and Tsuda, 2010</a>). Large-billed crow (
   <span class="italic">Corvus macrorhynchos</span>) and Eurasian tree sparrow (
   <span class="italic">Passer montanus</span>) were detected from the blood-meal of CXPIP09-infected mosquitoes (
   <a rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib19">Kim and Tsuda, 2010</a>) and this lineage made up over 21.4% of all the 
   <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> lineages found in this study. This highly suggests that this lineage is highly preserved among the avian hosts and mosquito vectors of Japan. These lineages have only been found in Japan, meaning that they are perhaps unique lineages of Japan. CXPIP09 was found from 1 Herring gull (
   <span class="italic">Larus argentatus</span>), a winter visitor species, which had been in the facility for 3 years. This strongly suggests that this individual was infected within the facility. Meanwhile, CXPIP12 had been detected in a previous study from Hawfinch (
   <span class="italic">Coccothraustes coccothraustes</span>), also a winter visitor. As the mosquito population density is known to decline in the Kanto area during the winter (
   <a rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib19">Kim and Tsuda, 2010</a>), the chances of this species to get infected in the Kanto area are low. Hawfinch are known to breed as south as Nagano prefecture, a neighboring prefecture right next to the Kanto region (
   <a rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib35">Ornithological Society of Japan, 2012</a>) and may have been infected in such areas. 1 new lineage NYCNYC02 was found in Black-crowned night-heron (
   <span class="italic">Nycticorax nycticorax</span>), which are mostly sedentary, but some individuals are known migrate to the Philippines (
   <a rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib50">Yamashina Institute for Ornithology, 2002</a>, 
   <a rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib35">Ornithological Society of Japan, 2012</a>). Though these lineages may be unique lineages of Japan, the range of vector species such as 
   <span class="italic">Culex pipiens</span> is very wide, including Russia (
   <a rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib23">Medvedev, 2009</a>) and there is a significant exchange of birds between Japan and the surrounding continents, meaning there is a possibility that these lineages may be found in other areas of the world.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">18 
   <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> lineages were found in this study (
   <a rid="tbl4" ref-type="table" href="#tbl4">Table 4</a>). 3 of these lineages were previously found in other countries, suggesting a wide distribution. Of these, TUCHR01 was found from Japanese thrush (
   <span class="italic">Turdus cardis</span>), being of the same genus as all the previous hosts. Although not as strict as 
   <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> is known to have host specificity to a certain degree. Moreover, this lineage, which belongs to the species 
   <span class="italic">H. minutus</span>, is known to have high specificity in thrush (

   <a rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib36">Palinauskas et al., 2013</a>). This study is hence supportive of this specificity.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For all the remaining lineages, except for 1 with a single previous detection within Japan, there is no vector or avian information regarding distribution or transmission. This is in part due to the fact that most of the lineages were detected for the first time. There are very few previously reported lineages of 
   <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> in Japan, although reasons are unknown. Also, while there are at least 82 known species of 
   <span class="italic">Culicoides</span> spp. in Japan (
   <a rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib51">Yanase et al., 2014</a>), there have been no studies regarding haemosporidian infection in 
   <span class="italic">Culicoides</span> spp. or any other biting midge genus. However, 11 of these lineages were detected from resident breeders, strongly suggesting that these lineages are transmitted within Japan. For the 4 lineages derived solely from migratory breeders, further sampling and studies on both the vector and host species are needed for any further speculations.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is interesting to note that there were no lineages found solely from wintering visitors, unlike 
   <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span>. In the other 2 genera, there were many lineages from wintering visitors, but tended to be of a specific host species or order. There is a possibility that such host specific lineages of 
   <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span> were simply not sampled in this study. Of the 4 wintering visitors infected with 
   <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span>, only 2 were identified to a specific lineage due to co-infection. The 2 lineages from wintering visitors were also found from resident breeders. There are three possibilities for these lineages. One is that they were infected in their breeding grounds. LARCRA01 has been previously detected in Spain from Caspian gull (
   <span class="italic">Larus cachinnans</span>), which suggests that this lineage has a wide distribution, as mentioned above. Another possibility is that they were infected within the facilities, also discussed earlier. The last possibility is that they were infected in Japan during the winter. Seasonal dynamics of 
   <span class="italic">Culicoides</span> spp. have been studied in other countries and generally, they agree that there are no active 
   <span class="italic">Culicoides</span> spp. from November to April (

   <a rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib43">Santiago-Alarcon et al., 2013</a>). However, another study found parous biting midges in February, suggesting that bloodsucking activities occur even during the winter (
   <a rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib22">Mayo et al., 2014</a>). Although the seasonality for 
   <span class="italic">Culicoides</span> spp. in Japan is unknown, there is a possibility that

   <a rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib47">Valkiūnas, 2005</a>). There have been no studies regarding the ecology and prevalence of haemosporidia in blackflies of Japan. Although the seasonal dynamics of blackflies, which are thought to be the vectors of 
   <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span>, in this area are poorly studied, bloodsucking activities are known to decline when temperatures decrease lower than 10 °C (
   <a rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib6">Crosskey, 1990</a>). The average temperature of the Kanto region from December to February in the years 1981–2010 was 7.6 °C, with the highest being 11.9 °C (Japan Meteorological Agency; 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.data.jma.go.jp" id="intref0020" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.data.jma.go.jp</span>) suggesting that blackflies cannot be active during the winter. However, other studies reveal the possibility of bloodsucking activities in the winter (

   <a rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib42">Saito et al. (1986)</a> collected over 1000 blackflies in Tokyo prefecture in five samplings days from November to February, although bloodsucking activities were not checked. 
   <a rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib41">Rubtsov (1989)</a> stated that although low temperature inhibits adult blackfly emergence and bloodsucking activities in northern areas, some blackflies in lower latitudes can be active for bloodsucking in late autumn to winter. It is therefore difficult to distinguish whether bloodsucking activities take place during the winter in the Kanto region. However, lineage TUSW04 has also been found in Mongolia from Bar-headed goose (
   <span class="italic">Anser indicus</span>) and continental subspecies of Great cormorant (
   <span class="italic">Phalacrocorax carbo</span>), which breed in continental East Asia and are accidental visitors in Japan (
   <a rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib4">Brazil, 2009</a>). Hence, it is more likely that these lineages were infected at their breeding grounds in Northern Japan or continental Asia. ANACU04 has been previously found from Northern pintail (
   <span class="italic">Anas acuta</span>) of North America, which are known to change their wintering grounds between Japan and North America depending on year (
   <a rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib50">Yamashina Institute for Ornithology, 2002</a>, 
   <a rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib32">Nicolai et al., 2005</a>). This supports the fact that the same lineage was found from Anatidae in Japan and North America, suggesting that Anatidae have an important role in the transmission of parasites between continents (
   <a rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib39">Ramey et al., 2015</a>). It is essential to note again the fact that some of the birds were rescued a year or more before sampling, giving the possibility that they were infected in the facilities, rather than in their breeding grounds.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1 lineage, CIAE02, was detected from a wintering visitor and migratory breeder. This lineage has been previously seen in other countries. It is difficult to distinguish the area and distribution of transmission, as there is no vector information. However, because there have been many reports from various countries and various hosts, it is possible that this species is transmitted across a wide range. Meanwhile, COCOR10 shows a similar pattern to the 
   <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> lineage CXPIP12, being previously found in Hawfinch. Although the distribution range for this lineage is unknown, it is safe to say that this lineage is transmitted in Japan, as it has been found in resident breeders.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the remaining 16 lineages from resident and migratory breeders, there is little information, as they were all detected for the first time. For the 11 lineages from resident breeders, there is a high possibility that they are transmitted within Japan. However, for the 5 of the lineages were found from migratory breeders, it is difficult to identify the location of transmission. Further studies on the possible vector species are needed in order to justify this. Although 
   <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span> is known to have strong host specificity, apparent lineages with high host specificity were not found due to the fact that the majority of the lineages were described for the first time or have few reports of previous hosts. However, TUSW04 seems to have high host specificity in Anseriformes.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we were able to determine the prevalence of haemosporidia of rescued wild birds in the Kanto area. Although rescued wild birds are not truly in their natural state, they are important samples to survey the prevalence of avian haemosporidia in wild birds of the Kanto region. Migratory birds have a chance of coming in contact with various different haemosporidia that are distributed in areas they migrate, hence making them important carriers for the distribution and dispersal of haemosporidia. Meanwhile, the appropriate vector differs among species of haemosporidia and the presence of the appropriate vector is a key factor for transmission. Influence on the changes in distribution due to climate changes are reported in both the avian hosts and arthropod vectors, therefore emphasizing the need to monitor their ecology in order to prevent infectious diseases.</p>
