 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, the overall prevalence of avian haemosporidia was 21.1%, higher than previously reported in Japan (10.6–14.9%) (

  <a rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib38">Quillfeldt et al., 2011</a>,

  <a rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib52">Yoshimura et al., 2014</a>). Lastly, an important factor that needs to be discussed is the fact that these samples are from injured and rescued wild birds. These birds were rescued for various reasons (e.g. window collision, immobility and injury) and tend to have symptoms such as concussion, bone fracture and anemia. Body condition factors and immune reactions were not tested in this study, but in previous studies, there are reports that birds in poor body conditions are more likely to be infected by parasites compared to healthy birds, although there is variation between species (
  <a rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib7">Dawson and Bortolotti, 2000</a>, 
  <a rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib24">Meixell et al., 2016</a>, 
  <a rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib12">Fleskes et al., 2017</a>). It is however difficult to distinguish whether the individual is more likely to get infected when body conditions are poor, or vice versa. Also, some individuals stay in the facilities for long terms, depending on the type and degree of injury or condition. This means that those individuals have a higher chance of getting infected within the facility. Because of the general lack of data on the genetic diversity of avian malaria in Japan, it is difficult to separate individuals that were infected before and after being rescued. It is therefore important to achieve samples as soon as possible after the birds are rescued.
