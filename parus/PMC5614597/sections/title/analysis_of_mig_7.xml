 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analysis of migratory status of collected birds</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each species of bird was classified into one of four migratory statuses in the Kanto region: wintering visitor, migrant breeder, passage visitor and resident breeder, based on the Check-list of Japanese birds, 7th revised edition (
  <a rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib35">Ornithological Society of Japan, 2012</a>). The two introduced species, Mute swan (
  <span class="italic">Cygnus olor</span>) and Northern bobwhite (
  <span class="italic">Colinus virginianus</span>), were classified as resident breeders. A small population of Eurasian coot (
  <span class="italic">Fulica atra</span>) breeds in the Tokyo area, but most are migratory and use this area as their wintering ground (
  <a rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib14">Hashimoto and Sugawa, 2013</a>). For that reason, the Eurasian coot was considered a winter visitor. We analyzed whether there was a significant difference between migratory statuses, using the chi-square test via Excel. However, because of the small sample size, passage visitors were not used in these tests.
