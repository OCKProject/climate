 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">DNA was extracted from blood and liver samples using the standard phenol-chloroform method. The extracted DNA was dissolved in TE solution for nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which targets the partial mitochondrial cytochrome

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After amplification, the PCR products were visualized using 1.5% agarose gels (Agarose S: Nippon Gene, Chiyoda, Japan) containing ethidium bromide (Nacalai tesque, Nakagyo, Japan). The gels were placed in a chamber containing TAE buffer and electrophoresis was done at 100V for about 20 min. The gels were then visualized under ultraviolet light. Positive samples were cut out of the gel and DNA was extracted using Thermostable β-Agarase (Nippon Gene, Chiyoda, Japan).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The extracted DNA was directly sequenced in both directions using a BigDye™ terminator cycle sequence kit (Ver 3.1 Applied Biosystems, Forster City, CA) and an ABI 3130-Avant Auto Sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Double-base callings in the electrophoregram were designated as mixed infections. Nucleotide sequences were aligned using Clustal W program and compared at 479 bp with sequences in the GenBank database using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (NCBI website,
