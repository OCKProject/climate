 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, the prevalence among migratory birds (i.e. wintering visitors, migratory breeders, passage visitors) was higher compared to resident breeders, being 31.6% and 17.0% respectively. Notably, in both 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span>, the prevalence of avian haemosporidia was significantly higher in wintering visitors, birds that breed north of the Kanto region and migrate to the Kanto region in the winter (
  <a rid="tbl2" ref-type="table" href="#tbl2">Table 2</a>). The haemosporidia prevalence of birds in the Russian Far East is very high (63.9%), where a high proportion of wintering visitors from the Kanto region migrate for breeding. This high prevalence is thought to be due to the high density of vectors in the Russian Far East (
  <a rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib37">Palinauskas et al., 2005</a>). Bloodsucking activities of vectors in the Tundra and northern areas are more rigorous compared to lower latitudes (
  <a rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib41">Rubtsov, 1990</a>). For these reasons, there is a high chance that wintering visitors were infected in their breeding grounds, where they have a high contact with the vectors due to high vector densities. However, the high prevalence is Russian Far East is seen across all 3 genera of haemosporidia (
  <a rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib37">Palinauskas et al., 2005</a>), which is incoherent with the fact that there was no significant difference in migratory and resident prevalence for 
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus</span>.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When Eurasian coot (
  <span class="italic">Fulica atra</span>) and Anseriformes were removed from analysis, there was no significant difference among migratory status in 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> sp. and 
  <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span> sp., respectively. Furthermore, when both were removed from data set for analysis, there was no significant difference in the overall prevalence. These might show that the significantly high prevalence in wintering visitors was due to a bias caused by these species. There are few reports of the prevalence in Eurasian coot, but the 
  <span class="italic">Leucocytozoon</span> prevalence in Anseriformes is known to be high (
  <a rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib39">Ramey et al., 2015</a>, 
  <a rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib40">Reeves et al., 2015</a>, 
  <a rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib24">Meixell et al., 2016</a>, 
  <a rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib12">Fleskes et al., 2017</a>). Reasons are not sufficiently discussed, but probable reasons are due to differences in immune response, habitat environment, host specificity and occurring vector species (
  <a rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib47">Valkiūnas, 2005</a>, 
  <a rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib38">Quillfeldt et al., 2011</a>, 
  <a rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib18">Imura et al., 2012</a>, 
  <a rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib52">Yoshimura et al., 2014</a>). The prevalence in Ural owls (
  <span class="italic">Strix uralensis</span>) was particularly high compared to other species, presumably due to similar reasons as mentioned above. While certain patterns in migratory statuses may be seen and possibilities such as vector abundance and fauna exposure cannot be ruled out, general surveys such as this study need to be aware and careful of biases that may come from host specific factors.
