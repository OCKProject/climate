  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B24" href="#B24">24</a>]. MEGA 5.0 (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B25" href="#B25">25</a>]) was used to conduct genetic analyses, to choose the most appropriate model of evolution, and to construct maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees. In addition, a Bayesian analysis was run in MR Bayes for 1 million generations with a burn-in of 250 000 generations, sampling one in every 100 trees [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B26" href="#B26">26</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B27" href="#B27">27</a>]. The general time reversible model with a discrete gamma distribution (GTR + G; G = 0.20) received the best Bayesian Information Criterion score and was applied to the ML Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. Node support was evaluated using 1,000 bootstrap replicates, with bootstrap values greater than 50% used for the final tree [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B28" href="#B28">28</a>]. Sample sequences emerging in the same branches as GenBank sequences were assumed to be the same species and in this study are collectively referred to as a 'clade’. Seven individual 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> spp. lineages were isolated altogether, with clades numbered from I-VII. Two dual infection types were also isolated and were represented with the numbers of each clade causing infection.
