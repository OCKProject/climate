 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The prevailing outcome of this analysis was that avian malaria prevalence and mosquito abundance did not display analogous co-variation. Instead, they varied in a contrasting fashion and were indirectly linked by season and rainfall. The presence of infected birds at a site typically indicates the presence of a vector species; however, at many infected sites (particularly in the West Coast district of the Western Cape) no mosquitoes were caught. The same result has been reported in previous malarial studies [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B54" href="#B54">54</a>], which also demonstrated temporal lag responses between mosquito prevalence, infection prevalence and rainfall. The best-supported explanation for observed prevalence patterns is a probable lag response between vector prevalence and rainfall. Another trend was that local environmental variation played a prominent role in avian malarial infection prevalence in the Western Cape. In general, however, the findings presented here support the argument that avian malaria prevalence patterns vary with both host and vector-related factors.
