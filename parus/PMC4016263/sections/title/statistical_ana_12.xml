  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B36" href="#B36">36</a>]. Samples were ordered by season collected (winter or summer). Readings from all sampling stations were collated to generate a mean value for each parameter measured per site for each season, and all parameters were used in analysis.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All variables were tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilkes test. Only salinity was non-normal. To reduce heteroscedasticity in models [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B37" href="#B37">37</a>], salinity data were log-transformed using a Box-Cox transformation [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B38" href="#B38">38</a>], dividing by the mean and adding a constant as per the following equation:

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because water quality tends to display spatial heterogeneity in accordance with varying altitude and geology in a landscape [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B39" href="#B39">39</a>], the longitudinal and latitudinal values of each wetland site were also included as explanatory parameters in multiple regression analysis.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some mosquito specimens were unidentifiable due to immaturity and key body parts missing, and were not included in analysis. Mosquito data were quantified in two ways: mosquito prevalence and vector abundance. Mosquito prevalence was calculated as the sum of mosquitoes caught per site divided by total number of mosquitoes caught overall. For sites where trapping was conducted over two nights, the mean number of mosquitoes caught was calculated to provide comparability with sites where mosquitoes were trapped over one night.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As data for vector species for avian malaria are still quite sparse for the Western Cape region, there remains the possibility that additional undocumented species act as vectors. We simply used the abundance of known vectors to gauge vector presence. Vector abundance was thus the number of known vectors caught per site.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A disproportionate number of mosquitoes were caught at one wetland site. Because trapped mosquito samples displayed a non-normal distribution, the inter-quartile range of the dataset was employed as an outlier identification method applicable to non-normally distributed data [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The number of mosquitoes caught at this wetland site qualified as an extreme outlier in the dataset. Consequently, mosquito abundance data were analysed with and without the inclusion of this site in the data, to compensate for potential distortion in regression analyses.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Simple and multivariate regression was used to explore the relationships between infection prevalence and mosquito/vector prevalence, water quality and vector prevalence, and water quality and infection prevalence. Pearson’s product–moment correlations (

Significant variation within and between water quality parameters, seasonal infection prevalence, and the number of mosquitoes caught was tested using Chi-squared test, Welch’s two tailed 
  <span class="italic">t</span>-test and ANOVA.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Multiple regression analyses were run using general linear models (GLMs) fitted with Poisson (canonical) links corresponding to the nature of the prevalence distribution. Model selection was conducted using Akaike’s Information Criterion value (AIC) as the indicator of the best-fit model. Model selection was conducted using values from Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) as an indicator of the best-fit model, with predictor variables retained or removed depending upon their effect upon model AIC value.</p>
