 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rainfall data were obtained from the FEWS (Famine Early Warning Systems) net portal [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B33" href="#B33">33</a>]. The site provides remote spatial data for various regions worldwide, including estimates of daily rainfall (RFE). RFE is calculated using a rainfall estimation algorithm that incorporates cloud top temperature and rainfall data from various stations acquired at six-hour intervals at a resolution of 0.25 degrees [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B34" href="#B34">34</a>]. RFE data were downloaded from the southern Africa region files available on the site.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The daily rainfall data were summed to give a monthly rainfall estimate (MRFE), as well as seasonal and annual rainfall estimates for each site. MRFEs, together with the number of days of rainfall per month, were calculated for up to six months prior to the sampling month (i.e. over the period of July 2009 to September 2011). This was done in accordance with the results of Mbogo 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span>[
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B35" href="#B35">35</a>], who showed that vegetation, mosquito abundance and infection prevalence display a lag response to rainfall patterns, and that rainfall (and days of rainfall) from preceding months can potentially influence disease infection prevalence.
