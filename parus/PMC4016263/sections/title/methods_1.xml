 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The influence of mosquito abundance and occurrence on the prevalence of 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> spp. in the Ploceidae family (weavers) was examined, taking into account factors with an indirect influence upon mosquito ecology. Mosquitoes and weaver blood samples were simultaneously collected in the Western Cape, South Africa over a two-year period, and patterns of vector abundance and infection prevalence were compared. Dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature and salinity measurements were taken at 20 permanent waterbodies. Rainfall during this period was also quantified using remotely sensed data from up to 6Â months prior to sampling months.
