 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Birds from the Ploceidae family (bishops, weaver birds, and allies - hereafter referred to as 'weaversâ€™) were the target group and were trapped using mist nets. Although weavers can be highly mobile, the species trapped were mostly residential [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B22" href="#B22">22</a>]. In keeping with their social nature, weavers tend to move 
  <span class="italic">en masse</span> and live in nests built close together, and situated over water surfaces [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B22" href="#B22">22</a>]. It is, therefore, quite likely that infected birds caught at a particular site were infected at the same sampling site.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Birds were sampled by pricking the brachial vein and collecting blood into a capillary tube [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B23" href="#B23">23</a>], which was then preserved in vials containing lysis buffer. The vial was sealed and the sample sent for molecular processing. All birds were ringed (to identify potential recaptures) and released after sampling.
