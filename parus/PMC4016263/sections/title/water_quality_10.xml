 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Water quality was measured at each wetland site using an HI 9828 Hanna handheld water meter (HANNA instruments). Water samples were taken from three stations situated at opposing points around the wetland and sampled consistently at the same points during all sessions. Measurements recorded were dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH and salinity. Measurements were made every two metres into the water body, starting at 1 m from the shoreline up to a distance of 20 m, or as far into the waterbody as depth would allow. Sampling was conducted once during summer and once during winter for each site.</p>
