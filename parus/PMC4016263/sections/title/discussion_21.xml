  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> infections were widespread across sampling sites, with only four sites having no infected birds. The majority of mosquitoes (66%) were caught at one wetland, Strandfontein (STR). Strandfontein was amongst the sites receiving the highest annual rainfall (503 mm), which was likely a primary contributing factor to the high mosquito catch. Strandfontein is also a sewage treatment plant, and it is possible that the high nutrient content of the water enhanced mosquito breeding success at this site [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B41" href="#B41">41</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B42" href="#B42">42</a>]. However, because no nutrient data were collected in this study, this suggestion remains open.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temperature and pH displayed the most marked variations between seasons (Table  
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T2" href="#T2">2</a>), which is consistent with previous findings [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B43" href="#B43">43</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B44" href="#B44">44</a>]. Temperature varied with vector abundance, which was also consistent with previous findings on associations between water quality and malaria vectors [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B10" href="#B10">10</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B15" href="#B15">15</a>]. These elements did not display any apparent influence on either mosquito or 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> prevalence (see Figures  
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">5</a>). Otherwise prevalence patterns were synchronized across seasons, with higher prevalences seen in summer than in winter (Figures  
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">2</a>, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">4</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">5</a>). Seasonal factors tend to have contrasting effects upon different vector species; seasonal variation in the prevalence of vector-borne diseases is well documented [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B45" href="#B45">45</a>], and our observed patterns are in accordance with findings from other studies of avian malaria [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B46" href="#B46">46</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B47" href="#B47">47</a>], as well as other vector-borne diseases [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B48" href="#B48">48</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sites with the heaviest infection prevalence were also the sites with the lowest mosquito catch. Three (out of five) sites with heavy infections were situated in the west coast district of the Western Cape; no mosquitoes were caught at these sites, despite an equal sampling effort across all sites (Figures  
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">6</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F7" href="#F7">7</a>). Because mosquitoes are dependent upon water for breeding it is expected that they would be more abundant in wetter areas. Mosquito catch size across sites did indeed vary with rainfall patterns (Figure  
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F7" href="#F7">7</a>), which is supportive and consistent with previous findings [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B49" href="#B49">49</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B50" href="#B50">50</a>]. The West Coast District is much drier than other sampled districts in the province [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B51" href="#B51">51</a>], receiving ≤ 200 mm of rainfall annually compared to sites within the Cape Town metropole (≥ 700 mm), and sites in the Boland and Overberg Districts (400 – 600 mm). The western coast of the Western Cape is one of the driest regions in South Africa, with climate modelling indicating that it will become still drier over the coming years [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B52" href="#B52">52</a>]. Observed seasonal patterns of infection and mosquito abundance are in contrast to patterns observed elsewhere in the country [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B53" href="#B53">53</a>], most likely because the Western Cape is a winter-rainfall region, unlike the rest of South Africa. Rainfall had both a direct and indirect impact upon infection prevalence (Figures  
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F8" href="#F8">8</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F9" href="#F9">9</a>), and also featured in models explaining variation in prevalence (Table  
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T4" href="#T4">4</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seasonal abundance was the only apparent pattern of analogous co-variation between mosquito and infection prevalence. Otherwise, the notable outcome was the contrasting relationship between mosquito and infection prevalence. The two factors displayed a negative correlation with each other, although the expectation was that they would co-vary positively. The negative co-variance of mosquito prevalence and infection prevalence is apparently concurrent with observations from previous malaria studies in Africa, which report lag responses in mosquito abundance and infection prevalence, both with each other and with rainfall [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B9" href="#B9">9</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B35" href="#B35">35</a>]. Similar studies in Africa also found that at several sampling sites with high infection prevalences (of 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium falciparum</span>), few to no mosquitoes were caught [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B35" href="#B35">35</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B54" href="#B54">54</a>]. Additionally, the entomologic inoculation rate was low in comparison to infection prevalence, and varied widely in small geographic regions of sampling.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Taken in context, the gathered data thus suggest that malarial infection prevalence is not dependent upon current mosquito abundance - leading to three parsimonious conclusions. The first is that the patterns of prevalence observed here are indicative of malarial and mosquito prevalence exhibiting a lag response throughout the year in response to the same driving factors. This potentially explains the contrasting relationship between the two prevalences, and the observed correlations with rainfall in the months prior to sampling. The second conclusion is that a low number of mosquitoes are still capable of infecting a wide range of hosts. The third conclusion is that birds were not infected at the wetlands at which they were caught. As the majority of sampled birds were territorial wetland passerines, and predominantly residential [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B22" href="#B22">22</a>], it was assumed that these birds were infected on site. However, there remains the possibility that species sampled were more mobile than current knowledge suggests – potentially leading to a scenario where birds were caught at one wetland but actually infected at another location. This possibility is further complicated by the fact that wild passerines can carry chronic lifelong infections of avian malaria, which can have various effects (depending on the host species) on host mobility and reproductive success [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B55" href="#B55">55</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B56" href="#B56">56</a>]. For example in this study, a significant variation in species infection prevalence with season occurred only in Southern Red Bishops, but not with other sampled weaver species (Figure  
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">2</a>). Incorporating movement data (of sampled bird species) into future analyses would serve to confirm the significance of host movement in observed avian malarial infections. Also of interest was that many wetland sites with a low mosquito catch had exposed banks with little to no vegetation within the set trapping areas. Water with high detrital loads (from erosion or a similar event) is not conducive to mosquito breeding, and these wetlands may have acted as a deterrent to mosquito breeding [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B57" href="#B57">57</a>]. Leisnham 
  <span class="italic">et al. </span>[
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B57" href="#B57">57</a>] similarly noted that the level and type of vegetation cover mattered in mosquito breeding success. Hence mosquito prevalence here was potentially further affected by variation in vegetation cover and type, or changing landscape features. A final factor for consideration is that several mosquito species caught in this study may have been vectors for avian malaria, but are not yet known as vectors; leading to a potential underestimation of vector abundance. The fairly recent reports of new vector species in Africa [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B31" href="#B31">31</a>] highlight how limited vector knowledge is pertaining to avian malaria. Consequently, our conclusions are restricted by the lack of current knowledge about known vectors for avian malaria, particularly in sub-saharan Africa.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Salinity was the only element of water quality that exhibited a direct correlation with 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> infection prevalence (Table  
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T3" href="#T3">3</a>). Infection also varied with latitude, whereas salinity and latitude were significantly and positively correlated (
  <span class="italic">r</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </span> = 0.39; 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.01). The trend in infection prevalence was apparent across sampling regions (Figure  
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">6</a>), suggesting that location is an influential factor in both wetland salinity and infection prevalence. The link between salinity and 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> may be an effect of 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> prevalence being higher in the summer, when waterbodies tend to be more saline as a result of increased evaporation [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B58" href="#B58">58</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B59" href="#B59">59</a>]. It was also expected that salinity would increase with proximity to the sea – instead the opposite trend was observed. The locational trend in salinity variance implies there is an additional underlying factor influencing water quality, such as the geology of the landscape within which the wetland occurs. For instance, several sites in the West Coast District occurred in areas typified by geology such as shales and batholiths, which occur around Malmesbury and Darling respectively [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B60" href="#B60">60</a>]. The chemistry of these volcanic rocks [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B60" href="#B60">60</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B61" href="#B61">61</a>], combined with the land use of the surrounding areas [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B17" href="#B17">17</a>], may subsequently influence water quality.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> prevalence was best described by a model incorporating locational and seasonal factors together with salinity, rainfall and mosquito prevalence (Table  
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T4" href="#T4">4</a>). With the exception of mosquito prevalence, these factors were all influential to infection prevalence. Mosquito prevalence exerted an indirect influence in the 
  <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> model, further suggesting that the relationship between infected birds and mosquito prevalence is non-linear, and supporting the argument that mosquito and infection prevalences vary temporally in a lag pattern with each other.
