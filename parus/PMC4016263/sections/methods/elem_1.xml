  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Research was conducted after approval from the Science Faculty Animal Ethics Committee, University of Cape Town and carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations given by the committee. Research did not involve the sampling of endangered or protected species. Access to field sites was granted by private landowners in the Western Cape and the City of Cape Town. Research permits granting access to protected areas were issued by SANParks (South African National Parks Board) and by Cape Nature (the Western Cape Nature Conservation Board).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sampling was conducted at 20 perennial wetlands of 1 – 10 hectares in size, in the Western Cape Province of South Africa [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B17" href="#B17">17</a>]. Wetlands were chosen as study sites, as they are resource-rich and act as key habitats for a large variety of birds [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B18" href="#B18">18</a>]. All sites were located between altitudes of 0 – 300 m above sea level. In the Western Cape, summer occurs in the months of January to March, and winter in the months of July to September. Unlike other parts of South Africa, the Cape region experiences winter rainfall. The Cape is currently devoid of human malaria, but has a history of avian malaria infection [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B19" href="#B19">19</a>-
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B21" href="#B21">21</a>]. Sites were visited once per year for two years (between 2010 and 2011). Samples were collected during each visit; visits were timed to ensure that each site was visited once during summer and once during winter, with samples collected during each visit.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sampling of birds</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Birds from the Ploceidae family (bishops, weaver birds, and allies - hereafter referred to as 'weavers’) were the target group and were trapped using mist nets. Although weavers can be highly mobile, the species trapped were mostly residential [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B22" href="#B22">22</a>]. In keeping with their social nature, weavers tend to move 
   <span class="italic">en masse</span> and live in nests built close together, and situated over water surfaces [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B22" href="#B22">22</a>]. It is, therefore, quite likely that infected birds caught at a particular site were infected at the same sampling site.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Birds were sampled by pricking the brachial vein and collecting blood into a capillary tube [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B23" href="#B23">23</a>], which was then preserved in vials containing lysis buffer. The vial was sealed and the sample sent for molecular processing. All birds were ringed (to identify potential recaptures) and released after sampling.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Molecular analysis</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Blood samples were analysed using PCR, as detailed by Cumming 
   <span class="italic">et al. </span>[
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B24" href="#B24">24</a>]. MEGA 5.0 (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B25" href="#B25">25</a>]) was used to conduct genetic analyses, to choose the most appropriate model of evolution, and to construct maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees. In addition, a Bayesian analysis was run in MR Bayes for 1 million generations with a burn-in of 250 000 generations, sampling one in every 100 trees [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B26" href="#B26">26</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B27" href="#B27">27</a>]. The general time reversible model with a discrete gamma distribution (GTR + G; G = 0.20) received the best Bayesian Information Criterion score and was applied to the ML Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. Node support was evaluated using 1,000 bootstrap replicates, with bootstrap values greater than 50% used for the final tree [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B28" href="#B28">28</a>]. Sample sequences emerging in the same branches as GenBank sequences were assumed to be the same species and in this study are collectively referred to as a 'clade’. Seven individual 
   <span class="italic">Plasmodium</span> spp. lineages were isolated altogether, with clades numbered from I-VII. Two dual infection types were also isolated and were represented with the numbers of each clade causing infection.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mosquito sampling</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mosquitoes were trapped using two CDC miniature light traps (model 512, John W. Hock company). The traps were placed at opposite ends of the wetland, or at least 200 m from each other, to avoid overlap in the areas being sampled. Traps were suspended approximately 1.5 metres above ground, from a tree or bush and placed at a distance not exceeding 20 m from the water’s edge. Traps were operated using a 6 volt lead-acid motor cycle battery, which would run a trap for two nights when fully charged. Traps were placed out from dusk until dawn in 12 hour trapping cycles, after which they were retrieved. Trapping sessions consisted of one to two nights per site, depending on the numbers of mosquitoes trapped and the success of the trap location. Mosquitoes in the trap were individually removed and placed into a 10 ml vial containing absolute ethanol.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the laboratory, vials were decanted into a petri dish with filter paper. Mosquitoes were separated from the other insects caught in the trap, and left to dry on a separate piece of dry filter paper. Dried mosquito specimens were individually examined and identified using a Nikon SMZ-10 stereomicroscope. Identification of mosquito specimens was facilitated by the use of a handbook detailing local South African species and their distributions [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B29" href="#B29">29</a>]. This handbook is specific only to the identification of female mosquitoes in the Culicinae and Toxorhynchitinae families. 
   <span class="italic">Anopheles</span> mosquitoes and male culicine specimens were sent for identification to the VCRU (Vector Control Reference Unit) at the NCID (National Institute for Communicable Diseases, Johannesburg, South Africa), together with specimens that could not be identified using the handbook. Mosquito species were noted as potential vectors in accordance with Russell and Mohan [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Water quality</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Water quality was measured at each wetland site using an HI 9828 Hanna handheld water meter (HANNA instruments). Water samples were taken from three stations situated at opposing points around the wetland and sampled consistently at the same points during all sessions. Measurements recorded were dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH and salinity. Measurements were made every two metres into the water body, starting at 1 m from the shoreline up to a distance of 20 m, or as far into the waterbody as depth would allow. Sampling was conducted once during summer and once during winter for each site.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rainfall</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rainfall data were obtained from the FEWS (Famine Early Warning Systems) net portal [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B33" href="#B33">33</a>]. The site provides remote spatial data for various regions worldwide, including estimates of daily rainfall (RFE). RFE is calculated using a rainfall estimation algorithm that incorporates cloud top temperature and rainfall data from various stations acquired at six-hour intervals at a resolution of 0.25 degrees [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B34" href="#B34">34</a>]. RFE data were downloaded from the southern Africa region files available on the site.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The daily rainfall data were summed to give a monthly rainfall estimate (MRFE), as well as seasonal and annual rainfall estimates for each site. MRFEs, together with the number of days of rainfall per month, were calculated for up to six months prior to the sampling month (i.e. over the period of July 2009 to September 2011). This was done in accordance with the results of Mbogo 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>[
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B35" href="#B35">35</a>], who showed that vegetation, mosquito abundance and infection prevalence display a lag response to rainfall patterns, and that rainfall (and days of rainfall) from preceding months can potentially influence disease infection prevalence.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B36" href="#B36">36</a>]. Samples were ordered by season collected (winter or summer). Readings from all sampling stations were collated to generate a mean value for each parameter measured per site for each season, and all parameters were used in analysis.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All variables were tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilkes test. Only salinity was non-normal. To reduce heteroscedasticity in models [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B37" href="#B37">37</a>], salinity data were log-transformed using a Box-Cox transformation [

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some mosquito specimens were unidentifiable due to immaturity and key body parts missing, and were not included in analysis. Mosquito data were quantified in two ways: mosquito prevalence and vector abundance. Mosquito prevalence was calculated as the sum of mosquitoes caught per site divided by total number of mosquitoes caught overall. For sites where trapping was conducted over two nights, the mean number of mosquitoes caught was calculated to provide comparability with sites where mosquitoes were trapped over one night.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As data for vector species for avian malaria are still quite sparse for the Western Cape region, there remains the possibility that additional undocumented species act as vectors. We simply used the abundance of known vectors to gauge vector presence. Vector abundance was thus the number of known vectors caught per site.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A disproportionate number of mosquitoes were caught at one wetland site.
