  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used distributions of Chinese endemic bird species as dataset in the present paper for two reasons: 1) using endemic species can ensure that the distributional ranges of all species were included in the study area, and thus avoided problems related to partial distributional ranges in PAE analysis [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b46-ijms-11-02097" href="#b46-ijms-11-02097">46</a>]; 2) the endemic species in China have been better studied than most other species and therefore have the most accurately mapped distributions [

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijms-11-02097" href="#b5-ijms-11-02097">5</a>] (hereafter “2007 data”), which was compiled from distribution records before year 2005. China currently has 19 recognized avian subregions belonging to seven regions and two realms [

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ijms-11-02097" href="#b4-ijms-11-02097">4</a>]. However, because there are almost no distribution records from the South-Sea Island Subregion, we only used the other 18 subregions in the PAE analysis.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ijms-11-02097" href="#b31-ijms-11-02097">31</a>] (hereafter “1976 data”) contains almost all past information on the distributions of Chinese birds before year 1974, which therefore provides a historical baseline of avian distribution in China. This monograph only provides data on 99 species in 16 subregions. To allow comparison between the two time periods, distributions of the same 99 species and in 16 subregions were used to derive trees from the 1976 and 2007 dataset.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Areas of endemism (AOEs) are usually defined as areas delimited by the congruent distribution of two or more species of restricted range [

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ijms-11-02097" href="#b11-ijms-11-02097">11</a>]. The procedure of PAE analysis modified by Morrone [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijms-11-02097" href="#b13-ijms-11-02097">13</a>] was used in the present study. For identifying AOEs, the 2007 data was used and a matrix of 18 OGUs (subregions) × 105 taxa (bird species) was constructed. To obtain comparable area trees, two matrices with the same 16 OGUs and 99 taxa were constructed from the 1976 and 2007 data. All matrices coded taxa as presence (1) or absence (0). Each matrix also included a hypothetical outgroup OGU with all 0s to root the trees [

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b49-ijms-11-02097" href="#b49-ijms-11-02097">49</a>]. The strict consensus trees of the equally parsimonious trees in each analysis were obtained. AOEs, defined by two or more species being restricted to a group of OGUs, were delimited and mapped. Furthermore, two area trees of the two time periods were compared to see if we could find distribution shifts of bird species through time (
   <span class="italic">ca.</span> 30 years). For more details about PAE implementation see Huang
