  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijms-11-02097" href="#b5-ijms-11-02097">5</a>] documented the subregional avian endemism of China based on the number of endemic species, monotypic species and EOSR (species distributed only in one specific subregion). This approach may not reflect possible historical relationships and congruence in species distribution among different avian subregions. However, some results in the present paper are nearly congruent with those of Lei

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijms-11-02097" href="#b5-ijms-11-02097">5</a>], in that the Taiwan subregion had the highest EOSR species richness. This AOE, with an extremely high degree of regional endemism, reflects its particular geological, evolutionary and ecological isolation.

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-ijms-11-02097" href="#b38-ijms-11-02097">38</a>]. To promote avian biodiversity conservation, BirdLife International has used other criteria to set up global endemic bird areas (EBAs). EBAs are defined as areas containing two or more species with restricted distributions and can overlap an adjoining EBA by no more than 50,000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ijms-11-02097" href="#b6-ijms-11-02097">6</a>]. Most of the 13 EBAs and three secondary areas of avian biodiversity in China listed by BirdLife International [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-ijms-11-02097" href="#b39-ijms-11-02097">39</a>] are located within the four AOEs described here.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">AOEs are important for avian biodiversity conservation based on two main reasons: 1) according to its theoretical basis, AOEs are historically key areas for evolution of the avian fauna (namely, formation of avian biodiversity); 2) AOEs have a higher degree of avian endemism, especially endemic bird species with very restricted distributions. Our results suggest that the Southwest Mountainous Subregion and Taiwan Subregion have the highest conservation priority in terms of biodiversity, biogeography and evolution.</p>
