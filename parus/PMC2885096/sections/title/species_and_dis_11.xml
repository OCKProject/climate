 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used distributions of Chinese endemic bird species as dataset in the present paper for two reasons: 1) using endemic species can ensure that the distributional ranges of all species were included in the study area, and thus avoided problems related to partial distributional ranges in PAE analysis [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b46-ijms-11-02097" href="#b46-ijms-11-02097">46</a>]; 2) the endemic species in China have been better studied than most other species and therefore have the most accurately mapped distributions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b47-ijms-11-02097" href="#b47-ijms-11-02097">47</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The updated distribution database of endemic birds was from Lei 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijms-11-02097" href="#b5-ijms-11-02097">5</a>] (hereafter “2007 data”), which was compiled from distribution records before year 2005. China currently has 19 recognized avian subregions belonging to seven regions and two realms [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ijms-11-02097" href="#b3-ijms-11-02097">3</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ijms-11-02097" href="#b4-ijms-11-02097">4</a>]. However, because there are almost no distribution records from the South-Sea Island Subregion, we only used the other 18 subregions in the PAE analysis.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cheng’s Complete Checklist of the Avifauna of China [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ijms-11-02097" href="#b31-ijms-11-02097">31</a>] (hereafter “1976 data”) contains almost all past information on the distributions of Chinese birds before year 1974, which therefore provides a historical baseline of avian distribution in China. This monograph only provides data on 99 species in 16 subregions. To allow comparison between the two time periods, distributions of the same 99 species and in 16 subregions were used to derive trees from the 1976 and 2007 dataset.
