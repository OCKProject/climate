  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The general topology based on distributions of the 105 species revealed three main branches: the DXMS, the Palaearctic subregions, and the Oriental subregions. Among them, the DXMS has only the one species, 
   <span class="italic">Garrulax davidi</span>. It is very probable that such little information caused this branch to separate from the other Palaearctic subregions. Except this branch, the subregional topology generally reflects the accepted division between the Palaearctic and Oriental realms in China [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By using the PAE method, four avian AOEs at subregional level, 
   <span class="italic">i.e.,</span> the Qinghai-Zangnan Subregion (AOE1), the Southwest Mountainous Subregion (AOE2), the Hainan Subregion (AOE3), and the Taiwan Subregion (AOE4) were identified (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijms-11-02097" href="#f1-ijms-11-02097">Figure 1</a>). The Qinghai-Zangnan Subregion extends from the north Qilianshan mountains of northeastern Qinghai Province southward to Changdu and encompasses central and eastern regions of the Himalayan Mountains, including the Yaluzangbu valley of Tibetan Autonomous Region. Typical habitats in this area are montane forest (coniferous and broad-leaved), meadow and meadow-steppe. The Southwest Mountainous Subregion encompasses the western areas of Yunnan and Sichuan provinces and mostly covers the Hengduan mountain areas. Its typical habitats are mountain meadow and mountain forest with obvious altitudinal variation. The Hainan Subregion is confined to the Hainan Island. The typical habitat is tropical monsoon rain forest. The Taiwan Subregion is confined to the Taiwan Island and its offshore islands. Typical habitats are tropical monsoon rain forest and subtropical ever-green broad-leaved forest.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the Qinghai-Zangnan Subregion and the Southwest Mountainous Subregion are geographically contiguous on the southeast Tibetan Plateau, they are in two distinct separated branches in the tree, which is consistent with the division between the Palaearctic and Oriental realms [

   <span class="italic">B. koslowi</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Urocynchramus pylzowi</span> and

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ijms-11-02097" href="#b3-ijms-11-02097">3</a>]. Besides the endemics restricted to this AOE,

AOEs are important areas for understanding fauna evolution, which has been determined by historical and ecological factors. For these two adjacent AOEs, they have related but discrepant geological history. As part of the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau and the Himalayas region, which began in the Late Cenozoic [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ijms-11-02097" href="#b32-ijms-11-02097">32</a>], the Qinghai-Zangnan region has been formed due to the recent and violent uplift (less than 2.5 million years ago). Harsh environmental pressures during this uplift mainly determined the fauna evolution in this region [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ijms-11-02097" href="#b15-ijms-11-02097">15</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-ijms-11-02097" href="#b33-ijms-11-02097">33</a>]. However, the Southwest Mountainous region has much longer geological history and was more stable during this geological event [

The differences between geological history, topography and ecological factors may determine this different endemic avian fauna of the two AOEs, with the inferred hypothesis that historical and ecological vicariant events may act as important factors in shaping this deep divergence between the two AOEs.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The other two AOEs, the Hainan and Taiwan subregions, are islands with typical mountainous habitats in the southern subtropical, northern and middle tropical zones. Mountains in the Hainan subregion are relatively low, the highest peak, Wuzhishan, is less than 2,000 m, and the average temperature is &gt;25 °C. The Taiwan Subregion is more geographically isolated by the wider Taiwan Strait. Its western coastal areas are plains, but eastern and central parts are mountainous, with the highest mountain in southeastern China, Mt Yushan (3,997 m) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ijms-11-02097" href="#b3-ijms-11-02097">3</a>]. Fifteen endemic species restricted to this region defined this AOE. For these two AOEs, especially for the Taiwan subregion, species diversification after geological isolation from the mainland may contribute to its current endemic avian fauna.

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All the four AOEs have large part of mountainous habitats, which suggests that mountainous environment may act as “historical and ecological barriers” preventing population gene flow, promoting speciation and maintaining a high endemism [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Importance of AOEs for Avian Biodiversity Conservation</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lei

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijms-11-02097" href="#b5-ijms-11-02097">5</a>] documented the subregional avian endemism of China based on the number of endemic species, monotypic species and EOSR (species distributed only in one specific subregion). This approach may not reflect possible historical relationships and congruence in species distribution among different avian subregions. However, some results in the present paper are nearly congruent with those of Lei 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijms-11-02097" href="#b5-ijms-11-02097">5</a>], in that the Taiwan subregion had the highest EOSR species richness. This AOE, with an extremely high degree of regional endemism, reflects its particular geological, evolutionary and ecological isolation.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of the four AOEs identified in this paper, three are spatially congruent with the avian biodiversity hotspots in China previously mapped by Lei

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ijms-11-02097" href="#b7-ijms-11-02097">7</a>] and China’s avian ‘evolutionary powerhouse’ [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-ijms-11-02097" href="#b38-ijms-11-02097">38</a>]. To promote avian biodiversity conservation, BirdLife International has used other criteria to set up global endemic bird areas (EBAs). EBAs are defined as areas containing two or more species with restricted distributions and can overlap an adjoining EBA by no more than 50,000 km
   <span class="sup">2</span> [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ijms-11-02097" href="#b6-ijms-11-02097">6</a>]. Most of the 13 EBAs and three secondary areas of avian biodiversity in China listed by BirdLife International [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-ijms-11-02097" href="#b39-ijms-11-02097">39</a>] are located within the four AOEs described here.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">AOEs are important for avian biodiversity conservation based on two main reasons: 1) according to its theoretical basis, AOEs are historically key areas for evolution of the avian fauna (namely, formation of avian biodiversity); 2) AOEs have a higher degree of avian endemism, especially endemic bird species with very restricted distributions. Our results suggest that the Southwest Mountainous Subregion and Taiwan Subregion have the highest conservation priority in terms of biodiversity, biogeography and evolution.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Can We Infer Species Distribution Changes by PAE?</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some topology differences are indicated by comparison of the 1976 and 2007 topologies (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-11-02097" href="#f2-ijms-11-02097">Figures 2</a> and 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-11-02097" href="#f3-ijms-11-02097">3</a>). According to the principle of the PAE analysis (parsimony analysis of the species distributions), topology changes indicate that species composition of the related subregions have changed over 
   <span class="italic">ca</span>. three decades. One difference is that more subregions have become clustered to form larger branches. This implies that species dispersal has occurred between some subregional faunas. The group 
   <span class="italic">a</span> (Taiwan island) (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-11-02097" href="#f2-ijms-11-02097">Figure 2b</a>) has become more isolated from branch 
   <span class="italic">d</span> (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-11-02097" href="#f2-ijms-11-02097">Figure 2a</a>), which may suggest a recent decrease in migration between populations on Taiwan island and the Chinese mainland. The most distinct difference is that three Palaearctic subregions in the 1976 tree cluster together with the Oriental subregions in the 2007 tree, which indicates change of species composition of the three subregions, more specifically, oriental species may have dispersed to the Palaearctic subregions. Of the three subregions, the Huang-Huai Plain Subregion (A04) is located in eastern China, which has usually been considered as a dispersal corridor for animal species between southern and northern China. The other two subregions, Qiangtang Plateau Subregion (A09) and Qinghai-Zangnan Subregion (A10) are located on the Tibetan Plateau, which is the highest area of China and most sensitive to climate change. When we refer to the data about climate change (e.g., global climate warming) in China, it was found that more and more data suggest that during the past 
   <span class="italic">ca.</span> half century, most regions of China have been experiencing climate warming, especially in regard to the winter mean temperature in eastern China [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-ijms-11-02097" href="#b40-ijms-11-02097">40</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-ijms-11-02097" href="#b41-ijms-11-02097">41</a>], and the northern boundary of the subtropical zone moved 2–3 degrees of latitude northward in central and eastern China [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-ijms-11-02097" href="#b42-ijms-11-02097">42</a>]. Moreover, a distinct tendency of increasing temperatures, precipitation and relative humidity over the Tibetan Plateau was reported, and data showed the Tibetan Plateau is more sensitive to the global change [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-ijms-11-02097" href="#b43-ijms-11-02097">43</a>]. Based on these evidences, our data may suggest that south to north switches in trend across the boundary between the Palaearctic and Oriental realms in eastern China are probably happening, the bird species 
   <span class="italic">Garrulax canorus, G. elloitii, Carpodacus trifasciatus,</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Urocynchramus pylzowi</span> are good examples. Another type of distribution shift may happen on the Tibetan Plateau region, that is to say, some avian species are moving upward from Oriental subregions with relatively low elevation to the higher elevation of the plateau, such as 
   <span class="italic">Parus davidi, Yuhina diademata, Alcippe variegaticeps</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Paradoxornis przewalskii</span>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When species are forced to move to different areas, so-called “optimal” habitats for many species may no longer exist, at least in the short term [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-ijms-11-02097" href="#b44-ijms-11-02097">44</a>], and this may lead to local extinction of some species [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-ijms-11-02097" href="#b45-ijms-11-02097">45</a>]. The subregional distribution shifts revealed in this paper encourages us to further investigate whether the distribution changes of bird species can exactly link with global warming, or other factors such as human activities or sampling bias. Furthermore, difference between mobility of species may also influence distribution patterns. Detailed investigations from more species and based on more detailed geographical scales are needed in the future.
