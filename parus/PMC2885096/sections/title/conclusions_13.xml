 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PAE was firstly used to identify areas of endemism of Chinese birds at the subregional level. Four AOEs, 
  <span class="italic">i.e.,</span> Qinghai-Zangnan Subregion, the Southwest Mountainous Subregion, the Hainan Subregion and the Taiwan Subregion, were identified. The congruent environments of these AOEs indicate that mountainous environments may act as “historical and ecological barriers” in preventing population gene flow, promoting speciation and maintaining a high endemism, but the differences between geological history, topography and ecological factors may determine the vicariance between the former two AOEs. The cladistic analysis of subregions generally supports the division of China’s avifauna into Palaearctic and Oriental realms. PAE based topological differences produced from two different distribution datasets may reflect the distribution changes of bird species through 
  <span class="italic">ca.</span> three decades. PAE are also found to be useful in avian conservation priority in terms of biodiversity, biogeography and evolution through identifying AOEs.
