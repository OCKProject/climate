 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">China has a high degree of avian endemism, a large land area and a diverse range of habitats spanning both the Palaearctic and the Oriental realms. These features make China an important center of global biodiversity and a good place for biogeographical research. The patterns of distribution of endemic birds have previously been used to set biodiversity conservation priorities in China [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ijms-11-02097" href="#b1-ijms-11-02097">1</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ijms-11-02097" href="#b2-ijms-11-02097">2</a>]. Distribution patterns of endemic bird species are also fundamental to determine China’s avifaunal regionalization [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ijms-11-02097" href="#b3-ijms-11-02097">3</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ijms-11-02097" href="#b4-ijms-11-02097">4</a>], and to interpret subregional avian endemism [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijms-11-02097" href="#b5-ijms-11-02097">5</a>]. BirdLife International has set up global endemic bird areas (EBAs) based on the distribution of species with restricted ranges [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ijms-11-02097" href="#b6-ijms-11-02097">6</a>], and areas of high endemism have been targeted for protection [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ijms-11-02097" href="#b6-ijms-11-02097">6</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ijms-11-02097" href="#b7-ijms-11-02097">7</a>]. Sometimes, endemic birds are effective surrogates for identifying conservation priorities [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ijms-11-02097" href="#b8-ijms-11-02097">8</a>] because of similar distribution patterns with other vertebrate taxa [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ijms-11-02097" href="#b9-ijms-11-02097">9</a>]. Although some previous studies have analyzed distribution patterns in China of endemic birds from different aspects, there has been no report about their areas of endemism (AOEs). Identification of AOEs is important, not only for understanding evolution of Chinese avian fauna, but also for identifying hotspots of avian biodiversity conservation, and may serve as a starting point for developing conservation strategies for other vertebrate taxa.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE) is a biogeographical method first proposed by Rosen [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ijms-11-02097" href="#b10-ijms-11-02097">10</a>], which uses a parsimony algorithm to obtain area cladograms based on the geographical distributions of specified taxa [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ijms-11-02097" href="#b11-ijms-11-02097">11</a>]. PAE can be used to infer relationships among different biogeographical units (e.g., localities, quadrats, continents, islands) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijms-11-02097" href="#b12-ijms-11-02097">12</a>]. Although there is ongoing debate about the value of PAE, PAE has also proven to be a useful and important tool for identifying AOEs [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijms-11-02097" href="#b12-ijms-11-02097">12</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ijms-11-02097" href="#b15-ijms-11-02097">15</a>]. The most common procedure of PAE, as proposed by Morrone [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijms-11-02097" href="#b13-ijms-11-02097">13</a>], used quadrats of predetermined size; and different authors have used different operating geographical units (OGUs) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ijms-11-02097" href="#b16-ijms-11-02097">16</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ijms-11-02097" href="#b21-ijms-11-02097">21</a>]. However, smaller quadrats may decrease the absolute number of steps in the area cladogram while larger quadrats may increase the number of synapomorphies. The use of ‘somewhat more natural’ OGUs, such as biogeographical provinces, subregions and ecoregions, instead of artificial quadrats, is thought to increase the absolute and relative numbers of synapomorphies [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijms-11-02097" href="#b12-ijms-11-02097">12</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ijms-11-02097" href="#b22-ijms-11-02097">22</a>]. Furthermore, such OGUs are useful to understand biogeographical evolution at a large scale. Therefore, we used avian subregions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ijms-11-02097" href="#b3-ijms-11-02097">3</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijms-11-02097" href="#b5-ijms-11-02097">5</a>] as the most appropriate OGU in this PAE analysis.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While historical change in patterns of avian distribution has been documented [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ijms-11-02097" href="#b23-ijms-11-02097">23</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ijms-11-02097" href="#b24-ijms-11-02097">24</a>], evidence of change over a more recent timescale is likely to be related to current climate change or human activities [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ijms-11-02097" href="#b25-ijms-11-02097">25</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-ijms-11-02097" href="#b29-ijms-11-02097">29</a>]. A previous paper tried to link the distribution changes of bird species in China with global warming [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ijms-11-02097" href="#b30-ijms-11-02097">30</a>], however, very limited data (only 12 new distribution records) was used. PAE can produce an area tree by using species distributions as characters in parsimony analysis. Thus, it may give us a chance to investigate distribution shift by comparing area topologies from different datasets (change of character assignment in parsimony analysis will be reflected in the area topology). The data accumulation over more than half a century in our lab [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijms-11-02097" href="#b5-ijms-11-02097">5</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ijms-11-02097" href="#b31-ijms-11-02097">31</a>] is a good basis to investigate the relationship between bird distribution shift and global change (for details about the databases see the Experimental Section).
