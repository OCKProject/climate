 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparison of the topologies derived from the 1976 and 2007 data indicates that: 1) on a large scale (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-11-02097" href="#f3-ijms-11-02097">Figure 3a,b</a>) some central and southern clades have mixed to form a larger southern region, however, in contrast, northeastern clades have contracted within a smaller region; 2) on a fine scale (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-11-02097" href="#f3-ijms-11-02097">Figure 3c,d</a>) southeastern clades have combined to form a larger region while some clades in northeastern China have mixed to form a larger branch; 3) three Palaearctic subregions in the 1976 tree clustered together with the Oriental subregions in the 2007 tree.
