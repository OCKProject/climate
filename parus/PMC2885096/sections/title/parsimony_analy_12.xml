 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Areas of endemism (AOEs) are usually defined as areas delimited by the congruent distribution of two or more species of restricted range [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ijms-11-02097" href="#b11-ijms-11-02097">11</a>]. The procedure of PAE analysis modified by Morrone [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijms-11-02097" href="#b13-ijms-11-02097">13</a>] was used in the present study. For identifying AOEs, the 2007 data was used and a matrix of 18 OGUs (subregions) Ã— 105 taxa (bird species) was constructed. To obtain comparable area trees, two matrices with the same 16 OGUs and 99 taxa were constructed from the 1976 and 2007 data. All matrices coded taxa as presence (1) or absence (0). Each matrix also included a hypothetical outgroup OGU with all 0s to root the trees [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijms-11-02097" href="#b13-ijms-11-02097">13</a>]. PAE was implemented using PAUP 4.0 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b49-ijms-11-02097" href="#b49-ijms-11-02097">49</a>]. The strict consensus trees of the equally parsimonious trees in each analysis were obtained. AOEs, defined by two or more species being restricted to a group of OGUs, were delimited and mapped. Furthermore, two area trees of the two time periods were compared to see if we could find distribution shifts of bird species through time (
