 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Can We Infer Species Distribution Changes by PAE?</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some topology differences are indicated by comparison of the 1976 and 2007 topologies (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-11-02097" href="#f2-ijms-11-02097">Figures 2</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-11-02097" href="#f3-ijms-11-02097">3</a>). According to the principle of the PAE analysis (parsimony analysis of the species distributions), topology changes indicate that species composition of the related subregions have changed over 
  <span class="italic">ca</span>. three decades. One difference is that more subregions have become clustered to form larger branches. This implies that species dispersal has occurred between some subregional faunas. The group 
  <span class="italic">a</span> (Taiwan island) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-11-02097" href="#f2-ijms-11-02097">Figure 2b</a>) has become more isolated from branch 
  <span class="italic">d</span> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-11-02097" href="#f2-ijms-11-02097">Figure 2a</a>), which may suggest a recent decrease in migration between populations on Taiwan island and the Chinese mainland. The most distinct difference is that three Palaearctic subregions in the 1976 tree cluster together with the Oriental subregions in the 2007 tree, which indicates change of species composition of the three subregions, more specifically, oriental species may have dispersed to the Palaearctic subregions. Of the three subregions, the Huang-Huai Plain Subregion (A04) is located in eastern China, which has usually been considered as a dispersal corridor for animal species between southern and northern China. The other two subregions, Qiangtang Plateau Subregion (A09) and Qinghai-Zangnan Subregion (A10) are located on the Tibetan Plateau, which is the highest area of China and most sensitive to climate change. When we refer to the data about climate change (e.g., global climate warming) in China, it was found that more and more data suggest that during the past 
  <span class="italic">ca.</span> half century, most regions of China have been experiencing climate warming, especially in regard to the winter mean temperature in eastern China [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-ijms-11-02097" href="#b40-ijms-11-02097">40</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-ijms-11-02097" href="#b41-ijms-11-02097">41</a>], and the northern boundary of the subtropical zone moved 2–3 degrees of latitude northward in central and eastern China [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-ijms-11-02097" href="#b42-ijms-11-02097">42</a>]. Moreover, a distinct tendency of increasing temperatures, precipitation and relative humidity over the Tibetan Plateau was reported, and data showed the Tibetan Plateau is more sensitive to the global change [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-ijms-11-02097" href="#b43-ijms-11-02097">43</a>]. Based on these evidences, our data may suggest that south to north switches in trend across the boundary between the Palaearctic and Oriental realms in eastern China are probably happening, the bird species 
  <span class="italic">Garrulax canorus, G. elloitii, Carpodacus trifasciatus,</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Urocynchramus pylzowi</span> are good examples. Another type of distribution shift may happen on the Tibetan Plateau region, that is to say, some avian species are moving upward from Oriental subregions with relatively low elevation to the higher elevation of the plateau, such as 
  <span class="italic">Parus davidi, Yuhina diademata, Alcippe variegaticeps</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Paradoxornis przewalskii</span>.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When species are forced to move to different areas, so-called “optimal” habitats for many species may no longer exist, at least in the short term [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-ijms-11-02097" href="#b44-ijms-11-02097">44</a>], and this may lead to local extinction of some species [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-ijms-11-02097" href="#b45-ijms-11-02097">45</a>]. The subregional distribution shifts revealed in this paper encourages us to further investigate whether the distribution changes of bird species can exactly link with global warming, or other factors such as human activities or sampling bias. Furthermore, difference between mobility of species may also influence distribution patterns. Detailed investigations from more species and based on more detailed geographical scales are needed in the future.
