 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 1976 subregional topology from the PAE analysis has four distinctive branches (A, B, C and D) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-11-02097" href="#f2-ijms-11-02097">Figure 2a</a>). With one exception, most subregions from the Oriental realm are clustered in branch D and those from the Palaearctic realm in branches A, B, and C. Branch A and B have only one subregion each. Branch C and D can be divided into minor subregional branches as 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-11-02097" href="#f2-ijms-11-02097">Figure 2a</a> shows. Branch A has only one endemic species, 
  <span class="italic">Podoces hendersoni</span>, branch B has five endemic species. In branch C, group 
  <span class="italic">a</span> has one subregion and only one species, 
  <span class="italic">Garrulax davidi</span>, which is co-distributed in all but one of the other subregions of branch C. Four and five subregions belong to group 
  <span class="italic">b</span> and 
  <span class="italic">c</span>, respectively. Group 
  <span class="italic">d</span>, which has four subregions, is clustered with group 
  <span class="italic">e</span>, with two subregions, to form branch D.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 2007 subregional topology has three distinct branches (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-11-02097" href="#f2-ijms-11-02097">Figure 2b</a>). All subregions from the Oriental realm, together with three from the Palaearctic realm, are clustered in branch B. The other subregions from the Palaearctic realm form the other two branches, A and C. Branch B contains three groups, among which branch 
  <span class="italic">a</span> has only one subregion (A16) with very typical island habitat.
