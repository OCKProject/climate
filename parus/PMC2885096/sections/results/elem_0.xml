  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A tree derived from the 2007 data, comprised of 105 endemic bird species in 18 subregions, indicates that the 18 subregions form three main branches (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijms-11-02097" href="#f1-ijms-11-02097">Figure 1</a>). The first branch is comprised of only the DXMS (avian subregional code A01; for the abbreviations for the subregions, refer to the caption of 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijms-11-02097" href="#f1-ijms-11-02097">Figure 1</a>). The second branch includes nine subregions, 
   <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, A02–A10, all of which belong to the Palaearctic realm. The third branch includes eight subregions (A11–A18), all of which belong to the Oriental realm. With the exception of the DXMS, this PAE-derived topology reflects the accepted division of China’s avifauna into Palaearctic and Oriental realms.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Four AOEs were identified at the subregional level (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijms-11-02097" href="#f1-ijms-11-02097">Figure 1</a>). Of these subregions, one is in the Palaearctic realm and the other three are in the Oriental realm. AOE1 is the Qinghai-Zangnan Subregion (clade A10) on the southeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau, and was delimited by the species 
   <span class="italic">Alectoris magna</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Babax koslowi</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Garrulax sukatschewi</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Kozlowia roborowskii</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Paradoxornis przewalskii</span>. AOE2 is the Southwest Mountainous Subregion (clade A11) delimited by 
   <span class="italic">Arborophila rufipectus</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Garrulax bieti</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Liocichla omeiensis</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Moupinia poecilotis</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Paradoxornis zappeyi</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Phylloscopus emeienses</span>. AOE3 is Hainan Subregion (clade A17) delimited by 
   <span class="italic">Arborophila ardens</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Phylloscopus hainanus</span>. AOE4 is the Taiwan Subregion (clade A18) delimited by 
   <span class="italic">Actinodura morrisoniana</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Arborophila crudigularis</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Bradypterus alishannensis</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Garrulax morrisonianus</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Heterophasia auricularis</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Liocichla steerii</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Lophura swinhoii</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Myiophoneus insularis</span>,

   <span class="italic">Tarsiger johnstoniae</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Urocissa caerulea</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Yuhina brunneiceps</span>. The greater number of species delimiting this AOE reflects the fact that it has the highest endemicity of all four AOEs.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 1976 subregional topology from the PAE analysis has four distinctive branches (A, B, C and D) (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-11-02097" href="#f2-ijms-11-02097">Figure 2a</a>). With one exception, most subregions from the Oriental realm are clustered in branch D and those from the Palaearctic realm in branches A, B, and C. Branch A and B have only one subregion each. Branch C and D can be divided into minor subregional branches as 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-11-02097" href="#f2-ijms-11-02097">Figure 2a</a> shows. Branch A has only one endemic species, 
   <span class="italic">Podoces hendersoni</span>, branch B has five endemic species. In branch C, group 
   <span class="italic">a</span> has one subregion and only one species, 
   <span class="italic">Garrulax davidi</span>, which is co-distributed in all but one of the other subregions of branch C. Four and five subregions belong to group 
   <span class="italic">b</span> and 
   <span class="italic">c</span>, respectively. Group 
   <span class="italic">d</span>, which has four subregions, is clustered with group 
   <span class="italic">e</span>, with two subregions, to form branch D.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 2007 subregional topology has three distinct branches (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-11-02097" href="#f2-ijms-11-02097">Figure 2b</a>). All subregions from the Oriental realm, together with three from the Palaearctic realm, are clustered in branch B. The other subregions from the Palaearctic realm form the other two branches, A and C. Branch B contains three groups, among which branch 
   <span class="italic">a</span> has only one subregion (A16) with very typical island habitat.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparison of the topologies derived from the 1976 and 2007 data indicates that: 1) on a large scale (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-11-02097" href="#f3-ijms-11-02097">Figure 3a,b</a>) some central and southern clades have mixed to form a larger southern region, however, in contrast, northeastern clades have contracted within a smaller region; 2) on a fine scale (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-11-02097" href="#f3-ijms-11-02097">Figure 3c,d</a>) southeastern clades have combined to form a larger region while some clades in northeastern China have mixed to form a larger branch; 3) three Palaearctic subregions in the 1976 tree clustered together with the Oriental subregions in the 2007 tree.
