 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bird abundance data were collected within the citizen science program Stunde der Gartenvögel (Hour of the Garden Birds) in Germany. This program is organized by the German BirdLife partner Naturschutzbund Deutschland (Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union) and its counterpart Landesbund für Vogelschutz in Bayern (Bavarian Society for the Protection of Birds). During the second weekend of May each year, German citizens were requested to count the maximum number of specimens per bird species observed in their gardens in a time frame of 1 hour. We used the data for the 15 most commonly detected bird species, with at least 247,000 observed specimens each during 2006–2016, for further analyses: Eurasian blue tit (
  <span class="italic">Cyanistes caeruleus</span>), common chaffinch (
  <span class="italic">Fringilla coelebs</span>), Eurasian magpie (
  <span class="italic">Pica pica</span>), European greenfinch (
  <span class="italic">Chloris chloris</span>), black redstart (
  <span class="italic">Phoenicurus ochruros</span>), great tit (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>), common blackbird, house sparrow (
  <span class="italic">Passer domesticus</span>), Eurasian tree sparrow (
  <span class="italic">Passer montanus</span>), common swift (
  <span class="italic">Apus apus</span>), common house martin (
  <span class="italic">Delichon urbicum</span>), carrion crow (
  <span class="italic">Corvus corone</span>), common wood pigeon (
  <span class="italic">Columba palumbus</span>), European robin (
  <span class="italic">Erithacus rubecula</span>), and common starling (
  <span class="italic">Sturnus vulgaris</span>). The dataset consisted of 317,533 unique observation datasets with anonymized sampling locations at the level of postal code regions in Germany, each giving information on the number of specimens per bird species and sampling site.
