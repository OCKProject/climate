   </a>). After the description of a USUV outbreak in wild birds in Germany in 2011, we requested, by press releases and media dissemination, that citizens send dead birds for USUV screening at national reference laboratories. We necropsied the bird specimens and screened them for USUV-specific RNA. During August 2011–November 2015, a total of 230 specimens of 15 species (85.7% common blackbirds) from 132 different sites tested positive for USUV. We used European Land Surface Temperature (EuroLST) dataset maps with 9 bioclimatic variables at 250-m resolution as explanatory variables for the distribution modeling of USUV (

   </a>). Bioclimatic variables are derived from monthly temperature and rainfall values. These biologically meaningful variables represent annual trends, seasonality, and extreme or limiting environmental factors.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We applied an ensemble boosted regression tree (BRT) approach using R software (
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.r-project.org</span>) with the packages raster, dismo, and ecospat and visualized with ggplot2, which was successfully applied to other mosquitoborne viruses in the past (e.g., Zika virus) (
   <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">
    <span class="italic">28</span>
   </a>). We calibrated BRT models with presence-only data and 10,000 random background points selected from the entire area of Germany. To account for the biased bird collection due to the unsystematic dead bird surveillance program and to increase the robustness of model predictions and quantify model uncertainty, we selected 300 random subsamples of the presence data with replacement. Due to locality uncertainties in the presence data (e.g., mobility of the birds and imprecise reporting by the volunteer senders), we applied a random point selection within the corresponding German postal code areas (0.31–891.68 km
   <span class="sup">2</span>, mean size 32.00 km
   <span class="sup">2</span>) for all presence points (i.e., sites with birds testing positive for USUV) in each subsample. In addition, we selected a new set of 10,000 random background points for each model. We weighted background points and occurrence points equally in each of the 300 BRT models, which we averaged for the final USUV distribution map. We converted the continuous distribution map for USUV to a binary map with areas that are suitable or unsuitable for USUV. Following Pigott et al. (
   <a rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" href="#R29">
    <span class="italic">29</span>
   </a>), we selected a threshold that included 90% of the USUV occurrence points. We chose a threshold cutoff of 90% instead of 100% to account for potential spatial inaccuracies of the occurrence point dataset.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We validated the models with a 10-fold cross-validation approach. We produced a total of 300 random split sampling datasets with 10 subsets for training datasets (comprising 10% of the presence and background observations) and 10 subsets for test datasets (comprising 90% of the presence and background observations) each. We used the training datasets to assess the ability of the models to predict the test dataset with the area under the curve (AUC) statistic. We averaged the AUC values of the models across the 10 models of each split sampling dataset and finally across the 300 average AUC values. Furthermore, we applied a pairwise distance sampling procedure to avoid AUC inflation due to spatial sorting bias, which is considered to give a more realistic quantification of the model performance especially regarding its transferability (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bird Population Data</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bird abundance data were collected within the citizen science program Stunde der Gartenvögel (Hour of the Garden Birds) in Germany. This program is organized by the German BirdLife partner Naturschutzbund Deutschland (Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union) and its counterpart Landesbund für Vogelschutz in Bayern (Bavarian Society for the Protection of Birds). During the second weekend of May each year, German citizens were requested to count the maximum number of specimens per bird species observed in their gardens in a time frame of 1 hour. We used the data for the 15 most commonly detected bird species, with at least 247,000 observed specimens each during 2006–2016, for further analyses: Eurasian blue tit (
   <span class="italic">Cyanistes caeruleus</span>), common chaffinch (
   <span class="italic">Fringilla coelebs</span>), Eurasian magpie (
   <span class="italic">Pica pica</span>), European greenfinch (
   <span class="italic">Chloris chloris</span>), black redstart (
   <span class="italic">Phoenicurus ochruros</span>), great tit (

   <span class="italic">Sturnus vulgaris</span>). The dataset consisted of 317,533 unique observation datasets with anonymized sampling locations at the level of postal code regions in Germany, each giving information on the number of specimens per bird species and sampling site.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We applied a generalized additive model approach to analyze the population development of each of the 15 bird species. This statistical approach was first developed by Fewster et al. (
   <a rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" href="#R31">
    <span class="italic">31</span>
   </a>) to describe population trends in breeding birds and later successfully used to model bird and bat populations (

   <a rid="R33" ref-type="bibr" href="#R33">
    <span class="italic">33</span>
   </a>). We used the GAM framework to fit a single smoothed curve to the trend of the number of bird specimens in the USUV-positive areas and USUV-negative areas per year. In addition, to allow for differences in relative abundances between sites, we included a site term in the models. Following the suggestion by Fewster et al. (
   <a rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" href="#R31">
    <span class="italic">31</span>
   </a>), we set the selection of the degree of smoothing in the GAM to 0.3 times the number of years of the survey data (df = 3).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We avoided the problems of temporal autocorrelation within the abundance data (
   <a rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" href="#R31">
    <span class="italic">31</span>
   </a>) and overdispersion (
   <a rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" href="#R34">
    <span class="italic">34</span>
   </a>) by using a bootstrap approach. We produced CIs around the smoothed trends with a total of 300 bootstrap samples by resampling with replacement observations from the original dataset for each bird species. We classified each sampling site of the bird population data to be located in the USUV-positive or USUV-negative area on the basis of site coordinates and the USUV binary map. Spatial information of the bird observation sites was available only at the level of postal code regions; therefore, for each bootstrap sample, we took the mean of observed specimens per species within each region and then randomly assigned it within its postal code region to classify it as within the USUV-suitable or USUV-unsuitable area.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We set 2011 as the baseline year (index = 100); this year was the last time bird abundance data were collected before the first epizootic outbreak of USUV in Germany (
   <a rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" href="#R14">
    <span class="italic">14</span>
   </a>). Nonoverlapping 95% bootstrap CIs with index = 100 and nonoverlapping 95% bootstrap CIs between the USUV-suitable areas and USUV-unsuitable areas in 2016 were interpreted as a statistically significant difference (p&lt;0.05).
