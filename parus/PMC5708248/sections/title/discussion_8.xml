 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the past 2 decades, an ongoing spread of USUV and a continuous circulation of the virus after initial establishment have been observed in different countries in Europe (
  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </a>
  <span class="italic">,</span>
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">
   <span class="italic">10</span>
  </a>), highlighting the demand to understand the distribution of USUV and its ecosystem effects in the outbreak areas. Due to the enzootic transmission cycle of USUV with birds as amplifying hosts, the question regarding the effect of the virus on avian populations in particular was open. In this study, we compared the population dynamics of 15 common bird species between regions in Germany identified as USUV-suitable and USUV-unsuitable. Previous assessments were particularly limited by the missing explicit spatial distinction between areas with and without circulation of USUV. In addition, these studies did not distinguish population-level impacts of the disease from the natural fluctuations; that is, they did not use long-term bird abundance data that extend before and after the emergence of the first USUV outbreak.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Therefore, in a first step, we applied a distribution modeling approach to identify areas with and without potential circulation of USUV in Germany. The applied modeling approach was previously shown to be suitable to map the distribution of mosquitoborne viruses like dengue virus (
  <a rid="R35" ref-type="bibr" href="#R35">
   <span class="italic">35</span>
  </a>) or Zika virus (
  <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">
   <span class="italic">28</span>
  </a>). Potential outbreak areas for USUV were predominantly located in southwestern Germany, where the annual mean temperature was the most influential variable explaining the observed distribution (i.e., the virus showed an increasing probability of occurrence with increasing annual mean temperatures). Although the main transmission parameters of USUV are unknown (e.g., extrinsic incubation period), temperature is probably one of the most important drivers of USUV circulation, because the mosquito vectors are exothermic and the replication rate of the viruses increases as temperature increases. For example, laboratory experiments demonstrated that higher temperatures resulted in higher USUV infection rates of 
  <span class="italic">Culex pipiens</span> mosquitoes (
  <a rid="R36" ref-type="bibr" href="#R36">
   <span class="italic">36</span>
  </a>). Nevertheless, although the ensemble of boosted regression tree models had a high performance in the differentiation of areas suitable and unsuitable for USUV in Germany, it should be kept in mind that this estimation has some degree of uncertainty. A high probability of occurrence for USUV does not necessarily mean that the virus ultimately arrives and establishes itself (
  <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">
   <span class="italic">28</span>
  </a>). In addition to environmental suitability, different additional parameters influence the spread and circulation of arboviruses, including vector/host mobility or herd immunity (
  <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">
   <span class="italic">19</span>
  </a>
  <span class="italic">,</span>
  <a rid="R37" ref-type="bibr" href="#R37">
   <span class="italic">37</span>
  </a>). 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, the annual dynamics of USUV highly depend on the temporal temperature profile within the course of the year. The high activity of USUV in the late summer and beginning of autumn 2016, for example, was linked to temperature anomalies in September; significant positive deviation from the 30-year mean temperatures will have shortened the extrinsic incubation period and, at the same time, potentially caused increased vector abundance and associated vector-host contact rate (
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">
   <span class="italic">12</span>
  </a>
  <span class="italic">,</span>
  <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">
   <span class="italic">19</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Was observed statistically significant stronger decline of the population in the USUV outbreak areas compared with the USUV-unsuitable area only for the common blackbird and not for any other analyzed bird taxa, including species regularly tested positive for USUV in Europe (e.g., house sparrow and common starling) (
  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </a>). This finding is in contrast to other mosquitoborne avian viruses, which often show negative effects on the populations of several bird species at the same time; WNV in North America negatively affected the populations of 
  <span class="underline">&gt;</span>7 bird species, leading to population reduction of up to 45% (
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>), and avian malaria parasites potentially caused the extinction of several bird taxa in Hawaii, USA (
  <a rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" href="#R16">
   <span class="italic">16</span>
  </a>). One possible explanation might be that population declines of some species are masked by natural population dynamics or spatial-temporal variability of the population fluctuations (
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>), such as those caused by largely neglected bird pathogens like polyomaviruses (
  <a rid="R38" ref-type="bibr" href="#R38">
   <span class="italic">38</span>
  </a>). Nevertheless, although USUV can infect &gt;30 bird taxa, blackbirds are generally by far the most frequently affected species, comprising &gt;60% of all bird specimens testing positive for USUV in Europe (
  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </a>). The underlying causes of a remarkably higher frequency of USUV-positive common blackbirds compared with other bird species are unknown, but some factors may include the wide distribution and abundance of the species (
  <a rid="R39" ref-type="bibr" href="#R39">
   <span class="italic">39</span>
  </a>), its conspicuous size and color, and its close association with humans (
  <a rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" href="#R40">
   <span class="italic">40</span>
  </a>), all of which might contribute to the high recovery rate of blackbird bodies. Potential reasons for a higher sensitivity to USUV might be a higher virus susceptibility (
  <a rid="R41" ref-type="bibr" href="#R41">
   <span class="italic">41</span>
  </a>), behavioral traits (
  <a rid="R42" ref-type="bibr" href="#R42">
   <span class="italic">42</span>
  </a>), or different spatial-temporal distribution in relation to the vector/virus distribution (
  <a rid="R43" ref-type="bibr" href="#R43">
   <span class="italic">43</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the USUV outbreak in Germany, the common blackbird population decreased by an additional 15.7% in the USUV-suitable area compared with the USUV-unsuitable area. Thus, assuming a mean density of 111.93 birds/km
  <span class="sup">2</span> (8 million breeding pairs each having approximately 3 fledglings per year [
  <a rid="R44" ref-type="bibr" href="#R44">
   <span class="italic">44</span>
  </a>] and a USUV-suitable area of 9,510 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>), 
  <span class="underline">&gt;</span>167,119 birds died due to USUV since 2011; this estimate does not include other population effects like immigration compensating a part of the USUV-related population decline. The estimate is substantially higher than the one determined in the study by Bosch et al. (
  <a rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" href="#R21">
   <span class="italic">21</span>
  </a>), assuming 40,000 common blackbird deaths in the USUV outbreak in Germany in 2011–2012, which did not account for persistent USUV-related deaths. At the same time, the overall population decline of the common blackbird is considerably smaller than 50%–90% (
  <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">
   <span class="italic">22</span>
  </a>
  <span class="italic">,</span>
  <a rid="R23" ref-type="bibr" href="#R23">
   <span class="italic">23</span>
  </a>), which might reflect only the short-term population declines. Nevertheless, several studies reported local extinction of common blackbirds probably caused by the USUV outbreak (
  <a rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" href="#R18">
   <span class="italic">18</span>
  </a>
  <span class="italic">,</span>
  <a rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" href="#R21">
   <span class="italic">21</span>
  </a>
  <span class="italic">,</span>
  <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">
   <span class="italic">22</span>
  </a>), which can be explained by local high virus transmission (e.g., favorable distribution of vectors and hosts). A relatively large spatial heterogeneity of the impact of mosquitoborne viruses on bird populations was also observed for WNV in North America (
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>); that rate is potentially related to the connection between the local vector and the bird community and influenced by land use and climate parameters (
  <a rid="R43" ref-type="bibr" href="#R43">
   <span class="italic">43</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">USUV activity after the first outbreak in Germany in 2011–2012 was remarkably lower in the following years, as reflected in the detection of fewer USUV-positive dead birds (
  <a rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" href="#R25">
   <span class="italic">25</span>
  </a>
  <span class="italic">,</span>
  <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
   <span class="italic">26</span>
  </a>). However, the common blackbird population in the USUV-suitable areas continued to decline after the initial outbreak. A similar observation was made for WNV in North America, which has a persistent impact for different bird species resulting in a lower survival rate without signs of recovery after the first outbreak of the virus (
  <a rid="R45" ref-type="bibr" href="#R45">
   <span class="italic">45</span>
  </a>). Therefore, due to the ongoing and widespread circulation of USUV in Central Europe (
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">
   <span class="italic">12</span>
  </a>), we must expect a long-term decline of common blackbird populations in areas with USUV occurrence, leading to a substantial alteration of the bird communities in the European USUV outbreak areas.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We still lack comprehensive data on the interaction between USUV and its vectors, hosts, and environmental parameters. We need data on the avian hosts to clarify the epidemiology of USUV and investigation into ecologic consequences, especially if they increase the risk of infection for humans. For example, the high mortality rate among common blackbirds might increase the chance of USUV spillover to humans, because the dead hosts are not present as immune or dead-end hosts (
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>
  <span class="italic">,</span>
  <a rid="R43" ref-type="bibr" href="#R43">
   <span class="italic">43</span>
  </a>
  <span class="italic">,</span>
  <a rid="R46" ref-type="bibr" href="#R46">
   <span class="italic">46</span>
  </a>
  <span class="italic">,</span>
  <a rid="R47" ref-type="bibr" href="#R47">
   <span class="italic">47</span>
  </a>). In addition, although no USUV effect was found for bird species classified as threatened (e.g., common starling) (
  <a rid="R48" ref-type="bibr" href="#R48">
   <span class="italic">48</span>
  </a>), a wide variety of bird species may be susceptible to USUV infections (
  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </a>). Therefore, further studies should also focus on bird species not covered by the bird abundance dataset used here, such as wetland birds, which occupy areas that generally harbor high numbers of mosquitoes (
  <a rid="R49" ref-type="bibr" href="#R49">
   <span class="italic">49</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, USUV had a statistically significant negative impact on the population of common blackbirds in suitable areas in Germany: a lower population index compared with the baseline year (CIs &lt;100) and a statistically significant lower population index in the USUV-suitable area compared with the USUV-unsuitable area (nonoverlapping CIs between both areas). We observed no significant effect for the other 14 bird species included in the study. Five years after the first detection of USUV in southwest Germany, the circulation of the virus resulted in an additional decline of ≈15.7% in the common blackbird populations compared with the development of populations not affected by USUV. Avian populations are under different threats, including changes of land use and climate change (
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>
  <span class="italic">,</span>
  <a rid="R24" ref-type="bibr" href="#R24">
   <span class="italic">24</span>
  </a>). The emergence of USUV in Europe is a further threat that can cause substantial changes in ecosystem services provided by birds, such as seed dispersal (
  <a rid="R50" ref-type="bibr" href="#R50">
   <span class="italic">50</span>
  </a>). The recent outbreak of USUV in 4 Central European countries (Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, and France) underlines the large-scale distribution of USUV spanning from southern to central Europe (
  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </a>
  <span class="italic">,</span>
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">
   <span class="italic">12</span>
  </a>). In conclusion, USUV could affect bird populations, at least common blackbirds, across Europe.
