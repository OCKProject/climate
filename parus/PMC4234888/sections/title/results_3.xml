 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The warmth sum was extremely low in 2013 in comparison with the values for the preceding 14 years (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). When we excluded 2013, there was a trend for warmth sums to increase during 1999–2012 (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.53, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 14, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.049) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). The mean warmth sum for the period 1999–2012 was 338.5 °C, increasing by 2.34 °C per year (the mean for 2002–2012 was 347.8 °C), compared to 90.2 °C in 2013. The Cook’s distance for the 2013 data point in temporal trend line shows that this point is a very strong outlier (4.62), whereas the median distance (1999–2013) is 0.03, while the second highest distance in the analysed period is only 0.14 (2012) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). When the data point for 2013 is included into the regression, the relationship between the warmth sum and years becomes nonsignificantly negative. The 15 March–15 April warmth sum for 2013 is extremely low also in a wider comparison with the warmth sums for the preceding 40 years. The value for 2013 is below the lowest marginal warmth sum in 1973–2012 (ranging from 185.5 to 436 °C; mean 315.1 °C ± 64.3 SD), resulting in a highly significant difference (
