 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study was carried out in 1999–2013 as part of a long-term project of research into the breeding biology of hole-nesting birds occupying nest boxes near Łódź (51° 47′ N, 19° 28′ E, central Poland). Study areas are located in two, 10-km-distant, structurally and floristically contrasting types of habitats: an urban parkland and a rich deciduous forest. Data analysed include tit breeding seasons (April–May) 1999–2013 in the parkland and 2002–2013 in the forest (Marciniak et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2007</a>; Kaliński et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2012</a>). Both areas have been equipped with wooden nest boxes (Labmrechts et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">2010</a>), c. 200 in the parkland area and c. 300 in the forest. In spring, all nest boxes were checked for first egg dates and other breeding characteristics of tits. A total of 1,182 first clutches of Great Tit (735 from the parkland and 447 from the forest) and 861 first clutches of Blue Tit (412 from parkland and 449 from the forest) were studied between 1999 and 2013.

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">1989</a>), we calculated warmth sums, as the sum of the maximum daily temperatures for the period between 15 March and 15 April each year, to characterise thermal conditions. We used Cook’s distance to measure how extreme 2013 was in comparison with the trend for 14 preceding years (being the background for our phenological data on tits). In addition, in order to compare the 15 March–15 April warmth sum for 2013 with the warmth sums for a longer period encompassing 40 years of available records (1973–2012), we used a special version of 
  <span class="italic">t</span> test described by Sokal and Rohlf (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">1994</a>). We used one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test to compare mean laying dates between years.
