 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The dynamics of bird populations are influenced by climate change on both regional and local scales (Crick and Sparks 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">1999</a>; Hallett et al.

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2013</a>). There is good evidence from Europe and North America that many avian species nowadays migrate and breed earlier as a result of higher temperatures (Crick 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">1997</a>; Tryjanowski et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">2002</a>; Huppop and Huppop

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">2010</a>; Matthysen et al.

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">2013</a>). The impact of the changes varies for different latitude, longitude, topography, etc., as well as among different species (Sanz 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2002</a>; Askeyev et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2010</a>; Goodenough et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">2010</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2011</a>). Yet, global warming not only means higher temperatures but also more frequent extreme weather events (Ogi et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2010</a>; Wu et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">2012</a>; Zhang et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">2012</a>; Coumou and Rahmstorf 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">2012</a>; Tang et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">2013</a>). In light of many recent extreme events all over the globe in 2012 and 2013 (Peterson et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2013</a>; Vaughan et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">2013</a>; Zscheischler et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">2013</a>; some of which are considered to be the result of climate change), there is a possibility that distinctly low temperatures in the early spring 2013 could probably be linked to climate change. On the other hand, some climatologists think that there is no link between recent extreme events and climate change (Wallace et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">2014</a>), but regardless of what is the reason for the extreme spring 2013 at our area and assuming that there is a potential for more frequent occurrence of atypical years, in the course of climate changes, we should study extreme weather phenomena and their consequences for wild populations.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2013, the winter ended late and with very low temperatures in central and north Europe. March 2013 was the coldest in the UK meteorological records since 1962 (measurement since 1910; Slingo 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">2013</a>), and in central Europe, the temperatures were also much below recent averages, and as a result, many temperature records were beaten (Andrews 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2013</a>; Harris 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">2013</a>). Because of unusually low late winter/early spring temperatures, for many European countries, March 2013 was the snowiest March in at least 400 years (Harris 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">2013</a>). In central Poland, snow cover was still almost complete until 9 April in urban parks and until 15 April in forests (Glądalski, personal observation). According to some researchers, the basic cause of those extreme weather phenomena could be the melting of arctic ice cap, which caused a long-lasting inflow of cold air to Europe (Li et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">2012</a>; Ravilious 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">2013</a>; Slingo 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">2013</a>). Some authors think that there may be existing connection between arctic sea ice loss caused by global warming and large-scale circulation patterns in the Northern Hemisphere (Francis et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">2009</a>; Francis and Vavrus 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2012</a>; Jaiser et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">2012</a>; Screen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2013</a>; Tang et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">2013</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fletcher et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2013</a>) conclude that there is a need to collect long-term phenology monitoring data in order to fully understand the impacts of climate change on different species. Bauer et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">2010</a>) note in addition that, surprisingly, most papers analysing these trends do not use data from central Europe, and there is a need to fill this gap. The aim of this paper is to show the influence of an extreme weather event in spring 2013 (unique over at least 40 years) on the timing of breeding of Great Tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) and Blue Tits (
  <span class="italic">Cyanistes caeruleus</span>) by comparison with the data from the preceding decade.
