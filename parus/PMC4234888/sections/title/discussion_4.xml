 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mean dates of first egg laying by Great Tits and Blue Tits were highly correlated with spring (pre-laying) thermal conditions (in our region, the period between 15 March and 15 April is crucial; Glądalski 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">2013</a>), with earlier laying occurring in warmer years. The temperature trend (1999–2012), being the background for our phenological data, shows gradual warming. Yet, the 15 March and 15 April warmth sum in 2013 was lower than that in any spring during 1973–2012. In 2013, the beginning of spring was extremely cold, and therefore, initiation of breeding was significantly delayed. Some delays in the timing of breeding were also found for both tit species in 2003 and 2006. Although the spring warmth sums in 2003 and 2006 were not distinctly low, the preceding winters were relatively severe, with the long-lasting snow cover and some adverse weather spells occurring even in early April, which could prevent females from early laying (Glądalski

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Currently, many avian species in Europe migrate and breed earlier as a result of higher temperatures caused by global climate changes (Crick and Sparks

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2013</a>). The Great Tit and the Blue Tit are among such earlier breeding species (Potti

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">2010</a>; Smallegange et al.

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">2013</a>). However, the force of impact of climate warming on reproductive parameters of both tit species seems to vary depending on variables such as longitude, latitude, topography, orientation of slopes, etc., and as a result, in some areas, it may be too weak to be detectable (Sanz 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2002</a>). The effect is stronger for the populations of birds in western Europe (including Mediterranean area), where warmer and wetter winters in recent times result in accelerated breeding. The effect in eastern Europe is weaker—it has a less distinct influence on fewer species (Sanz 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2002</a>; Visser et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">2003</a>; Zalakevicius et al.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study shows that extreme phenomena may act in opposition to trends, but more data are needed, as 1 year is certainly not enough to draw too far-reaching conclusions. Therefore, extreme weather phenomena that influence wild avian populations should be recorded, especially because there is a potential for more frequent occurrence of atypical years associated with climate change. It was extensively debated whether or not different species would be able to adapt quickly enough to keep up with gradually changing environment (Visser 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">2008</a>), but little attention was devoted to potential consequences of extreme weather events occurring more often. The frequency of extremes in weather will probably increase (Zhang et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">2012</a>), and it will have consequences for life histories of different organisms (Robinson et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2007</a>). Probably more extreme weather events and strong deviations from long-term trends, being very strong but unpredictable factors, could disturb life history strategies of some species and make it more difficult for organisms to adapt to local environments (Visser 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">2008</a>; Chamberlain and Pearce-Higgins 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2013</a>; Fletcher et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2013</a>). Maybe this one outlier does not make a wider story by itself, but if similar outliers will appear more frequently, as there is potential for more atypical years as the result of climate change, then further investigations should focus on the impact of extreme events on different life history traits, such as clutch size, hatching rate, reproductive success and proportions of second clutches.
