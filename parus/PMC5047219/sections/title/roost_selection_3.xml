 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the first roost selection experiment, we tested whether peahens’ (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 20) selection of nocturnal roosting locations was impacted by a medium-level of artificial noise pollution. For each trial, a peahen was put inside of the experimental cage (at least 4.5 h before sunset) for one night. The cage had two wooden roosts (0.85 m tall and 1.3 m long; 5.7 m between roosts) and a rock-shaped speaker (150 W Outdoor Rock Speaker, model tfs6sl; TIC Corporation, City of Industry, California, USA) that was positioned in front of each roost (1.4 m between the speaker and roost). One of the speakers (randomly selected for each trial) was connected to an audio amplifier (Audioengine N22; Austin, Texas, USA) and an iPod touch (model A1509; Apple Corporation, Cupertino, California, USA) that continuously broadcast white noise (white Gaussian noise generated with Matlab; 16 bit; 44.1 Hz). In the middle of the roost that was closer to the speaker, the white noise measured 75 dB SPL; in the middle of the roost that was farther from the speaker, the white noise measured 50 dB SPL (model 407730; Extech Instruments, Waltham, MA, USA). Two video cameras (Swann Pro-500) connected to a DVR (Swann DVR4-2600) recorded the experimental cage. Based on the video recordings, we determined whether the peahen slept on the roost closer or farther from the noise.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the second roost selection experiment, we tested whether peahens’ (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 20) selection of nocturnal roosting locations was impacted by a high-level of artificial noise pollution. The experimental procedure was the same as in the first roost selection experiment except the noise level was increased. In the middle of the roost that was closer to the speaker, the white noise measured 90 dB SPL; in the middle of the roost that was farther from the speaker, the white noise measured 65 dB SPL (Extech Instruments; model 407730). Due to a limited number of peahens, we tested 8 peahens that had not been used in the first roost selection experiment. In addition, we randomly selected 12 birds that we used in the first roost selection experiment and used them in this second experiment as well (at least 33 days lapsed since a bird was used in the first roost selection experiment; mean ± SE: 61 ± 6.1 d).
