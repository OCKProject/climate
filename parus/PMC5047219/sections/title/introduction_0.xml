 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Noise pollution is increasingly prevalent in natural environments. Over 85% of the contiguous United States is exposed to noise pollution (
  <a rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-25">Mennitt et al., 2013</a>). Noise pollution is usually louder and more frequent than natural sounds in the environment and can therefore mask these natural sounds (
  <a rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-21">Kight &amp; Swaddle, 2011</a>). In addition, noise pollution is often associated with other types of disturbances, such as light or chemical pollution (
  <a rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-16">Halfwerk &amp; Slabbekoorn, 2015</a>). Because many animals use acoustic information to inform their behavioral decisions (
  <a rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-7">Bradbury &amp; Vehrencamp, 1998</a>), noise pollution can have major impacts on their fitness (
  <a rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-28">Patricelli &amp; Blickley, 2006</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-39">Shannon et al., 2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Noise pollution could impact fitness because of its effect within a variety of different contexts. It can affect the mating behavior of animals. Pair bonds in zebra finches (
  <span class="italic">Taeniopygia guttata</span>) weaken when the birds are exposed to noise pollution (
  <a rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-43">Swaddle &amp; Page, 2007</a>) and male sage grouse (
  <span class="italic">Centrocercus urophasianus</span>) attendance on breeding grounds decreases with noise pollution (
  <a rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-5">Blickley, Blackwood &amp; Patricelli, 2012</a>). Noise pollution can impact territorial behavior as well. Many passerines adjust their songs, which function in both territory defense and mate attraction, to compensate for increased noise levels (
  <a rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-26">Mockford &amp; Marshall, 2009</a>). They vocalize louder (
  <a rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-8">Brumm , 2004</a>), repeat songs (
  <a rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-9">Brumm &amp; Slater, 2006</a>), or sing during times of low noise (
  <a rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-15">Fuller, Warren &amp; Gaston, 2007</a>). Noise pollution can also impact parental investment; female house sparrows (
  <span class="italic">Passer domesticus</span>) provide less food to their young when living in noisy environments (
  <a rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-36">Schroeder et al., 2012</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Less is known about the effects of noise pollution on antipredator behavior (
  <a rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-24">Meillère, Brischoux &amp; Angelier, 2015</a>). However, noise pollution has the potential to alter animals’ perception of the environment (
  <a rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-32">Quinn et al., 2006</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-37">Shannon et al., 2014a</a>). For example, animals that are exposed to noise pollution may perceive the environment as more dangerous because their ability to detect auditory signals and cues is low (
  <a rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-32">Quinn et al., 2006</a>). Chaffinches (
  <span class="italic">Fringilla coelebs</span>) are more vigilant and peck less in response to noise pollution, suggesting that they perceive their noisy environment as risky. In contrast, other animals’ perception of their environment may not be impacted by noise pollution (
  <a rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-4">Bejder et al., 2009</a>). These animals could have already habituated to the noise if they never experienced negative effects in noisy environments or if they are generally tolerant of noise. For example, noise pollution does not impact gerbils’ (
  <span class="italic">Gerbillus allenbyi and G. pyramidum</span>) selection of a safe versus risky microhabitat (
  <a rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-1">Abramsky et al., 1996</a>) and therefore does not seem to alter their perception of the riskiness of their environment. Finally, some animals may perceive environments with noise pollution as relatively safe because noise-sensitive predators may avoid these areas (
  <a rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-14">Francis, Ortega &amp; Cruz, 2009</a>). Elk (
  <span class="italic">Cervus elephus</span>) are less vigilant in response to noise pollution (
  <a rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-37">Shannon et al., 2014a</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-38">Shannon et al., 2014b</a>), suggesting that they view noisy environments as less risky. While we are beginning to understand how species perceive noise pollution with respect to risk levels during their active periods (daytime for diurnal species), we are unaware of any studies that have investigated this topic during their inactive periods (nighttime for diurnal species). Given that animals often rely on their senses differently depending on whether it is daytime or nighttime (e.g., some birds use their visual capabilities to forage during the day but switch to tactile capacities at night; 
  <a rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-35">Robert &amp; McNeil, 1988</a>), animals’ responses to noise pollution could vary depending on this factor.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We therefore examined the impact of noise pollution on nocturnal vigilance and roosting behavior in a diurnal avian species, peafowl (
  <span class="italic">Pavo cristatus)</span>, that inhabits urban environments (
  <a rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-34">Ramesh &amp; McGowan, 2009</a>). Peafowl are native to the Indian subcontinent and have also been introduced to other continents (
  <a rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-20">Kannan &amp; James, 1998</a>). While they naturally live in deciduous forests and scrubby woodlands, they also live near human settlements (
  <a rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-2">Ali &amp; Ripley, 1969</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-17">Johnsingh &amp; Murali, 1978</a>). They roost atop tall structures at night (such as trees; 
  <a rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-12">De Silva, Santiapillai &amp; Dissanayake, 1996</a> and are subject to predation by mammalian and avian predators 
  <a rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-12">De Silva, Santiapillai &amp; Dissanayake, 1996</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-20">Kannan &amp; James, 1998</a>). There are three alternative explanations for how peafowl perceive noisy environments. First, if peafowl perceive their environments as risky when there is noise pollution, then we expect them to exhibit high rates of vigilance in response to noise pollution and avoid roosting in areas with high levels of noise pollution. Second, if peafowl are tolerant of noise pollution or have previously habituated to it, then we do not expect their vigilance rates to change from baseline levels and expect them to select their roosts irrespective of noise pollution. Third, if peafowl perceive environments with noise pollution as an escape from predators, then we expect their vigilance levels to decrease in response to noise pollution and we expect them to roost near high levels of noise pollution. In addition, because noise pollution can be stressful to some species and cause physiological changes (
  <a rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-6">Blickley et al., 2012</a>), we examined whether the mass of peahens changed depending on their exposure to noise pollution.
