 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We explored the effect of artificial noise pollution on vigilance levels and roost selection in captive peahens at the Purdue Wildlife Area in West Lafayette, IN, USA (40.450327°N, −87.052574°E). The vigilance levels experiment was conducted between July 2014 and April 2015 and the roost experiment was conducted between March and June 2016. The experiments were performed in an outdoor experimental cage (4.5 m × 9.0 m) that was 75 m from the outdoor aviary (24.4 × 18.3 × 1.8 m) where the birds were permanently housed (the distance between the experimental cage and main aviary ensured that birds in the main aviary did not hear the broadcast noise from the experimental cage). The aviary was over 550 m from the nearest major road and it was surrounded by trees; noise pollution from anthropogenic sources was therefore minimal. The peahens were adults and were given food and water ad libitum. The study was approved by Purdue University Animal Care and Use Committee (#1305000862 &amp; 1504001232).</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We tested whether artificial noise pollution impacts vigilance levels in peahens (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 30). For each trial, a peahen was put inside of the experimental cage for seven consecutive nights (the experimental design was similar to 
   <a rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-46">Yorzinski et al., 2015</a>). The experimental cage had one wooden roost (0.85 m tall and 1.3 m long) that was 1.5 m from a rock-shaped speaker (150 W Outdoor Rock Speaker, model tfs6sl; TIC Corporation, City of Industry, California, USA). The speaker was connected to an audio amplifier (Audioengine N22; Austin, Texas) and an iPod touch (model A1509; Apple Corporation, Cupertino, California, USA). During noise trials, the speaker continuously broadcast white noise (white Gaussian noise generated with Matlab; 16 bit; 44.1 Hz) during nights (and days) 2–5; no noise was broadcast on nights 1, 6, or 7. The white noise automatically turned on at noon on the second day and turned off at noon on the sixth day (Woods outlet timer, model 50002, Mississauga, Canada). During medium noise trials (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 10), the white noise had a sound pressure level (SPL) of 75 dB (A weighting; slow setting) at the middle of the roost; during loud noise trials (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 10), the white noise measured 90 dB SPL at the middle of the roost (model 407730; Extech Instruments, Waltham, MA, USA). During control trials (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 10), white noise was not broadcast on any of the seven nights. The medium and loud noise trials broadcast noise at the same decibel levels as used in a previous study on noise pollution and birds (
   <a rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-43">Swaddle &amp; Page, 2007</a>); noise pollution in urban environments can exceed the decibel level that we broadcast in our loud noise trials (
   <a rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-11">Chepesiuk, 2005</a>). Furthermore, the peahens were not necessarily exposed to the same level of noise pollution for the entire trial. During the day, they could move to the opposite side of the experimental cage and therefore reduce the loudness of the noise that they experienced. Also, even though the peahens could have slept on the ground at the opposite side of the speaker at night, they always slept on the roost near the speaker.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The head movements of the peahens were continuously monitored with a 3-axis accelerometer (TechnoSmart, Rome, Italy; 3 mm × 1.1 mm; 0.5 g; sample resolution: 19.6 m s
   <span class="sup">−2</span>; sample rate: 50 Hz). The accelerometer was attached to a velcro strip (3.5 mm × 1.8 mm) that was glued (Artiglio Super 620) to the feathers atop the birds’ head (see 
   <a rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-46">Yorzinski et al., 2015</a> for further details on accelerometer and attachment). The accelerometer was replaced every day because the battery would not last for the duration of an entire trial. The accelerometer does not impact head movement rates (
   <a rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-46">Yorzinski et al., 2015</a>). We used a custom algorithm to extract the number of head movements the peahens exhibited during each night of the trial (starting 1 h after sunset and ending 1 h before sunrise; “nighttime period”); the accuracy of this algorithm is high (over 90% of head movements are correctly classified as head movements; see 
   <a rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-46">Yorzinski et al., 2015</a> for more details).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The peahens were weighed at the start and end of the trial (ZIEIS Veterinary Pet Scale; Apple Valley, Minnesota; 5 g accuracy). The length of the peahens’ tarsus + metatarsus was measured at the start of the entire experiment (Neiko digital caliper; Neiko Tools, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China; model number: 01409 A; ± 0.03 mm accuracy). Three video cameras (Swann Pro-500; Swann Communications, Santa Fe Springs, California, USA) connected to a DVR (Swann DVR4-2600) recorded the experimental cage and the area immediately outside the experimental cage (2 m from the cage perimeter). Using these video recordings, we determined the amount of time that predators (raccoons and domestic cats) and non-predators (mice, frogs, flying squirrels, deer, and rabbits) were visible during the nighttime period. We also assessed the time at which the peahens ascended to and descended from the roost each night. The time at which a bird ascended to the roost for the night was assessed by moving backwards in the videos from the nighttime period (1 h after sunset) and finding the time when the bird jumped on the roost. If the bird was not already on the roost 1 h after sunset, then we moved forward in the videos until the bird jumped on the roost. The time at which a bird descended from the roost for the night was assessed in a similar way except that we moved forward in the videos from the nighttime period (1 h before sunrise) until finding the time when the bird jumped off the roost. If the bird was already off the roost 1 h before sunrise, we moved backward in the videos until the bird jumped off the roost. We excluded times when the experimenters interfered with when the bird ascended to the roost or descended from the roost.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Roost selection</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the first roost selection experiment, we tested whether peahens’ (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 20) selection of nocturnal roosting locations was impacted by a medium-level of artificial noise pollution. For each trial, a peahen was put inside of the experimental cage (at least 4.5 h before sunset) for one night. The cage had two wooden roosts (0.85 m tall and 1.3 m long; 5.7 m between roosts) and a rock-shaped speaker (150 W Outdoor Rock Speaker, model tfs6sl; TIC Corporation, City of Industry, California, USA) that was positioned in front of each roost (1.4 m between the speaker and roost). One of the speakers (randomly selected for each trial) was connected to an audio amplifier (Audioengine N22; Austin, Texas, USA) and an iPod touch (model A1509; Apple Corporation, Cupertino, California, USA) that continuously broadcast white noise (white Gaussian noise generated with Matlab; 16 bit; 44.1 Hz). In the middle of the roost that was closer to the speaker, the white noise measured 75 dB SPL; in the middle of the roost that was farther from the speaker, the white noise measured 50 dB SPL (model 407730; Extech Instruments, Waltham, MA, USA). Two video cameras (Swann Pro-500) connected to a DVR (Swann DVR4-2600) recorded the experimental cage. Based on the video recordings, we determined whether the peahen slept on the roost closer or farther from the noise.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the second roost selection experiment, we tested whether peahens’ (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 20) selection of nocturnal roosting locations was impacted by a high-level of artificial noise pollution. The experimental procedure was the same as in the first roost selection experiment except the noise level was increased. In the middle of the roost that was closer to the speaker, the white noise measured 90 dB SPL; in the middle of the roost that was farther from the speaker, the white noise measured 65 dB SPL (Extech Instruments; model 407730). Due to a limited number of peahens, we tested 8 peahens that had not been used in the first roost selection experiment. In addition, we randomly selected 12 birds that we used in the first roost selection experiment and used them in this second experiment as well (at least 33 days lapsed since a bird was used in the first roost selection experiment; mean ± SE: 61 ± 6.1 d).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data analysis</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We tested whether artificial noise pollution impacts nocturnal vigilance rates. We ran a repeated-measures mixed linear model (PROC Mixed with a variance components covariance structure and the between-within degrees of freedom approximation) to examine whether vigilance rates differed among trials. The dependent variable was the natural log of the head movement rate (number of head movements during nighttime period divided by the total time in the nighttime period). The independent variables were the trial night (the specific night of the trial: 1–7), trial type (control trial, medium noise trial, or loud noise trial), trial night by trial type interaction, wind speed, precipitation, temperature, moon illumination, mass at the end of the trial, tarsus + metatarsus, and predator and non-predator presence. We included environmental and morphological variables within the model because these factors have been shown to impact antipredator behavior (e.g., wind speed: 
   <a rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-10">Carr &amp; Lima, 2010</a>; mass: 
   <a rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-19">Jones, Krebs &amp; Whittingham, 2009</a>). We performed 
   <span class="italic">a prior</span> contrasts to compare specific trial nights.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The climate variables were obtained from a local weather station (
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iclimate.org" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://iclimate.org</span>; ACRE- West Lafayette). We calculated the mean of the wind speed (natural log transformed) and temperature across the nighttime period. Since there was no precipitation during 82% of trial nights, precipitation was categorized as being present or absent. Moon illumination was the fraction of the moon’s surface that was illuminated from the sun’s rays (
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.timeanddate.com" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.timeanddate.com</span>; Lafayette, IN). Predator and non-predator presence was whether predators or non-predators, respectively, were visible inside the cage or along the outside of the cage perimeter or not during the nighttime period (predators and non-predators were visible in only 50.8% and 68.5% of nights, respectively). We analyzed whether the amount of time that predators and non-predators spent near the experimental area (total time that predators or non-predators were visible during the nighttime period divided by the nighttime period) was related to trial type, trial night, trial type by trial night interaction, and environmental variables with a repeated-measures mixed linear model. We performed 
   <span class="italic">a prior</span> contrasts to compare specific trial nights. We also performed a mixed linear model to assess whether the mass of the birds changed during the experiment; we calculated the percentage that the mass changed (mass on night 7 minus mass on night 1 divided by mass on night 1) and determined whether the trial type (control trial, medium noise trial, or loud noise trial) impacted this percentage.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We ran another two repeated-measures mixed linear models to determine the factors influencing when the birds ascended to the roost and descended from the roost for the night. The independent variables were the trial type (control trial, medium noise trial, or loud noise trial), trial night (the specific night of the trial: 1–7), trial type by trial night interaction, environmental variables during the nighttime period (wind speed, precipitation, temperature, and moon illumination), morphological measurements of the bird (mass and tarsus + metatarsus), and predator and non-predator presence. We performed binomial tests (Proc Freq) to assess peahens’ roosting preferences (the peahens did not switch to a different roost during a given night). We examined whether trial type (medium or loud noise), environmental variables (wind speed, temperature, and moon illumination), and morphological variables impacted roost choice using a binomial logistic regression (PROC Logistic). The wind speed and temperature at sunset during the night of the trial were used in the analysis; precipitation at sunset during the night of the trial was excluded from this analysis because precipitation was recorded in only 7.5% of trials. Analyses were performed in SAS (9.3; Cary, NC, USA) or Minitab (15.1; Minitab Inc., State College, PA, USA). The data supporting this article are available in Harvard Dataverse:
