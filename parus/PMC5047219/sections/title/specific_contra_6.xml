 <div class="title">Specific contrasts were performed to compare treatment effects and time effects with respect to head movement rate (df = 108) and the amount of time that predators spent near the experimental area (df = 138).</div>
 <p>Within the treatment effects, we examined whether the control and noise trials differed on night 1, nights 2–5 (averaged), and nights 6–7 (averaged). Within the time effects, we examined whether there were differences within the control or noise trials on night 1 compared to night 2–5 (averaged), nights 2–5 (averaged) compared to nights 6–7 (averaged), night 1 compared to night 6–7 (averaged), and night 2 compared to night 5. Contrasts were considered significant if they are less than the Bonferroni corrected 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-value (18 contrasts; 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0028).
