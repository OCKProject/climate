 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The head movement rate of peahens was similar regardless of trial night, the interaction between trial type and trial night, environmental variables (wind, precipitation, temperature, and moon illumination), morphological variables (mass and tarsus + metatarsus:), and predator presence and non-predator presence. However, the head movement rate of peahens was lower during noise trials compared to control trials (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="table-1" href="#table-1">Table 1</a>A). Comparing noise versus control trials on nights with and without noise, the head movement rates were similar (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="table-2" href="#table-2">Table 2</a>A: Treatment effects). There was a non-significant trend for head movement rate to be lower during nights with noise compared to nights without noise, especially during medium noise trials. Within the noise trials, the head movement rates were similar on nights with and without noise pollution; within the control trials, the head movement rates were similar across nights (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="table-2" href="#table-2">Table 2</a>A: Time effects; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" href="#fig-1">Fig. 1</a>). The results were qualitatively similar when the medium and noise trials were pooled. There was no change in body mass within trials with respect to whether the birds were exposed to artificial noise pollution or not (F
  <sub>2,24</sub> = 1.29, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.29).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The amount of time that predators spent near the experimental area varied depending on trial type, the interaction between trial type and trial night, wind speed, and temperature but not trial night, precipitation, or moon illumination (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="table-1" href="#table-1">Table 1</a>B). Predators spent more time near the experimental area during control versus noise trials (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" href="#fig-2">Fig. 2</a>), when the wind speed was low, and the temperature was high. They also spent more time near the experimental area during control trials compared to noise trials during nights when the noise was broadcast in noise trials (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="table-2" href="#table-2">Table 2</a>B: treatment effects). Within the noise trials and within the control trials, the amount of time that predators spent near the experimental area did not vary (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="table-2" href="#table-2">Table 2</a>B: time effects). The amount of time that non-predators were near the experimental area was only impacted by the temperature; the other variables were not significant (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="table-1" href="#table-1">Table 1</a>C). Non-predators spent more time near the experimental area when the temperature was high.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Peahens ascended to the roost later in the evening when the temperature was higher; the other independent variables did not affect when the birds ascended to the roost (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="table-1" href="#table-1">Table 1</a>D). Peahens descended from the roost later in the morning during control trials compared to noise trials (control: 24.3 ± 7.8 min after sunrise; medium noise: 16.9 ± 7.5 min after sunrise; loud noise: 12.2 ± 6.5 min after sunrise) and when their tarsus + metatarsus was longer; the other independent variables were not significant predictors of the time when the peahens descended from the roost (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="table-1" href="#table-1">Table 1</a>E). Peahens did not exhibit a preference for roosting closer or further from artificial noise (medium noise: 60% of the birds roosted away from the noise, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.50; loud noise: 55% of the birds roosted away from the noise, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.82; two-tailed binomial test). The type of noise (medium or loud), wind speed, temperature, moon illumination, mass, and tarsus + metatarsus did not impact whether the peahens roosted near or far from the noise (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="table-1" href="#table-1">Table 1</a>F).
