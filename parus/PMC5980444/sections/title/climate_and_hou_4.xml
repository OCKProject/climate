 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We obtained climate data collected in the United States between 1924 and 2016 using the R package “RFc” (Grechka et al., 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0038">2016</a>). We extracted our climate data from the CRU CL 2.0, CESM1‐BGC CMIP5 rcp85, and WorldClim 1.4 current datasets (Arora et al., 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0005">2013</a>; Hijmans, Cameron, Parra, Jones, &amp; Jarvis, 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0045">2005</a>; New, Lister, Hulme, &amp; Makin, 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0058">2002</a>). Climate variables represent monthly averages at each location. All climatic variables were z‐standardized to allow for easier interpretation of the coefficient estimates.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We calculated average air maximum and minimum temperature and relative humidity data for 30 years prior to collection at each location. These data represented the climate normal of a given geographical area. We also calculated climate variables for 4 years prior to specimen collection date at each location to represent the approximate generation time of northern cardinals. This approximate generation time was derived from

  <span class="italic">a</span> is age at normal breeding maturity for females and

  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0070">2005</a>). Age at maturation for females was 1 year (Halkin &amp; Linville, 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0043">1999</a>; Richmond, 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0065">1978</a>). We used an adult survival rate estimated by the Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) program using transient Cormack–Jolly–Seber models (Desante, Kaschube, &amp; Saracco, 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0022">2015</a>; MAPS 2016).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used housing density data for the United States between 1940 and 2016 obtained from US census data aggregated at the partial block level (Hammer, Stewart, Winkler, Radeloff, &amp; Voss, 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0044">2004</a>). Partial blocks are mapping units intermediate in scale between census block groups and block groups. As these data are a product of the US census, they provide decadal estimates of housing density. Therefore, we created 30‐year normal of housing density to match the climate data. Housing density served as a proxy both for the urban heat island microclimate and for the presence of supplemental seed. We used mean housing density estimated at a given specimen's coordinate.
