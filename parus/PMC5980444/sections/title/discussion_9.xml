 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Species and populations coping with a rapidly changing climate are capable of significant microevolutionary adjustments ranging from shrinking body sizes (Caruso, Sears, Adams, &amp; Lips, 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0015">2014</a>) to reductions in melanism (De Jong &amp; Brakefield, 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0021">1998</a>). In this study, we provided a unique biogeographic test of Allen's rule during a period of rapid environmental change. Our findings support past evidence of larger bills in drier environments (Campbell‐Tennant et al., 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0014">2015</a>; Danner et al., 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0020">2017</a>). Over an 85‐year period, cardinal bill size increased with warming temperatures in two of three geographic subregions, but only for females. Additionally, the relationship between bill size and housing density was complex. Females inhabiting highly developed areas of Chicago had smaller bills than those inhabiting the periphery of the city, while females in developed areas of Washington, D.C., had larger bill sizes.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Northern cardinals inhabit a broad swath of North America and must adapt to a wide range of temperature and aridity. We found strong support that cardinals occupying drier regions had bigger bills, but this pattern was strongest in males. These results suggest that bill size is a flexible trait important for water conservation and represents a climate–morphological relationship that varies between the sexes (Danner et al., 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0020">2017</a>; Greenberg, Cadena et al., 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0039">2012</a>). A possible reason for this sex‐based difference is that males sing for extensive periods, often on exposed branches, expending energy and water while maintaining territories during breeding (Conner et al., 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0017">1986</a>; Richmond, 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0065">1978</a>; Vondrasek, 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0082" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0082">2006</a>). This behavior could invoke thermoregulatory costs due to increased exposure to ambient humidity and temperature. Activities such as singing can lead to increased respiratory water loss, and birds with larger bills can potentially offset these costs by emitting dry heat (Greenberg, Cadena et al., 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0039">2012</a>). Our geographic analysis suggests pronounced differences in the strength of the relationship between bill size and temperature in arid regions (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34038-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34038-fig-0003">3</a>), providing additional support that bills are a key feature for heat exchange and water control (Danner et al., 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0020">2017</a>; Noakes, Wolf, &amp; McKechnie, 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0059">2016</a>; Smith, O'Neill, Gerson, &amp; Wolf, 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0076">2015</a>; Van de Ven et al., 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0081">2016</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cardinals inhabiting warmer climates had a weaker relationship with relative humidity than those living in cooler climates, although this relationship varied over space (Figures 
  <a rid="ece34038-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34038-fig-0002">2</a> and 
  <a rid="ece34038-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34038-fig-0003">3</a>). Previous work on the effects of these two climate factors on bill size supports these results. The internal conchae structures of bird bills are critical for mediating water evaporation and are significantly larger in song sparrow subspecies occupying arid regions (Danner et al., 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0020">2017</a>; Luther &amp; Danner, 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0052">2016</a>). A study conducted on Australian passerines found that the positive interaction of humidity and maximum temperature promoted larger bill sizes (Gardner et al., 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0033">2016</a>). We found a geographically complex relationship between bill size and humidity that varies from the northeastern United States to the southwestern United States. In areas characterized by high temperatures, such as the southeastern United States, bill sizes were relatively large in areas with high humidity, whereas in cooler areas such as the northeastern United States, the interaction between humidity and temperature was weak (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34038-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34038-fig-0003">3</a>). While we predicted cardinals would have larger bills in arid environments to mitigate evaporative water loss, selection pressures may also exist in regions of high humidity to maximize dry heat exchange because evaporative cooling is less efficient in saturated environments (Powers, 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0062">1992</a>). With predicted shifts in precipitation and humidity across the southern United States (Easterling et al., 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0025">2000</a>; IPCC, 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0046">2014</a>), climate change may cause variable shifts in bill sizes throughout the northern cardinal range.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We predicted that increasing temperatures over time would promote larger bill sizes for resident populations in our three subregions. Bill sizes did not demonstrate significant changes over time, but female cardinals exhibited a strong positive relationship with increasing temperatures in two subregions. Female bill size increased at a rate of 9 mm
  <span class="sup">2</span>/°C in Washington, D.C., and 15 mm
  <span class="sup">2</span>/°C in Ithaca (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34038-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34038-fig-0004">4</a>). Microevolutionary changes can occur over relatively short periods of time (e.g., decades) (De Jong &amp; Brakefield, 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0021">1998</a>; Réale et al. 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0400" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0400">2003</a>) and at different rates between sexes (Evans &amp; Gustafsson, 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0026">2017</a>). Changes in morphological features between sexes may be indicative of sexual selection. A study conducted in Gotland, Sweden, found a decrease in the white‐feathered forehead patch size of male collared flycatchers (
  <span class="italic">Ficedula albicollis</span>) due to lessened breeding site density and competition due to warming spring temperatures (Evans &amp; Gustafsson, 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0026">2017</a>). Although our findings point to the importance of sexual dimorphism in climate–morphological relationships, future research is needed to further identify the mechanisms underlying these sex‐specific relationships. We may be underestimating the relationships presented between bill size and climate per Allen's rule because we used tarsus length as our proxy to control for skeletal body size. It is possible that tarsus length in northern cardinals may follow Allen's rule (Nudds &amp; Oswald, 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0060">2007</a>; Symonds &amp; Tattersall, 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0077">2010</a>) or be confounded by other natural history characteristics such as foraging behavior (Aldrich 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0200" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0200">1984</a>). Additionally, the limited sample sizes available in the temporal analysis may have influenced our ability to identify significant relationships between bill size and environmental parameters. Consequently, although we found support for increasing bill sizes associated with warming temperatures, future longitudinal studies are needed to explore the consistency of these relationships for different species and regions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The complexity of the relationship between climate and bill size may result from competing influences of urbanization which may act to dampen biogeographic processes (Faurby &amp; Araújo, 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0027">2016</a>). The northern cardinal is a synanthropic species commonly found in urban and suburban areas (Leston &amp; Rodewald, 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0051">2006</a>; Rodewald &amp; Shustack, 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0067">2008</a>). With increased use of urban areas and supplemental food, resource availability may be as important a driver of bill size variability as climate. Cardinals are not considered diet specialists, but feed on multiple resources including seed, fruit, and insects (Wilman et al., 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0083">2014</a>), which are available across their range. Seminal work on the role of seed size availability and changes in bill size in Galapagos finches clearly exhibit the relationship between resource availability and natural selection (Boag &amp; Grant, 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0011">1981</a>, 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0012">1984</a>; Grant &amp; Grant, 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0036">2002</a>), but these relationships were ultimately mediated by climate and extreme weather events (e.g., drought) (Grant et al., 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0037">2017</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the increasing popularity of backyard bird feeding (Robb et al., 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0066">2008</a>) and the urban heat island effect, we predicted bill size to increase with housing density. This relationship was not supported over geographic scales, and although we found that female bill size increased with increasing housing density in Washington, D.C., bill size decreased significantly with housing density in Chicago, and we found no relationship with in Ithaca, NY Potential reasons for this pattern are that housing density may not be an adequate proxy for the prevalence of bird feeders and there may be additional aspects of the urban environment (e.g., noise and light pollution) that may influence selection pressures on bill size. Variation in housing density captures strong and complex environmental changes across urban to rural land use gradients, and it is possible that supplemental feeding is most prominent in areas with lower housing density. This may lead to a negative relationship between bill size and housing density should supplementary feeding be more common in suburban and rural areas as opposed to highly urban areas. Alternatively, urban areas are warmer due to the UHI, and as per Allen's rule, it is possible that these warmer conditions promote larger bills. Although cardinal bill sizes had a positive relationship with housing density in Washington, D.C., we found the opposite pattern for Chicago. It is possible that the contrasting results found for Chicago were due to differences in local climatology or higher frequency of cold extremes in Chicago that could counteract the warming effects of the UHI. We chose these cities as large metropolitan areas with well‐established northern Cardinal populations and an adequate sample size of museum specimens over time. The differences between the three cities point to the complexity of the relationship between morphological adaptations and rapidly urbanizing environments. Further research will be necessary to better understand how anthropogenic change influences species in an increasingly urbanized world.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study elucidates the complexity and challenges of exploring the predictions of biogeographic rules, such as Allen's rule, during a time of rapid environmental change. Cardinal bill sizes were larger in more arid environments and generally increased with warming temperatures. These relationships, however, were complicated by sex‐specific differences and the role of urbanization. As human‐induced climate and land use change continue, northern cardinals and other bird species will experience novel conditions. Northern cardinal ranges will likely continue to expand northward and occupy novel urban areas where unique selection pressures will influence morphology over time (Scheffers et al., 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0071">2016</a>). While climate and land use change are often described as extinction drivers (Jetz, Wilcove, &amp; Dobson, 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0047">2007</a>; Møller, Rubolini, &amp; Lehikoinen, 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0056">2008</a>; Selwood, McGeoch, &amp; Mac Nally, 
  <a rid="ece34038-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34038-bib-0073">2014</a>), species may respond to anthropogenic drivers through microevolutionary changes in line with the predictions of biogeographical principles such as Allen's rule.
