  <p>Maps of the resulting coefficients from the geographically weighted regression analysis of (a) bill size as a function of relative humidity, and (b) bill size as a function of average minimum temperature × relative humidity for all birds. Each circle represents the statistical relationship between bill size and the independent climate variable estimated for an individual point or bird. Red circles represent positive coefficients, and blue circles represent negative coefficients</p>
