 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We examined a total of 203 individuals from 32 localities within the breeding range of 
  <span class="italic">A. c. talifuensis–concinnus</span> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029329-g001" href="#pone-0029329-g001">Fig. 1</a>). Total genomic DNA was extracted from blood or tissue samples using the QIAGEN DNeasy Tissue kit following the manufacturer's instructions. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), Cytochrome b (
  <span class="italic">cyt b</span>) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2) genes. As described in 
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Sorenson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Sorenson1">[33]</a>, the primers H7956 and L6615 were used to amplify COI, and H6313 and L5219 for ND2. PCR reactions were run using the following parameters: denaturation at 94°C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles at 93°C for 1 min, 46°C for COI and 53°C for ND2 for 45 s, and 72°C for 2 min, and a final 8 min at 72°C. The primers and amplification conditions used for cytochrome b were as described in

   <p>Circles and associated letters indicate sample sizes and sampling localities. Each color represents a lineage. PZH includes populations in Panzhihua, Miyi, Yanbian and Yanyuan Counties and LC includes populations in Gengma, Shuangjiang and Yunxian Counties. The distribution of subspecies is based on that in Chinese Fauna Sinica

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each round of PCR reactions also included one negative control to check for contamination. The PCR products were purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN) and sequenced on a Perkin-Elmer 377 semiautomated DNA sequencer (Applied BioSystems) using a Perkin-Elmer Prism terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied BioSystems) with Ampli Taq FS polymerase and BigDye terminators. Both strands of each PCR product were sequenced. Complete sequences were assembled using Seqman II (DNASTAR). Sequences were compared visually to the original chromatograms to avoid reading errors. All sequences are accessible at GenBank under the accession No. HQ605086 - HQ605288 for COI, No. HQ605289 - HQ605491 for 
  <span class="italic">cyt b</span> and No. HQ605492 - HQ605694 for ND2.
