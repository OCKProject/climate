  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies suggested that there was no genetic divergence within 
   <span class="italic">A. c. concinnus</span>-
   <span class="italic">talifuensis</span>
   <a rid="pone.0029329-Eck1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Eck1">[28]</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0029329-Pckert1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Pckert1">[29]</a>. In contrast, we found significant genetic divergence in this group, despite its current continuous distribution. Both phylogenetic inferences and haplotype network analyses revealed the existence of three distinct evolutionary lineages in 
   <span class="italic">A. c. concinnus</span>-
   <span class="italic">talifuensis</span>. Node support for each lineage is high and missteps in haplotype network connections are large, especially between lineages A and B–C (up to 141 steps). Furthermore, analysis of molecular variance partitioned data into three phylogroups with clearly defined geographical population structures. We noticed that the sampling sites of specimens for 
   <span class="italic">A. c. talifuensis</span> analyzed by the previous studies were located in the area of lineage C. Thus, we compared the genetic distance (cyt b, p-distance) for a specimen of lineage A (
   <span class="italic">A. c. talifuensis</span>) with other two subspecies specimens (
   <span class="italic">A. c. manipurensis</span> and 
   <span class="italic">A. c. iredalei</span>) which are available at GenBank (Accessions: HM185382, GU244428, GU244426). The genetic distance was 4.9% between 
   <span class="italic">A. c. talifuensis</span> and 
   <span class="italic">A. c. manipurensis</span> and 5.1% between 
   <span class="italic">A. c. talifuensis</span> and 
   <span class="italic">A. c. iredalei</span>. These results suggest that the black-throated tit displays high genetic differentiation and zones of lineage endemism even within the Chinese part of its range.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The significant values for Tajima's D and Fu's 
   <span class="italic">Fs</span> statistical tests and the unimodal mismatch distribution suggest that lineage C has undergone a past population expansion. For lineage A and lineage B, however, values of statistical tests (significantly negative or negative) and mismatch distributions (multimodal but not significant values of goodness-of-fit tests) were not consistent with each other well. The coalescent-based method, which incorporates information from the genealogical tree structure of DNA sequences, seemed to be a more effective way of estimating demographic processes. Bayesian skyline plots indicate different population dynamics among lineages; a relatively constant population size in lineage A, a past population reduction and recent slight increase in lineage B, and successive population expansions in lineage C. Although BSP confidence intervals for lineage B were large, they are all supported by the ENMs. ENMs indicate that the amount of suitable habitat available was constant for lineage A, very limited range for lineage B during both the LIG and LGM, and a reduced distribution for lineage C during LIG.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climatic changes and lineage divergence</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The genetic distances (cyt b, p-distance) between lineages (of 4.8% between lineages A and B and 4.9% between lineages A and C) indicate relatively clear genetic separation between these lineages. However, the reasons for this are not clear and there is no obvious geographic barrier to dispersal in the current distribution. Marked genetic divergence within continuous habitat generally could be due to a cryptic barrier, or be a relic of a now absent historical barrier. Recently, the uplift of the Tibetan plateau has been hypothesized to induce phylogeographic breaks within or among species both on and outside the plateau in Southeast Asia 
   <a rid="pone.0029329-Song1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Song1">[23]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0029329-Yang1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Yang1">[63]</a>. The uplift of Tibetan plateau had profound effects on the geological environment of the Plateau and adjacent areas 
   <a rid="pone.0029329-Cheng1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Cheng1">[21]</a> and may have promoted the habitat fragmentation of species. However, reconstructing the paleo-vegetation in western Yunnan suggested that Late Pliocene vegetational patterns were similar to those of the present and that the Hengduan Mountains had approached their highest elevation before the Late Pliocene 
   <a rid="pone.0029329-Sun1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Sun1">[64]</a>. These findings suggest that the habitat of the black-throated tit may already have existed in the Late Pliocene. Considering that lineage A and the common ancestor of lineages B and C diverged at the estimation of about 2.4 Ma (95% CI: 4.29 − 0.88 Ma), and lineages A and B currently co-distributed in the Yulong Snow-Mountain of the Hengduan Mountains, the genetic split of black-throated tit was unlikely to be shaped by the uplift of Tibetan plateau.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alternatively, our molecular dating and ENMs reconstructions strongly suggest that Pleistocene climatic oscillations were more likely the reasons for the divergence between lineage A and lineages B–C. Our ENMs reconstructed for LIG and LGM, especially for LIG, show that the present contact zone among those lineages was relatively unsuitable. The predictive fragmented habitats would indicate the major refuges for the ancestors of those extant lineages. Therefore, climatic oscillations had real impact on the distribution of the black-throated tit. As the starting point of diversification is given right at the Pliocene/Pleistocene with 2.4 Ma, this separation was very likely under some Pleistocene impact at least with respect to the first cooling event. Given the fact that the ENMs simulations represent just the final phase of a series of repeated glacial cycles and fragmentation events, there were surely multiple effects of population decrease and expansion during the total time frame of lineage divergence. Thus, it was likely that climatic oscillations had caused the divergence between lineages A and B–C.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Southeast Asia had experienced several climatic oscillations during the last 0.4 million years 
   <a rid="pone.0029329-Hope1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Hope1">[65]</a>. It has been suggested that these climatic oscillations were major factors in the isolation of lineages in many species 
   <a rid="pone.0029329-Song1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Song1">[23]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0029329-Li1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Li1">[24]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0029329-Fuchs1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Fuchs1">[66]</a>. For instance, it has been hypothesized that the expansion of the Fagaceae forest type following climatic cooling about 0.35 Ma restricted the various lineages of the white-browed piculet (
   <span class="italic">Sasia ochracea</span>) to mountainous refugia resulting in increased genetic differentiation 
   <a rid="pone.0029329-Fuchs1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Fuchs1">[66]</a>. Similarly, since the estimated divergence time between lineages B and C was 0.32 Ma (95% CI: 0.76 − 0.23 Ma), we think it likely that climate-driven habitat fragmentation was the cause of divergence between lineage B and lineage C.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Last Glacial Maximum of Pleistocene climatic oscillations (0.021−0.018 Ma) had a profound impact on species' distribution and population sizes, e.g. in the heavy ice sheets covering northern regions of Europe and North America

   <a rid="pone.0029329-Fedorov1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Fedorov1">[67]</a>. In contrast, our results show that LGM had little impact on the geographic distribution of 
   <span class="italic">A. c. talifuensis–concinnus.</span> This conclusion is supported by both the ENMs and phylogeographic analyses. For instance, the ENMs suggest that there has been suitable environment for lineage A in Yunnan since the LIG. This result, combined with the constant population suggested by Bayesian skyline analyses, indicates that LGM may have had little impacts on this lineage. For lineage C, Bayesian skyline and mismatch analyses detect a strong signal of a recent population expansion across most of this lineage's current range. However, because the ENMs suggest that a similar geographic range as the present during the LGM and much of its LGM habitat was uninhabitable during the LIG, and the genetic data suggest that the range of this lineage expanded before the LGM (about 0.07 Ma), we think that LGM effects were limited. This is also true for lineage B, as our result showed that this lineage has a more restricted distribution during LGM than it does at present but more suitable habitat than it had during LIG. However, the significant genetic divergence between the western (PZH and JZS) and other populations within lineage C suggests that small refugia may have existed. Similar results were found in a phylogeographic study of the canopy tree 
   <span class="italic">Eurycorymbus cavaleriei</span>
   <a rid="pone.0029329-Wang2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Wang2">[68]</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In fact, our reconstructions of LGM distribution are much congruent with previous phylogeographic studies

These studies suggested the existence of multiple refugia, but species all showed population expansion before the LGM. Our ENMs and molecular data support that East China was not subjected to significant glacial advances 
   <a rid="pone.0029329-Williams1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Williams1">[71]</a>, at least with respect to the period of LGM. Unexpectedly, our ENMs results provide a distinct perspective for the climatic impact of LIG. However, this conclusion requires evaluation in other taxa with different life-history traits and biology.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Contact zone and the refuge theory</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Contact zones generally refer to the sympatric areas of closely related species which have their own separated primary distributions. Contact zones are important to understand the process of speciation, dispersal and vicariance. It is known that many closely related species pairs of birds are distributed in parapatry or allopatry with narrow contact zones 
   <a rid="pone.0029329-Haffer1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Haffer1">[72]</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0029329-Aliabadian1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Aliabadian1">[74]</a>. In this study, we found a narrowly circumscribed intraspecific contact zone whereby lineage B was parapatrically distributed with each of the two related lineages in LJ and PZH respectively.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A plethora of hypotheses have been suggested to explain the cause of contact zones, such as the refuge, river refuge and disturbance-vicariance hypotheses 
   <a rid="pone.0029329-Haffer2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Haffer2">[73]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0029329-Haffer3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Haffer3">[75]</a>. Among these, the refuge theory of Haffer 
   <a rid="pone.0029329-Haffer2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Haffer2">[73]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0029329-Haffer3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Haffer3">[75]</a> argued that the contractions and expansions of species range influenced by the climatic fluctuation would establish secondary contact zones. Our ENMs reconstructions support this theory. As can be seen in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029329-g004" href="#pone-0029329-g004">Fig. 4</a>, the contact zone was projected as unsuitable for the black-throated tit during LIG and LGM though the present ENMs showed that the habit was suitable. The present parapatry of these lineages could be the result of the recent expansions in the range of lineages B and C indicated by the BSP analysis into the present suitable environment. In addition, several species or species group have differentiated in a similar way of the black-throated tit, such as 
   <span class="italic">Seicercus affinis</span>
