A good and strong fit between the model and data is suggested by the high values of AUC (0.95 for GARP and 0.947 for MAXENT respectively), and the high coincidence between the projected distributions and collection records.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All modeled distributions suggest that there has been suitable habitat for the black-throated tit in Yunnan since the LIG. The species' predicted present geographic range indicates large areas of suitable habitat in south-western and southern China (

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029329.s002" href="#pone.0029329.s002">Figure S1a</a>). Modelling suggests that this bird is absent from Hainan Island, southern Guangxi and southern Guangdong provinces. This is confirmed by our field and other observational records (

However, GARP model reconstructions fail to project Taiwan as a suitable habit, possibly because of a lack of data. The ENMs suggest that the black-throated tit had distribution similar to the present during LGM (

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029329.s002" href="#pone.0029329.s002">Figure S1b</a>). The species' entire potential range and preferred habitat were only slightly reduced. However, projections for LIG are unexpected. The modeled distributions indicate a substantial reduction in range, with almost no suitable habitats predicted in the center and north of the current distribution (

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029329.s002" href="#pone.0029329.s002">Figure S1c</a>). During this period the species' range appears to have been restricted to Yunnan, southern Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Guangdong and Fujian provinces.
