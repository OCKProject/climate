 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The genetic distances (cyt b, p-distance) between lineages (of 4.8% between lineages A and B and 4.9% between lineages A and C) indicate relatively clear genetic separation between these lineages. However, the reasons for this are not clear and there is no obvious geographic barrier to dispersal in the current distribution. Marked genetic divergence within continuous habitat generally could be due to a cryptic barrier, or be a relic of a now absent historical barrier. Recently, the uplift of the Tibetan plateau has been hypothesized to induce phylogeographic breaks within or among species both on and outside the plateau in Southeast Asia

  <a rid="pone.0029329-Yang1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Yang1">[63]</a>. The uplift of Tibetan plateau had profound effects on the geological environment of the Plateau and adjacent areas 
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Cheng1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Cheng1">[21]</a> and may have promoted the habitat fragmentation of species. However, reconstructing the paleo-vegetation in western Yunnan suggested that Late Pliocene vegetational patterns were similar to those of the present and that the Hengduan Mountains had approached their highest elevation before the Late Pliocene 
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Sun1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Sun1">[64]</a>. These findings suggest that the habitat of the black-throated tit may already have existed in the Late Pliocene. Considering that lineage A and the common ancestor of lineages B and C diverged at the estimation of about 2.4 Ma (95% CI: 4.29 − 0.88 Ma), and lineages A and B currently co-distributed in the Yulong Snow-Mountain of the Hengduan Mountains, the genetic split of black-throated tit was unlikely to be shaped by the uplift of Tibetan plateau.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alternatively, our molecular dating and ENMs reconstructions strongly suggest that Pleistocene climatic oscillations were more likely the reasons for the divergence between lineage A and lineages B–C. Our ENMs reconstructed for LIG and LGM, especially for LIG, show that the present contact zone among those lineages was relatively unsuitable. The predictive fragmented habitats would indicate the major refuges for the ancestors of those extant lineages. Therefore, climatic oscillations had real impact on the distribution of the black-throated tit. As the starting point of diversification is given right at the Pliocene/Pleistocene with 2.4 Ma, this separation was very likely under some Pleistocene impact at least with respect to the first cooling event. Given the fact that the ENMs simulations represent just the final phase of a series of repeated glacial cycles and fragmentation events, there were surely multiple effects of population decrease and expansion during the total time frame of lineage divergence. Thus, it was likely that climatic oscillations had caused the divergence between lineages A and B–C.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Southeast Asia had experienced several climatic oscillations during the last 0.4 million years 
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Hope1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Hope1">[65]</a>. It has been suggested that these climatic oscillations were major factors in the isolation of lineages in many species 
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Song1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Song1">[23]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Li1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Li1">[24]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Fuchs1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Fuchs1">[66]</a>. For instance, it has been hypothesized that the expansion of the Fagaceae forest type following climatic cooling about 0.35 Ma restricted the various lineages of the white-browed piculet (
  <span class="italic">Sasia ochracea</span>) to mountainous refugia resulting in increased genetic differentiation 
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Fuchs1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Fuchs1">[66]</a>. Similarly, since the estimated divergence time between lineages B and C was 0.32 Ma (95% CI: 0.76 − 0.23 Ma), we think it likely that climate-driven habitat fragmentation was the cause of divergence between lineage B and lineage C.
