  <span class="italic">cyt b</span> and ND2 were aligned using ClustalW as implemented in MEGA 4 
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Tamura1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Tamura1">[35]</a>. Since all fragments belong to the same DNA molecule, all subsequent analyses were performed with three sequences per individual concatenated in three partitions: COI from nucleotide 1–1227, 
  <span class="italic">cyt b</span> from nucleotide 1228–2211 and ND2 from nucleotide 2212–3192. The number of segregating sites, haplotype diversity and nucleotide diversity for each population and all populations combined were estimated using DnaSP 5.0
