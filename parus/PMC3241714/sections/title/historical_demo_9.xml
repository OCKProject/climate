 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three commonly used methods were applied to explore the demographical history of 
  <span class="italic">A. c. talifuensis–concinnus</span>. First, statistical tests designed to assess whether nucleotide polymorphisms deviated from expectations under neutral theory [Tajima's D 
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Tajima1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Tajima1">[47]</a> and Fu's 
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Fu1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Fu1">[48]</a>
  <span class="italic">F
   <sub>S</sub>
  </span>] were carried out in ARLEQUIN 3.1.2. Significance of D and 
  <span class="italic">F
   <sub>S</sub>
  </span> values were determined using 1000 simulated samples to produce an expected distribution under selective neutrality and population equilibrium. The cut-off level for statistical significance was 0.05. For Fu's 
  <span class="italic">F
   <sub>S</sub>
  </span>, significance at the 0.05 level was indicated when P values were &lt;0.02

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, the program ARLEQUIN 3.1.2 was used to compare the observed frequency distribution of pairwise nucleotide differences among haplotypes with that expected from a population under expansion (Mismatch distribution analysis). For populations which have undergone historical expansions, plots of the distribution of pairwise differences among haplotypes are expected to be unimodal, whereas populations in equilibrium generally show multimodal distributions 
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Harpending1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Harpending1">[49]</a>. Parametric bootstrapping was used to test the goodness-of-fit between the observed mismatch and sudden expansion model, and to obtain confidence intervals 
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Schneider1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Schneider1">[50]</a>. The timing of population expansion was estimated by the mode (
  <span class="italic">τ</span>) of the mismatch distribution expressed in units of mutational time as 
  <span class="italic">t = τ</span>/2
  <span class="italic">u</span>
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Rogers1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Rogers1">[51]</a>, where 
  <span class="italic">t</span> is the expansion time in number of generations and 
  <span class="italic">u</span> is the mutation rate per generation for the whole sequence.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Third, past population dynamics were examined using Bayesian skyline plots (BSP) in the program BEAST 1.4.8 
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Drummond1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Drummond1">[52]</a>. This genealogical method utilizes MCMC sampling of sequence data to estimate a posterior distribution of effective population size through time and does not require a specified demographic model (e.g. constant size, exponential growth, logistic growth, or expansive growth) prior to the analysis. Bayesian skyline analyses were run under the conditions of the SRD06 model (four gamma categories), which has been found to provide a better fit for protein-coding nucleotide data. The mutation rate was the same as that used in the MDIV analyses. The number of grouped intervals (m) was set to five for lineages A and B because of the small number of sequences. For lineage C, m was set to ten. Five million iterations of the MCMC chains were run and sampled every 1000 iterations with the first 500,000 chains discarded as burnin. Bayesian skyline plots were generated with TRACER version 1.2.1
