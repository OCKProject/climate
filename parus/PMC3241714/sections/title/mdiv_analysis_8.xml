 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the coalescent-based program MDIV 
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Nielsen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Nielsen1">[44]</a> to determine the divergences between major lineages. MDIV uses a Bayesian approach to simultaneously approximate the posterior distribution of three parameters: divergence time between populations (
  <span class="italic">T = t
   <sub>div</sub>
  </span>/2
  <span class="italic">N
   <sub>e</sub>
  </span>), the migration rate between populations since divergence (
  <span class="italic">M</span> = 2
  <span class="italic">N
   <sub>e</sub>m
  </span>), and the population parameter theta (θ = 2
  <span class="italic">N
   <sub>e</sub>
  </span>µ, where µ is the per locus mutation rate). The program was first run using default search settings and priors (for theta and divergence time). Following this data exploration, we set our prior for 
  <span class="italic">T</span> and M to 5. Analyses were run for 5 million generations following a burn-in period of 500,000 generations, and repeated three times to ensure convergence upon the same posterior distributions for each of the parameter estimates. Because direct rate estimates for the concentrated sequence were not available, estimates of 
  <span class="italic">T</span> were converted to real time assuming a neutral mutation rate of 1.05×10
  <span class="sup">−8</span> substitutions/site/year according to the recent studies 
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Pckert2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Pckert2">[45]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Weir3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Weir3">[46]</a>. These rates were multiplied by the number of sequenced nucleotides to obtain our estimate of µ for the conversions. Divergence time estimates are intended only to give a general idea of the timescale of diversification; as with any such molecular clock estimates, they should be interpreted with caution. We used the formula
