 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used unrooted networks to explore the phylogeographic structure of 
  <span class="italic">A. c. talifuensisâ€“concinnus</span> because many of the underlying assumptions of traditional tree-building methods (e.g. fully bifurcating trees, complete lineage sorting) are often violated in intraspecific studies 
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Posada1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Posada1">[41]</a>. The major-joining network was constructed with program NETWORK 4.5 
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Bandelt1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Bandelt1">[42]</a>. An analysis of molecular variance was performed using ARLEQUIN 3.1.2 
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Excoffier1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Excoffier1">[43]</a> to test the segregation of individuals according to the haplotype clusters indicated in the phylogenetic tree. Significance levels were determined by conducting nonparametric procedures 1000 times. In addition, because of the large number of samplings of lineage C, pairwise population differentiation was estimated by computing pairwise 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>ST</sub>. Genetic distance and pairwise number of nucleotide differences were used to calculate the pairwise 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>ST</sub>. A permutation test was used to calculate the probability that two populations had no genetic differentiation. For both tests, the significant level was set to 0.01.
