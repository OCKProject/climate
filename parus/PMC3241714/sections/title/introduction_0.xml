 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phylogeographic analysis is a powerful way of gaining insights into the historical processes that have shaped current species distribution and genetic variation 
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Avise1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Avise1">[1]</a>. Combined analysis of geographical and genealogical information has revealed that Pleistocene glacial cycles and climate changes had profound impacts on species' distribution patterns and population diversity 
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Hewitt1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Hewitt1">[2]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Hewitt4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Hewitt4">[5]</a>. For instance, species inhabiting high-latitude regions of Europe and North America, which had been covered by the heavy ice sheets usually have shallow genetic divergences and low genetic diversity, whereas species living in the temperate refugial areas of these regions generally have deep divergences and higher genetic diversity 
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Zink1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Zink1">[6]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Weir2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Weir2">[9]</a>. Ecological data can complement phylogeographic research by providing information on species' origin, evolutionary history and present distribution. One way to use these ecological data is in ecological niche models (ENMs), which use collection localities and Geographic Information System (GIS) maps of ecological data to develop spatial predictions of a species' historical and current range 
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Hugall1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Hugall1">[10]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Richards1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Richards1">[11]</a>. This approach has been somewhat controversial because it assumes that information on the distribution of ancestral species at the time of speciation can be deduced from the current distribution of their descendent species 
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Peterson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Peterson1">[12]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0029329-MartnezMeyer2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-MartnezMeyer2">[14]</a>. Nonetheless, integrating phylogeographic and ecological analysis has become more common in recent years, and this approach has provided new insights on speciation and species' distribution

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">South-western and southern China is one of the most species-rich regions in the world. This region ranges from an elevation of more than 2000 m on the Yunnan-Guizhou (Yungui) plateau to the medium and low mountains (lower than 1800 m) areas of East China. Many theories have been proposed to explain its extraordinary number of species. For instance, this area may have served as a refugium during the Pleistocene glaciations 
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Wang1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Wang1">[18]</a> or as the center of speciation 
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Lei1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Lei1">[19]</a>. Zhang 
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Zhang1">[20]</a> suggested that this region was not glaciated throughout the Quaternary period. However, even in the absence of ice sheets, the habitats in this region are believed to have been much affected by the climatic oscillations as well as the uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau 
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Cheng1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Cheng1">[21]</a>. These major climatic and geographical events are likely to have profoundly affected the distributions, and consequently the population dynamics, of many species. Previous studies on the avifauna of this region have highlighted genetic differentiation, unusual historical demography and the existence of multiple refugia during the glacial periods 
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Zou1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Zou1">[22]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Huang1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Huang1">[25]</a>. Although these studies have assessed the effects of geological and climatic changes on species distributions in East Asian, we still have limited knowledge of how these changes have impacted avian species in south-western and southern China. Improving our understanding of this is important for estimating the global effects of Pleistocene climate variations, for predicting future climate change impacts and for setting priorities for conservation and management 
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Hampe1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Hampe1">[26]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0029329-DinizFilho1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-DinizFilho1">[27]</a>. Obviously, such questions can be best addressed by integrating phylogeographic analysis with ecological niche models because these two kinds of analysis are independent of each other and thus offer independent information.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The black-throated tit 
  <span class="italic">(Aegithalos concinnus)</span> is a wide-spread and small passerine bird that lives in pine and open broadleaf forest, generally at middle altitudes. Its range extends from the foothills of the Himalayas in Pakistan and northern India through large areas of southern China to northern Burma, Vietnam and Taiwan. Currently, six subspecies are recognized; 
  <span class="italic">A. c. concinnus, A. c. talifuensis, A. c. iredalei, A. c. manipurensis, A. c. pulchellus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">A. c. annamensis</span>, some of which differ markedly in plumage pattern and coloration. For instance, 
  <span class="italic">A. c. pulchellus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">A. c. annamensis</span> are gray-headed but the other subspecies are red-headed. Studies have discovered significant genetic divergence among these red crowned subspecies 
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Eck1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Eck1">[28]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Pckert1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Pckert1">[29]</a>. Genetic distances between groups range from 4.3% within the subspecies 
  <span class="italic">A. c. iredalei</span> to 5.4–5.8% between 
  <span class="italic">A. c. iredalei</span> and 
  <span class="italic">A. c. manipurensis</span>, and up to 5.3–5.8% between the latter two subspecies and subspecies 
  <span class="italic">A. c. talifuensis</span>–
  <span class="italic">concinnus</span>
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Pckert1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Pckert1">[29]</a>. Although the phylogeny of the 
  <span class="italic">A. concinnus</span> complex has not been resolved, the monophyly of 
  <span class="italic">A. c. talifuensis–concinnus</span> was strongly supported by the nuclear and MtDNA makers 
  <a rid="pone.0029329-Pckert1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0029329-Pckert1">[29]</a>. These two subspecies occupy the largest part of the species' distribution range, being mainly distributed in south-western and southern China. Races in this group have similar morphology except that the coloration of the crown and chestnut breast band is redder in the nominate subspecies 
  <span class="italic">(A. c. concinnus).</span> However, in our previous survey of the phylogenetic relationships of the long-tailed tits, we discovered substantial genetic differentiation between four black-throated tit specimens, including two 
  <span class="italic">A. c. concinnus</span> and two 
  <span class="italic">A. c. talifuensis</span>
