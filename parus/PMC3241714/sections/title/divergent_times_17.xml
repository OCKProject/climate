 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The estimated divergence time between lineage A and lineage B–C was 1.79 (95% CI: 0.84 – 2.68) coalescence units. Using our estimated mutation rate to convert the MDIV estimate to real time, we estimate a divergence time of approximately 2.4 Ma (95% CI: 4.29 – 0.88 Ma). Lineages B and C were estimated to diverge at 0.29 (95% CI: 0.25 – 0.56) coalescent units, which converted to real time corresponds to 0.32 Ma (95% CI: 0.76 – 0.21 Ma). The migration rate between lineage A and lineage B–C is near zero (95% CI: 0 – 0.44). Estimation of the migration rate between lineage B and lineage C suggests a rather restricted gene flow M = 0.12 (95% CI: 0.03 – 0.91).</p>
