  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The combined length of the obtained sequences (3192 bp) contained 336 polymorphic sites, 235 of which were parsimony informative. These polymorphic sites defined 139 unique haplotypes, 112 of which were observed in a single bird. Two widespread haplotypes were observed and shared by 15 individuals from different sampling sites. For sample sizes larger than four, haplotype diversity values were nearly maximal: from 0.8333 to 1; nucleotide diversity values were between 0.052% and 0.378% (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0029329.s001" href="#pone.0029329.s001">Table S1</a>). Phylogenetic relationship inference identified three lineages (Marked with A, B, C) and the nucleotide diversity for them is 0.326%, 0.145% and 0.179% respectively. Samples collected at site LJ included the haplotypes of lineage A and lineage B, while those collected at PZH included the haplotypes of lineage B and lineage C. These populations all show extremely high values of nucleotide diversity (values not shown).

Using our estimated mutation rate to convert the MDIV estimate to real time, we estimate a divergence time of approximately 2.4 Ma (95% CI: 4.29 – 0.88 Ma). Lineages B and C were estimated to diverge at 0.29 (95% CI: 0.25 – 0.56) coalescent units, which converted to real time corresponds to 0.32 Ma (95% CI: 0.76 – 0.21 Ma). The migration rate between lineage A and lineage B–C is near zero (95% CI: 0 – 0.44). Estimation of the migration rate between lineage B and lineage C suggests a rather restricted gene flow M = 0.12 (95% CI: 0.03 – 0.91).</p>

For mismatch analyses, lineages A and B showed a multimodal distribution profile, but the statistical mismatch distribution test statistics (SSD and rg) were not significant. Plots of the distribution of pairwise differences for lineage C are unimodal (

This distribution type, together with the very small and not statistically significant mismatch distribution test statistics, suggests that this lineage has undergone recent population expansions. Using the same mutation rate for the whole sequence as it was in the MDIV analysis, the expansion time for lineage C was estimated at about 0.07 Ma. Bayesian skyline plots showing the estimated changes in median

Lineage B seems to have experienced a population reduction followed by a recovery at about 0.05 Ma. However, the 95% highest probability density (HPD) intervals on this estimate are very large. Lineage C appears to have undergone population expansions since about 0.075 Ma, after which it entered a period of relative population stability.
