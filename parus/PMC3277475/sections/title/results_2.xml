 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">No parasites causing disease in humans such as 
  <span class="italic">Dirofilaria </span>spp. were detected in about 83,000 mosquitoes tested, which had been collected in 2009 and 2010 in 16 locations throughout Germany. However, minimum infection rates of up to 24 per 1000 mosquitoes were revealed, which could be attributed to mosquito infection with 
  <span class="italic">Setaria tundra </span>and a yet unidentified second parasite. 
  <span class="italic">Setaria tundra </span>was found to be widespread in southern Germany in various mosquito species, except 
  <span class="italic">Culex </span>spp. In contrast, the unidentified filarial species was exclusively found in 
  <span class="italic">Culex </span>spp. in northern Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, and is likely to be a bird parasite.
