 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the yet unidentified filarial species was exclusively found in 
  <span class="italic">Culex </span>mosquitoes, it is not surprising that it was most abundant in those places where mainly 
  <span class="italic">Culex </span>spp. were caught using gravid traps, which were Weinheim and Großsachsen (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1</a>). Only three positive pools originated from the site at Wagbachniederung in 2009. All three sites are located in the north of the state of Baden-Württemberg (see also below).

  <span class="italic">Setaria tundra </span>appears to be more widespread: it was found in various mosquito species in the states of Bavaria, Rhineland-Palatinate and Baden-Württemberg.
