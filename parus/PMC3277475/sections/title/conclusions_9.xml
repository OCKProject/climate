 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study searched for filarial human pathogens in German mosquitoes, for instance 
  <span class="italic">Dirofilaria </span>species. In about 83,000 mosquitoes tested, no filarial DNA sequences were found that matched those known for the two potential targets, i.e. 
  <span class="italic">D. immitis </span>or 
  <span class="italic">D. repens</span>. Hence it remains open whether one or both parasites could be transmitted autochthonously by indigenous mosquitoes. The absence of 
  <span class="italic">Dirofilaria </span>spp. or other zoonotic filariae in our sample allows the conclusion that the risk of autochthonous infection in Germany is still very low, although dirofilariasis is emerging and spreading in Europe [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The generalized filarial PCR primers used in our study allowed the detection of two other species one of which could be unambiguously identified as 
  <span class="italic">Setaria tundra</span>. The other remains unidentified, but is likely a bird parasite.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We do not have any published information regarding human infection with 
  <span class="italic">Setaria tundra </span>or one or the other bird filariae, but it could be possible occasionally since some of the mosquito species found to be infected are known to feed on humans. In this case, infections are likely to be symptomless, given the lack of any case report. In summary, the synergism between entomologists, virologists and parasitologists, combined with state-of-the-art methods allows a very efficient near-real-time monitoring of a wide spectrum of both human and veterinary pathogens, including the discovery of yet unknown or neglected species.
