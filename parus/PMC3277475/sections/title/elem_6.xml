 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 14,522 female mosquitoes were collected in 2009 (Table 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">1</a>). The collections consisted of 
  <span class="italic">Culex </span>spp. (confirmed: 
  <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens </span>and 
  <span class="italic">Cx. torrentium</span>; not confirmed: 
  <span class="italic">Cx. modestus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Cx. territans</span>), 
  <span class="italic">Aedes vexans</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Ae. cinereus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Ochlerotatus cantans</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Oc. sticticus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Culiseta annulata</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Anopheles maculipennis </span>s.l., and 
  <span class="italic">An. claviger</span>. The most abundant species were 
  <span class="italic">Culex </span>spp. (35%), 
  <span class="italic">An. claviger </span>(24%) and the floodwater mosquito 
  <span class="italic">Ae. vexans </span>(20%). The mosquitoes most frequently trapped with the gravid traps (GT) were 
  <span class="italic">Culex </span>spp. (99%), while the total catches in GTs were 4,587, compared with 9,935 specimens trapped with the EVS traps (proportion 1:2.2).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, in the first-round real-time PCRs, 218 super-pools, which had been derived from 666 original pools, were assayed for the presence of filariae. Of the 218 super-pools, 63 (29%) gave filaria-positive results.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of the 63 positive super-pools, all respective original pools (189) were screened by real-time PCR, and 67 (35.4%) were shown to be positive, of which 24 were confirmed by 12S PCR (23 were sequenced). In 17 cases (27%), the second round-PCR did not confirm the positive first-round result.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of 226 
  <span class="italic">Culex </span>spp. pools consisting of 5106 individuals, 44 pools were filaria-positive by real-time PCR, which corresponds to 19.5% positive 
  <span class="italic">Culex </span>spp. pools and a minimum infection rate (MIR: [number of positive pools/total specimens tested] × 1000) of 8.6 per 1000 mosquitoes.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of 369 non-
  <span class="italic">Culex </span>pools (excluding 
  <span class="italic">Culiseta </span>and 
  <span class="italic">An. maculipennis </span>s.l.) consisting of 8538 individuals of 
  <span class="italic">Ae. vexans</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Oc. cantans</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Oc. sticticus </span>and 
  <span class="italic">An. claviger</span>, 23 were filaria-positive, which corresponds to 6% positive pools and a MIR of 2.7. In terms of species, the MIRs were as follows: 
  <span class="italic">Oc. sticticus </span>6.2, 
  <span class="italic">An. claviger </span>2.3, 
  <span class="italic">Ae. vexans </span>1,7. The highest MIR at a single locality was 24.1 at Flotzengrün (Table 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">1</a>), which was entirely due to positive 
  <span class="italic">Ae. vexans </span>pools.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2010, a total of 68,633 female mosquitoes were collected and processed into 2981 pools. In addition to the species caught in 2009, 
  <span class="italic">Oc. annulipes</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Oc. communis</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Oc. punctor</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Oc. rusticus </span>and 
  <span class="italic">An. plumbeus </span>were caught. 
  <span class="italic">Aedes vexans </span>was the dominating species (50%), followed by 
  <span class="italic">Oc. sticticus </span>(35%) and 
  <span class="italic">Culex </span>spp. (8%). The mosquitoes most frequently trapped with the GT were again 
  <span class="italic">Culex </span>spp. (&gt; 99%), with a total proportion of GT versus EVS of 1:13.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of the 2981 pools, 149 were tested filaria-positive by real-time PCR (5%), of which 54 were confirmed by either 12S, or 16S or 
  <span class="italic">COI </span>PCR, and 27 12S products were sequenced. In 78 cases (52%), the second-round PCR did not confirm the positive first-round result.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of 307 
  <span class="italic">Culex </span>spp. pools consisting of 5417 individuals, 140 pools were filaria-positive by real-time PCR, which corresponds to 45% positive 
  <span class="italic">Culex </span>spp. pools and a MIR of 25.8.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of 2674 non-
  <span class="italic">Culex </span>pools consisting of 63,216 individuals of 12 different species, only nine were filaria-positive (four 
  <span class="italic">Ae. vexans</span>, two 
  <span class="italic">An. claviger</span>, two 
  <span class="italic">Cs. annulata</span>, one 
  <span class="italic">Oc. sticticus</span>), which corresponds to 0.3% positive pools and a MIR of 0.1. The highest MIR at a single locality was 29.75 at Großsachsen (Table 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">1</a>), which was entirely due to positive 
  <span class="italic">Culex </span>spp. pools.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2009, fourteen closely related filarial sequences resembling that of 
  <span class="italic">Setaria tundra </span>(identity of consensus with 
  <span class="italic">S. tundra </span>is 97-99%) were derived from five pools of 
  <span class="italic">Oc. sticticus</span>, four pools each of 
  <span class="italic">Ae. vexans </span>and 
  <span class="italic">An. claviger</span>, and one pool of 
  <span class="italic">Oc. cantans</span>. In 2010, only two additional 
  <span class="italic">S. tundra-</span>like sequences were revealed from one 
  <span class="italic">Oc. sticticus </span>pool and one 
  <span class="italic">Ae. vexans </span>pool. The 
  <span class="italic">S. tundra </span>sequences (as consensus in Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">2</a>) unequivocally cluster with other 
  <span class="italic">S. tundra </span>(99% bootstrap support).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additionally, in 9 and 25 pools of 
  <span class="italic">Culex </span>sp. (2009 and 2010, respectively) sequences of unspecified filarial origin were derived, but presumably all of the same species. In the 12S taxon identification tree (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">2</a>) these 
  <span class="italic">Culex </span>filariae (as consensus) do not cluster with any of those included in the tree analysis and cannot even be assigned unequivocally to any of the genera sequenced so far (see also below). An additional analysis with a reduced number of taxa (all those in the branch above 
  <span class="italic">Dipetalonema </span>in Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">2</a>) revealed an identical topology, but with higher statistical bootstrap support (data not shown). A BLAST search of GenBank retrieves the highest sequence identity (86%) with 
  <span class="italic">Onchocerca suzukii</span>, a parasite of Japanese bovids. However, the tree (in Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">2</a>) shows that this does not correspond to a close relationship, as 
  <span class="italic">O. suzukii </span>clusters with other 
  <span class="italic">Onchocerca </span>species.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Geographic pattern</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the yet unidentified filarial species was exclusively found in 
   <span class="italic">Culex </span>mosquitoes, it is not surprising that it was most abundant in those places where mainly 
   <span class="italic">Culex </span>spp. were caught using gravid traps, which were Weinheim and Großsachsen (Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1</a>). Only three positive pools originated from the site at Wagbachniederung in 2009. All three sites are located in the north of the state of Baden-Württemberg (see also below).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <span class="italic">Setaria tundra </span>appears to be more widespread: it was found in various mosquito species in the states of Bavaria, Rhineland-Palatinate and Baden-Württemberg.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Potential vertebrate hosts and vectors</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At this stage, we can only speculate about the potential vertebrate hosts of the two different filariae. In the case of 
   <span class="italic">Setaria tundra </span>it seems prudent to assume roe-deer as the vertebrate host, as in the past this has been reported from Germany [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B21" href="#B21">21</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B37" href="#B37">37</a>] and neighbouring countries [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B38" href="#B38">38</a>-
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B40" href="#B40">40</a>]. In southern Germany the prevalence of 
   <span class="italic">S. tundra </span>in roe-deers ranges between 1.6% in North Rhine-Westphalia [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B37" href="#B37">37</a>] and 12.3% in northern Bavaria [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B21" href="#B21">21</a>]. In Finland, roe-deer seem to be the main reservoir, but reindeer and moose can also be infected [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B41" href="#B41">41</a>]. The transmission of 
   <span class="italic">S. tundra </span>by various German mosquito species such as 
   <span class="italic">Oc. sticticus</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Ae. vexans </span>and 
   <span class="italic">An. claviger </span>is similar to findings from Finland, where 
   <span class="italic">Ae. communis, Ae. punctor, Ae. hexodontus and Ae. excrucians </span>were incriminated as natural vectors [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B28" href="#B28">28</a>]. The veterinary importance of 
   <span class="italic">S. tundra </span>is due to a reported outbreak of peritonitis with significant economic losses in Finnish semi-domesticated reindeer in 2003-5 [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B42" href="#B42">42</a>]. Similar outbreaks may occur in any other wild or semi-domesticated cervid population outside Finland, e.g. in zoos.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding the filarial species derived from Culex mosquitoes, birds might serve as vertebrate hosts, because of the ornithophilic behavior of most Culex species in Europe [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B38" href="#B38">38</a>]. Potential bird parasite genera known from Europe are Cardiofilaria, Chandlerella, 
   <span class="italic">Eufilaria</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Eulimdana</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Pelecitus</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Pseudlemdana</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Sarconema </span>and 
   <span class="italic">Splendidofilaria </span>[
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B12" href="#B12">12</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B43" href="#B43">43</a>-
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B49" href="#B49">49</a>], some of which are found in common birds such as Blackbirds (
   <span class="italic">Turdus merula</span>), Magpies (
   <span class="italic">Pica pica</span>) or Great Tits (
   <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) ([
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B12" href="#B12">12</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B50" href="#B50">50</a>]), others in domesticated exotic birds [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B51" href="#B51">51</a>]. However, only certain Cardiofilaria and Pelecitus species are known to be vectored by culicines from Asia and North America [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B12" href="#B12">12</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B52" href="#B52">52</a>]. A single record from German birds of prey [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B47" href="#B47">47</a>] makes 
   <span class="italic">Cardiofilaria pavlovskyi </span>the favourite candidate for our unidentified specimens. It is also known from various birds in Spain, France, Poland and Latvia [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B12" href="#B12">12</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B45" href="#B45">45</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B49" href="#B49">49</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B50" href="#B50">50</a>]. Final conclusions are prevented by the paradox that on one hand, sequences are not available for 
   <span class="italic">Cardiofilaria </span>and for the majority of the about 90 known genera of onchocercid filariae [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B17" href="#B17">17</a>], of which only 20 genera are currently represented in GenBank. On the other hand our study protocol did not allow morphological examination prior to homogenization for DNA extraction, and the same applies to most if not all vector-borne specimens listed in GenBank. The only bird parasite that was confirmed by morphology and DNA sequencing during a bird die-off in late 2011 was 
   <span class="italic">Diplotriaena </span>sp. (Nematoda: Diplotriaenidae) in two dead blackcaps (
   <span class="italic">Sylvia atricapilla</span>), but the 12S DNA sequence turned out to be very different from the 
   <span class="italic">Culex </span>filariae (unpublished observations by the authors).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is generally assumed that avian filarioid parasites are rarely pathogenic, and clinical signs may occur only in some bird species or in some individuals within one species [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B53" href="#B53">53</a>].
