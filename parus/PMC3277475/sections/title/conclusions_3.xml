 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although dirofilariasis appears to be emerging and spreading in Europe, the absence of 
  <span class="italic">Dirofilaria </span>spp. or other zoonotic filariae in our sample allows the conclusion that the risk of autochthonous infection in Germany is still very low. Potential vectors of 
  <span class="italic">S. tundra </span>in Germany are 
  <span class="italic">Ochlerotatus sticticus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Oc. cantans</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Aedes vexans </span>and 
  <span class="italic">Anopheles claviger</span>. Technically, the synergism between entomologists, virologists and parasitologists, combined with state-of-the-art methods allows a very efficient near-real-time monitoring of a wide spectrum of both human and veterinary pathogens, including new distribution records of parasite species and the incrimination of their potential vectors.
