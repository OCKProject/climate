 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Filariae (order Spirurida, superfamily Filarioidea) represent a relatively small group of tissue-dwelling, parasitic nematodes with great impact on human and animal health [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B1" href="#B1">1</a>]. Those of highest medical relevance are the causative agents of lymphatic filariasis (
  <span class="italic">Wuchereria bancrofti </span>and others) and onchocerciasis (
  <span class="italic">Onchocerca volvulus</span>), both diseases with anthroponotic cycles. Several other filarioses are truly enzootic, e.g. in ungulates (animal onchocerciasis) or rodents (
  <span class="italic">Litomosoides </span>sp.), but a few may be transmissible on rare occasions from animals to humans, such as dirofilariasis [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B2" href="#B2">2</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B4" href="#B4">4</a>] or accidental onchocerciasis [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B5" href="#B5">5</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B6" href="#B6">6</a>]. Although dirofilariasis has been diagnosed in Germany both in humans and dogs, it is assumed that most dog cases and all human cases were imported from endemic regions outside Germany [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B7" href="#B7">7</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B9" href="#B9">9</a>]. However, more recently 
  <span class="italic">Dirofilaria </span>spp. are considered emerging agents of parasitic zoonoses in Europe with a northward trend of expansion [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B10" href="#B10">10</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, filarioses are vector-borne infections transmitted by various haematophagous arthropods, e.g. insects such as mosquitoes (Culicidae) or arachnids such as mites (Acari) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B11" href="#B11">11</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B12" href="#B12">12</a>]. However, the role of particular vectors in the transmission cycles of many filarial species, and their geographical distribution remain largely unknown. These gaps can partially be attributed to the very laborious screening techniques used until recently. If infectivity, prevalence, and parasite identity were to be determined from a vector, large numbers of the arthropods had to be collected and freshly dissected.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nowadays, molecular techniques are frequently used to detect filarial species in arthropods [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B13" href="#B13">13</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B16" href="#B16">16</a>]. They allow a much faster throughput and less specimen handling, which is of particular relevance when the prevalence of the parasite is very low. However, these techniques can only provide information about the presence of particular parasites; they do not allow definite conclusions about the natural vector status or infectivity, unless the different body segments such as heads of the insects are screened separately.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to (i) further clarify the occurrence of mosquito-borne filariae in Germany, (ii) identify their potential vectors, and (iii) monitor the possible introduction or expansion of parasites due to climate change or globalization, we conducted a mass collection of mosquitoes in 2009 and 2010. Alongside a screening for arboviruses in German mosquitoes [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B31" href="#B31">31</a>], the same mosquito specimens were co-tested for the presence of filariae. In addition, mosquitoes were tested for filariae that were not included in the arbovirus screening.
