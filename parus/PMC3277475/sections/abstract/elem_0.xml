  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Knowledge of the potential vector role of Culicidae mosquitoes in Germany is very scanty, and until recently it was generally assumed that they are not involved in the transmission of anthroponotic or zoonotic pathogens in this country. However, anticipated changes in the course of global warming and globalization may alter their status.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conducted a molecular mass screening of mosquitoes for filarial parasites using mitochondrial 12S rRNA-based real-time PCR.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">No parasites causing disease in humans such as 
   <span class="italic">Dirofilaria </span>spp. were detected in about 83,000 mosquitoes tested, which had been collected in 2009 and 2010 in 16 locations throughout Germany. However, minimum infection rates of up to 24 per 1000 mosquitoes were revealed, which could be attributed to mosquito infection with 
   <span class="italic">Setaria tundra </span>and a yet unidentified second parasite. 
   <span class="italic">Setaria tundra </span>was found to be widespread in southern Germany in various mosquito species, except 
   <span class="italic">Culex </span>spp. In contrast, the unidentified filarial species was exclusively found in 
   <span class="italic">Culex </span>spp. in northern Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, and is likely to be a bird parasite.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conclusions</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although dirofilariasis appears to be emerging and spreading in Europe, the absence of 
   <span class="italic">Dirofilaria </span>spp. or other zoonotic filariae in our sample allows the conclusion that the risk of autochthonous infection in Germany is still very low. Potential vectors of 
   <span class="italic">S. tundra </span>in Germany are 
   <span class="italic">Ochlerotatus sticticus</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Oc. cantans</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Aedes vexans </span>and 
   <span class="italic">Anopheles claviger</span>. Technically, the synergism between entomologists, virologists and parasitologists, combined with state-of-the-art methods allows a very efficient near-real-time monitoring of a wide spectrum of both human and veterinary pathogens, including new distribution records of parasite species and the incrimination of their potential vectors.
