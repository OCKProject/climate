  <p>The number of chicks fledged against hatching synchrony. Data is from 1960 to 2014. The plotted line is generated from a Poisson GLM with fixed effects of clutch initiation date relative to caterpillar timing, its quadratic, clutch size, hatch date relative to caterpillar timing, its quadratic, and section of the woodland. The shaded area represents the 95% confidence interval of the plotted line</p>
