  <p>The proportion of the active day spent incubating against maximum daily temperature. The plotted lines are generated from predictions from a binomial GLMM using mean incubation day and one standard deviation above and below the mean incubation day (start of full incubation = incubation day 1). For the purposes of prediction, random effects were ignored. Shaded area represents the 95% confidence interval for the relationship between temperature and intensity when incubation day is 6 only, to improve readability</p>
