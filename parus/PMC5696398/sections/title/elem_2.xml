   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The nest box breeding great tit population of Wytham woods has been studied since 1960 using a standardized procedure (Perrins, 
    <a rid="ece33446-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0033">1965</a>; Perrins &amp; McCleery, 
    <a rid="ece33446-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0036">1989</a>). Nest boxes (
    <span class="italic">n</span> = 1,203 with an average of 225 occupied by great tits each year) are visited weekly from early April. During these weekly checks, nest stage and number of eggs are recorded, and the date that a female initiated her clutch is then inferred by assuming a laying rate of one egg per day and counting back from the number of eggs observed on the weekly check. When at least three eggs are present, they are weighed so that species can be assigned (blue tits, coal tits (
    <span class="italic">Periparus ater</span>), and marsh tits (
    <span class="italic">Poecile palustris</span>) also use the Wytham nest boxes). Clutch size is defined as the maximum number of eggs observed in the nest. Date of hatching is established by visiting the nest on the estimated hatch date (date of clutch completion plus 11 days) and then every other day until the eggs hatch. If eggs have hatched prior to the hatch check, the largest chicks are weighed and assigned age based on their weight. Parents are identified at the nest either remotely using RFID (radio‐frequency identification) scanners (all previously trapped birds are fitted with RFID tags) or by catching using spring‐loaded nest box traps. All surviving nestlings are tagged with uniquely identifiable metal leg rings and RFID tags at 2 weeks of age. Nests are then checked postfledging to determine the number of chicks that left the nest.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In‐nest temperature data collection and incubation onset identification</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the 2014 breeding season, in‐nest temperature was recorded at 163 great tit nests using iButton thermometers (DS1921G‐F5, accurate to ±1°C; HomeChip Ltd) set to record temperature every 20 min. These iButtons were secured in the nest cup by wrapping blunted garden wire around the iButton and using the protruding ends to anchor the iButton in the nest material. The iButtons and wire were then sealed into small cotton pouches. Pouch color was matched as closely as possible to the nesting material to minimize visibility to the female great tit (for further details, see Figure 
    <a rid="ece33446-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33446-fig-0001">1</a> in the supporting information, 
    <a rid="ece33446-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece33446-sup-0001">S1</a>). iButtons were placed in every second great tit nest discovered across the woodland, throughout the season, ensuring a spatially and temporally even spread of sampling (163 of the 337 great tit nests). iButtons were placed in nests prior to the start of incubation (eggs were cold to the touch). Incubation in great tits occurs gradually (Haftorn, 
    <a rid="ece33446-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0017">1981</a>), and therefore, eggs can feel cold even after daytime incubation has begun if a fieldworker visits when the female is not incubating. Consequently, only nests which showed, from in‐nest temperatures, at least 1 day of nonincubation after placement of the iButton were included in our analyses. Four nests that did not meet this criteria were removed from the analysis.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of the 163 iButtons placed, 109 were retrieved (54 disappeared from the nest and were assumed to have been removed by the resident great tit). There was potential for bias to be created if females who removed iButtons had a tendency for a certain incubation behavior. However, there was no statistical difference between the clutch completion to hatch period for those females who removed iButtons and those that did not (full analysis reported in supporting information 
    <a rid="ece33446-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece33446-sup-0001">S3</a>). Of the retrieved iButtons, a further six nests were removed from analyses because they were abandoned, three prior to incubation onset and three after incubation but prior to hatching. There was no significant association between abandonment and whether a nest had an iButton or not (χ
    <span class="sup">2</span> = 3.06, 
    <span class="italic">df</span> = 1, 
    <span class="italic">p</span> = .08, 
    <span class="italic">N</span> = 337). A further six iButtons were removed from analyses due to indistinct readings, probably due to deep burial in the nest by the resident female. We therefore present data from the remaining 93 nests where onset of daytime incubation was clearly identifiable.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Date of onset of daytime incubation was determined by combining in‐nest temperature measures with hourly local ambient temperature measures (see below for details of ambient temperature data collection) and calculating the difference between the two. Every in‐nest temperature was paired with a local ambient reading from the same hour. Each in‐nest iButton was matched to the closest ambient temperature iButton using GPS coordinates in ArcGIS (Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), 
    <a rid="ece33446-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0011">2011</a>). In order to identify the onset of daytime incubation, it was necessary to distinguish when a female was incubating in the daytime. This posed a methodological challenge because the temperature readings from the iButtons did not represent the exact egg temperature due to different conductive properties of the egg and the iButton. iButtons were also prone to slight burial and movement within the nest cup based on female behavior, potentially altering the temperature readings. As a result, it was necessary to calibrate each iButton daily. The in‐nest iButton was calibrated to its daily position by selecting a period each day, when the female is known to be incubating (the period just after dark, c. 7 p.m., to midnight (Haftorn, 
    <a rid="ece33446-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0017">1981</a>)), and using the temperatures recorded at this point as a threshold for what can be considered an incubating temperature. In‐nest temperature was calculated for this every night and temperatures over 4°C greater than ambient were taken to indicate incubation. This cutoff was chosen in order to avoid classing small deviations (1 or 2°C) caused by ambient temperature differences, as incubation. All in‐nest iButtons showed differences of &lt;1°C from local ambient temperature during the active day (7 a.m. to 7 p.m.) prior to the onset of daytime incubation; therefore, we are confident a 4°C cutoff is sufficient to indicate incubation. The minimum of these incubating temperatures was then taken as the minimum incubation temperature for the focal nest and current iButton position. Recorded temperatures during the following active day (7 a.m. to 7 p.m.), which exceeded the defined threshold for a given nest and day, were classed as showing incubation is taking place. The onset of daytime incubation was consequently defined as the day when at least 50% of the active‐day recordings were classed as “incubating” (see Figure 
    <a rid="ece33446-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33446-fig-0002">2</a> in the supporting information,

This gives an index with negative values indicating hatch timing earlier than optimum, positive values indicating hatch dates later, and 0 indicating optimal synchrony. The null expectation assumed no incubation behavior alterations and was calculated as the clutch completion date plus 14 days (to represent duration of incubation) minus annual caterpillar timing. Synchrony index measures were then squared in order to remove negative values.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How much within‐population variation exists in (a) onset of incubation relative to clutch completion, (b) incubation duration, and (c) incubation intensity?</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the identified onset of full incubation for the 2014 breeding season, we calculated two primary aspects of incubation behavior: the relative onset (interval between clutch completion and start of daytime incubation) and duration (interval between onset of incubation and observed hatch date). In addition, we also quantified the daily intensity of incubation effort. Incubation effort for each day was determined by calculating the number of 20‐min periods during the active day (7 a.m. to 7 p.m.—the active day) that exceeded the threshold temperature for incubation, as a proportion of the total number of active‐day recordings. The range, mean, and variance of each of these aspects of incubation behavior were calculated.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Relationships between each of the aspects of incubation behavior were also tested. Linear models (LMs) and GLMs were run for each combination of behaviors. Due to sequential timing, relative incubation onset could not be causally influenced by either intensity or duration. However, the onset itself could influence the intensity of incubation effort and consequently impact the duration of daytime incubation. Furthermore, other factors, such as individual condition and clutch size, could also impact incubation effort. These associations were tested in two analyses. The first was a binomial GLM, with mean intensity of incubation as a response variable and relative incubation onset as an explanatory variable, accounting for clutch size and clutch initiation date (a proxy for individual condition (Rowe, Ludwig, &amp; Schluter, 
    <a rid="ece33446-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0039">1994</a>)). The second was a LM with incubation duration as the response variable and mean intensity, relative incubation onset, and clutch size as explanatory variables. The duration of daytime incubation should be a result of the amount of incubation required for an embryo to develop and hatch, scaled by the intensity at which it was incubated. As a result, we would expect incubation duration to show a relationship with mean incubation intensity. However, this relationship could also be modulated by other processes, which influence the amount of incubation required. This could be altered by clutch size (Haftorn, 
    <a rid="ece33446-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0017">1981</a>) and the amount of prior incubation, through relative incubation onset. A nest that began incubation prior to clutch completion could require a greater intensity of incubation effort for the same duration as a nest that began incubation after clutch completion. This occurs due to accumulated hours of incubation during nocturnal incubation reducing the amount required from full incubation for nests which delay onset.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Can this observed variability be explained by ambient temperature cues, and if so, which temperature measures best capture variation?</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For both relative incubation onset and incubation duration, exploratory analyses were conducted using sliding time window methods in order to identify the temporal temperature window and temperature measure, which best explain variance in different components of incubation behavior. This method does not establish a causal link between the behavior of interest and temperature, but instead attempts to identify the time window in which temperature may be most important for determining the behavior in question.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Twelve different length windows were tested for these analyses (Figure 
    <a rid="ece33446-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33446-fig-0001">1</a>). The minimum time window (shown in red) was unique to each nest and spanned from the lay date to the date of onset of full incubation, hereafter termed the “laying period.” The time windows then increase in 1‐day increments spanning backward from the start of laying, up to the maximum window of 10 days prior to laying, up until incubation onset (see Figure 
    <a rid="ece33446-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33446-fig-0001">1</a>). Window 12 is only used in the analysis of incubation duration and spans from the onset of incubation up until hatching.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Candidate models for model selection were LMs and took the form of two configurations of null model (models with no temperature variables included), which were compared with four configurations of temperature model, each containing a single temperature variable (see Table 
    <a rid="ece33446-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#ece33446-tbl-0001">1</a>a). Four different temperature measures were tested: mean temperature, mean daily minimum temperature (MMin), mean daily maximum temperature (MMax), and mean daily temperature range (Trange). In total, this gave 44 different explanatory temperature variables (four measures across 11 windows). A total of 176 candidate temperature models were compared with relative incubation onset as the response variable, consisting of 44 different temperature variables in each of the four model configurations and the two null models. For models with incubation duration as a response variable, each candidate model also included a fixed effect of relative incubation onset. As incubation occurs at night prior to the onset of full incubation, any delay or advance in full incubation onset will alter the number of accumulated “incubation hours” and therefore will likely influence the final duration of full incubation. An additional four candidate models were also run due to the additional time window for this variable, totaling 180 candidate models.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For incubation intensity, binomial generalized linear mixed‐effects models (GLMMs) were used with daily incubation effort as the response variable and temperature and stage of incubation (incubation day) as fixed effects. The random effect of individual was also included to take account of individual differences in incubation effort. Incubation days ran from the onset of full incubation (day 1) to the day prior to hatch day. Hatch date itself was excluded as this is when iButtons were removed. Candidate models each included a single temperature variable from daily mean temperature, daily minimum temperature, daily maximum temperature, and daily temperature range. Five different configurations of model were trialed (see Table

This is similar to the technique applied to the long‐term data; however, in this instance we are able to distinguish between different aspects of incubation behavior and quantify their impacts independently. A null expectation was created for both relative incubation onset (calculated as the clutch completion date plus the duration of full incubation minus caterpillar timing) and incubation duration (calculated as the clutch completion date plus the relative incubation onset and the mean duration of full incubation in 2014—12 days minus caterpillar timing). The variance of the observed hatching synchrony was compared to the two null estimations using pairwise 
    <span class="italic">F</span> tests for equality of variance. As there was no logical null estimate for the duration of daytime incubation, isolation of the influence of this element of incubation behavior on mean synchrony was not possible. Therefore, only the influence of relative incubation onset on mean synchrony was tested. This was conducted using a paired 
    <span class="italic">t</span> test between the observed synchrony and a null estimate with no onset changes.
