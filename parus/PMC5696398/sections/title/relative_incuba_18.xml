 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Relative incubation onset varies in response to mean local temperatures around the laying period</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ten candidate models had ΔAIC values of within two of the lowest AIC model, giving 11 candidate models with equal support.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All of these models included mean temperature or mean maximum temperature. The majority (nine of 11) included an additive effect of clutch initiation date or an interaction between clutch initiation date and temperature. Effect sizes for the relationship between temperature and relative incubation onset vary from −5.4 for mean temperature to −0.7 for mean maximum temperature. As all of these models are similar in composition, only the model with the lowest AIC is discussed further (but a full list of model parameters is given in supporting information 
  <a rid="ece33446-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece33446-sup-0001">S4</a>). The model with the lowest AIC included explanatory variables of mean temperature for time window 8, clutch initiation date, and an interaction between the two.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relative incubation onset had a significant negative correlation with mean temperature for window 8, with individuals starting incubation earlier when mean temperature was higher (5 days advance in the onset of incubation per 1°C increase in mean temperature; Figure 
  <a rid="ece33446-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33446-fig-0003">3</a>; EST = −5.03, 
  <span class="italic">SE</span> = 1.72, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = .004). The interaction between clutch initiation date and temperature took the form of early layers having the strongest negative relationship between temperature and their incubation onset and later layers showing almost no relationship with temperature, as illustrated in Figure 
  <a rid="ece33446-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33446-fig-0003">3</a> (EST = 0.3, 
  <span class="italic">SE</span> = 0.13, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = .02). Figure 
  <a rid="ece33446-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33446-fig-0003">3</a> show the relationship including outliers; the relationship was also tested without these data points (mean temperature values &lt;8.5°C). Parameter values did not change considerably on removal of the outliers; consequently, we opted to retain all data. Full output of both analyses is given in supporting information

   <p>Relative onset of incubation against mean temperature for window 8. The plotted:lines are generated from predictions from linear models. Clutch:initiation dates are held at the 1st quartile value, the median value, and the 3rd quartile value, to illustrate the significant interaction between clutch initiation date and temperature. Shaded area represents the 95% confidence interval for predictions with median clutch initiation date only, to improve the readability</p>
