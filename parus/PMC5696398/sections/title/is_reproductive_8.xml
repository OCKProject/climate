 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Is reproductive success better explained by timing of hatching relative to the caterpillar peak than timing of clutch initiation relative to the caterpillar peak?</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Whether hatch timing relative to winter moth caterpillar peak abundance (taken as the median date on which caterpillars were observed descending to pupate) is important for reproductive success was tested using a Poisson generalized linear model (GLM) with number of fledglings as the response variable. Fixed effects were hatching synchrony (observed hatch date minus median caterpillar date of that year) and its quadratic. Clutch size, clutch initiation synchrony (observed clutch initiation date minus median caterpillar date of that year), its quadratic, and section of the woodland were also included as explanatory variables to take account of number of eggs laid, individual condition, and local habitat quality.</p>
