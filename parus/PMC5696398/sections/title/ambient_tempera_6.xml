 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Local ambient temperature was collected via a grid of ambient temperature iButtons (DS1923‐F5, accurate to ±0.5°C; HomeChip Ltd) set to measure absolute temperature every 30 min. A total of 200 of these ambient temperature iButtons were distributed in a grid system across Wytham woods with positions chosen to reflect the density of nest boxes.
