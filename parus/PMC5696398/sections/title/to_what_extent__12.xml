 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To what extent do these three aspects of incubation behavior (relative onset, duration, and intensity) contribute to improving synchrony between timing of chick hatching and the caterpillar peak?</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The influence of relative incubation onset and incubation duration on the observed synchrony was tested by comparing the observed hatch date synchrony (hatch date minus caterpillar peak timing) to a null expectation of hatch synchrony, if either aspect of incubation behavior had not varied. This is similar to the technique applied to the long‐term data; however, in this instance we are able to distinguish between different aspects of incubation behavior and quantify their impacts independently. A null expectation was created for both relative incubation onset (calculated as the clutch completion date plus the duration of full incubation minus caterpillar timing) and incubation duration (calculated as the clutch completion date plus the relative incubation onset and the mean duration of full incubation in 2014—12 days minus caterpillar timing). The variance of the observed hatching synchrony was compared to the two null estimations using pairwise 
  <span class="italic">F</span> tests for equality of variance. As there was no logical null estimate for the duration of daytime incubation, isolation of the influence of this element of incubation behavior on mean synchrony was not possible. Therefore, only the influence of relative incubation onset on mean synchrony was tested. This was conducted using a paired 
  <span class="italic">t</span> test between the observed synchrony and a null estimate with no onset changes.
