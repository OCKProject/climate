 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Can this observed variability be explained by ambient temperature cues, and if so, which temperature measures best capture variation?</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For both relative incubation onset and incubation duration, exploratory analyses were conducted using sliding time window methods in order to identify the temporal temperature window and temperature measure, which best explain variance in different components of incubation behavior. This method does not establish a causal link between the behavior of interest and temperature, but instead attempts to identify the time window in which temperature may be most important for determining the behavior in question.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Twelve different length windows were tested for these analyses (Figure 
  <a rid="ece33446-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33446-fig-0001">1</a>). The minimum time window (shown in red) was unique to each nest and spanned from the lay date to the date of onset of full incubation, hereafter termed the “laying period.” The time windows then increase in 1‐day increments spanning backward from the start of laying, up to the maximum window of 10 days prior to laying, up until incubation onset (see Figure 
  <a rid="ece33446-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33446-fig-0001">1</a>). Window 12 is only used in the analysis of incubation duration and spans from the onset of incubation up until hatching.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Candidate models for model selection were LMs and took the form of two configurations of null model (models with no temperature variables included), which were compared with four configurations of temperature model, each containing a single temperature variable (see Table 
  <a rid="ece33446-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#ece33446-tbl-0001">1</a>a). Four different temperature measures were tested: mean temperature, mean daily minimum temperature (MMin), mean daily maximum temperature (MMax), and mean daily temperature range (Trange). In total, this gave 44 different explanatory temperature variables (four measures across 11 windows). A total of 176 candidate temperature models were compared with relative incubation onset as the response variable, consisting of 44 different temperature variables in each of the four model configurations and the two null models. For models with incubation duration as a response variable, each candidate model also included a fixed effect of relative incubation onset. As incubation occurs at night prior to the onset of full incubation, any delay or advance in full incubation onset will alter the number of accumulated “incubation hours” and therefore will likely influence the final duration of full incubation. An additional four candidate models were also run due to the additional time window for this variable, totaling 180 candidate models.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For incubation intensity, binomial generalized linear mixed‐effects models (GLMMs) were used with daily incubation effort as the response variable and temperature and stage of incubation (incubation day) as fixed effects. The random effect of individual was also included to take account of individual differences in incubation effort. Incubation days ran from the onset of full incubation (day 1) to the day prior to hatch day. Hatch date itself was excluded as this is when iButtons were removed. Candidate models each included a single temperature variable from daily mean temperature, daily minimum temperature, daily maximum temperature, and daily temperature range. Five different configurations of model were trialed (see Table 
  <a rid="ece33446-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#ece33446-tbl-0001">1</a>b). Therefore, a total of 20 candidate models were trialed.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Candidate models were compared using the ΔAIC. The preferred model was defined as the model with the lowest AIC. Models are considered as not significantly different to the preferred model if the ΔAIC is less than 2. It should be noted that as each model including a temperature variable contains at least a partially overlapping or correlated variable (as all temperature measures and windows are likely to be correlated), we would not expect these analyses to always produce any single clearly preferred model.</p>
