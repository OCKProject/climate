 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Incubation alterations lead to hatch dates having lower variance than clutch initiation or completion dates</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From 1960 to 2014, hatch dates in the Wytham woods great tit population showed significantly lower annual variance than clutch initiation dates. Hatch dates had an average variance of 3.7 days less than clutch initiation dates (variance difference = −13.6, 
  <span class="italic">SE</span> = 0.97, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; .01). This difference was partly driven by changes in clutch size, but not exclusively. Variance in clutch completion date was significantly lower than in clutch initiation date (variance difference = 5.9, 
  <span class="italic">SE</span> = 0.97, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; .01) and significantly greater than observed hatch date variance (variance difference = 7.6, 
  <span class="italic">SE</span> = 0.97, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; .001).
