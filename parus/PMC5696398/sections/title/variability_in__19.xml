 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The duration of full incubation showed no significant relationship with any temperature measure or temporal window once the relative onset of incubation was taken into account. The candidate model with the lowest AIC included the temperature range for window 11 and the relative incubation onset; however, the effect of temperature was not statistically significant at
