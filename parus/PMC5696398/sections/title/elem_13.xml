  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The number of chicks fledged showed a significant relationship with observed hatching synchrony (difference between hatch date and caterpillar peak date) (EST = −0.074,

   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; .01) and its quadratic (EST = −0.0017,

   <a rid="ece33446-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33446-fig-0002">2</a>). Those hatching too early (more than 13 days prior to the caterpillar peak) or too late (less than 13 days prior to the caterpillar peak) fledged fewer young. The number of chicks fledged also showed a significant positive relationship with clutch initiation synchrony, but not the quadratic (EST = −0.00012, 
   <span class="italic">SE</span> = 0.000099, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = .24). Earlier layers fledged more young; however, the effect size was almost half that of hatch timing (EST = 0.036,

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From 1960 to 2014, hatch dates in the Wytham woods great tit population showed significantly lower annual variance than clutch initiation dates.

   <span class="italic">SE</span> = 0.97, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; .01). This difference was partly driven by changes in clutch size, but not exclusively. Variance in clutch completion date was significantly lower than in clutch initiation date (variance difference = 5.9,

   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; .01) and significantly greater than observed hatch date variance (variance difference = 7.6,

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ten candidate models had ΔAIC values of within two of the lowest AIC model, giving 11 candidate models with equal support.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All of these models included mean temperature or mean maximum temperature. The majority (nine of 11) included an additive effect of clutch initiation date or an interaction between clutch initiation date and temperature. Effect sizes for the relationship between temperature and relative incubation onset vary from −5.4 for mean temperature to −0.7 for mean maximum temperature. As all of these models are similar in composition, only the model with the lowest AIC is discussed further (but a full list of model parameters is given in supporting information 
   <a rid="ece33446-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece33446-sup-0001">S4</a>). The model with the lowest AIC included explanatory variables of mean temperature for time window 8, clutch initiation date, and an interaction between the two.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relative incubation onset had a significant negative correlation with mean temperature for window 8, with individuals starting incubation earlier when mean temperature was higher (5 days advance in the onset of incubation per 1°C increase in mean temperature; Figure

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Null estimations of hatching synchrony, assuming no changes in relative incubation onset or no changes to incubation duration, and the observed hatching synchrony were compared. This allowed us to tease apart the contributions of different aspects of incubation behavior to the observed hatching synchrony for the 2014 breeding season. The inclusion of alterations to incubation duration altered the variance of synchrony among nests, from 44.8 without duration changes to 37.8 for observed hatching synchrony. The inclusion of changes to the relative onset of incubation also showed a difference in variance, but to a much lower extent (1.1 higher than observed variance).
