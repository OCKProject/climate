 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Do adjustments to timing of hatching made after clutch initiation improve synchrony between chick hatching and the caterpillar peak?</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to address the overarching question of whether adjustments after clutch initiation improve synchrony between chick hatching and the caterpillar peak, we address two subquestions.</p>

     <span class="italic">Is annual population‐level variance in hatching timing reduced through incubation adjustments?</span> The annual variance of hatch dates and clutch initiation dates was calculated from 1960 to 2014. To take account of the potential influence of changes in clutch size, we also calculated the variance of clutch completion dates. The variances of clutch initiation date, clutch completion date, and observed hatch date were compared using an ANOVA including a fixed effect of year.

     <span class="italic">Is synchrony with the food source improved by adjustments made between clutch initiation and hatching?</span> To distinguish whether the observed synchrony between hatch dates and caterpillar peak abundance was a significant improvement to the null expectation of this synchrony, without incubation alterations, a paired 
     <span class="italic">t</span> test was conducted. Observed synchrony was calculated as the difference between each nest's hatch date and the woodland annual caterpillar timing. All synchrony values had 13 added to them as 13 days prior to the caterpillar peak was indicated to be the optimal timing of hatching (see above for the analysis of reproductive success). This gives an index with negative values indicating hatch timing earlier than optimum, positive values indicating hatch dates later, and 0 indicating optimal synchrony. The null expectation assumed no incubation behavior alterations and was calculated as the clutch completion date plus 14 days (to represent duration of incubation) minus annual caterpillar timing. Synchrony index measures were then squared in order to remove negative values.
