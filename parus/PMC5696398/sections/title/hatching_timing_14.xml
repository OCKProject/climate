 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hatching timing relative to the food peak abundance influences reproductive success and is a better predictor than relative clutch initiation timing</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The number of chicks fledged showed a significant relationship with observed hatching synchrony (difference between hatch date and caterpillar peak date) (EST = −0.074, 
  <span class="italic">SE</span> = 0.0037, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; .01) and its quadratic (EST = −0.0017, 
  <span class="italic">SE</span> = 0.00013, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; .01) (see Figure 
  <a rid="ece33446-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33446-fig-0002">2</a>). Those hatching too early (more than 13 days prior to the caterpillar peak) or too late (less than 13 days prior to the caterpillar peak) fledged fewer young. The number of chicks fledged also showed a significant positive relationship with clutch initiation synchrony, but not the quadratic (EST = −0.00012, 
  <span class="italic">SE</span> = 0.000099, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = .24). Earlier layers fledged more young; however, the effect size was almost half that of hatch timing (EST = 0.036, 
  <span class="italic">SE</span> = 0.0069, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; .01).
