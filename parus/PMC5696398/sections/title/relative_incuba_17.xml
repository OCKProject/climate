 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Relative incubation onset, incubation duration, and intensity are highly variable</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the 2014 breeding season, relative incubation onset ranged from 3 days prior to clutch completion up to 12 days after, with an average of four and a half days delay. Incubation duration ranged from 7 to 19 days with an average duration of 11.5 days. Incubation intensity, once full incubation had begun, ranged from 5% to 100% of the active day, with a mean incubation effort of 70%.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The maximum alteration to hatch date, assuming independence of different incubation behaviors and an expected incubation duration of 11.5 days, is an advance of 7.5 days or a delay of 19.5 days.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mean intensity of incubation showed no significant relationship with either clutch size (EST = 0.04, 
  <span class="italic">SE</span> = 0.03, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = .14) or clutch initiation date (EST = 0.01, 
  <span class="italic">SE</span> = 0.01, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = .42), but did show a significant negative relationship with relative incubation onset (EST = −0.04, 
  <span class="italic">SE</span> = 0.01, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; .001). Incubation duration also showed a significant negative relationship with the relative onset of incubation (EST = −0.45, 
  <span class="italic">SE</span> = 0.05, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; .001), but did not show any significant relationship with either clutch size (EST = 0.03, 
  <span class="italic">SE</span> = 0.12, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = .79) or mean intensity (EST = −3.92, 
  <span class="italic">SE</span> = 2.09, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = .06).
