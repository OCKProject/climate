 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study examined whether incubation behavior is used to improve the timing of hatching relative to peak resource abundance (winter moth caterpillars), and which temperature cues best predict within‐year variation in incubation. We quantified variability in different aspects of incubation behavior for a single breeding season (the onset relative to clutch completion, duration, and intensity) and explored how such changes are linked to temperature and how they can influence hatch timing. Using a population of wild great tits, we show that across 54 years, individual hatching dates show lower within‐year variance than clutch initiation dates, suggesting that alterations are occurring post‐clutch initiation that are bringing hatching dates closer to the mean. These alterations were found to be driven by both clutch size changes and incubation behavior. Synchrony between hatch dates and caterpillar peak abundance was shown to be significantly improved for observed hatching compared to a null estimation (where incubation behavior was assumed to be the same for all individuals). This suggests that incubation behavior is being used to improve synchrony with peak food availability.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we were interested in how different aspects of incubation behavior drive the observed post‐clutch initiation adjustments and to identify the temperature cues which best explain this variability. In order to distinguish different elements of incubation behavior, we used a passive method of in‐nest temperature recording. Through this, we were able to accurately distinguish the onset of full incubation and consequently quantify the relative onset, duration, and intensity of incubation. We demonstrate that incubation adjustments are driven by variability in multiple aspects of incubation behavior. The onset of incubation relative to clutch completion, the duration of full incubation, and intensity of incubation effort are all highly variable. Cumulatively, alteration to these behaviors could lead to almost 8 days advance or 20 days delay in hatch timing. At least some of the variation observed in these behaviors can be explained by temperature changes from just prior to the laying period right up until hatching. An interplay between the energetic costs of incubation (Visser &amp; Lessels, 
  <a rid="ece33446-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0047">2001</a>) and the fitness costs of timing hatching poorly in relation to peak food abundance could also play a role in determining optimal incubation behavior. However, this study focuses on the role incubation behavior plays in the timing of hatching.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Different aspects of incubation behavior correlated with different temperature variables. Sliding time window analyses identified a critical temporal window of mean temperatures from 7 days prior to laying up until incubation onset (see Figure 
  <a rid="ece33446-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33446-fig-0003">3</a>) as the best predictor of variability in relative incubation onset. Warmer mean temperatures during this period corresponded to earlier relative onsets with an advance of approximately 5 days per °C but mediated by an interaction with clutch initiation date. Earlier layers displayed the strongest negative temperature—onset relationship, supporting previous findings that early layers are most able to alter their timing (Cresswell &amp; McCleery, 
  <a rid="ece33446-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0010">2003</a>). This suggests that temperatures around laying do act as a cue for the onset of incubation, supporting several previous findings (Álvarez &amp; Barba, 
  <a rid="ece33446-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0001">2014</a>; Cresswell &amp; McCleery, 
  <a rid="ece33446-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0010">2003</a>; Stenning, 
  <a rid="ece33446-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0042">2008</a>). However, the cues for incubation behavior were not found to be uniform across different aspects. While some of the findings from this study support previous work suggesting that mean temperature is an important phenological cue (Álvarez &amp; Barba, 
  <a rid="ece33446-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0001">2014</a>; Cresswell &amp; McCleery, 
  <a rid="ece33446-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0010">2003</a>; García‐Navas &amp; Sanz, 
  <a rid="ece33446-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0013">2011</a>), we also show that for some aspects of incubation behavior, temperature extremes are more important. This demonstrates a need to test multiple temperature measures when considering phenological cues. It should also be noted that temperatures do autocorrelate throughout the year, and between different measures (mean, maximum, minimum, and range), this can make distinguishing a definitive temperature cue difficult.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The different aspects of incubation behavior studied here were not completely independent. Both the intensity and duration of incubation appeared to be partly constrained by the onset of incubation. The daily intensity of incubation effort showed a significant positive relationship with daily maximum temperatures during the incubation period, even when accounting for stage of incubation. In contrast, incubation duration showed no significant relationship with any temporal window or temperature measure tested here. This could arise because incubation duration is constrained due to an interaction between the number of hours of incubation required for development and the relative onset of incubation. Consequently, it may not exhibit plasticity in response to temperature variation, despite changes to intensity. Incubation durations are highly variable, but a significant portion of this variability can be explained by the relative onset of incubation. Mean incubation intensity showed no relationship with clutch size or lay date (proxy for individual condition) but a significant negative relationship with the relative incubation onset. Higher mean intensities corresponded with earlier incubation onsets. This could indicate an attempt by females to advance their hatch date via both onset and duration of incubation. However, this relationship is not shown for duration itself. Incubation duration showed no significant relationship with either clutch size or mean intensity of incubation. It did, however, show a significant negative relationship with relative incubation onset; earlier onsets corresponded to longer durations. The lack of a relationship between intensity of incubation effort and the duration of incubation could be explained by the role of nighttime incubation. As great tits incubate at night from several days prior to clutch completion (Haftorn, 
  <a rid="ece33446-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0017">1981</a>), those individuals initiating full incubation prior to clutch completion will have accumulated fewer active incubation hours than an individual who initiates after the clutch is completed. Consequently, females incubating early will need to input more hours of full incubation than those who delayed. This would lead to a modulation of any intensity–duration relationship with females with earlier onset requiring a greater intensity of incubation in order to achieve the same total duration as a female with later onset.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, multiple aspects of the breeding cycle have been shown to play a role in achieving synchrony between hatching timing and caterpillar peak abundance. We have demonstrated that elements of incubation behavior alter hatch dates in different ways. The relative onset of incubation significantly alters the mean hatching synchrony to create better matching with the caterpillar peak abundance. The duration of incubation altered the variance of hatching timing, although not significantly in the focal year. The relative onset of incubation had no influence on the variance of hatching timing; therefore, all variance changes are likely attributable to alterations of incubation duration. Although not statistically significant in 2014, we did find that incubation behavior significantly altered variance in hatching timing across long‐term data, which could be driven by duration changes. As a result, incubation duration changes do appear to play a notable role in eventual synchrony between hatching and caterpillar peak abundance across years.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hatching timing, relative to the caterpillar peak, has a significant impact on reproductive success, and consequently, all alterations discussed here play a key role in fitness. Further to direct effects on the relative hatching timing, incubation alterations could also have other knock‐on fitness impacts. The shifting of incubation onset earlier could influence reproductive success through increases in asynchrony in the hatching of individual eggs within a clutch (Cresswell &amp; McCleery, 
  <a rid="ece33446-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0010">2003</a>; Johnson et al., 
  <a rid="ece33446-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0020">2013</a>; Lord et al., 
  <a rid="ece33446-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0026">2011</a>; Stenning, 
  <a rid="ece33446-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0042">2008</a>). This can drive rapid brood reduction in years with little food or when matching is poor, therefore reducing recruitment and having impacts on population dynamics.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When assessing plasticity in different elements of the breeding cycle, it is important to consider the limits and constraints on this flexibility. There is an inherent asymmetry in adjustments to incubation behavior. As demonstrated with females in our study, it is much easier to delay incubation onset than to advance. An advance in incubation onset is bounded by initial lay date, but eggs remain viable many weeks after being laid (Perrins, 
  <a rid="ece33446-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0034">1970</a>), so females have more flexibility to delay incubation than they do to advance it (Van Noordwijk et al., 
  <a rid="ece33446-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0044">1995</a>). Therefore, if temperatures after laying advance faster than prior to laying, as is occurring for great tit populations in the Netherlands (Visser et al., 
  <a rid="ece33446-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0048">1998</a>, 
  <a rid="ece33446-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0046">2003</a>), plasticity in incubation behavior alone may not be sufficient to compensate for a late lay date in comparison with subsequently early caterpillar peak. This is demonstrated by reduced reproductive success for this population in years when temperatures change drastically after laying (Van Noordwijk et al., 
  <a rid="ece33446-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0044">1995</a>). Additionally, females may be energetically constrained from advancing incubation very early in the spring when resources are scarce (Van Noordwijk et al., 
  <a rid="ece33446-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0044">1995</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The patterns shown here are not unique to great tits. Variation in timing after reproduction has been initiated has been shown in blue tits (García‐Navas &amp; Sanz, 
  <a rid="ece33446-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0013">2011</a>; Matthysen et al., 
  <a rid="ece33446-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0027">2010</a>; Stenning, 
  <a rid="ece33446-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0042">2008</a>), tree swallows (Ardia et al., 
  <a rid="ece33446-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0002">2010</a>), ducks (Hepp et al., 
  <a rid="ece33446-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0019">2006</a>), cervids (Asher, 
  <a rid="ece33446-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0003">2007</a>; Asher et al., 
  <a rid="ece33446-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0004">2005</a>; Moyes et al., 
  <a rid="ece33446-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0030">2011</a>), and bats (Racey &amp; Swift, 
  <a rid="ece33446-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0038">1981</a>). In order to predict how populations of temperate species will be impacted by further climate changes, it is essential to consider the mechanisms behind phenological synchrony, the responsiveness to temperature, and their constraints. Many species appear to display considerable flexibility in multiple aspects of their breeding phenology. Therefore, they might have greater potential to adapt to further climatic variability than would be assumed from looking at only single aspects of reproduction. In this study, we demonstrated that great tits do alter incubation behavior in response to ambient temperatures from prior to laying right up until hatching, even adjusting to daily maximum temperature changes during incubation. These adjustments improve the synchrony between hatch timing and caterpillar peak abundance and have knock‐on impacts to reproductive success through this improved matching.
