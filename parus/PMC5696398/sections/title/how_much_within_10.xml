 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How much within‐population variation exists in (a) onset of incubation relative to clutch completion, (b) incubation duration, and (c) incubation intensity?</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the identified onset of full incubation for the 2014 breeding season, we calculated two primary aspects of incubation behavior: the relative onset (interval between clutch completion and start of daytime incubation) and duration (interval between onset of incubation and observed hatch date). In addition, we also quantified the daily intensity of incubation effort. Incubation effort for each day was determined by calculating the number of 20‐min periods during the active day (7 a.m. to 7 p.m.—the active day) that exceeded the threshold temperature for incubation, as a proportion of the total number of active‐day recordings. The range, mean, and variance of each of these aspects of incubation behavior were calculated.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Relationships between each of the aspects of incubation behavior were also tested. Linear models (LMs) and GLMs were run for each combination of behaviors. Due to sequential timing, relative incubation onset could not be causally influenced by either intensity or duration. However, the onset itself could influence the intensity of incubation effort and consequently impact the duration of daytime incubation. Furthermore, other factors, such as individual condition and clutch size, could also impact incubation effort. These associations were tested in two analyses. The first was a binomial GLM, with mean intensity of incubation as a response variable and relative incubation onset as an explanatory variable, accounting for clutch size and clutch initiation date (a proxy for individual condition (Rowe, Ludwig, &amp; Schluter, 
  <a rid="ece33446-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0039">1994</a>)). The second was a LM with incubation duration as the response variable and mean intensity, relative incubation onset, and clutch size as explanatory variables. The duration of daytime incubation should be a result of the amount of incubation required for an embryo to develop and hatch, scaled by the intensity at which it was incubated. As a result, we would expect incubation duration to show a relationship with mean incubation intensity. However, this relationship could also be modulated by other processes, which influence the amount of incubation required. This could be altered by clutch size (Haftorn, 
  <a rid="ece33446-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0017">1981</a>) and the amount of prior incubation, through relative incubation onset. A nest that began incubation prior to clutch completion could require a greater intensity of incubation effort for the same duration as a nest that began incubation after clutch completion. This occurs due to accumulated hours of incubation during nocturnal incubation reducing the amount required from full incubation for nests which delay onset.
