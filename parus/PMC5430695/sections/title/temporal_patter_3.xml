 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analysis of the temporal pattern of the price of the European goldfinch was based on information collected from the market of eight Algerian provinces between 1990 and 2016 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). The temporal pattern of the price of the species showed an exponential growth (R² = 0.94, P &lt; 0.0001; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>), revealing a very rapid increase during 2005–2016. On average (across provinces), the price increased 92.2 times from $1.08 ± 0.70 in 1990–1994 to $99.9 in 2011–2016. By correcting the price by the monthly per capita income (PCI), it still showed an exponential growth over time (R² = 0.89, P &lt; 0.0001; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b</a>). When averaged across provinces, PCI increased 32.26 times from 0.007 ± 0.005 in 1990–1994 to 0.23 ± 0.06 in 2011–2016.
