 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of the 237 selected grids (25 × 25 km²) which cover the potential habitat of the European goldfinch in western Maghreb, the species was observed in 115 grids (48.5%, n = 237) during 1990–1991 and in only 37 grids (15.6%, n = 237) during 2015–2016. The highest decline was recorded in Tunisia and Algeria where the number of occupied grids decreased from 16 (38.1%, n = 42) in 1990–1991 to 0 (0%, n = 42) in 2015–2016 and from 58 (48.7%, n = 119) in 1990–1991 to 3 (2.5%, n = 119) in 2015–2016, respectively. In Morocco, the number of occupied grids declined from 41 (53.9%, n = 76) in 1990–1991 to 34 (44.7%, n = 76) in 2015–2016.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To estimate the changes in range distribution, we used dynamic occupancy models which account for detection probability. The dynamic occupancy model showed strong evidence for time-dependence in detection probability. Detection probability was influenced by vegetation cover (linear and quadratic), elevation (linear and quadratic), and by the interaction terms between elevation and vegetation cover (vegetation-by-elevation and vegetation-by-elevation²). Initial occupancy was affected by elevation (linear and quadratic) and vegetation cover. Extinction probability was best explained by longitude (linear and quadratic) and elevation, whereas colonization probability was constant (Table

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on our best model, we predicted the occurrence of the species on 1325 grids covering the western Maghreb region, excluding Sahara. We summed the predicted values of occupancy over the study area and found an estimated distribution area prior to industrial poaching (1990–1991) of 236725 km² (95% CI: 221834–264911 km²). In 2015–2016, the distribution range retracted to 102548 km² (95% CI: 126300.7–142635 km²), which corresponds to a loss of 56.7% of the home range in western Maghreb (Fig.
