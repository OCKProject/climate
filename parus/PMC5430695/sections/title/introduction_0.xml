 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Species overexploitation for wildlife trade is a major global threat to biodiversity, particularly birds
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>. Many species of birds are targets of poaching due to their high economic and cultural value
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>, threatening wild populations and ecosystem functioning
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. Nearly half of the extant and extinct bird species have been utilized by humans for various purposes, especially for domestication as pets
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>. These species are often not exploited sustainably
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>, and many are threatened by extinction
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>. Although poaching is sometimes species-specific and tends to have local consequences on target species
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>, it can also be non-selective with substantial consequences on a large number of local and migratory species
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Mediterranean has recently been identified as a danger zone for migratory birds where 11–36 million individuals per year may be killed or taken illegally, and one of the most important reasons is for use as cage-birds
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. This is an alarming issue for global avian diversity since one of the world's major flyways, the Palearctic-African flyway
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>, crosses the Mediterranean where an estimated number of 2.1 billion Afro-Palearctic birds migrate every year back and forth from breeding to wintering grounds
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. Moreover, migratory birds do not only fly through the Mediterranean region but also spend several days in stop-overs to rest and eat
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span> which increases their vulnerability to poaching. In North Africa, and particularly western Maghreb (Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia), stop-over areas are known to be suitable for fat accumulation because of the availability of food and water
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>, and thus they potentially host a large number of migratory birds every year. However, the cultural practice of trapping the European goldfinch (
  <span class="italic">Carduelis carduelis</span>) for domestication in this region is widespread
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. Yet, the potential effects of the local poaching practice on Afro-Palearctic migratory birds has not been investigated.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The European goldfinch is a widespread songbird, considered as one of the most abundant passerine species in the Palearctic
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. The species has been domesticated in cages for a long time in the Palearctic where it is very popular and holds important cultural significance
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. It has been recognized that more than 400 paintings, particularly those of Carel Fabritius included the goldfinch as symbol of spirit, resurrection, sacrifice or death
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>. In North Africa, the use of a goldfinch as a pet goes back to the Umayyad dynasty around 700 AD and reached the region through the expansion of the Umayyad Caliphate. Nowadays, it is part of the culture of this region to buy and raise goldfinches in cages for their elegant colors and large repertoire of singing. In western Maghreb (Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia), the industrial poaching of the species started in the early 1990s. Following a deep economic crisis in these countries, goldfinch poaching became a job and a hobby for local people who trapped the species all year long, even during the reproductive season. Bird trapping and killing has been prohibited in western Maghreb since 2004 in Algeria
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>, 2007 in Tunisia
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>, and 1962 in Morocco
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>, but the application of conservation laws is often not respected and their effectiveness is thus questionable
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. Here, we document the effects of the long-term poaching on local populations of European goldfinch to reveal the consequences of overexploitation of natural populations on abundant animal species.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Goldfinch poaching has been conducted with various methods including lime sticks, cage traps and ground nets. However, from around 2010, when the species became particularly rare, poachers started to use mist nets to increase the chances of capture. Mist nets are known to intercept all birds that fly through them
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. Even when the birds are released, this method may induce injuries and lower the survival probability of individuals
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>. In addition, this poaching method is potentially threatening to many migratory birds. Indeed, western Maghreb lies in a major migration flyway where millions of birds fly through this region or make stopovers during their migration
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>. Therefore, the understanding of the potential damages caused by the European goldfinch's poaching in western Maghreb may shed light on why many Afro-Palearctic migrant birds have declined during the past two decades
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The causes of changes in the geographic distribution of the European goldfinch in western Maghreb and the potential consequences of its intensive poaching on Afro-Palearctic migratory species have not been surveyed yet. Here, we first combined observations from our field visits with questionnaire data of (ex-)poachers to build historical presence/absence data on the species in western Maghreb and assess the changes of its distribution with a dynamic occupancy model
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span>. Second, we estimate the current population size of European goldfinch in captivity by conducting a survey that aims at estimating the number of individuals held in cage per family to reveal the cultural importance of the species and the intensity of poaching. Third, we evaluate the international trading network of the species in western Maghreb using seizure data from Algerian conservation authorities and gendarmerie. Finally, we highlight the potential collateral damage of European goldfinch poaching on local and Afro-Palearctic migratory birds based on information gathered from bird markets and ex-poachers.
