 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The use of mist nets as poaching tool in western Maghreb started in 2009–2010. Our survey conducted on 12 poachers from three Algerian provinces revealed that goldfinch trapping with mist nets during 2010–2012 captured 16 bird species besides European goldfinch, belonging to 10 families (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). Of these species, five (31.25%) are migratory and the rest (68.75%) are resident. To make the connection between the use of mist nets and the increase of cage-bird species in the flea markets, we surveyed the number of cage-bird species sold in the flea markets of the same three Algerian provinces during 2008–2015. A checklist of species sold in the market in the same three Algerian provinces is shown in Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>. Interestingly, there was a significant increase of the number of cage-bird species during this period (GLM Poisson: slope = 0.142, z-value = 11.28, P &lt; 0.0001) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>). The average number of species a﻿cross provinces (﻿excluding exotic species) that are regularly sold in the flea markets was 1.18 ± 0.39 (±SD, range = 1–2, n = 75) in 2008 (before mist net poaching) and 3.27 ± 0.82 (±SD, range = 1–5, n = 69) in 2015 (after mist net poaching). Overall, five Palearctic Fringilid cage-birds were regularly recorded, of which four are resident and one is migratory. Importantly, they are all passerines that are caught as by-catch of the European goldfinch poaching, suggesting that the severe decline of the European goldfinch might have yielded new target species for domestication which perpetuates the poaching issues in the region.
