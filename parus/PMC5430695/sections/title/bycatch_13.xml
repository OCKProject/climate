 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To obtain a list of species captured as by-catch with mist nets, we conducted a survey on 12 poachers from three Algerian provinces (Guelma, Skikda, and Annaba). We obtained data only for the period 2010–2012. We were not able to gather quantitative data regarding the number of individuals captured for each species since poachers were careful﻿ and not willing to fully cooperate on an illegal act punishable by law. To investigate the potential relationship between the changes in the number of cage-bird species sold in the market and mist net trapping, each week we recorded cage-bird species that are sold in the weekly flea markets of the same three provinces at least 20 times every year from 2008 to 2015 (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a>). We excluded all exotic species and included only species that are locally resident or migratory. Then, we estimated the temporal pattern of the number of cage-bird species that were sold in the market during 2008–2015 with a generalized Poisson model using year as a fixed effect.
