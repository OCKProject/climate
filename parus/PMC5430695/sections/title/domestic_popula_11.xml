 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To estimate the number of European goldfinches currently in captivity in Algeria, we selected 15 provinces well-distributed across the Northern part of the country (five in the east, five in the center and five in the west, Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>; Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). In each province, we selected typically 3–5 districts where 3–7 buildings were sampled (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>). Each building has a number of apartments and we assumed that each apartment has one family which is the case in Algeria and western Maghreb. For instance, a typical building has 10 to 12 apartments which corresponds to 10 to 12 families. Overall, 83 (982 families), 52 (949 families) and 51 (790 families) buildings were sampled from the East, center and West, respectively. Given our sample size and geographic coverage, we assume that our sampling do not lead to biased estimations of the average number of goldfinches owned per family and the number of owners that carry out captive breeding. We calculated the total number of goldfinches domesticated in Algeria by multiplying the average number of goldfinches owned per family by the estimated number of families in the country (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a>). Because the cultural importance and popularity of the European goldfinch is similar in the three countries of western Maghreb, we also estimated the total number of individuals held in captivity for the entire region using Algerian estimates.
