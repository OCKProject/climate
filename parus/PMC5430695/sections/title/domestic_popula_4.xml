 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We investigated the number of goldfinches owned by 2721 families distributed in 15 Algerian provinces in 2016. A total of 2517 goldfinches was counted, which corresponds to an average of 0.925 (95% CI: 0.841–1.008) goldfinch per family (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). The total number of European goldfinch in captivity in Algeria was estimated by multiplying the total number of families (see Supplementary Material) by the average number of European goldfinches in captivity from the sample. We obtained an estimated total of 6.35 million (95% CI: 5.78–6.92 million) captive European goldfinches in Algeria, and 15.6 million (95% CI: 14.2–17.0 million) in the western Maghreb. Surprisingly, we found that only a proportion of 0.03 (95% CI: 0.029–0.043) of owners carry out in-cage breeding which suggests that traders rely on wild populations of the species to meet people’s needs. However, the quasi-extinct wild populations of European goldfinch in Algeria and Tunisia are far from being enough to supply people with wild European goldfinches, and thus most domestic individuals most likely come from illegal importation.
