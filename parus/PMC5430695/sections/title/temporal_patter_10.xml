 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To investigate the changes in the economic value of the European goldfinch in the region, long-term traders in eight flea markets from different Algerian provinces (Oran, Algiers, Blida, Annaba, Guelma, Jijel, Skikda, and Souk Ahras) were asked for the yearly mean price of adults from 1990 to 2015. As the economy and purchasing power changed considerably in Algeria during the past two decades, we also calculated the price corrected for the per capita monthly income (PCI) by dividing the price of the goldfinch of a given year by the monthly per capita income of the same year
