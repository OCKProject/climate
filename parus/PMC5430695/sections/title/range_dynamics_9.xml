 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study site is the western Maghreb which includes Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco. Because we were interested in the changes of the range distribution of European goldfinch during the past 26 years, we compiled data of the species occurrence in western Maghreb within 237 grids (25 × 25 km²) from poachers and field visits, and we built a detection/non-detection dataset which included observations before (1990–1991) and after the intensive poaching (2015–2016) in each site (grid) (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). The selection of the grids was based on our social network that we could establish for this project. The European goldfinch is easy to identify in the wild because of its unique and distinguishable morphological features with respect to other local passerines. Data collected for the period 1990–1991 were based on poachers recalling having observed goldfinches that they personally poached from the wild. We are confident that data obtained from people are accurate since we used the following criteria to increase the quality of detection data: (1) we selected those who used to own the bird and poach it in the wild (expert poachers), and thus the probability of false positive detection is very low; (2) observations/trapping were made when weather conditions were good, so there is no detection-bias related to weather; (3) we included only observers and poachers who made at least 10 visits/year/grid and stayed at least at least 2 hours in the field; (4) poachers were asked whether they observed the species and not whether they trapped it because in many cases the bird is observed but not trapped. To control for consistency in sampling efforts for the two study periods (1990–1991 and 2015–2016), we maintained a balanced sampling effort for both periods by limiting the number of observers (or poachers) to one observer/year/grid.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since our purpose is to reveal changes of species occupancy resulting from 26 years of intensive poaching, we considered period (1990–1991 or 2015–2016) as a primary sampling occasion and year as a secondary sampling occasion. We used dynamic occupancy models using the R package unmarked
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span> in R 3.2.1
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>
  </span> to estimate the initial occupancy, extinction, colonization, and detection probabilities. We tested for potential relationships of these parameters with covariates namely vegetation density, elevation and longitude estimated with raster map analysis and interpolated digital elevation model using Global Mapper (version 15.0,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conducted model selection using Akaike's information criterion (AIC) on models with increasing complexity in terms of covariates. Both linear and quadratic effects for covariates were fitted. We first fitted the model with constant parameters and compared it with a model where detection was time-dependent. After selecting which model was better, we added to detection probability (
  <span class="italic">p</span>) the linear and quadratic effects of vegetation cover and elevation. Then we repeated the operation for initial occupancy, extinction and colonization probabilities by increasing covariate complexity and performing AIC-based model selection
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>. The goodness of fit of the overall best model was assessed with a parametric bootstrapping approach
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span> based on a chi-square test statistic for the AIC-best model (P-value = 0.20) which indicated that there was no lack of fit and thus the model can be used for predictions. To obtain predictions (with statistical uncertainty) for initial occupancy, extinction and colonization and detection probabilities, we used the 
  <span class="italic">predict</span> function in 
  <span class="italic">unmarked</span>. Parametric bootstrap (replicates = 1000) was used to calculate confidence intervals for the initial occupancy, extinction and colonization probabilities using the 
  <span class="italic">parboot</span> function in 
  <span class="italic">unmarked</span>. We produced maps of predicted occupancy before (1990–1991) and after (2015–2016) the industrial poaching of the species with MapInfo Professional software (version 15.0,
