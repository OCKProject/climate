  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of the 237 selected grids (25 × 25 km²) which cover the potential habitat of the European goldfinch in western Maghreb, the species was observed in 115 grids (48.5%, n = 237) during 1990–1991 and in only 37 grids (15.6%, n = 237) during 2015–2016. The highest decline was recorded in Tunisia and Algeria where the number of occupied grids decreased from 16 (38.1%, n = 42) in 1990–1991 to 0 (0%, n = 42) in 2015–2016 and from 58 (48.7%, n = 119) in 1990–1991 to 3 (2.5%, n = 119) in 2015–2016, respectively. In Morocco, the number of occupied grids declined from 41 (53.9%, n = 76) in 1990–1991 to 34 (44.7%, n = 76) in 2015–2016.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To estimate the changes in range distribution, we used dynamic occupancy models which account for detection probability. The dynamic occupancy model showed strong evidence for time-dependence in detection probability. Detection probability was influenced by vegetation cover (linear and quadratic), elevation (linear and quadratic), and by the interaction terms between elevation and vegetation cover (vegetation-by-elevation and vegetation-by-elevation²). Initial occupancy was affected by elevation (linear and quadratic) and vegetation cover. Extinction probability was best explained by longitude (linear and quadratic) and elevation, whereas colonization probability was constant (Table

   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). The temporal pattern of the price of the species showed an exponential growth (R² = 0.94, P &lt; 0.0001; Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>), revealing a very rapid increase during 2005–2016. On average (across provinces), the price increased 92.2 times from $1.08 ± 0.70 in 1990–1994 to $99.9 in 2011–2016. By correcting the price by the monthly per capita income (PCI), it still showed an exponential growth over time (R² = 0.89, P &lt; 0.0001; Fig.

   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). The total number of European goldfinch in captivity in Algeria was estimated by multiplying the total number of families (see Supplementary Material) by the average number of European goldfinches in captivity from the sample. We obtained an estimated total of 6.35 million (95% CI: 5.78–6.92 million) captive European goldfinches in Algeria, and 15.6 million (95% CI: 14.2–17.0 million) in the western Maghreb. Surprisingly, we found that only a proportion of 0.03 (95% CI: 0.029–0.043) of owners carry out in-cage breeding which suggests that traders rely on wild populations of the species to meet people’s needs. However, the quasi-extinct wild populations of European goldfinch in Algeria and Tunisia are far from being enough to supply people with wild European goldfinches, and thus most domestic individuals most likely come from illegal importation.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The use of mist nets as poaching tool in western Maghreb started in 2009–2010. Our survey conducted on 12 poachers from three Algerian provinces revealed that goldfinch trapping with mist nets during 2010–2012 captured 16 bird species besides European goldfinch, belonging to 10 families (Table 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). Of these species, five (31.25%) are migratory and the rest (68.75%) are resident. To make the connection between the use of mist nets and the increase of cage-bird species in the flea markets, we surveyed the number of cage-bird species sold in the flea markets of the same three Algerian provinces during 2008–2015. A checklist of species sold in the market in the same three Algerian provinces is shown in Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>. Interestingly, there was a significant increase of the number of cage-bird species during this period (GLM Poisson: slope = 0.142, z-value = 11.28, P &lt; 0.0001) (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>). The average number of species a﻿cross provinces (﻿excluding exotic species) that are regularly sold in the flea markets was 1.18 ± 0.39 (±SD, range = 1–2, n = 75) in 2008 (before mist net poaching) and 3.27 ± 0.82 (±SD, range = 1–5, n = 69) in 2015 (after mist net poaching). Overall, five Palearctic Fringilid cage-birds were regularly recorded, of which four are resident and one is migratory. Importantly, they are all passerines that are caught as by-catch of the European goldfinch poaching, suggesting that the severe decline of the European goldfinch might have yielded new target species for domestication which perpetuates the poaching issues in the region.
