  <p>Predicted relationship of three parameters of the dynamic occupancy model with covariates (vegetation cover, elevation and longitude) for the range dynamics of the European goldfinch (
   <span class="italic">Carduelis carduelis</span>) in western Maghreb from 1990–1991 to 2015–2016. (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) Predicted response of occupancy probability in 1990–1991. (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) Extinction probability. (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) Detection probability in 1990–1991. (
   <span class="bold">d</span>) Detection probability in 2015–2016. The gradient of colour from grey to red corresponds to a range of low to high probability. Values of observed covariates at 237 sample plots are presented as circles.
