  <p>Dynamics of occupancy probability before (1990–1991) and after (2015–2016) the industrial poaching of the wild European goldfinch in western Maghreb. Occupancy probabilities were calculated based on the best dynamic occupancy model (see results). The gradient of color from yellow to red corresponds to a range of low to high occupancy probability. One grid is 25 × 25 km². The grids do not cover the entire geographic area of the three countries because areas where the species is unlikely to exist (desert) were excluded. The maps were created with MapInfo Professional software (version 15.0,
