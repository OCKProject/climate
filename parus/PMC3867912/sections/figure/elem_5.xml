  <p>Pairwise Φ
   <sub>st</sub> (mtDNA) and G′′
   <sub>ST</sub> (microsatellites and 
   <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene) comparisons between all populations. Dotted line in each graph (5A and B) indicates the 1:1 neutrality expectation of similar differentiation among both genetic markers. (A) is based on microsatellite loci and control region sequences and (B) is based on differentiation in microsatellites and 
   <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene alleles. The same patterns are observed if only recent populations were analyzed (data not shown).
