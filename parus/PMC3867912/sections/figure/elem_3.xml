  <p>Median-joining haplotype networks for recent and historic 
   <span class="italic">Ficedula hypoleuca</span> populations, based on mtDNA control region sequences. (A) Overview of recent (white) and historic (black) haplotypes found in Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands. (B) Haplotypes are additionally color coded according to their geographical and temporal origin (Germany: green; Netherlands: orange; Sweden: blue; historic samples: light color). Only haplotypes which occur more than once are shown. The size of the circles is proportional to the frequency of the haplotypes, and the lines indicate single mutation. Small red dots denote median vectors.
