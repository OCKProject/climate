 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ten microsatellite loci were amplified using primers published by Leder et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b59" href="#b59">2008</a>). We chose primer combinations with nonoverlapping product sizes, using two different color labels, and tested them for the feasibility of multiplexing. As we use historic samples, we selected product sizes with a maximum length of around 400 bp. End-labeled forward primers were obtained with either Alexa647 (Invitrogen) or IRD700 (Metabion, Martinsried, Germany) fluorescent dye (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Table S2</a>). Multiplex PCRs were performed with the Type-it Microsatellite PCR Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to instructions of the manufacturer. The PCRs were performed in a S1000 thermocycler (BIO-RAD), starting with an initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, then 32 cycles of 95°C 30 sec, 55°C 90 sec, 72°C 60 sec, and a final extension of 60°C for 30 min. All historic samples were analyzed at least two times independently (see above; Morin et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b70" href="#b70">2001</a>). Microsatellite loci longer than 200 bp were amplified separately for all museum samples, using the same PCR program and final primer concentrations of 0.2 μmol/L each. PCR products (1 μL) were directly mixed with SLS and a size standard (DNA Size Standard Kit-400 Beckmann Coulter), electrophoresed and analyzed on a CEQ 2000 (Beckman Coulter) automatic DNA sequencer.
