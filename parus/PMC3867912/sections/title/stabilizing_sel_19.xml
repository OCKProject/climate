 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among blue tit and bluethroat populations, significant associations between pairwise 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>st</sub>-values based on 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene allele frequency and those based on microsatellites were found (Johnsen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b54" href="#b54">2007</a>). A different pattern was found in pied flycatcher (this study) and barn swallow (Dor et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">2011</a>) populations, that is, no association was detected and much lower differentiation at the 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> poly-Q locus than at microsatellite loci was found. In contrast to our expectation that genetic differentiation at candidate genes might be larger than at neutral loci, we observed the opposite pattern. The 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene in pied flycatchers seems to show no sign of neutral evolution, but a very low differentiation among populations compared with neutral markers (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">5</a>B). Similarly, intraspecific variation in two further candidate genes coding for a potentially sexually selected trait in the pied flycatcher (UV plumage coloration and visual perception of that trait) was recently demonstrated to deviate from the expectation of neutral evolution, too (Lehtonen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b61" href="#b61">2012</a>). As a consequence, these genes and the avian 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene locus might well underlie stabilizing selection in the pied flycatcher. Equivalent to comparisons of neutral markers with phenotypic (
  <span class="italic">P</span>
  <sub>ST</sub>) or quantitative (
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>ST</sub>) differentiation, lower differentiation in potentially selected traits or genes than in neutral loci suggests that natural selection must be favoring the same mean phenotype in different populations (Meril√§ and Cnorkrak 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b69" href="#b69">2001</a>; Goudet and Martin 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">2007</a>). Analyses of genetic differentiation among barn swallow populations revealed patterns of stabilizing selection as found in pied flycatchers (Dor et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">2011</a>). The observed spatial and temporal variation in migration and breeding phenology in pied flycatchers (Both et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" href="#b8">2004</a>) cannot solely be explained by variation at the 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene locus.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">So far, it is not clear whether adaptation of migration and breeding time to rapid environmental changes is restricted through limited phenotypic plasticity and/or a lack of genetic variation on which selection can act. The increased selection for breeding date as observed in several long-term population studies (Both and Visser 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" href="#b6">2001</a>; Goodenough et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" href="#b36">2011</a>) may not result in an adaptive response if the variation in breeding date has no genetic background. Adaptation may work through immigration of individuals of more southern origin that disperse northwards and thereby introduce genes for earlier timing (Edelaar et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">2008</a>). Indeed, in pied flycatchers, more southern populations migrate earlier in spring (Both 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" href="#b5">2010</a>), but whether this earlier timing is genetically coded or the result of ontogeny is still unclear. Our results suggest that the 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene variation considered here is not a good candidate for such an adaptive process because neither between- nor within-population variation was related to variation in timing. The general lack of geographical variation in neutral genetic markers suggests that dispersal is an important process in this and other species of long-distance migrants, which would swamp most of the declines in genetic diversity in shrinking populations. This observation poses the question how much of the observed local phenotypic variation has a genetic origin. In fact, in the Spanish pied flycatcher population included in our analysis, spring arrival of males and breeding dates are shaped by a mixed-mating strategy of this species (sexual selection was suggested to be the main driving force of protandry; Canal et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" href="#b13">2012</a>). Identification of more candidate genes may help to unravel these processes, as will experiments in which individuals are translocated to breed in distant places and which consider how their offspring will behave relative to the local population (Burger and Both 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" href="#b12">2011</a>).
