 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 273 individuals from nine populations were successfully screened for variation at ten microsatellite loci. Only a few populations–marker combinations showed homozygote excess (17 of 90) or stuttering (2 of 90), and no evidence for large allelic dropout (12 of 90) was found. Private alleles were found in all populations (Table 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a>). The Spanish (15.15%) and the historic (11.76%) and recent (11.29%) Dutch populations exhibited the highest percentage of private alleles, whereas the lowest proportion was found in the Finnish and Norwegian populations (2.56% and 3.61%, respectively). The observed heterozygosity (
  <span class="italic">H</span>
  <sub>o</sub>) covered a range from 0.681 to 0.783 with a mean of 0.722 (Table 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The overall fixation index was 0.02 and more than 10-fold lower than mitochondrial differentiation. 97.91% of the variation was found within populations. Pairwise comparisons between populations ranged from zero (recent Germany/Norway) to 0.05 (Spain/historic Netherlands). In concordance with control region divergence, we found that the Spanish population was significantly differentiated from all other populations at nuclear loci (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Table S3</a>). In contrast to the mtDNA results, which revealed no significant differentiation among Scandinavian populations, pairwise F-statistics based on microsatellite data indicated a low but significant level of genetic differentiation between the Finnish population and both the recent and the historic population from Sweden. When historic and recent populations from the same country were compared, only the German populations showed a little, but significant differentiation (
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>ST</sub> = 0.008; 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.018 ± 0.012). Overall, we observed a tendency of less genetic variation (haplotype diversity and allelic richness) in the current Dutch population than in the historic Dutch population (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">3</a>).
