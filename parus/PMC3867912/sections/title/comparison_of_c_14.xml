 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regardless of the marker system used, geographical differentiation was much more pronounced than differentiation between historic and recent samples from the same country (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">5</a>). This was also the case if the highly differentiated Spanish population was excluded from the analysis (data not shown). Genetic differentiation measured by 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>st</sub>-values was about 10-fold higher on mtDNA level (control region) compared with nuclear markers (microsatellites and 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene). However, there was a significant association between pairwise Φ
  <sub>st</sub> values based on mtDNA and G′′
  <sub>ST</sub> values based on microsatellite loci (

  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.64; Mantel test, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.01; Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig06" href="#fig06">6</a>A). On the other hand, G′′
  <sub>ST</sub> values based on microsatellite loci were not significantly correlated with G′′
  <sub>ST</sub> values based on 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene loci (Mantel test, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.38; Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig06" href="#fig06">6</a>B). In contrast, differentiation at the 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene locus was significantly lower than differentiation at neutral loci (
  <span class="italic">t</span> = 8.2705, df = 36.672, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001, Welch two sample 
  <span class="italic">t</span>-test) which is in concordance with the finding that populations showed hardly any genetic divergence at the 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene locus.
