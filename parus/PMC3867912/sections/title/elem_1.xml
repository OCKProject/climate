  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We investigated populations of pied flycatchers from six regions in Europe: Finland, Germany, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the Netherlands. Altogether, 311 samples were collected from specimens dating between 1901 and 2010 (for origin of samples and collection dates see Fig. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">2</a>, 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Table S1</a>). Most samples collected before 1990s were taken from nest box populations or tissue collections, while specimens collected before the 1980s were sampled from study skins or feather collections of various museums. We chose only samples collected during the regional-specific breeding periods (Cramp and Perrins

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b73" href="#b73">2008</a>) to ensure sampling of local populations. This resulted in 
   <span class="italic">a priori</span> limited availability of appropriate specimens in all collections. Samples taken in the field (1990s and later) comprised blood and tissue (both stored as frozen material) and feather samples (stored dry or in alcohol; see 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Table S1</a>). Feathers were always sampled at the calami. From historic collection material (whole skins), we usually took toe pad tissue for DNA extraction, but we also took a small skin patch from the ventral side of some historic specimens (and in very few cases, feathers from mounted feather collections;

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">DNA isolation</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">DNA from frozen tissue and blood samples, as well as from nestling feather samples kept in alcohol (recent material), was extracted using the DTAB method (Gustinich et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" href="#b40">1991</a>). Extraction from toe pads and skin patches (historic museum material) was carried out in a separate clean laboratory. There each step of analysis (sampling and extraction) was carried out on separate working benches. DNA from museum specimens and dry feather samples from extant populations was extracted using the sbeadex® forensic kit (LGC Genomics, Berlin, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions with small modifications, for example, overnight incubation of tissue with proteinase K (instead of one hour). In order to yield a sufficiently high DNA concentration for microsatellite analyses, we performed two successive elution steps with a volume of 20 μL of sterile water (instead of one step with 60 μL elution volume). In order to avoid cross-contamination, extant and historic samples were never treated at the same time, and after each step, working benches were cleaned with DNA-away (Molecular Bio Products, Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada), and both benches and laboratory rooms were set under UV-light for at least four hours. The amount and the quality of DNA isolates were checked on 1.4% agarose gels.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PCR amplifications</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Control region: We successfully amplified a 271-bp fragment of the mitochondrial control region of 309 pied flycatcher individuals. Primers were designed on the basis of an alignment of control region sequences of different bird species belonging to the family Muscicapidae. We used the forward primer crFHfor 5′GCCATACGGGTATGCTATG 3′ and the reverse primer crFHrev 5′GCTTGGGAGTTCCTGAAAG 3′. PCRs were performed in 12.5 μL using a Tetrad PTC-225 thermal cycler (BIO-RAD, München, Germany). Each reaction contained about 1–10 ng template DNA, 2.5 pmol each primer, 0.2 mmol/L each dNTP, 2 mmol/L MgCl2, 1× amplification buffer, and 0.5 U Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany). The PCR started with an initial denaturation at 94°C for 1 min followed by five cycles: 94°C 40 sec, 45°C 40 sec, and 72°C 1 min; then cycling 35 times: 94°C 40 sec, 52°C 40 sec, 72°C 1 min; ending with a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis using 1.4% agarose gels and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide (1 ppm). In agreement with Töpfer et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b96" href="#b96">2011</a>), historic DNA isolates from foot pads yielded better results than DNA isolates from skin patches. After purifying the PCR products with Agencourt AMPURE (Beckman Coulter), both strands were sequenced with the following PCR program: 96°C 20 sec, 50°C 20 sec, 60°C 4 min, and 39 cycles, using GenomeLab DTCS-Quick Start Kit (Beckmann Coulter, Krefeld, Germany). Dye terminators were removed with the Agencourt CleanSEQ kit (Beckmann Coulter), and amplicons were analyzed on a CEQ 2000 (Beckman Coulter) automatic sequencer.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From the first DNA extracts, all historic samples were amplified and sequenced at least twice. In all cases, both sequencing reactions yielded identical results. In order to control for the possible occurrence of single-base errors in PCR products from museum specimens (Sefc et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b90" href="#b90">2007</a>), DNA was newly extracted from a set of 126 original samples and was re-analyzed via independent PCR and sequencing reactions (most of these were historic samples plus a few recent samples that carried unique haplotypes). Each step of analysis (sampling, extraction, and PCR) was performed in a clean laboratory on separate working benches that were decontaminated by UV-light exposure after each working step. Negative controls were performed for both DNA extractions and PCRs in the control analysis, and spot tests of PCRs from negative controls were also sequenced in order to test for possible contamination. Sequences of negative controls never showed a considerable signal. For haplotypes that deviated from those resulting from the first analysis, the respective samples were re-analyzed at least one more time (starting from PCR). For 14 samples, haplotypes from the first analysis were not reproducible in the control analysis (11%). However, all of these deviating haplotypes were reproducible in one or even two replicate PCR and sequencing reactions from the second DNA extract. For seven of fourteen ambiguous samples, deviations between first and control sequencing were due to double peaks at the respective polymorphic sites. Among the ten polymorphic sites concerned, six cases corresponded to the more common overlaid signals of either the two purine or the two pyrimidine bases (C + T or A + G double peaks).

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Microsatellites</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ten microsatellite loci were amplified using primers published by Leder et al. (
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b59" href="#b59">2008</a>). We chose primer combinations with nonoverlapping product sizes, using two different color labels, and tested them for the feasibility of multiplexing. As we use historic samples, we selected product sizes with a maximum length of around 400 bp. End-labeled forward primers were obtained with either Alexa647 (Invitrogen) or IRD700 (Metabion, Martinsried, Germany) fluorescent dye (see 
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Table S2</a>). Multiplex PCRs were performed with the Type-it Microsatellite PCR Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to instructions of the manufacturer. The PCRs were performed in a S1000 thermocycler (BIO-RAD), starting with an initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, then 32 cycles of 95°C 30 sec, 55°C 90 sec, 72°C 60 sec, and a final extension of 60°C for 30 min. All historic samples were analyzed at least two times independently (see above; Morin et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b70" href="#b70">2001</a>). Microsatellite loci longer than 200 bp were amplified separately for all museum samples, using the same PCR program and final primer concentrations of 0.2 μmol/L each. PCR products (1 μL) were directly mixed with SLS and a size standard (DNA Size Standard Kit-400 Beckmann Coulter), electrophoresed and analyzed on a CEQ 2000 (Beckman Coulter) automatic DNA sequencer.

    <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene
   </div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For initial PCR tests, we used the primer pairs from Johnsen et al. (
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b54" href="#b54">2007</a>), to amplify the variable region of the 
    <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene locus (corresponding to the human 
    <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene exon 20; Steeves et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b92" href="#b92">1999</a>) with the following settings: initial denaturation at 94°C for 2 min, then 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 58°C for 30 sec, 72°C for 1 min and a final extension at 72°C for 7 min. In order to verify PCR products, a subset of 37 fragments was sequenced from Dutch and Spanish samples with 25 cycles of 96°C for 10 sec, 50°C for 5 sec, and 60°C for 4 min. Finally, the 
    <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene locus of pied flycatchers was screened for length polymorphism by PCR amplification and electrophoresis using an automatic DNA sequencer. PCR was conducted with an Alexa647 labeled forward primer 5′TGGAGCGGTAATGGTACCAAGTA 3′ and the reverse primer 5′ TCAGCTGTGACTGAGCTGGCT 3′ (Johnsen et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b54" href="#b54">2007</a>) with a final concentration of 0.2 μM each. We applied the same PCR conditions and detection methods as described for the microsatellites, except that PCR products from recent samples were diluted 1:10 to 1:100 before electrophoresis.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Museum samples for which we could not perform at least two replicates with concordant results for each marker (control region, microsatellites, and 
    <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene), or which were genotyped with less than eight of ten microsatellites, were discarded from further analyses. Swedish pied flycatchers collected on Öland are likely to be migrants heading to northern Sweden (Fransson and Hall-Karlsson 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">2008</a>). As we could not rule out that they also may migrate to Finland or Norway, we reanalyzed our data excluding these specimens. The exclusion of all potential migrants from Swedish populations did not alter the main picture, and therefore, we report results based on the complete data set.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistical analysis</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Samples were assigned to groups according to their geographical origin. Dutch, German, and Swedish samples were subdivided into extant and historic samples and Spanish, Finish, and Norwegian samples were classified as three further recent populations only, because no historic sampling was available from these regions. On the temporal scale, we had a considerable sampling gap in the 1980s (from 1977 to 1995), and therefore, we labeled all samples collected before 1977 as “historic” or “museum samples” (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 110) and those samples taken after 1995 as “extant” or “recent” (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 201). This temporal division coincides with the first observations of decline in pied flycatcher populations in the Netherlands in the mid-1980s, as well as with a general decline of forest-dwelling long-distance migrants during the same time (Both et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" href="#b10">2010</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Control region sequences as well as 
   <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene sequences were aligned with BioEdit 7.0.9.0 (Hall 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" href="#b43">1999</a>) and verified by eye. Nucleotide and haplotype diversities for the control region were calculated with the program DnaSP 5.10 (Librado and Rozas

   <sub>st</sub> (e.g., G′′
   <sub>ST</sub>) for microsatellite loci and the 
   <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene and Φ
   <sub>ST</sub> for mtDNA were evaluated with GenAlEx ver. 6.5 (Meirmans and Hedrick 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b67" href="#b67">2011</a>; Peakall and Smouse 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b155" href="#b155">2012</a>). Private haplotypes, private alleles, observed heterozygosity (

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" href="#b28">2010</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ten microsatellite loci were tested with MICRO-CHECKER 2.2.3 (van Oosterhout et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b78" href="#b78">2004</a>), using 1000 randomizations and a 95% confidence interval, for genotyping errors due to stuttering, large allelic dropout, and null alleles.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to investigate the phylogeographic relationships among haplotypes, we constructed networks with the program Network 4.6.0.0. (Bandelt et al.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" href="#b31">2001</a>; Polzin and Daneshmand 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b82" href="#b82">2003</a>). The median-joining method with transversions weighted three times more than transitions was used to build a network. Both the network and the alignment were cross-checked for any kind of sequencing artifacts, particularly with respect to the historic sampling. Amplification errors can be detected by an increased frequency of unique tip haplotypes (occurring in single individuals) mostly characterized by C to T substitutions in the network representing historic museum specimens (Stiller et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b94" href="#b94">2006</a>; Sefc et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b90" href="#b90">2007</a>). For graphical illustration, we chose the “frequency one criterion”, which excludes unique haplotypes, and the star contraction algorithm in order to simplify the network.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model-based clustering method structure by Prichard et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b84" href="#b84">2000</a>) was used to infer the number of clusters (K) of individuals based on microsatellite data. Simulations were run assuming the admixture model with correlated allele frequencies and using the sampling location as prior. Ten independent runs, with ten replicates for each K (1–10), were performed with a 500,000 burn-in period followed by 500,000 MCMC repeats after burn-in. To find the true value of K, we performed the K-statistic (Prichard et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b84" href="#b84">2000</a>). The results were compared with K estimates based on the method by Evanno et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" href="#b27">2005</a>) as implemented in STRUCTURE HARVESTER (Earl and vonHoldt
