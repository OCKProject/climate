 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We investigated populations of pied flycatchers from six regions in Europe: Finland, Germany, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the Netherlands. Altogether, 311 samples were collected from specimens dating between 1901 and 2010 (for origin of samples and collection dates see Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">2</a>, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Table S1</a>). Most samples collected before 1990s were taken from nest box populations or tissue collections, while specimens collected before the 1980s were sampled from study skins or feather collections of various museums. We chose only samples collected during the regional-specific breeding periods (Cramp and Perrins

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Table S1</a>). Feathers were always sampled at the calami. From historic collection material (whole skins), we usually took toe pad tissue for DNA extraction, but we also took a small skin patch from the ventral side of some historic specimens (and in very few cases, feathers from mounted feather collections;
