 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nearly all frozen blood and tissue samples (collected after 1980) were successfully used for the amplification and sequencing of the control region, 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene and for microsatellite analysis (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Table S1</a>). For the period of 1940–1979, control region sequences were recovered in 98% of all samples and at least eight microsatellite loci (which were included in the analysis) were successfully amplified in 74% of all cases. Samples collected before 1940 yielded good sequencing results with regard to mtDNA (91%), but for most samples older than 1940, less than ten microsatellite loci were amplified, mostly due to dropout of some loci of a length greater than 320 bp (only 9% of the samples from this period scored eight or more loci; see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Table S1</a>). Regardless of locus length, the success rate of PCR amplifications from samples older than 34 years predominantly depended on the quality but not on the age of the preserved specimens.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Control region: A total of 304 pied flycatcher individuals from nine populations (Table 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a>) were analyzed for variation in a 271-bp fragment of the mtDNA control region. Among all individuals examined, a total of 61 haplotypes were identified (27 variable sites), ranging from eight in the current Swedish population to 20 in the current as well as in the historic German population. The most common haplotype was found in 59 individuals (almost 20%) and was widely distributed across all extant and historic populations except those from the Iberian Peninsula. Three other common haplotypes were present in 39, 36, and 25 individuals, respectively, and had similar geographical and temporal distributions. About two-thirds (65.6%) of all haplotypes represented private haplotypes. The historic and the recent German population harbored 40% private haplotypes, whereas the current and historic Dutch, the Finnish, the Norwegian, and the current and historic Swedish populations shared more than 70% (73–82%) of their haplotypes with other populations. Only the Spanish population showed a highly distinct pattern, that is, nine private haplotypes but only one haplotype shared with other populations. Nucleotide diversities were largely similar among geographical and temporal samplings and ranged from 0.006 to 0.0095 (with highest values in the extant Norwegian and the historic Swedish population; Table 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a>). There was no considerable difference of nucleotide diversities among the temporal samples from the same region (Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands, Table 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a>).

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 273 individuals from nine populations were successfully screened for variation at ten microsatellite loci. Only a few populations–marker combinations showed homozygote excess (17 of 90) or stuttering (2 of 90), and no evidence for large allelic dropout (12 of 90) was found. Private alleles were found in all populations (Table 
    <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a>). The Spanish (15.15%) and the historic (11.76%) and recent (11.29%) Dutch populations exhibited the highest percentage of private alleles, whereas the lowest proportion was found in the Finnish and Norwegian populations (2.56% and 3.61%, respectively).

Pairwise comparisons between populations ranged from zero (recent Germany/Norway) to 0.05 (Spain/historic Netherlands). In concordance with control region divergence, we found that the Spanish population was significantly differentiated from all other populations at nuclear loci (
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Table S3</a>). In contrast to the mtDNA results, which revealed no significant differentiation among Scandinavian populations, pairwise F-statistics based on microsatellite data indicated a low but significant level of genetic differentiation between the Finnish population and both the recent and the historic population from Sweden. When historic and recent populations from the same country were compared, only the German populations showed a little, but significant differentiation (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the control region alignment, we did not find any bias with respect to an increased frequency of C to T substitutions in the historic sampling. The network based on recent and historic samples (61 haplotypes) contained nine unique tip haplotypes (not shown); however, among these, we found no bias with respect to our historic sampling. In fact, eight unique tip haplotypes occurred in the extant populations.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The network based on recent samples only (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Figure S1</a>) displayed a strong genetic differentiation of the Spanish population, that is, sharing only one rare haplotype (which occurs only once in each population) with the Finnish and Swedish populations. All other haplotypes were exclusively found in the Spanish population. There was no geographical structure observed among the other European populations. The majority of haplotypes was shared at least between two populations, and three common haplotypes were found in all populations except Spain.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to describe the distribution of haplotypes among current and historic populations, we reconstructed a network using control region sequences of Dutch, German, and Swedish populations. Like the other analyses (microsatellites and candidate genes), this revealed very little temporal differentiation (Fig. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">4</a>A) and again no geographical differentiation (Fig. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">4</a>B). Nearly all haplotypes of the network were represented in both recent and historic samples. Only four haplotypes were exclusively found in recent or historic populations, respectively. Dutch and German populations shared 7 haplotypes which did not occur in the Swedish population.

The second cluster corresponded to birds from Sweden, and the third exhibited samples from Finland, Germany, and Norway. The fourth cluster harbored all individuals from the Netherlands. In Structure analyses which resulted in K = 3, the Swedish populations fell into the cluster with Finland, Germany, and Norway. Using no prior information on sample geographical origin, K = 2 was identified as the most likely. Only the Spanish birds could be discriminated from all other populations. This pattern was supported by Evanno′s ΔK method.

   <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene. We identified five length variants ranging from 193 bp (10 poly-Q repeats) to 205 bp (14 poly-Q repeats). At least three different alleles were found in each population, and all five alleles were detected in the current Dutch as well as in the historic German population. No pied flycatcher population exhibited private alleles. However, allele 205 was only found once in a historic German sample and in one recent sample from the Netherlands, and allele 193 was not found in extant Norwegian and Swedish samples. The remaining alleles were found in all populations with allele 199 being much more abundant in all populations than the other two. The observed heterozygosity (
   <span class="italic">H</span>
   <sub>o</sub>) was consistent over the populations and ranged from 0.400 to 0.563 (Table 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pairwise comparisons among all populations yielded 
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>st</sub>-values ranging from zero to 0.0174. Only the pairwise comparison between the recent populations from the Netherlands and Spain showed low (
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>ST</sub>-value = 0.0174), but significant differentiation at the 
   <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene locus (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Table S3</a>). The overall genetic differentiation index F
   <sub>st</sub> was zero. Results from AMOVA highlight that no variation was found among populations, but 100% of the variation is explained by variation within the populations.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A subset of 205 samples was further analyzed for sex-specific differentiation at the poly-Q locus. GLM analysis performed in STATISTICA yielded no significant differences between geographical regions (
    <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.54) nor any interaction of population x gender (
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Table S4</a>). Forty-two pied flycatcher individuals from the Spanish nest box population were tested for a correlation between laying dates (males were assigned the laying date of their mated female) and poly-Q genotype variation. We did not find any association of the two parameters for either females (
    <span class="italic">N</span> = 26; 
    <span class="italic">r</span> = −0.022) or males (
    <span class="italic">N</span> = 16;

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regardless of the marker system used, geographical differentiation was much more pronounced than differentiation between historic and recent samples from the same country (Fig. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">5</a>). This was also the case if the highly differentiated Spanish population was excluded from the analysis (data not shown). Genetic differentiation measured by 
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>st</sub>-values was about 10-fold higher on mtDNA level (control region) compared with nuclear markers (microsatellites and

   <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene loci (Mantel test, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.38; Fig.

   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001, Welch two sample 
   <span class="italic">t</span>-test) which is in concordance with the finding that populations showed hardly any genetic divergence at the
