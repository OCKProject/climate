 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Contrary to our expectations, genetic differences on the temporal scale within populations were much weaker than spatial differentiation, and only a slight temporal decline of genetic variation was found in the Dutch population. Thus, any postulated negative effect of climate change on local genetic variation, particularly in declining Western European populations, would have been counteracted or mitigated by gene flow. Second, despite very little genetic variation in the 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene locus among our study populations, the overall pattern of greater genetic differentiation on the spatial scale compared with the temporal scale was similar at this candidate gene and neutral loci.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" href="#b20">2000</a>) mainly originates from historic processes, in particular cases of rapid range expansions (in the pied flycatcher: Backström et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" href="#b1">2013</a>; in tits: Kvist et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b55" href="#b55">2002</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b56" href="#b56">2003</a>). Spatial differentiation patterns driven by dispersal strongly contrast to those driven by vicariance (for birds see Voelker

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b104" href="#b104">2000</a>). The extant distribution of western Palearctic 
   <span class="italic">Ficedula</span> flycatcher species has been largely shaped by historic processes such as Pleistocene range fragmentation (for significant East-West subdivision of other Eurasian bird species see Haring et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b45" href="#b45">2007</a>,

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b105" href="#b105">2008</a>). Their present distribution includes secondary overlap and hybrid zones (Sætre et al.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b53" href="#b53">2012</a>) as well as significant population subdivision in pied flycatchers with respect to Iberian populations (this study; Lehtonen et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b60" href="#b60">2009</a>,

   <sub>st</sub> = 0.34) and nuclear loci matches well the findings by Haavie et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" href="#b41">2000</a>). The significant differentiation of populations from the Iberian Peninsula versus the Central and Northern European populations is strongly corroborated by both neutral marker systems (compare also Haavie et al.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" href="#b1">2013</a>). Similar phylogeographic patterns have been described for other species, such as Iberian and central/northern European chiffchaffs, 
   <span class="italic">Phylloscopus ibericus</span> and 
   <span class="italic">P. collybita</span> (Helbig et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b50" href="#b50">1996</a>,

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The large discrepancies in intraspecific variation between nuclear and mitochondrial markers (such as a 10-fold lower fixation index of microsatellite alleles compared with mtDNA haplotypes) could be related to differences in rate and patterns of mutations (Haavie et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" href="#b41">2000</a>; Ballard and Rand 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" href="#b3">2005</a>). This discrepancy has also been documented for Swedish pied flycatcher populations (Tegelström et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b95" href="#b95">1990</a>) and might be explained by gender-biased gene flow and dispersal (Prugnolle and de Meeus 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b85" href="#b85">2002</a>; Hedrick 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b48" href="#b48">2007</a>). The slight geographical structure in mtDNA across Central Europe would suggest female-biased dispersal, which is consistent with the general observation that in passerines (including pied flycatchers), dispersal is female-biased (Clarke et al.
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" href="#b16">1997</a>; Winkel and Hudde 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b102" href="#b102">2001</a>; Eeva et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">2008</a>). However, long-distance dispersal of pied flycatchers between the UK and the Netherlands seemed to be biased more by males than females (Both et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" href="#b11">2012</a>), and these relatively rare long-distance dispersal events could profoundly affect genetic structure.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Besides processes such as historic gene flow and succession of new populations and subsequent founder effects, also recent demographic changes might have altered the genetic architecture of pied flycatchers. Recent population declines due to climate change, mainly in Dutch populations (Both et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" href="#b9">2006</a>), raised the question whether genetic drift might have reduced local genetic diversity. Loss of genetic diversity over time, in marginal or small isolated populations, for example, on islands, has been documented in a few studies, for example, in the Spanish White-headed Duck, 
   <span class="italic">Oxyura leucocephala</span> (Muñoz-Fuentes et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b72" href="#b72">2005</a>), the Floreana Mockingbird, 
   <span class="italic">Mimus trifasciatus</span>, on two remote Galapagos islands (Hoeck et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b52" href="#b52">2011</a>) as well as in two continental drastically bottlenecked species, the North American whooping crane, 
   <span class="italic">Grus americana</span> (Glenn et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">1999</a>), and the European bearded vulture, 
   <span class="italic">Gypaetus barbatus</span> (Godoy et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" href="#b35">2004</a>). Our comparison of population genetic variation suggests that the demographic declines in Dutch populations have resulted in a decrease in haplotype diversity and allelic richness over time and demonstrated that the current Dutch populations exhibited the lowest levels of diversity of all European populations. These patterns are consistent with the expectation that global climate change may have a weaker or no effect on the genetic composition of Northern European pied flycatcher populations, because spring phenology has not advanced here as strongly as in Western Europe (Both et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" href="#b8">2004</a>). However, the decline in genetic variation in the Dutch population was not consistent in all parameters (see Table 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a>; e.g., π). Firstly, in the Netherlands, local population declines differed regionally and largely in dimension (in oak stands up to 90% decline: Both et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" href="#b9">2006</a>). Although our sampling involved Dutch populations that were less affected by climate-induced demographic changes (12–20%), the overall regional diversity could still have been reduced over time. Secondly, traces of gene flow (by long-distance dispersal) among neighboring regions, that is, among Dutch and German populations, might have counteracted the loss of genetic diversity due to genetic drift. From ringing data, there is further evidence of a steady exchange of breeding birds among neighboring Dutch populations (Both et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" href="#b9">2006</a>) and an influx of long-distance immigrants from the British Isles into Dutch breeding populations (Both et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" href="#b11">2012</a>). Thirdly, nest-site fidelity with respect to the place of birth was shown to be less pronounced in marginal Western European pied flycatcher populations than elsewhere in Europe (Winkel 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b101" href="#b101">1982</a>). Thus, it is probable that Dutch pied flycatchers were able to compensate at least partly the loss of genetic diversity via gene flow with Western and Central Europe populations.

The extremely low variation at the

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evidence for an association of 
   <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene variation with both breeding latitude and breeding phenology of birds is scarce and inconsistent so far. A latitudinal cline of avian

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b54" href="#b54">2007</a>), but there is counterevidence of such a cline in a number of other passerine species (Johnsen et al.

   <span class="italic">Clock</span> poly-Q variation is significantly correlated with migration distance, and in the same study, species as well as in the blackcap (

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b81" href="#b81">2013</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With respect to breeding phenology, intrapopulational analysis of the Spanish pied flycatchers yielded no significant correlation among 
   <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene variation and laying dates, which is in concordance with results found in a great tit population in the UK (Liedvogel and Sheldon 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b63" href="#b63">2010</a>) and in 
   <span class="italic">Tachycineta</span> swallows (Dor et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">2012</a>). That contrasts the findings by Liedvogel et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b64" href="#b64">2009</a>) who documented a slight and not significant trend for earlier laying dates for blue tit females with fewer Q repeats (but see more recent analysis in Liedvogel et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b66" href="#b66">2012</a>). Similar results were reported for an Italian migrating barn swallow population (Caprioli et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" href="#b14">2012</a>). Apart from the timing of reproduction, there is evidence of an association of

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">2012</a>). Because of such conflicting results from independent studies of different avian model species, it seems that at this time no general conclusion can be drawn concerning an association between

  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among blue tit and bluethroat populations, significant associations between pairwise 
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>st</sub>-values based on 
   <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene allele frequency and those based on microsatellites were found (Johnsen et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b54" href="#b54">2007</a>). A different pattern was found in pied flycatcher (this study) and barn swallow (Dor et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">2011</a>) populations, that is, no association was detected and much lower differentiation at the 
   <span class="italic">Clock</span> poly-Q locus than at microsatellite loci was found. In contrast to our expectation that genetic differentiation at candidate genes might be larger than at neutral loci, we observed the opposite pattern. The 
   <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene in pied flycatchers seems to show no sign of neutral evolution, but a very low differentiation among populations compared with neutral markers (Fig. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">5</a>B). Similarly, intraspecific variation in two further candidate genes coding for a potentially sexually selected trait in the pied flycatcher (UV plumage coloration and visual perception of that trait) was recently demonstrated to deviate from the expectation of neutral evolution, too (Lehtonen et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b61" href="#b61">2012</a>). As a consequence, these genes and the avian 
   <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene locus might well underlie stabilizing selection in the pied flycatcher. Equivalent to comparisons of neutral markers with phenotypic (
   <span class="italic">P</span>
   <sub>ST</sub>) or quantitative (
   <span class="italic">Q</span>
   <sub>ST</sub>) differentiation, lower differentiation in potentially selected traits or genes than in neutral loci suggests that natural selection must be favoring the same mean phenotype in different populations (Merilä and Cnorkrak 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b69" href="#b69">2001</a>; Goudet and Martin 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">2007</a>). Analyses of genetic differentiation among barn swallow populations revealed patterns of stabilizing selection as found in pied flycatchers (Dor et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">2011</a>). The observed spatial and temporal variation in migration and breeding phenology in pied flycatchers (Both et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" href="#b8">2004</a>) cannot solely be explained by variation at the 
   <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene locus.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">So far, it is not clear whether adaptation of migration and breeding time to rapid environmental changes is restricted through limited phenotypic plasticity and/or a lack of genetic variation on which selection can act. The increased selection for breeding date as observed in several long-term population studies (Both and Visser 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" href="#b6">2001</a>; Goodenough et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" href="#b36">2011</a>) may not result in an adaptive response if the variation in breeding date has no genetic background. Adaptation may work through immigration of individuals of more southern origin that disperse northwards and thereby introduce genes for earlier timing (Edelaar et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">2008</a>). Indeed, in pied flycatchers, more southern populations migrate earlier in spring (Both 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" href="#b5">2010</a>), but whether this earlier timing is genetically coded or the result of ontogeny is still unclear. Our results suggest that the 
   <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene variation considered here is not a good candidate for such an adaptive process because neither between- nor within-population variation was related to variation in timing. The general lack of geographical variation in neutral genetic markers suggests that dispersal is an important process in this and other species of long-distance migrants, which would swamp most of the declines in genetic diversity in shrinking populations. This observation poses the question how much of the observed local phenotypic variation has a genetic origin. In fact, in the Spanish pied flycatcher population included in our analysis, spring arrival of males and breeding dates are shaped by a mixed-mating strategy of this species (sexual selection was suggested to be the main driving force of protandry; Canal et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" href="#b13">2012</a>). Identification of more candidate genes may help to unravel these processes, as will experiments in which individuals are translocated to breed in distant places and which consider how their offspring will behave relative to the local population (Burger and Both 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" href="#b12">2011</a>).
