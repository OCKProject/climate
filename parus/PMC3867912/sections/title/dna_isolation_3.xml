 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">DNA from frozen tissue and blood samples, as well as from nestling feather samples kept in alcohol (recent material), was extracted using the DTAB method (Gustinich et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" href="#b40">1991</a>). Extraction from toe pads and skin patches (historic museum material) was carried out in a separate clean laboratory. There each step of analysis (sampling and extraction) was carried out on separate working benches. DNA from museum specimens and dry feather samples from extant populations was extracted using the sbeadex® forensic kit (LGC Genomics, Berlin, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions with small modifications, for example, overnight incubation of tissue with proteinase K (instead of one hour). In order to yield a sufficiently high DNA concentration for microsatellite analyses, we performed two successive elution steps with a volume of 20 μL of sterile water (instead of one step with 60 μL elution volume). In order to avoid cross-contamination, extant and historic samples were never treated at the same time, and after each step, working benches were cleaned with DNA-away (Molecular Bio Products, Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada), and both benches and laboratory rooms were set under UV-light for at least four hours. The amount and the quality of DNA isolates were checked on 1.4% agarose gels.
