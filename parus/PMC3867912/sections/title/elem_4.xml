 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Control region: We successfully amplified a 271-bp fragment of the mitochondrial control region of 309 pied flycatcher individuals. Primers were designed on the basis of an alignment of control region sequences of different bird species belonging to the family Muscicapidae. We used the forward primer crFHfor 5′GCCATACGGGTATGCTATG 3′ and the reverse primer crFHrev 5′GCTTGGGAGTTCCTGAAAG 3′. PCRs were performed in 12.5 μL using a Tetrad PTC-225 thermal cycler (BIO-RAD, München, Germany). Each reaction contained about 1–10 ng template DNA, 2.5 pmol each primer, 0.2 mmol/L each dNTP, 2 mmol/L MgCl2, 1× amplification buffer, and 0.5 U Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany). The PCR started with an initial denaturation at 94°C for 1 min followed by five cycles: 94°C 40 sec, 45°C 40 sec, and 72°C 1 min; then cycling 35 times: 94°C 40 sec, 52°C 40 sec, 72°C 1 min; ending with a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis using 1.4% agarose gels and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide (1 ppm). In agreement with Töpfer et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b96" href="#b96">2011</a>), historic DNA isolates from foot pads yielded better results than DNA isolates from skin patches. After purifying the PCR products with Agencourt AMPURE (Beckman Coulter), both strands were sequenced with the following PCR program: 96°C 20 sec, 50°C 20 sec, 60°C 4 min, and 39 cycles, using GenomeLab DTCS-Quick Start Kit (Beckmann Coulter, Krefeld, Germany). Dye terminators were removed with the Agencourt CleanSEQ kit (Beckmann Coulter), and amplicons were analyzed on a CEQ 2000 (Beckman Coulter) automatic sequencer.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From the first DNA extracts, all historic samples were amplified and sequenced at least twice. In all cases, both sequencing reactions yielded identical results. In order to control for the possible occurrence of single-base errors in PCR products from museum specimens (Sefc et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b90" href="#b90">2007</a>), DNA was newly extracted from a set of 126 original samples and was re-analyzed via independent PCR and sequencing reactions (most of these were historic samples plus a few recent samples that carried unique haplotypes). Each step of analysis (sampling, extraction, and PCR) was performed in a clean laboratory on separate working benches that were decontaminated by UV-light exposure after each working step. Negative controls were performed for both DNA extractions and PCRs in the control analysis, and spot tests of PCRs from negative controls were also sequenced in order to test for possible contamination. Sequences of negative controls never showed a considerable signal. For haplotypes that deviated from those resulting from the first analysis, the respective samples were re-analyzed at least one more time (starting from PCR). For 14 samples, haplotypes from the first analysis were not reproducible in the control analysis (11%). However, all of these deviating haplotypes were reproducible in one or even two replicate PCR and sequencing reactions from the second DNA extract. For seven of fourteen ambiguous samples, deviations between first and control sequencing were due to double peaks at the respective polymorphic sites. Among the ten polymorphic sites concerned, six cases corresponded to the more common overlaid signals of either the two purine or the two pyrimidine bases (C + T or A + G double peaks).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Microsatellites</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ten microsatellite loci were amplified using primers published by Leder et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b59" href="#b59">2008</a>). We chose primer combinations with nonoverlapping product sizes, using two different color labels, and tested them for the feasibility of multiplexing. As we use historic samples, we selected product sizes with a maximum length of around 400 bp. End-labeled forward primers were obtained with either Alexa647 (Invitrogen) or IRD700 (Metabion, Martinsried, Germany) fluorescent dye (see 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Table S2</a>). Multiplex PCRs were performed with the Type-it Microsatellite PCR Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to instructions of the manufacturer. The PCRs were performed in a S1000 thermocycler (BIO-RAD), starting with an initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, then 32 cycles of 95°C 30 sec, 55°C 90 sec, 72°C 60 sec, and a final extension of 60°C for 30 min. All historic samples were analyzed at least two times independently (see above; Morin et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b70" href="#b70">2001</a>). Microsatellite loci longer than 200 bp were amplified separately for all museum samples, using the same PCR program and final primer concentrations of 0.2 μmol/L each. PCR products (1 μL) were directly mixed with SLS and a size standard (DNA Size Standard Kit-400 Beckmann Coulter), electrophoresed and analyzed on a CEQ 2000 (Beckman Coulter) automatic DNA sequencer.

  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For initial PCR tests, we used the primer pairs from Johnsen et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b54" href="#b54">2007</a>), to amplify the variable region of the 
   <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene locus (corresponding to the human 
   <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene exon 20; Steeves et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b92" href="#b92">1999</a>) with the following settings: initial denaturation at 94°C for 2 min, then 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 58°C for 30 sec, 72°C for 1 min and a final extension at 72°C for 7 min. In order to verify PCR products, a subset of 37 fragments was sequenced from Dutch and Spanish samples with 25 cycles of 96°C for 10 sec, 50°C for 5 sec, and 60°C for 4 min. Finally, the 
   <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene locus of pied flycatchers was screened for length polymorphism by PCR amplification and electrophoresis using an automatic DNA sequencer. PCR was conducted with an Alexa647 labeled forward primer 5′TGGAGCGGTAATGGTACCAAGTA 3′ and the reverse primer 5′ TCAGCTGTGACTGAGCTGGCT 3′ (Johnsen et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b54" href="#b54">2007</a>) with a final concentration of 0.2 μM each. We applied the same PCR conditions and detection methods as described for the microsatellites, except that PCR products from recent samples were diluted 1:10 to 1:100 before electrophoresis.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Museum samples for which we could not perform at least two replicates with concordant results for each marker (control region, microsatellites, and 
   <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene), or which were genotyped with less than eight of ten microsatellites, were discarded from further analyses. Swedish pied flycatchers collected on Öland are likely to be migrants heading to northern Sweden (Fransson and Hall-Karlsson 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">2008</a>). As we could not rule out that they also may migrate to Finland or Norway, we reanalyzed our data excluding these specimens. The exclusion of all potential migrants from Swedish populations did not alter the main picture, and therefore, we report results based on the complete data set.
