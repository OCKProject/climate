 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Besides processes such as historic gene flow and succession of new populations and subsequent founder effects, also recent demographic changes might have altered the genetic architecture of pied flycatchers. Recent population declines due to climate change, mainly in Dutch populations (Both et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" href="#b9">2006</a>), raised the question whether genetic drift might have reduced local genetic diversity. Loss of genetic diversity over time, in marginal or small isolated populations, for example, on islands, has been documented in a few studies, for example, in the Spanish White-headed Duck, 
  <span class="italic">Oxyura leucocephala</span> (Muñoz-Fuentes et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b72" href="#b72">2005</a>), the Floreana Mockingbird, 
  <span class="italic">Mimus trifasciatus</span>, on two remote Galapagos islands (Hoeck et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b52" href="#b52">2011</a>) as well as in two continental drastically bottlenecked species, the North American whooping crane, 
  <span class="italic">Grus americana</span> (Glenn et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">1999</a>), and the European bearded vulture, 
  <span class="italic">Gypaetus barbatus</span> (Godoy et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" href="#b35">2004</a>). Our comparison of population genetic variation suggests that the demographic declines in Dutch populations have resulted in a decrease in haplotype diversity and allelic richness over time and demonstrated that the current Dutch populations exhibited the lowest levels of diversity of all European populations. These patterns are consistent with the expectation that global climate change may have a weaker or no effect on the genetic composition of Northern European pied flycatcher populations, because spring phenology has not advanced here as strongly as in Western Europe (Both et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" href="#b8">2004</a>). However, the decline in genetic variation in the Dutch population was not consistent in all parameters (see Table 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" href="#tbl1">1</a>; e.g., π). Firstly, in the Netherlands, local population declines differed regionally and largely in dimension (in oak stands up to 90% decline: Both et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" href="#b9">2006</a>). Although our sampling involved Dutch populations that were less affected by climate-induced demographic changes (12–20%), the overall regional diversity could still have been reduced over time. Secondly, traces of gene flow (by long-distance dispersal) among neighboring regions, that is, among Dutch and German populations, might have counteracted the loss of genetic diversity due to genetic drift. From ringing data, there is further evidence of a steady exchange of breeding birds among neighboring Dutch populations (Both et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" href="#b9">2006</a>) and an influx of long-distance immigrants from the British Isles into Dutch breeding populations (Both et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" href="#b11">2012</a>). Thirdly, nest-site fidelity with respect to the place of birth was shown to be less pronounced in marginal Western European pied flycatcher populations than elsewhere in Europe (Winkel 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b101" href="#b101">1982</a>). Thus, it is probable that Dutch pied flycatchers were able to compensate at least partly the loss of genetic diversity via gene flow with Western and Central Europe populations.
