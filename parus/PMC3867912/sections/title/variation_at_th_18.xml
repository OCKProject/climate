 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Variation in the number of poly-Q repeats at the 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene locus has been reported for several bird species on both levels, either among populations or within populations. This length variation seems to be a viable trait to test for an association between genetic and life-history trait variation, particularly with regard to changes in breeding phenology caused by recent climate change. The extremely low variation at the 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene locus in pied flycatchers is striking although the number of alleles identified (five in total, three up to five per population) is similar to that observed in other bird species (Johnsen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b54" href="#b54">2007</a>; Liedvogel et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b64" href="#b64">2009</a>; Liedvogel and Sheldon 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b63" href="#b63">2010</a>; Dor et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">2011</a>; Caprioli et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" href="#b14">2012</a>; Dor et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">2012</a>). Likewise, the numbers of 10 to 14 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> poly-Q repeats are comparable to the numbers of tandem repeats in blue tits (
  <span class="italic">Cyanistes caeruleus</span>), great tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>), and bluethroats (
  <span class="italic">Luscinia svecica</span>) (Johnsen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b54" href="#b54">2007</a>; Liedvogel et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b64" href="#b64">2009</a>; Liedvogel and Sheldon 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b63" href="#b63">2010</a>), but exceed those found in the swallows of the genus 
  <span class="italic">Tachycineta</span> (5 to 9) and the barn swallow (
  <span class="italic">Hirundo rustica</span>) (6 to 8) (Dor et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">2011</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">2012</a>; Caprioli et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" href="#b14">2012</a>). The mean observed heterozygosity (
  <span class="italic">H</span>
  <sub>o</sub> = 0.482) of pied flycatchers is in the same order of magnitude as values measured in blue tits (H
  <sub>o</sub> = 0.489) although slightly higher than in bluethroats (
  <span class="italic">H</span>
  <sub>o</sub> = 0.213) and differs considerably from the low values reported for great tits (
  <span class="italic">H</span>
  <sub>o</sub> = 0.077) and barn swallows (
  <span class="italic">H</span>
  <sub>o</sub> = 0.030).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evidence for an association of 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene variation with both breeding latitude and breeding phenology of birds is scarce and inconsistent so far. A latitudinal cline of avian 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> ploy-Q variation was detected only in a nonmigratory species (blue tit; Johnsen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b54" href="#b54">2007</a>), but there is counterevidence of such a cline in a number of other passerine species (Johnsen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b54" href="#b54">2007</a>; Dor et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">2011</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">2012</a>). Breeding latitudes of the pied flycatcher populations included in our study ranged from 41°5′ (Spain) to 69°24′ (Norway), and we could not confirm any correlation between latitude and 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> poly-Q length either. However, in North American dark-eyed juncos (
  <span class="italic">Junco hyemalis</span>), 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> poly-Q variation is significantly correlated with migration distance, and in the same study, species as well as in the blackcap (
  <span class="italic">Sylvia atricapilla</span>), the 
  <span class="italic">ADCYAP1</span> locus, another gene of the ‘migratory gene package’ (Liedvogel et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b65" href="#b65">2011</a>), is similarly associated with both migratory distance and migratory restlessness (Müller et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b71" href="#b71">2013</a>; Peterson et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b81" href="#b81">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With respect to breeding phenology, intrapopulational analysis of the Spanish pied flycatchers yielded no significant correlation among 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene variation and laying dates, which is in concordance with results found in a great tit population in the UK (Liedvogel and Sheldon 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b63" href="#b63">2010</a>) and in 
  <span class="italic">Tachycineta</span> swallows (Dor et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">2012</a>). That contrasts the findings by Liedvogel et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b64" href="#b64">2009</a>) who documented a slight and not significant trend for earlier laying dates for blue tit females with fewer Q repeats (but see more recent analysis in Liedvogel et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b66" href="#b66">2012</a>). Similar results were reported for an Italian migrating barn swallow population (Caprioli et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" href="#b14">2012</a>). Apart from the timing of reproduction, there is evidence of an association of 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene variation with fitness-related traits such as clutch size and thus breeding success (Dor et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">2012</a>). Because of such conflicting results from independent studies of different avian model species, it seems that at this time no general conclusion can be drawn concerning an association between 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> genotypes and migratory behavior on the one hand and breeding phenology on the other hand.
