 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A subset of 205 samples was further analyzed for sex-specific differentiation at the poly-Q locus. GLM analysis performed in STATISTICA yielded no significant differences between geographical regions (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.54) nor any interaction of population x gender (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Table S4</a>). Forty-two pied flycatcher individuals from the Spanish nest box population were tested for a correlation between laying dates (males were assigned the laying date of their mated female) and poly-Q genotype variation. We did not find any association of the two parameters for either females (
