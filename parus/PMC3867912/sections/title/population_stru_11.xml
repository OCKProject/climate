 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the control region alignment, we did not find any bias with respect to an increased frequency of C to T substitutions in the historic sampling. The network based on recent and historic samples (61 haplotypes) contained nine unique tip haplotypes (not shown); however, among these, we found no bias with respect to our historic sampling. In fact, eight unique tip haplotypes occurred in the extant populations.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The network based on recent samples only (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Figure S1</a>) displayed a strong genetic differentiation of the Spanish population, that is, sharing only one rare haplotype (which occurs only once in each population) with the Finnish and Swedish populations. All other haplotypes were exclusively found in the Spanish population. There was no geographical structure observed among the other European populations. The majority of haplotypes was shared at least between two populations, and three common haplotypes were found in all populations except Spain.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to describe the distribution of haplotypes among current and historic populations, we reconstructed a network using control region sequences of Dutch, German, and Swedish populations. Like the other analyses (microsatellites and candidate genes), this revealed very little temporal differentiation (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">4</a>A) and again no geographical differentiation (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">4</a>B). Nearly all haplotypes of the network were represented in both recent and historic samples. Only four haplotypes were exclusively found in recent or historic populations, respectively. Dutch and German populations shared 7 haplotypes which did not occur in the Swedish population.

(A) Overview of recent (white) and historic (black) haplotypes found in Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands. (B) Haplotypes are additionally color coded according to their geographical and temporal origin (Germany: green; Netherlands: orange; Sweden: blue; historic samples: light color). Only haplotypes which occur more than once are shown. The size of the circles is proportional to the frequency of the haplotypes, and the lines indicate single mutation. Small red dots denote median vectors.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Employing a mode-based clustering method for microsatellite data of all recent samples, individuals were probabilistically assigned into K = 4 populations (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Figure S2</a>). Individuals from Spain clearly formed a cluster of their own. The second cluster corresponded to birds from Sweden, and the third exhibited samples from Finland, Germany, and Norway. The fourth cluster harbored all individuals from the Netherlands. In Structure analyses which resulted in K = 3, the Swedish populations fell into the cluster with Finland, Germany, and Norway. Using no prior information on sample geographical origin, K = 2 was identified as the most likely. Only the Spanish birds could be discriminated from all other populations. This pattern was supported by Evanno′s ΔK method.
