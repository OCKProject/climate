 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Food types were selected to represent different amounts of energy per 100 g and had different fat to carbohydrate ratios (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053121-t001" href="#pone-0053121-t001">Table 1</a>). Food types represented natural non-animal food of the bird species predicted for the study area and were classified as fat-rich, carbohydrate-rich, and fruit (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053121-t001" href="#pone-0053121-t001">Table 1</a>). However, grain size of food types was similar and varied less than 1 mm in diameter (except for fruit, which were slightly larger, and control). Each food was offered in a plastic dish (hereafter ‘food dish’) in equal amounts (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053121-t001" href="#pone-0053121-t001">Table 1</a>). Each food type was mixed with the same amount of pure lard to fix the grains to the food dish, so preventing wind or landing birds dispersing the grains. To test the effect of lard on feeding preferences, we added two control food dishes of lard to each feeding station.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At each experimental plot we placed two feeding stations (each with four food dishes), which consisted of modified, free-hanging plastic flowerpots prepared to hold the food dishes (

Each feeding station had a roof to prevent snow and rain from covering the food and also to exclude large predators. Each food dish placeholder was numbered randomly from 1 to 8, but specific numbers have been assigned to each food type (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053121-t001" href="#pone-0053121-t001">Table 1</a>). To prevent mice and large mammals from stealing food, the feeding stations hung free (at least 1.5 m above the ground and from the next tree or branch), and the suspension ropes were blocked with free-rotating discs (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053121.s001" href="#pone.0053121.s001">Notes S1</a> on the procedures and methods are provided in Supporting Information). Food consumption was measured through counts of birds at feeding stations. All counts per species and time unit (60 minutes) is activity.
