 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each ‘count’ represented a bird observed at any feeding station. Observer counted simultaneously as the camera traps recorded birds in 5-second-intervals. Therefore we analyzed data from images and direct observations. A count was analyzed, when (1) an individual bird was detected, leaving the food station with food in the beak (we noted time/date, plot, species, food type, remarks), (2) an individual bird was observed feeding without leaving the food station (counted as 1), and (3) an individual bird was photographed at the feeding station by a camera trap (regardless of whether consuming the food or not). We did not consider counts as part of the activity, when (i) an individual bird was detected feeding several times without flying up nor without changing food dish within 5 seconds, (ii) an individual bird was detected by the camera trap in a sequence of images and it was certainly the same individual in the same food dish, (iii) an individual bird was detected at the fringe or roof of the food station, but was not feeding at any given dish (except when the bird had food in the beak), (iv) it was impossible to identify the species ('something' flying away, for instance dark image/steep shadow, only shape visible, and uncertain identification of some 
  <span class="italic">Parus</span> species). When necessary, we corrected for different sample size (amount of plots) between habitat types in the analysis.
