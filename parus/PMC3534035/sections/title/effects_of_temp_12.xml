 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Consistent with our predictions, there was an effect of snow cover on the activity of some bird species. Birds adjust individually food intake and energy saving, by using strategies such as hypothermia, hoarding and preference for specific food sources during cold and resources limited seasons 
  <a rid="pone.0053121-Wells1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Wells1">[24]</a>. Low local temperatures and snow cover change the feeding behaviour of birds

  <a rid="pone.0053121-Caraco1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Caraco1">[11]</a>. Small forest birds can reduced their energy loss by supplementing their energy intake when snow is covering all natural food sources, which become unobtainable and therefore unavailable even if still quite abundant below the snow

  <a rid="pone.0053121-Rogers1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Rogers1">[40]</a>. Birds would have to change sites as an alternative (e.g., move to areas with less snow) or reduce energy loss and expenditure through other strategies to compensate for reduced availability of energy. To cope with reduced food availability, one possible strategy is to move to other areas through regular long-distance migration (at least south of the Alps) or short-distance movements (5 km), which both involve high costs for the individuals. Several bird species that breed in temperate areas move to southern Europe or Africa during winter to avoid resource scarcity (among other reasons).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Low air temperatures should increase energy requirement (e.g., found for tropical birds: 
  <a rid="pone.0053121-Khler1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Khler1">[42]</a>) to compensate for relatively higher costs of maintaining a constant body temperature. In addition, lower temperatures should trigger reduced insect activity (in March/April, at least) making further animal food resources unavailable for the birds, which in turn rely on plant-based food resources. Low temperatures are typically associated with rain or snow on the Schwäbische Alb during winter, which can be compensated through higher intake of fat-rich food.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temperature and snow affect arthropods significantly and in Central Europe arthropods hide in safe places in winter. Animal food resources are therefore significantly reduced for birds. Animal food would easily provide fat-rich food for birds in a wintery landscape, facilitating their survival. Almost all bird species change therefore to fat-rich food. In addition, spruce forests offer more opportunities for arthropod communities to hide during winter then deciduous forests. The rough bark of spruce is a large surface with relatively safe hiding places for wintering arthropods, therefore making insects less available for birds 
  <a rid="pone.0053121-Haftorn1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Haftorn1">[9]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0053121-Caraco1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Caraco1">[11]</a>. Predation risk is probably also higher for birds at feeding stations in open beech forests then in closed spruce forests 
  <a rid="pone.0053121-Haftorn1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Haftorn1">[9]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0053121-Caraco1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Caraco1">[11]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0053121-Hilton1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Hilton1">[43]</a>. Beech forests probably offer a higher quality and quantity of energy, but the energy needed for hiding from potential predators in open beech forests (compared to spruce forests) should decrease activity at feeding stations in these habitats 
  <a rid="pone.0053121-Hilton1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Hilton1">[43]</a>. We found the opposite: higher activity at feeding stations in beech forests, suggested that predation risk and need for high levels of energy intake are a trade off for winter birds in Central Europe.
