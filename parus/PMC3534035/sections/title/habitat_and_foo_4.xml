 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We observed birds for 146 h in beech and 134 h in spruce forest. Activity depended strongly on species in each of the two habitat types: Each species and the whole community (in terms of species numbers) had twice-higher activity in beech forest as compared to spruce forest (ANOVA: activity ∼ forest type, df: 1/5026, F = 15.1, p&lt;0.001; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053121-g001" href="#pone-0053121-g001">Figure 1a</a>). Only Crested Tits (42.4%) had higher activity in spruce forests.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found an effect of habitat type on food preferences. Overall activity showed a significant bias towards fat-rich food (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053121-g001" href="#pone-0053121-g001">Figure 1b</a>). However, relative food preference did not differ significantly in both forest types. Forest type was the most important explanatory variable for activity (ANOVA: activity ∼ forest type * food type; forest type: df: 1/5020, F = 17.6, p&lt;0.001; food type: df: 3/5020, F = 269.1, p&lt;0.001).
