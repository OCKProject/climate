 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found a clear temporal change in activity (ANOVA: activity ∼ Observation Day, df: 1/5026, F = 67.199, p&lt;0.0001), but no change in activity in relation to forest types nor food type. Chaffinches where absent from our feeding stations prior to 26 March, 2011, and only occasionally observed thereafter.</p>

Activity slightly (not significantly) increases at offered grain (carbohydrate-rich), but decreases at offered sunflower and peanut grains (fat-rich) food sources towards the breeding season (mid-March to April, from observation day 36 onwards;
