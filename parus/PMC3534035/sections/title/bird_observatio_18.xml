 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observers recorded birds (counts) at feeding stations for 60 minutes in the morning (earliest start at 08: 05, latest start at 13: 35) on each observation day. The observation period started on the 30
  <span class="sup">th</span> November 2010 and ended on the 8
  <span class="sup">th</span> April 2011. At any given time, six camera traps (AMG Viper 3 BM Ltl-5210 were used and supported by one (until February) or two (March/April) observers. Two camera traps per plot (as each camera recorded images of four food dishes per flower pot only), recorded all birds (i.e., six camera traps at 3 plots and Possler or Winkler/Baur at other plots). Both observers and camera traps finished recording after 60 minutes simultaneously, covering four plots a day (three plots by camera traps and one by observer). We set up cameras each day to start at the same time as the observers. Each image was analyzed and birds were counted for 60 minutes. We use activity = 
  <span class="italic">N</span>
  <span class="sup">−h</span> as our baseline unit for all comparison and analyzes, where 
  <span class="italic">N</span> are the counted observations normalized for 60 minutes (activity), and h is the number of hours. For a single day when we observed birds for only 55 minutes, we tested the influence of the missing time and adjusted the data for 60 minutes. In case we pooled together food sources (which have been similar regarding carbohydrate or fat contents), we adjusted count values if necessary to 60 minutes counts (i.e. normalizing of data: fat-rich food was offered in two food dishes at each feeding station, grain in three, control in two, and fruit in one;

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each day and plot we recorded start and ending time, snow cover (present/absent/partial), local temperature, and other remarks of potential interest for our study. Camera trap failures have been adjusted by later repetitions of the same plot to have always the exactly same amount of observed hours per feeding station. We obtained air temperature data for each plot as measured during the observation hour (max, min, mean of each hour when observed, measured 10 cm above ground within 50 m of the feeding stations) as available (no temperature data available for AEW12 during our study).</p>
