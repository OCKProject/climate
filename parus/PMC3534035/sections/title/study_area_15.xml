 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study is part of the large-scale long-term research program ‘Biodiversity Exploratories’ (details and scope are summarized in 
  <a rid="pone.0053121-Fischer1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Fischer1">[2]</a>), which aims at investigating the impact of forest and grassland management on various organisms and ecosystem services. Three study sites in Germany, with 50 experimental plots each, in forests of different structure and management regimes have been selected for this research program. For the present study we selected 11 experimental plots in forests of the Schwäbische Alb Exploratory in south-western Germany (approximate centre coordinates: 48.411° North and 9.497°East, 500–800 m a. s. l.).
