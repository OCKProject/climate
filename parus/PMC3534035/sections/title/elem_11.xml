 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, birds respond to forest structure at different levels, from the individual to the community

  <a rid="pone.0053121-Terborgh1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Terborgh1">[28]</a>. Several bird populations decrease or increase in response to changes in forest structure and food availability

  <a rid="pone.0053121-Wells1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Wells1">[24]</a> yielding divergent responses to changes in forest structure. Under natural or natural-like conditions, bird species have species-specific preferences for particular forest structures, which are related to foraging strategies and other traits that determine bird abundance

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We observed far more birds in beech than in spruce forests, because of differences in food availability, corroborating previous studies 
  <a rid="pone.0053121-Jansson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Jansson1">[1]</a>–

  <a rid="pone.0053121-Renner1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Renner1">[29]</a>. Several breeding birds that are common in the study area, such as European Blackbirds (
  <span class="italic">Turdus merula</span>) and European Goldfinches (
  <span class="italic">Carduelis spinus</span>), were absent during our study. These two species probably moved to other areas with less snow, before we began the cafeteria trials in November 2011

  <a rid="pone.0053121-Hewson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Hewson1">[35]</a>, since we did not observe any individuals of European Blackbirds or European Goldfinches close to the cafeterias throughout our study.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Contrary to our predictions, we observed no difference in food preferences of birds between beech and spruce forests, since all species preferred fat-rich food in both forest types. The similarity in food preferences between beech and spruce forests is an evidence of the limited access to fat-rich food in European spruce and beech forests. In both forest types natural food had limited availability, leading to similar preference for the offered food types 
  <a rid="pone.0053121-Hlzinger1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Hlzinger1">[34]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0053121-Nikolov1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Nikolov1">[36]</a>, which were mainly beechnut and spruce seeds. Deciduous forests, especially those dominated by beech trees, generally offer quantitatively and qualitatively more food for birds than spruce forests 
  <a rid="pone.0053121-GlutzvonBlotzheim3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-GlutzvonBlotzheim3">[32]</a>. For instance, breeding success and population density of Blue Tits decrease with the percentage of conifers in their breeding habitat 
  <a rid="pone.0053121-Hinsley2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Hinsley2">[37]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0053121-LWF1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-LWF1">[38]</a>. In addition, spruce forests have almost no understory vegetation or any other plant species in higher abundance 
  <a rid="pone.0053121-Fischer1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Fischer1">[2]</a> and offer therefore limited food availability, represented by spruce seeds only 
  <a rid="pone.0053121-Fischer1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Fischer1">[2]</a>. In addition, reduced forest structure in spruce forests also decreases the availability of hideouts to escape predators.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As predicted, forest birds preferred fat-rich and to a lesser extent carbohydrate-rich food over other food types, because of their increased energy requirements in winter 
  <a rid="pone.0053121-Lehikoinen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Lehikoinen1">[39]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0053121-Rogers1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Rogers1">[40]</a>. This hypothesis is supported by the similarity between the constituents of the fat-rich food offered and the fat-rich natural food (i.e., beechnuts, spruce seeds) that are available in winter only and in limited amount 
  <a rid="pone.0053121-Hlzinger1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Hlzinger1">[34]</a> in forests. The preferred food of most species, regardless of forest type, was sunflower seeds and peanuts, both of which have high fat content (compare 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053121-t001" href="#pone-0053121-t001">Table 1</a>). In winter, food types with high energy content (fat-rich) are preferred by birds, because, according to the optimal foraging theory, they should maximize the difference between energy intake and expenditure. By taking fat-rich food at our feeding stations, birds profit through high energy gain with the smallest possible energy loss through food search and handling. In our experiment food search time can be disregarded, as the different food types were offered at the same time and controlled for.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The more calories a food type has, the more energy it provides for the consumer. However, it is also important to consider the interaction between carbohydrates, fat, and proteins. Carbohydrates allocate energy fast, but for a short time, whereas protein and fat offer energy for a longer time. Together, those nutrients provide the consumer with a complete supply to keep its physiological functions 
  <a rid="pone.0053121-Barboza1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Barboza1">[41]</a> over an extended time period and long winter nights. The preferred food, composed of sunflower seeds and peanuts, provides energy for both short and long time. In addition, fat-rich food helps build up fat reserves for the upcoming breeding season.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Oat, spelt, and barley consist mainly of carbohydrates and have just half the caloric value of peanuts or sunflower seeds. All three food types deliver short-term energy, resulting in increased need for food search. The short-term energy that oats, spelt, and barley provide indicates that birds need to invest more time in search for food, and that they need to eat more to obtain the same calories that fat-rich (animal) food would provide. Rowanberries have very little calorie content, what may explain why they were seldom consumed. The energy value of rowan is probably not high enough to transform carbohydrates into fat that could be saved for the coming breeding season. In addition, rowan might have a shape and size that are suboptimal to congest for smaller birds (as the tits of this study) making again the energy intake less favourable as with the used energy to swallow the fruit.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Effects of Temperature and Snow Cover</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Consistent with our predictions, there was an effect of snow cover on the activity of some bird species. Birds adjust individually food intake and energy saving, by using strategies such as hypothermia, hoarding and preference for specific food sources during cold and resources limited seasons 
   <a rid="pone.0053121-Wells1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Wells1">[24]</a>. Low local temperatures and snow cover change the feeding behaviour of birds 
   <a rid="pone.0053121-Macarrone1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Macarrone1">[3]</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0053121-Nakamura1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Nakamura1">[5]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0053121-Caraco1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Caraco1">[11]</a>. Small forest birds can reduced their energy loss by supplementing their energy intake when snow is covering all natural food sources, which become unobtainable and therefore unavailable even if still quite abundant below the snow 
   <a rid="pone.0053121-Haftorn1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Haftorn1">[9]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0053121-Lehikoinen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Lehikoinen1">[39]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0053121-Rogers1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Rogers1">[40]</a>. Birds would have to change sites as an alternative (e.g., move to areas with less snow) or reduce energy loss and expenditure through other strategies to compensate for reduced availability of energy. To cope with reduced food availability, one possible strategy is to move to other areas through regular long-distance migration (at least south of the Alps) or short-distance movements (5 km), which both involve high costs for the individuals. Several bird species that breed in temperate areas move to southern Europe or Africa during winter to avoid resource scarcity (among other reasons).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Low air temperatures should increase energy requirement (e.g., found for tropical birds: 
   <a rid="pone.0053121-Khler1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Khler1">[42]</a>) to compensate for relatively higher costs of maintaining a constant body temperature. In addition, lower temperatures should trigger reduced insect activity (in March/April, at least) making further animal food resources unavailable for the birds, which in turn rely on plant-based food resources. Low temperatures are typically associated with rain or snow on the Schwäbische Alb during winter, which can be compensated through higher intake of fat-rich food.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temperature and snow affect arthropods significantly and in Central Europe arthropods hide in safe places in winter. Animal food resources are therefore significantly reduced for birds. Animal food would easily provide fat-rich food for birds in a wintery landscape, facilitating their survival. Almost all bird species change therefore to fat-rich food. In addition, spruce forests offer more opportunities for arthropod communities to hide during winter then deciduous forests. The rough bark of spruce is a large surface with relatively safe hiding places for wintering arthropods, therefore making insects less available for birds 
   <a rid="pone.0053121-Haftorn1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Haftorn1">[9]</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0053121-Caraco1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Caraco1">[11]</a>. Predation risk is probably also higher for birds at feeding stations in open beech forests then in closed spruce forests 
   <a rid="pone.0053121-Haftorn1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Haftorn1">[9]</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0053121-Caraco1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Caraco1">[11]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0053121-Hilton1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Hilton1">[43]</a>. Beech forests probably offer a higher quality and quantity of energy, but the energy needed for hiding from potential predators in open beech forests (compared to spruce forests) should decrease activity at feeding stations in these habitats 
   <a rid="pone.0053121-Hilton1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Hilton1">[43]</a>. We found the opposite: higher activity at feeding stations in beech forests, suggested that predation risk and need for high levels of energy intake are a trade off for winter birds in Central Europe.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conclusions</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In temperate forests, bird activity is affected by snow cover and temperature. In addition, habitat type rather than food type availability affects bird activity. Our study suggests that resident winter birds are strongly affected by snow and temperature, and that food preferences change from pre-breeding to breeding. Therefore, studies on bird breeding in seasonal environments should take into account changes in food availability and food preferences.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Still missing in our framework of experiments to understand food availability are other land management strategies beyond forest management. For example, studies based on our approach could compare bird food preference (or other animals affected by seasonal environments) in grasslands or farmlands, in order to assess the relative importance of food, weather, and land management strategies for birds foraging in a constantly-changing, human-dominated world.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most studies with feeding experiments similar to ours focused on seasonal environments; a study with a similar approach in the tropics, where seasonality is different, is currently lacking and would add valuable information on how climate zones affect food availability. Addressing whether in a less, or rather different seasonal environment (e.g., rain vs. drought rather than low temperature vs. high temperature, or natural like forest vs. oil palm plantations) birds respond to land management strategies prior to and during breeding would enhance our understanding of the importance of food availability.</p>
