 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In temperate forests, bird activity is affected by snow cover and temperature. In addition, habitat type rather than food type availability affects bird activity. Our study suggests that resident winter birds are strongly affected by snow and temperature, and that food preferences change from pre-breeding to breeding. Therefore, studies on bird breeding in seasonal environments should take into account changes in food availability and food preferences.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Still missing in our framework of experiments to understand food availability are other land management strategies beyond forest management. For example, studies based on our approach could compare bird food preference (or other animals affected by seasonal environments) in grasslands or farmlands, in order to assess the relative importance of food, weather, and land management strategies for birds foraging in a constantly-changing, human-dominated world.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most studies with feeding experiments similar to ours focused on seasonal environments; a study with a similar approach in the tropics, where seasonality is different, is currently lacking and would add valuable information on how climate zones affect food availability. Addressing whether in a less, or rather different seasonal environment (e.g., rain vs. drought rather than low temperature vs. high temperature, or natural like forest vs. oil palm plantations) birds respond to land management strategies prior to and during breeding would enhance our understanding of the importance of food availability.</p>
