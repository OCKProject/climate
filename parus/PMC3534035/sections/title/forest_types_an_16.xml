 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our experimental plots cover two forest management regimes, with managed forests of spruce (
  <span class="italic">Picea abies</span>) and beech (
  <span class="italic">Fagus sylvatica</span>) of different ages 
  <a rid="pone.0053121-Fischer1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Fischer1">[2]</a>. These 11 experimental plots have been selected based on dominant tree species (large trees with canopy cover over 70% of the experimental plot area). The experimental plots within each habitat type have supposedly similar average diameter at breast height (DBH) and age structure. While five plots have been placed in spruce forests (AEW01, AEW02, AEW10, AEW12, AEW34), six have been located in beech forests (AEW08, AEW04, AEW07, AEW28, AEW46, AEW45). The maximum distance between the plots is 20 km; plots are located in discontinuous forest patches, separated by other forest types or open landscapes.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) methods have been shown to provide continuous environmental variables that largely outcompete traditional forest type classifications which many times are also relatively coarse

  <a rid="pone.0053121-Bradbury1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0053121-Bradbury1">[48]</a>. We used LiDAR to obtain continuous environmental variables of all experimental plots during leave-on (deciduous trees) season end of July 2010. A Riegl LMS-Q 560 scanner was mounted on a helicopter flying at an altitude of 600 m. The size of the footprint diameter ranged between 20 cm and 30 cm and the sampling accuracy was 50 cm horizontally and 15 cm vertically. Based on normalized raw data and the Canopy Height model we then mathematically derived forest structure parameters, which are Roughness (vertical heterogeneity), Understory (extent of shrubs and bushes close to the forest ground), Island (canopy islands), Stem Zone (extent of the stem zone which is shows no leave, basically to open area within a forest), Euphotic Zone (leave area which resembles basically the canopy), and Forest Height (the mean height of the outer canopy height; further details of LiDAR parameters are explained in
