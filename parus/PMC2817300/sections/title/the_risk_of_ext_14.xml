 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Projected impacts of climate change for Western Europe include an increase in air temperature in all seasons (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20090799F5" href="#RSPB20090799F5">figure 5</a>) and changes in the seasonal distribution of rainfall (

  </a>). Our simulations of projected changes in lake surface temperature based on these results indicate average increases of between 0.8°C and 2.3°C in January and 0.8°C and 2.4°C in spring (March, April and May). We used our model B to assess the egg-to-smolt survival prospects for the Burrishoole wild salmon population under two future climate scenarios, i.e. 60 years hence, with low and high proportions of Burrishoole ranched fish in the wild spawning cohort. The model outputs show no reduction in egg-to-smolt survival when the proportion of eggs from ranched fish is low under either of the future projected climate scenarios (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20090799F4" href="#RSPB20090799F4">figure 4</a>
  <span class="italic">a</span>). If anything they suggest an increase in survival compared to historical levels. In contrast, poor outcomes and considerably lower egg-to-smolt survivals, including some catastrophic results are predicted for the population when the proportion of eggs originating from ranched fish is high. In 11 of the 15 30-year model runs based on the E A2 scenario, zero egg-to-smolt survival was observed in at least one year. Two of these model runs are even more pessimistic each showing two consecutive years with zero survival (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has been shown that, in a directionally changing environment, mean phenotype will lag behind the optimum, but will evolve on a roughly parallel trajectory (

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C34" href="#RSPB20090799C34">Naish &amp; Hard 2008</a>). The magnitude of the lag determines the vulnerability to extinction. Based on our analysis, large scale interbreeding with captive-bred fish has the potential to increase the size of this disparity and prevent the population from at least tracking changes in the environment. Even low levels of gene flow from a captive population to a wild population will shift the wild population's mean phenotype so that it approaches the hatchery optimum (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C13" href="#RSPB20090799C13">Ford 2002</a>). The effects of this are particularly severe if high levels of hybridization and introgression are reoccurring on a continuous basis (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C22" href="#RSPB20090799C22">Hindar 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2006
  </a>). Furthermore, as the population adapts to a novel environment, its density may fall below critically low levels for a period of time (the burden imposed by natural selection). During this time, it becomes highly vulnerable to extinction by non genetic stochastic demographic processes, in other words ‘the population succumbs before it has a chance to evolve’ (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C17" href="#RSPB20090799C17">Gomulkiewicz &amp; Holt 1995</a>). Our results suggest that high levels of gene flow from the hatchery can impair the adaptive capacity of the Burrishoole wild salmon population enough to jeopardize its long-term viability. The evidence that this occurs by impacting directly on traits associated with the fish's ability to deal with increased winter temperatures at the egg stage of development is compelling, though this is not to say that other important traits are not similarly affected by gene flow from the hatchery.
