 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Surface water temperature (SWT) data for Lough Feeagh were collected from 1960 to present using a Negretti chart recorder and temperature probe from 1960 to 2003 at a site close to the outflow from the lake (depth 40–60 cm). Temperatures at 12.00 have been abstracted from charts since 1960. SWT has been measured at the same site using a Stowaway TidbiT (Onset Computer Corporation) from 2003 to present. Data were missing for several short periods including spring 1971 and January 1990. Monthly and seasonal means were calculated for 1970–2006. Daily precipitation data were available from the furnace meteorological station from 1960. Precipitation was summarized as monthly sums and as monthly 90th percentile values. The latter were considered to reflect high flow conditions.</p>
