 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistical analysis was performed using M
  <span class="sc">initab</span> (13.1) or SPSS (11.0). We used a multiple linear regression approach to assess the influence of ranched eggs, water temperature and precipitation on egg-to-smolt survival, with egg-to-smolt survival as the dependent variable. Our initial exploration of the data indicated a significant negative relationship between egg-to-smolt survival and ranched egg proportion at the time of egg deposition. This factor was retained in subsequent models. Climatic variables were added in a forward running stepwise manner starting at the time of egg incubation (year 0) and continuing until the time of smolt migration to sea (June year 2). These were assessed as both monthly and seasonal values. The resulting model is referred to as model A. Two-way interactive terms were also assessed in the final model but none were significant.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a further exploration of the data, we expressed the variable ranched eggs/all eggs as a dummy variable 1 or 0 for years with high and low proportions of ranched eggs (model B). A cut-off of 15 per cent gave two datasets with average proportion of 34 per cent (range 18–60%; 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 15) and 6 per cent (range 1–13%; 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 16) for high and low years, respectively, and was selected following visual inspection of the plot of ranched eggs/all eggs against egg-to-smolt survival. The dummy variable is referred to as HiLo and was retained in all further models. Climatic variables were then assessed in a stepwise manner as described above. This approach gave a model (model B) with results similar to those of model A, but explained a lower proportion of the variability. However, the final model included a significant interactive term between HiLo and water temperature at the time of egg incubation. The resulting model may be considered to represent two linear models for high and low ranched egg proportions, respectively (see below). Non-significant contributing terms are included in the model in accordance with the hierarchical principle. All datasets were assessed for normality using the Shapiro–Wilks test. All had a normal distribution, with the exception of reared eggs/all eggs. However, as the use of transformed data did not change the overall regression results, the original data were retained.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The models were as follows:</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Low contribution of ranched eggs</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Egg to smolt % survival = (−0.050 * Jan SWT year 0) + (−0.092 * Jan SWT year 1) + (0.131 * Spring SWT year 2) + (0.010 * 90 ppt Jan year 1) + (−0.011 * 90 ppt Aug year 1) + 0.265.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">High contribution of ranched eggs</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Egg-to-smolt survival = (−0.151 * Jan SWT year 0) + (−0.092 * Jan SWT year 1) + (0.131 * Spring SWT year 2) + (0.010 * 90 ppt Jan year 1) + (−0.011 * 90 ppt Aug year 1) + 0.606.</p>
