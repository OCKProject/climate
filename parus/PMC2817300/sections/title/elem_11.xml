   </a>) concluded that water temperature and photoperiod (and factors related to them) were likely to be the most important physical variables determining local selective pressures in Atlantic salmon populations. Our models show that higher water temperatures encountered in the first winter, when eggs are incubating in gravel beds, and in the second winter, when fish are 0+ juveniles (parr), have negative effects on survival. We believe that the negative response to warmer winter water temperatures found is consistent with

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C4" href="#RSPB20090799C4">Bradshaw &amp; Holzapel (2006)</a> that climate change, particularly at higher latitudes, will impose seasonal rather than thermal selection (summer thermal tolerance) on natural populations.

   <span class="italic">Parus major</span> (

   </a>) warm winters can lead to earlier hatching but not necessarily advance the supply of food for the hatchlings. It is quite plausible that this is also the case for salmon eggs and salmon alevins, with earlier than normal hatching and emergence induced by increased winter water temperatures predisposing fry to the risk of starvation. It follows that higher mortality is likely to occur in warm winters because of a mismatch in developmental schedules between the hatching eggs and emerging salmon fry and their prey resulting in insufficient energy reserves for survival. The eggs of a ‘locally adapted’ population of salmon might be expected to match the energy demands of a typical winter by either having eggs of sufficient size (see below), by a slowing of developmental rates, or by a phenological adjustment of spawning time.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The interaction term in model B suggests that increases in winter temperature are a much greater problem for the progeny of hatchery fish, particularly the eggs, than for the progeny of wild fish. We know from previous studies that Burrishoole ranched salmon produce significantly smaller eggs than Burrishoole wild salmon (

    <span class="italic">et al</span>. 1997
   </a>), which would pre-dispose them to higher mortalities in the wild during winters with excessive energy demands as they would have less intrinsic food resources than larger eggs. While it has been demonstrated elsewhere (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C20" href="#RSPB20090799C20">Heath 
    <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2003
   </a>) that there is usually no fitness penalty for producing small eggs in benign hatchery environments, less fit offspring would emerge from small eggs than large eggs in sub-optimal natural environments (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C8" href="#RSPB20090799C8">Einum 
    <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2004

    <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2001
   </a>) are in addition likely to contribute to the large apparent differences in performance between the progeny of ranched parents compared with their wild conspecifics.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For older fish experiencing their first winter as parr, our models also suggest a strong negative effect of increasing winter water temperature on survival. By proposing a simple ‘bio-energetics’ explanation for this outcome, we might reasonably assume that increases in metabolic rates as a consequence of higher winter temperatures cause the depletion of parr energy reserves faster than in cold years and decrease the likelihood of survival until food supplies become available in spring. Excessive depletion of energy reserves in winter has recently been shown to be a major cause of mortality in juvenile fish (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C9" href="#RSPB20090799C9">Finstad 
    <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2004
   </a>) and provides strong support for this idea.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, in common with many animals, salmon parr undergo a winter dormancy or hibernation to overcome the demands of winter stress. There are two advantages to hibernating: conserving energy that would be used up in seeking food and maintaining station at high flows and secondly in reducing the risk of predation. It has been shown previously that salmon stop feeding in the autumn and find shelter within the stream bed even though food is plentiful (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C32" href="#RSPB20090799C32">Metcalfe &amp; Thorpe 1992</a>), suggesting that this behaviour is adaptive. Furthermore, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C32" href="#RSPB20090799C32">Metcalfe &amp; Thorpe (1992)</a> have shown that the anorexia associated with the onset of winter is a genetically determined response to photoperiod. To survive, salmon parr need to predict accurately when food will be available some six months in advance. Photoperiod provides one of the most important cues for events that are distant in time or space (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C5" href="#RSPB20090799C5">Bradshaw &amp; Holzapfel 2008</a>). In contrast, temperature, food and other ecological conditions become more important closer to the actual event itself and are associated with phenotypically plastic, non-genetic, phenological responses to the environment. Incorrect physiological or behavioural responses to photoperiod cues, such as suspending feeding prematurely, could explain the poorer survival in Burrishoole salmon associated with increased winter water temperature observed in this study. In contrast to the eggs, no HiLo interaction effect was found in overwintering parr. Either the warmer winter temperature affects both the parr progeny of wild and hatchery fish equally or more likely that the progeny of hatchery fish die at the egg stage disproportionately and are no longer present in the population in sufficient numbers to have an effect.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the final winter before spring metamorphosis from parr to smolt, appetite and growth of salmon are maintained through the winter, and parr are therefore less dependent on stored energy reserves than in the first two winters. Consequently, it is not surprising that we found no relationship between water temperature in the third winter and survival. However, the positive effect on survival of warm spring temperatures may come about through improved foraging efficiency and enhancement of the smoltification process. Our model would suggest that there is little difference in the response of hatchery and wild presmolts, but the progeny of hatchery fish are less likely to have survived the rigours of their first two winters to have much impact on overall survival at the smolt stage, their number being greatly reduced at egg and fry stages.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results clearly demonstrate that hatchery fish spawning in the wild can impact negatively on freshwater survival chances in natural populations. The study provides some clues as to one specific cause and effect. However, in addition to the winter temperature effects postulated, captively bred fish in other studies have shown increased metabolic rates and food conversion efficiency (

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C11" href="#RSPB20090799C11">Fleming &amp; Einum 1997</a>) and less risk averse to predators compared with wild fish (

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C11" href="#RSPB20090799C11">Fleming &amp; Einum 1997</a>). These are all characteristics that have proven to be maladaptive in the wild. Without tangible gene flow from the hatchery to the river, the differential response of the progeny of wild and hatchery fish to higher winter temperature could account for the variation in survival observed with respect to the proportion of hatchery fish in the spawning population. Yet this is of little consequence to the evolutionary trajectory of the wild population unless there is a direct genetic interaction by inter-breeding between wild and ranched adults either in the parental F1 or subsequent generations. A direct interaction would lead to a change in the genetic composition of the wild population by the addition or incorporation of a ‘genetic load’ carried over from the hatchery into the wild that might subsequently affect its productivity. This ‘load’ or degree of maladaptation to the existing natural environment occurs because hatchery populations (where food is available ad libitum) do not experience the continuous evolutionary adjustment possible in the wild, and therefore they do not have the benefit of a history of natural selection experienced by the wild population. Consequently, the mismatch between the hatchery fish and the natural environment will increase. In addition, domestication selection in the hatchery population, such as for reduced fear of predators, will exacerbate these differences over time. Illustrating this possibility empirically (McGinnity 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C30" href="#RSPB20090799C30">2003</a>), it has been shown that hybrid progeny of local wild salmon and farm escape salmon parents have, when compared under natural conditions, intermediate fitness to their parents. This lower fitness in hybrids was found to be accompanied by a reduction in the productive potential of the hybridized population. It is known that ranched and wild salmon at Burrishoole interbreed in the wild (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C48" href="#RSPB20090799C48">Thompson 
    <span class="italic">et al</span>. 1998
   </a>), gene flow primarily occurring by fertilization of eggs of ranched females by wild mature male parr. Although not usually to the same extent, it has also been shown in this and other studies that substantial levels of gene flow also occurs via captive bred males to wild females (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C12" href="#RSPB20090799C12">Fleming

    <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2004
   </a>). The extent of the gene flow between ranched males and wild females might be expected to be a function of the proportion of captive bred fish in the spawning population. We might conclude therefore that some of the HiLo effect on egg-to-smolt survival pertains to both the progeny of the hatchery fish and the F(n) hybrid progeny of wild and hatchery reared fish.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We interpret our results as being consistent with the predictions of general theoretical demographic-evolutionary models (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C6" href="#RSPB20090799C6">Burger &amp; Lynch 1995</a>;

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C28" href="#RSPB20090799C28">Kirkpatrick &amp; Barton 1997</a>). These models suggest that each time a population undergoes an evolutionary adjustment in response to variations in the environment through natural selection, a demographic penalty, such as a higher rate of mortality is incurred. In our study, the demographic penalty associated with increases in winter temperature or high summer precipitation is a reduction in egg-to-smolt survival. Though the relationship between natural selection and environmental change and the demographic response have been modelled extensively, there are very few empirical examples under natural conditions (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C16" href="#RSPB20090799C16">Grant &amp; Grant 2002</a>). The end product of these adjustments should be a population that is better adapted to its local environment and consequently is increasing in size towards its carrying capacity (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C28" href="#RSPB20090799C28">Kirkpatrick &amp; Barton 1997</a>). However, what is also suggested from our results is that the potential to adapt to environmental change can be thwarted by concurrent and recurrent genetic changes in the wild population following hybridization with captive bred animals, which are subject to domestication and possibly directional selection. Also they will not be not subject to natural selection in benign hatchery environments and as a consequence are less well adapted to life in the wild. This would counteract any positive adaptive response in the wild population to environmental change and increase the demographic costs imposed by natural selection.

Our simulations of projected changes in lake surface temperature based on these results indicate average increases of between 0.8°C and 2.3°C in January and 0.8°C and 2.4°C in spring (March, April and May). We used our model B to assess the egg-to-smolt survival prospects for the Burrishoole wild salmon population under two future climate scenarios, i.e. 60 years hence, with low and high proportions of Burrishoole ranched fish in the wild spawning cohort. The model outputs show no reduction in egg-to-smolt survival when the proportion of eggs from ranched fish is low under either of the future projected climate scenarios (

In contrast, poor outcomes and considerably lower egg-to-smolt survivals, including some catastrophic results are predicted for the population when the proportion of eggs originating from ranched fish is high. In 11 of the 15 30-year model runs based on the E A2 scenario, zero egg-to-smolt survival was observed in at least one year.

Based on our analysis, large scale interbreeding with captive-bred fish has the potential to increase the size of this disparity and prevent the population from at least tracking changes in the environment. Even low levels of gene flow from a captive population to a wild population will shift the wild population's mean phenotype so that it approaches the hatchery optimum (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C13" href="#RSPB20090799C13">Ford 2002</a>). The effects of this are particularly severe if high levels of hybridization and introgression are reoccurring on a continuous basis (

   </a>). Furthermore, as the population adapts to a novel environment, its density may fall below critically low levels for a period of time (the burden imposed by natural selection). During this time, it becomes highly vulnerable to extinction by non genetic stochastic demographic processes, in other words ‘the population succumbs before it has a chance to evolve’ (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C17" href="#RSPB20090799C17">Gomulkiewicz &amp; Holt 1995</a>). Our results suggest that high levels of gene flow from the hatchery can impair the adaptive capacity of the Burrishoole wild salmon population enough to jeopardize its long-term viability. The evidence that this occurs by impacting directly on traits associated with the fish's ability to deal with increased winter temperatures at the egg stage of development is compelling, though this is not to say that other important traits are not similarly affected by gene flow from the hatchery.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C43" href="#RSPB20090799C43">Schiermeier 2003</a>). It is surely a serious cause for concern that a large proportion of the marine production of farmed salmon occurs close to high-latitude Norwegian rivers. In these rivers, where salmon parr require four and even five winters to reach the smolt stage (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C31" href="#RSPB20090799C31">Metcalfe &amp; Thorpe 1990</a>), climate projections show winter temperatures increasing by the greatest magnitude (up to 6°C) (

Our results imply that the impact of climate change combined with a high proportion of farm escapes that breed in the wild could have an even greater negative impact on the productivity of wild salmon populations at these high latitudes than predicted for western Ireland, particularly as each extra year spent in freshwater must increase the demographic cost of selection.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conclude based on this study that ranched fish capable of breeding in the wild, even where strains have been established from local or progenitor stocks, should not be deliberately introduced into natural salmon rivers, and that measures must be found to reduce the numbers of escaped farm salmon in nature, if wild salmon populations are to successfully adapt to climate change. Our findings are likely to hold true for other poikilothermic animals where captive breeding programmes are used in population management. Recent reports suggest that captive breeding is being considered for some of the estimated 1900 species of amphibians that are known to be threatened with extinction (
