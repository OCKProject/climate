 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The natural environment has been undergoing unprecedented change due to climate warming (

   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2007
  </a>). A large body of evidence indicates that many organisms, including fish, are affected by changes associated with this warming (

   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2002
  </a>). Impacts include phenological change, biogeographical range shifts, reduced fitness and population extinctions (

   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2005
  </a>). The focus of much contemporary research has been on adaptive responses to climate warming such as thermal tolerance (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C39" href="#RSPB20090799C39">Portner &amp; Knust 2007</a>), acclimation to higher summer temperatures (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C44" href="#RSPB20090799C44">Stillman 2003</a>) and climate-mediated susceptibility to disease (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C19" href="#RSPB20090799C19">Hari 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2006

   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2006
  </a>). It has also been shown that adaptive shifts in the timing of life-stages, such as dormancy, migration, development and reproduction, will be required if animals are to adapt to projected future climates and that these life-stage adaptations should precede other effects (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C4" href="#RSPB20090799C4">Bradshaw &amp; Holzapel 2006</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Populations undergoing adaptation to new environmental conditions will incur demographic costs (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C6" href="#RSPB20090799C6">Burger &amp; Lynch 1995</a>). Recruitment declines that follow will usually, with other factors such as over-harvesting or habitat deterioration, elicit a directed management response. For example, in the case of salmonids, every year millions of hatchery fish are deliberately released into the wild from captive breeding programmes (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C33" href="#RSPB20090799C33">Myers 2004</a>), either for the maintenance of fisheries and attempted enhancement of declining wild stocks, or also accidentally as a by-product of salmon farming (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C43" href="#RSPB20090799C43">Schiermeier 2003</a>). It may be that some of these management actions do more harm than good.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has previously been shown that the progeny of farm-bred salmon are less fit than wild fish under natural conditions and that fitness reduction and potential extinction for wild populations could result from interactions with escaped farm salmon (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C30" href="#RSPB20090799C30">McGinnity 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2003

   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2007
  </a>), although the mechanisms causing the reductions of fitness observed were not identified. Here we report on a 37-year study of Atlantic salmon (
  <span class="italic">Salmo salar</span>) from the Burrishoole river system in the west of Ireland, which shows that a wild population, where fish from a captive-bred population represent a variable but often substantial proportion of the naturally spawning cohort, is less able to adapt to higher freshwater winter temperatures and is negatively and disproportionately impacted by climate change, to such an extent that under projected future climates its future existence is threatened.
