 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Projected future climate at Burrishoole</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Future changes in climate for Burrishoole for 2071–2100 include an increase in air temperature in all seasons and changes in the seasonal distribution of precipitation (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20090799F3" href="#RSPB20090799F3">figure 3</a>). The projected increase in January air temperatures ranges from 0.9°C to 3.1°C while increases for spring are expected to be between 1.2°C and 3.3°C. Precipitation in January is projected to increase by between 25 per cent and 58 per cent while in contrast August should be drier with decreases ranging from 4 per cent to 62 per cent. Increases in water temperature of between 0.8°C and 2.3°C are projected for January, while those for spring (March, April and May) range from 0.8°C and 2.4°C.
