  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adult Atlantic salmon in the Burrishoole river system are anadromous and typically return to freshwater between June and September and spawn the following December. At this latitude (53°59′ N), juveniles generally spend three winters in freshwater, including the winter when eggs are in the gravel, before migrating to sea as smolts in April and May (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C31" href="#RSPB20090799C31">Metcalfe &amp; Thorpe 1990</a>). A total trapping system for the counting of returning adults and migrating smolts has been operated at Burrishoole since 1969 at two locations above the tide (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20090799F1" href="#RSPB20090799F1">figure 1</a>), allowing both the quantification of all fish entering and leaving the system and the estimation of egg numbers (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20090799F2" href="#RSPB20090799F2">figure 2</a>
   <span class="italic">a</span>). The number of adult wild salmon spawning in the system during the period of the study ranged from 203 to 1485 individuals. Total estimates of egg input into the wild includes a variable proportion, 1–60%, of eggs deposited by adult salmon from an experimental captive breeding and smolt release (ranching) programme (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20090799F2" href="#RSPB20090799F2">figure 2</a>
   <span class="italic">b</span>). The number of salmon bred in captivity spawning naturally in the system has varied between 8 and 608 fish. The captive breeding programme for salmon was established from wild fish collected from the catchment between 1960 and 1964. Additional wild fish were included in the breeding stock between 1970 and 1975. The breeding population has been effectively closed since that time with brood fish being selected from returning ranched fish. The Burrishoole hatchery population fish are referred to as ranched fish.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The estimated fecundities for this analysis of both Burrishoole wild and ranched females are based on values previously reported in 1974 of 4000 eggs for one sea winter fish and 6000 eggs for two sea winter fish (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C42" href="#RSPB20090799C42">Salmon Research Trust/Agency of Ireland including the Marine Institute 1955–2006</a>). The sex ratio of 55 per cent female for one sea winter wild fish is based on the average value reported between 1963 and 1974. A value of 70 per cent female is calculated for two sea winter wild fish based on observations on fish captured in the Burrishoole river traps. All ranched fish spawning in the wild are assumed to be one sea winter fish. All smolts are assumed to be 2 years old (time from emergence to smoltification). The percentage survival to smolt stage was calculated from these data and is referred to as egg-to-smolt survival. The value for 2001 was exceptionally high (3.5 times the s.d.) and was considered to be an outlier and omitted from the analysis. The number of ranched eggs contributing to the total number of eggs in any year was expressed as a proportion (ranched eggs/all eggs).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Water temperature and precipitation data</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Surface water temperature (SWT) data for Lough Feeagh were collected from 1960 to present using a Negretti chart recorder and temperature probe from 1960 to 2003 at a site close to the outflow from the lake (depth 40–60 cm). Temperatures at 12.00 have been abstracted from charts since 1960. SWT has been measured at the same site using a Stowaway TidbiT (Onset Computer Corporation) from 2003 to present. Data were missing for several short periods including spring 1971 and January 1990. Monthly and seasonal means were calculated for 1970–2006. Daily precipitation data were available from the furnace meteorological station from 1960. Precipitation was summarized as monthly sums and as monthly 90th percentile values. The latter were considered to reflect high flow conditions.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data analyses</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistical analysis was performed using M
   <span class="sc">initab</span> (13.1) or SPSS (11.0). We used a multiple linear regression approach to assess the influence of ranched eggs, water temperature and precipitation on egg-to-smolt survival, with egg-to-smolt survival as the dependent variable. Our initial exploration of the data indicated a significant negative relationship between egg-to-smolt survival and ranched egg proportion at the time of egg deposition. This factor was retained in subsequent models. Climatic variables were added in a forward running stepwise manner starting at the time of egg incubation (year 0) and continuing until the time of smolt migration to sea (June year 2). These were assessed as both monthly and seasonal values. The resulting model is referred to as model A. Two-way interactive terms were also assessed in the final model but none were significant.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a further exploration of the data, we expressed the variable ranched eggs/all eggs as a dummy variable 1 or 0 for years with high and low proportions of ranched eggs (model B). A cut-off of 15 per cent gave two datasets with average proportion of 34 per cent (range 18–60%; 
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 15) and 6 per cent (range 1–13%; 
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 16) for high and low years, respectively, and was selected following visual inspection of the plot of ranched eggs/all eggs against egg-to-smolt survival. The dummy variable is referred to as HiLo and was retained in all further models. Climatic variables were then assessed in a stepwise manner as described above. This approach gave a model (model B) with results similar to those of model A, but explained a lower proportion of the variability. However, the final model included a significant interactive term between HiLo and water temperature at the time of egg incubation. The resulting model may be considered to represent two linear models for high and low ranched egg proportions, respectively (see below). Non-significant contributing terms are included in the model in accordance with the hierarchical principle. All datasets were assessed for normality using the Shapiro–Wilks test. All had a normal distribution, with the exception of reared eggs/all eggs. However, as the use of transformed data did not change the overall regression results, the original data were retained.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The models were as follows:</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Low contribution of ranched eggs</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Egg to smolt % survival = (−0.050 * Jan SWT year 0) + (−0.092 * Jan SWT year 1) + (0.131 * Spring SWT year 2) + (0.010 * 90 ppt Jan year 1) + (−0.011 * 90 ppt Aug year 1) + 0.265.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Future climate modelling</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the lake temperature model DYRESM (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C24" href="#RSPB20090799C24">Imberger &amp; Patterson 1981</a>; 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C25" href="#RSPB20090799C25">Imerito 2007</a>), to model the impact of projected climate change on lake SWT. The model was run on a daily time step. Once validated, DYRESM was run using daily data for a control period and a future climate scenario period (2071–2100), a standardized control time frame commonly used in climate change impact studies across Europe (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C41" href="#RSPB20090799C41">Räisänen 
    <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2004
   </a>). These daily data were multiple time-series output from the Climate Research Unit (UK) weather generator (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C27" href="#RSPB20090799C27">Jones &amp; Salmon 1995</a>). The weather generator was first trained using local data for the period 1966–1993. Multiple 30-year time series of daily data were output for a control period based on these observational data. The weather generator was then perturbed based on the output from two general circulation model (GCM) and regional climate model (RCM) combinations to produce multiple 30-year time series for future climate scenarios. The RCM used for both combinations was the Rossby Center Regional Climate Model RCAO (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C41" href="#RSPB20090799C41">Räisänen 
    <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2004
   </a>). The GCMs were the ECHAM4/OPYC3 GCM (Max Plank Institute, Germany) and the HadAM3H GCM (Hadley Center, UK). The future climate scenario period was run with assumptions based on the A2 and B2 scenarios on future greenhouse emissions. The training set consisted of 28 years from weather stations at Burrishoole and Belmullet, County Mayo (40 km NNW of Burrishoole). Daily mean lake SWT was simulated for the control and the projected climate period for all scenarios. Mean monthly and spring SWT were calculated from these data.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Future egg-to-smolt survival was then calculated using model B. Projected mean January and mean Spring lake SWT data from DYRESM runs, together with projected 90th percentiles of January and August precipitation, were used as input to model B to calculate projected egg-to-smolt survival for two reared egg scenarios based on high and low ranched egg contributions as defined above. The use of this regression gave two linear models for scenarios with less and greater than 15 per cent reared eggs, respectively.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each 30-year period of daily data output by the weather generator gave 28 egg to smolt per cent survival estimates. The model was run for two future climate scenarios, which represent a relatively high and relatively low projected increase in water temperatures at Burrishoole, respectively: the ECHAM4/OPYC3-RCAO A2 scenario (E A2) and the HadAM3H-RCAO B2 scenario (H B2). Results are presented for 15 runs for the control period, the E A2 scenario and the H B2 scenario as box plots of the overall distribution of egg-to-smolt survival (
