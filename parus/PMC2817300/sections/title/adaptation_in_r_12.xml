 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a recent review of local adaptation in Atlantic salmon,

   <span class="italic">et al</span>. (2007
  </a>) concluded that water temperature and photoperiod (and factors related to them) were likely to be the most important physical variables determining local selective pressures in Atlantic salmon populations. Our models show that higher water temperatures encountered in the first winter, when eggs are incubating in gravel beds, and in the second winter, when fish are 0+ juveniles (parr), have negative effects on survival. We believe that the negative response to warmer winter water temperatures found is consistent with

   <span class="italic">et al</span>. (2007
  </a>) and can be explained most effectively within a bioenergetics framework similar to the model proposed for the little brown bat 
  <span class="italic">Myotis lucifugus</span> (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C23" href="#RSPB20090799C23">Humphries

  </a>), with the timing of the physiological processes associated with energy acquisition synchronized by photoperiod (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C4" href="#RSPB20090799C4">Bradshaw &amp; Holzapel 2006</a>). That winter temperatures rather than summer temperatures were found in this study to have the greatest effect on survival supports the idea proposed by 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C4" href="#RSPB20090799C4">Bradshaw &amp; Holzapel (2006)</a> that climate change, particularly at higher latitudes, will impose seasonal rather than thermal selection (summer thermal tolerance) on natural populations.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As has also been reported recently for the European great tit 
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span> (

  </a>) warm winters can lead to earlier hatching but not necessarily advance the supply of food for the hatchlings. It is quite plausible that this is also the case for salmon eggs and salmon alevins, with earlier than normal hatching and emergence induced by increased winter water temperatures predisposing fry to the risk of starvation. It follows that higher mortality is likely to occur in warm winters because of a mismatch in developmental schedules between the hatching eggs and emerging salmon fry and their prey resulting in insufficient energy reserves for survival. The eggs of a ‘locally adapted’ population of salmon might be expected to match the energy demands of a typical winter by either having eggs of sufficient size (see below), by a slowing of developmental rates, or by a phenological adjustment of spawning time.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The interaction term in model B suggests that increases in winter temperature are a much greater problem for the progeny of hatchery fish, particularly the eggs, than for the progeny of wild fish. We know from previous studies that Burrishoole ranched salmon produce significantly smaller eggs than Burrishoole wild salmon (

   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 1997
  </a>), which would pre-dispose them to higher mortalities in the wild during winters with excessive energy demands as they would have less intrinsic food resources than larger eggs. While it has been demonstrated elsewhere (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C20" href="#RSPB20090799C20">Heath 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2003
  </a>) that there is usually no fitness penalty for producing small eggs in benign hatchery environments, less fit offspring would emerge from small eggs than large eggs in sub-optimal natural environments (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C8" href="#RSPB20090799C8">Einum 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2004
  </a>). Other adaptive traits such as the timing of spawning (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C21" href="#RSPB20090799C21">Heggberget 1988</a>) and genetically determined differences in predator avoidance in young fish (

   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2001
  </a>) are in addition likely to contribute to the large apparent differences in performance between the progeny of ranched parents compared with their wild conspecifics.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For older fish experiencing their first winter as parr, our models also suggest a strong negative effect of increasing winter water temperature on survival. By proposing a simple ‘bio-energetics’ explanation for this outcome, we might reasonably assume that increases in metabolic rates as a consequence of higher winter temperatures cause the depletion of parr energy reserves faster than in cold years and decrease the likelihood of survival until food supplies become available in spring. Excessive depletion of energy reserves in winter has recently been shown to be a major cause of mortality in juvenile fish (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C9" href="#RSPB20090799C9">Finstad 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2004
  </a>) and provides strong support for this idea.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, in common with many animals, salmon parr undergo a winter dormancy or hibernation to overcome the demands of winter stress. There are two advantages to hibernating: conserving energy that would be used up in seeking food and maintaining station at high flows and secondly in reducing the risk of predation. It has been shown previously that salmon stop feeding in the autumn and find shelter within the stream bed even though food is plentiful (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C32" href="#RSPB20090799C32">Metcalfe &amp; Thorpe 1992</a>), suggesting that this behaviour is adaptive. Furthermore, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C32" href="#RSPB20090799C32">Metcalfe &amp; Thorpe (1992)</a> have shown that the anorexia associated with the onset of winter is a genetically determined response to photoperiod. To survive, salmon parr need to predict accurately when food will be available some six months in advance. Photoperiod provides one of the most important cues for events that are distant in time or space (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C5" href="#RSPB20090799C5">Bradshaw &amp; Holzapfel 2008</a>). In contrast, temperature, food and other ecological conditions become more important closer to the actual event itself and are associated with phenotypically plastic, non-genetic, phenological responses to the environment. Incorrect physiological or behavioural responses to photoperiod cues, such as suspending feeding prematurely, could explain the poorer survival in Burrishoole salmon associated with increased winter water temperature observed in this study. In contrast to the eggs, no HiLo interaction effect was found in overwintering parr. Either the warmer winter temperature affects both the parr progeny of wild and hatchery fish equally or more likely that the progeny of hatchery fish die at the egg stage disproportionately and are no longer present in the population in sufficient numbers to have an effect.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the final winter before spring metamorphosis from parr to smolt, appetite and growth of salmon are maintained through the winter, and parr are therefore less dependent on stored energy reserves than in the first two winters. Consequently, it is not surprising that we found no relationship between water temperature in the third winter and survival. However, the positive effect on survival of warm spring temperatures may come about through improved foraging efficiency and enhancement of the smoltification process. Our model would suggest that there is little difference in the response of hatchery and wild presmolts, but the progeny of hatchery fish are less likely to have survived the rigours of their first two winters to have much impact on overall survival at the smolt stage, their number being greatly reduced at egg and fry stages.</p>
