 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the lake temperature model DYRESM (

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C25" href="#RSPB20090799C25">Imerito 2007</a>), to model the impact of projected climate change on lake SWT. The model was run on a daily time step. Once validated, DYRESM was run using daily data for a control period and a future climate scenario period (2071–2100), a standardized control time frame commonly used in climate change impact studies across Europe (

  </a>). These daily data were multiple time-series output from the Climate Research Unit (UK) weather generator (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C27" href="#RSPB20090799C27">Jones &amp; Salmon 1995</a>). The weather generator was first trained using local data for the period 1966–1993. Multiple 30-year time series of daily data were output for a control period based on these observational data. The weather generator was then perturbed based on the output from two general circulation model (GCM) and regional climate model (RCM) combinations to produce multiple 30-year time series for future climate scenarios. The RCM used for both combinations was the Rossby Center Regional Climate Model RCAO (

   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2004
  </a>). The GCMs were the ECHAM4/OPYC3 GCM (Max Plank Institute, Germany) and the HadAM3H GCM (Hadley Center, UK). The future climate scenario period was run with assumptions based on the A2 and B2 scenarios on future greenhouse emissions. The training set consisted of 28 years from weather stations at Burrishoole and Belmullet, County Mayo (40 km NNW of Burrishoole). Daily mean lake SWT was simulated for the control and the projected climate period for all scenarios. Mean monthly and spring SWT were calculated from these data.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Future egg-to-smolt survival was then calculated using model B. Projected mean January and mean Spring lake SWT data from DYRESM runs, together with projected 90th percentiles of January and August precipitation, were used as input to model B to calculate projected egg-to-smolt survival for two reared egg scenarios based on high and low ranched egg contributions as defined above. The use of this regression gave two linear models for scenarios with less and greater than 15 per cent reared eggs, respectively.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each 30-year period of daily data output by the weather generator gave 28 egg to smolt per cent survival estimates. The model was run for two future climate scenarios, which represent a relatively high and relatively low projected increase in water temperatures at Burrishoole, respectively: the ECHAM4/OPYC3-RCAO A2 scenario (E A2) and the HadAM3H-RCAO B2 scenario (H B2). Results are presented for 15 runs for the control period, the E A2 scenario and the H B2 scenario as box plots of the overall distribution of egg-to-smolt survival (
