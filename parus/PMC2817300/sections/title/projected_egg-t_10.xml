 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Model B gave two linear models: one for a population with less 15 per cent eggs from reared fish and one for a population with greater than 15 per cent eggs from reared fish. Future egg-to-smolt survival estimated based on these models for two projected climate scenarios (E A2 and H B2) indicated no reduction in egg-to-smolt survival when the proportion of eggs from ranched fish was low under either scenario (

  <span class="italic">a</span>). Poor outcomes and considerably lower egg-to-smolt survival were predicted for the population when the proportion of eggs originating from ranched fish was high with 4 out of the 28 years (14.3%) having zero smolt recruitment from the eggs deposited (
