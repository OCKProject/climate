 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The seemingly intuitive management response to declines in natural production for both salmon and other commercially exploited wild fish species has been to increase the production and release of ranched fish (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C33" href="#RSPB20090799C33">Myers 2004</a>) with the objective of enhancing or at least sustaining natural production (

   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2006
  </a>). However, as we have shown here, such a practice is likely to exacerbate the impact of climate change on natural populations rather than ameliorate it (

   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2007
  </a>). Furthermore, an estimated two million salmon escape from farms around the North Atlantic each year (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C43" href="#RSPB20090799C43">Schiermeier 2003</a>). It is surely a serious cause for concern that a large proportion of the marine production of farmed salmon occurs close to high-latitude Norwegian rivers. In these rivers, where salmon parr require four and even five winters to reach the smolt stage (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C31" href="#RSPB20090799C31">Metcalfe &amp; Thorpe 1990</a>), climate projections show winter temperatures increasing by the greatest magnitude (up to 6°C) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20090799F5" href="#RSPB20090799F5">figure 5</a>). Our results imply that the impact of climate change combined with a high proportion of farm escapes that breed in the wild could have an even greater negative impact on the productivity of wild salmon populations at these high latitudes than predicted for western Ireland, particularly as each extra year spent in freshwater must increase the demographic cost of selection.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conclude based on this study that ranched fish capable of breeding in the wild, even where strains have been established from local or progenitor stocks, should not be deliberately introduced into natural salmon rivers, and that measures must be found to reduce the numbers of escaped farm salmon in nature, if wild salmon populations are to successfully adapt to climate change. Our findings are likely to hold true for other poikilothermic animals where captive breeding programmes are used in population management. Recent reports suggest that captive breeding is being considered for some of the estimated 1900 species of amphibians that are known to be threatened with extinction (

   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2008
  </a>). It is pertinent here that much of the extinction risk for amphibians is likely to be also climate mediated (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C40" href="#RSPB20090799C40">Pounds 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2006
  </a>). Rather than imposing an additional genetic load on wild populations experiencing climate change by releasing captive bred animals, we propose that conservation efforts should focus on optimising conditions for adaptation to occur by reducing exploitation and protecting critical habitats.
