  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The regression model results indicate that 76 per cent of the variability in egg-to-smolt survival in the Burrishoole salmon population for the period between 1969 and 2005 was explained by six factors (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="RSPB20090799TB1" href="#RSPB20090799TB1">table 1</a>, model A). These were five climate-related factors and the proportion of eggs in the natural spawning population contributed by ranched fish. The proportion of eggs from ranched fish in the spawning population had a significant negative impact on survival (
   <span class="italic">p</span> ≤ 0.0001). The five climatic effects included both positive and negative relationships. Both increases in winter water temperatures in year 0, when eggs are incubating in gravel beds, and in year 1, when fish are 0+ juveniles (parr), had significant negative effects on survival rates (
   <span class="italic">p</span> ≤ 0.0001). In contrast, higher water temperatures in the spring before the smolts went to sea had a positive impact on survival (
   <span class="italic">p</span> ≤ 0.0001). Two rainfall-related impacts were also identified. These were less significant than the temperature effects. Higher precipitation in the first winter had a positive effect on survival (
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01) while a further negative effect on survival was related to increased precipitation in the August preceding the second winter (
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0021).
