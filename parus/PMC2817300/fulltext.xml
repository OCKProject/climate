It is essential that any measures taken to conserve individual species and their constituent populations against climate-mediated declines are appropriate. The release of captive bred animals to augment wild populations is a widespread management strategy for many species but has proven controversial. Using a regression model based on a 37-year study of wild and sea ranched Atlantic salmon (<italic>Salmo salar</italic>) spawning together in the wild, we show that the escape of captive bred animals into the wild can substantially depress recruitment and more specifically disrupt the capacity of natural populations to adapt to higher winter water temperatures associated with climate variability. We speculate the mechanisms underlying this seasonal response and suggest that an explanation based on bio-energetic processes with physiological responses synchronized by photoperiod is plausible. Furthermore, we predict, by running the model forward using projected future climate scenarios, that these cultured fish substantially increase the risk of extinction for the studied population within 20 generations. In contrast, we show that positive outcomes to climate change are possible if captive bred animals are prevented from breeding in the wild. Rather than imposing an additional genetic load on wild populations by releasing maladapted captive bred animals, we propose that conservation efforts should focus on optimizing conditions for adaptation to occur by reducing exploitation and protecting critical habitats. Our findings are likely to hold true for most poikilothermic species where captive breeding programmes are used in population management.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>captive breeding</kwd><kwd>Atlantic salmon</kwd><kwd>climate change</kwd><kwd>bioenergetics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p>The natural environment has been undergoing unprecedented change due to climate warming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C10">Fischlin <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>). A large body of evidence indicates that many organisms, including fish, are affected by changes associated with this warming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C49">Walther <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>). Impacts include phenological change, biogeographical range shifts, reduced fitness and population extinctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C2">Beaugrand <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C36">Parmesan &#x00026; Yohe 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C47">Thomas <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C37">Perry <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>). The focus of much contemporary research has been on adaptive responses to climate warming such as thermal tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C39">Portner &#x00026; Knust 2007</xref>), acclimation to higher summer temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C44">Stillman 2003</xref>) and climate-mediated susceptibility to disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C19">Hari <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C40">Pounds <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>). It has also been shown that adaptive shifts in the timing of life-stages, such as dormancy, migration, development and reproduction, will be required if animals are to adapt to projected future climates and that these life-stage adaptations should precede other effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C4">Bradshaw &#x00026; Holzapel 2006</xref>).</p><p>Populations undergoing adaptation to new environmental conditions will incur demographic costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C6">Burger &#x00026; Lynch 1995</xref>). Recruitment declines that follow will usually, with other factors such as over-harvesting or habitat deterioration, elicit a directed management response. For example, in the case of salmonids, every year millions of hatchery fish are deliberately released into the wild from captive breeding programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C33">Myers 2004</xref>), either for the maintenance of fisheries and attempted enhancement of declining wild stocks, or also accidentally as a by-product of salmon farming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C43">Schiermeier 2003</xref>). It may be that some of these management actions do more harm than good.</p><p>It has previously been shown that the progeny of farm-bred salmon are less fit than wild fish under natural conditions and that fitness reduction and potential extinction for wild populations could result from interactions with escaped farm salmon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C30">McGinnity <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C1">Araki <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>), although the mechanisms causing the reductions of fitness observed were not identified. Here we report on a 37-year study of Atlantic salmon (<italic>Salmo salar</italic>) from the Burrishoole river system in the west of Ireland, which shows that a wild population, where fish from a captive-bred population represent a variable but often substantial proportion of the naturally spawning cohort, is less able to adapt to higher freshwater winter temperatures and is negatively and disproportionately impacted by climate change, to such an extent that under projected future climates its future existence is threatened.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><label>2.</label><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><label>(a)</label><title>Study site</title><p>The Burrishoole river system is situated in NW Ireland (53&#x000b0;59&#x02032; N, 09&#x000b0;37&#x02032; W) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20090799F1">figure&#x000a0;1</xref>).

At this latitude (53&#x000b0;59&#x02032; N), juveniles generally spend three winters in freshwater, including the winter when eggs are in the gravel, before migrating to sea as smolts in April and May (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C31">Metcalfe &#x00026; Thorpe 1990</xref>). A total trapping system for the counting of returning adults and migrating smolts has been operated at Burrishoole since 1969 at two locations above the tide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20090799F1">figure&#x000a0;1</xref>), allowing both the quantification of all fish entering and leaving the system and the estimation of egg numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20090799F2">figure&#x000a0;2</xref><italic>a</italic>). The number of adult wild salmon spawning in the system during the period of the study ranged from 203 to 1485 individuals.

The number of salmon bred in captivity spawning naturally in the system has varied between 8 and 608 fish. The captive breeding programme for salmon was established from wild fish collected from the catchment between 1960 and 1964. Additional wild fish were included in the breeding stock between 1970 and 1975. The breeding population has been effectively closed since that time with brood fish being selected from returning ranched fish.

We used a multiple linear regression approach to assess the influence of ranched eggs, water temperature and precipitation on egg-to-smolt survival, with egg-to-smolt survival as the dependent variable. Our initial exploration of the data indicated a significant negative relationship between egg-to-smolt survival and ranched egg proportion at the time of egg deposition. This factor was retained in subsequent models. Climatic variables were added in a forward running stepwise manner starting at the time of egg incubation (year 0) and continuing until the time of smolt migration to sea (June year 2). These were assessed as both monthly and seasonal values. The resulting model is referred to as model A. Two-way interactive terms were also assessed in the final model but none were significant.</p><p>In a further exploration of the data, we expressed the variable ranched eggs/all eggs as a dummy variable 1 or 0 for years with high and low proportions of ranched eggs (model B). A cut-off of 15 per cent gave two datasets with average proportion of 34 per cent (range 18&#x02013;60%; <italic>n</italic> = 15) and 6 per cent (range 1&#x02013;13%; <italic>n</italic> = 16) for high and low years, respectively, and was selected following visual inspection of the plot of ranched eggs/all eggs against egg-to-smolt survival. The dummy variable is referred to as HiLo and was retained in all further models. Climatic variables were then assessed in a stepwise manner as described above. This approach gave a model (model B) with results similar to those of model A, but explained a lower proportion of the variability. However, the final model included a significant interactive term between HiLo and water temperature at the time of egg incubation. The resulting model may be considered to represent two linear models for high and low ranched egg proportions, respectively (see below). Non-significant contributing terms are included in the model in accordance with the hierarchical principle. All datasets were assessed for normality using the Shapiro&#x02013;Wilks test. All had a normal distribution, with the exception of reared eggs/all eggs.

The model was run on a daily time step. Once validated, DYRESM was run using daily data for a control period and a future climate scenario period (2071&#x02013;2100), a standardized control time frame commonly used in climate change impact studies across Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C41">R&#x000e4;is&#x000e4;nen <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>).

The weather generator was first trained using local data for the period 1966&#x02013;1993. Multiple 30-year time series of daily data were output for a control period based on these observational data. The weather generator was then perturbed based on the output from two general circulation model (GCM) and regional climate model (RCM) combinations to produce multiple 30-year time series for future climate scenarios.

The GCMs were the ECHAM4/OPYC3 GCM (Max Plank Institute, Germany) and the HadAM3H GCM (Hadley Center, UK). The future climate scenario period was run with assumptions based on the A2 and B2 scenarios on future greenhouse emissions. The training set consisted of 28 years from weather stations at Burrishoole and Belmullet, County Mayo (40 km NNW of Burrishoole).

(2007</xref>) concluded that water temperature and photoperiod (and factors related to them) were likely to be the most important physical variables determining local selective pressures in Atlantic salmon populations. Our models show that higher water temperatures encountered in the first winter, when eggs are incubating in gravel beds, and in the second winter, when fish are 0+ juveniles (parr), have negative effects on survival. We believe that the negative response to warmer winter water temperatures found is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C15">Garcia de Le&#x000e1;niz <italic>et al</italic>. (2007</xref>) and can be explained most effectively within a bioenergetics framework similar to the model proposed for the little brown bat <italic>Myotis lucifugus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C23">Humphries <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>), with the timing of the physiological processes associated with energy acquisition synchronized by photoperiod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C4">Bradshaw &#x00026; Holzapel 2006</xref>). That winter temperatures rather than summer temperatures were found in this study to have the greatest effect on survival supports the idea proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C4">Bradshaw &#x00026; Holzapel (2006)</xref> that climate change, particularly at higher latitudes, will impose seasonal rather than thermal selection (summer thermal tolerance) on natural populations.</p><p>As has also been reported recently for the European great tit <italic>Parus major</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C35">Nussey <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>) warm winters can lead to earlier hatching but not necessarily advance the supply of food for the hatchlings. It is quite plausible that this is also the case for salmon eggs and salmon alevins, with earlier than normal hatching and emergence induced by increased winter water temperatures predisposing fry to the risk of starvation. It follows that higher mortality is likely to occur in warm winters because of a mismatch in developmental schedules between the hatching eggs and emerging salmon fry and their prey resulting in insufficient energy reserves for survival. The eggs of a &#x02018;locally adapted&#x02019; population of salmon might be expected to match the energy demands of a typical winter by either having eggs of sufficient size (see below), by a slowing of developmental rates, or by a phenological adjustment of spawning time.</p><p>The interaction term in model B suggests that increases in winter temperature are a much greater problem for the progeny of hatchery fish, particularly the eggs, than for the progeny of wild fish. We know from previous studies that Burrishoole ranched salmon produce significantly smaller eggs than Burrishoole wild salmon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C29">McGinnity <italic>et al</italic>. 1997</xref>), which would pre-dispose them to higher mortalities in the wild during winters with excessive energy demands as they would have less intrinsic food resources than larger eggs. While it has been demonstrated elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C20">Heath <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>) that there is usually no fitness penalty for producing small eggs in benign hatchery environments, less fit offspring would emerge from small eggs than large eggs in sub-optimal natural environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C8">Einum <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>). Other adaptive traits such as the timing of spawning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C21">Heggberget 1988</xref>) and genetically determined differences in predator avoidance in young fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C26">Johnsson <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>) are in addition likely to contribute to the large apparent differences in performance between the progeny of ranched parents compared with their wild conspecifics.</p><p>For older fish experiencing their first winter as parr, our models also suggest a strong negative effect of increasing winter water temperature on survival. By proposing a simple &#x02018;bio-energetics&#x02019; explanation for this outcome, we might reasonably assume that increases in metabolic rates as a consequence of higher winter temperatures cause the depletion of parr energy reserves faster than in cold years and decrease the likelihood of survival until food supplies become available in spring. Excessive depletion of energy reserves in winter has recently been shown to be a major cause of mortality in juvenile fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C9">Finstad <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>) and provides strong support for this idea.</p><p>However, in common with many animals, salmon parr undergo a winter dormancy or hibernation to overcome the demands of winter stress. There are two advantages to hibernating: conserving energy that would be used up in seeking food and maintaining station at high flows and secondly in reducing the risk of predation. It has been shown previously that salmon stop feeding in the autumn and find shelter within the stream bed even though food is plentiful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C32">Metcalfe &#x00026; Thorpe 1992</xref>), suggesting that this behaviour is adaptive. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C32">Metcalfe &#x00026; Thorpe (1992)</xref> have shown that the anorexia associated with the onset of winter is a genetically determined response to photoperiod. To survive, salmon parr need to predict accurately when food will be available some six months in advance. Photoperiod provides one of the most important cues for events that are distant in time or space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C5">Bradshaw &#x00026; Holzapfel 2008</xref>). In contrast, temperature, food and other ecological conditions become more important closer to the actual event itself and are associated with phenotypically plastic, non-genetic, phenological responses to the environment. Incorrect physiological or behavioural responses to photoperiod cues, such as suspending feeding prematurely, could explain the poorer survival in Burrishoole salmon associated with increased winter water temperature observed in this study. In contrast to the eggs, no HiLo interaction effect was found in overwintering parr. Either the warmer winter temperature affects both the parr progeny of wild and hatchery fish equally or more likely that the progeny of hatchery fish die at the egg stage disproportionately and are no longer present in the population in sufficient numbers to have an effect.</p><p>In the final winter before spring metamorphosis from parr to smolt, appetite and growth of salmon are maintained through the winter, and parr are therefore less dependent on stored energy reserves than in the first two winters. Consequently, it is not surprising that we found no relationship between water temperature in the third winter and survival. However, the positive effect on survival of warm spring temperatures may come about through improved foraging efficiency and enhancement of the smoltification process. Our model would suggest that there is little difference in the response of hatchery and wild presmolts, but the progeny of hatchery fish are less likely to have survived the rigours of their first two winters to have much impact on overall survival at the smolt stage, their number being greatly reduced at egg and fry stages.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><label>(b)</label><title>The possibility that adaptation to environmental change in the wild is constrained by gene flow from the hatchery</title><p>Our results clearly demonstrate that hatchery fish spawning in the wild can impact negatively on freshwater survival chances in natural populations. The study provides some clues as to one specific cause and effect. However, in addition to the winter temperature effects postulated, captively bred fish in other studies have shown increased metabolic rates and food conversion efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C46">Thodesen <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C18">Handeland <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>), higher growth rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C11">Fleming &#x00026; Einum 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C29">McGinnity <italic>et al</italic>. 1997</xref>), to be more aggressive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C7">Einum &#x00026; Fleming 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C11">Fleming &#x00026; Einum 1997</xref>) and less risk averse to predators compared with wild fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C7">Einum &#x00026; Fleming 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C11">Fleming &#x00026; Einum 1997</xref>). These are all characteristics that have proven to be maladaptive in the wild. Without tangible gene flow from the hatchery to the river, the differential response of the progeny of wild and hatchery fish to higher winter temperature could account for the variation in survival observed with respect to the proportion of hatchery fish in the spawning population. Yet this is of little consequence to the evolutionary trajectory of the wild population unless there is a direct genetic interaction by inter-breeding between wild and ranched adults either in the parental F1 or subsequent generations. A direct interaction would lead to a change in the genetic composition of the wild population by the addition or incorporation of a &#x02018;genetic load&#x02019; carried over from the hatchery into the wild that might subsequently affect its productivity. This &#x02018;load&#x02019; or degree of maladaptation to the existing natural environment occurs because hatchery populations (where food is available ad libitum) do not experience the continuous evolutionary adjustment possible in the wild, and therefore they do not have the benefit of a history of natural selection experienced by the wild population. Consequently, the mismatch between the hatchery fish and the natural environment will increase. In addition, domestication selection in the hatchery population, such as for reduced fear of predators, will exacerbate these differences over time. Illustrating this possibility empirically (McGinnity <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C29">1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C30">2003</xref>), it has been shown that hybrid progeny of local wild salmon and farm escape salmon parents have, when compared under natural conditions, intermediate fitness to their parents. This lower fitness in hybrids was found to be accompanied by a reduction in the productive potential of the hybridized population. It is known that ranched and wild salmon at Burrishoole interbreed in the wild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C48">Thompson <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>), gene flow primarily occurring by fertilization of eggs of ranched females by wild mature male parr. Although not usually to the same extent, it has also been shown in this and other studies that substantial levels of gene flow also occurs via captive bred males to wild females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C12">Fleming <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C50">Weir <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>). The extent of the gene flow between ranched males and wild females might be expected to be a function of the proportion of captive bred fish in the spawning population. We might conclude therefore that some of the HiLo effect on egg-to-smolt survival pertains to both the progeny of the hatchery fish and the F(n) hybrid progeny of wild and hatchery reared fish.</p><p>We interpret our results as being consistent with the predictions of general theoretical demographic-evolutionary models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C6">Burger &#x00026; Lynch 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C17">Gomulkiewicz &#x00026; Holt 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C28">Kirkpatrick &#x00026; Barton 1997</xref>). These models suggest that each time a population undergoes an evolutionary adjustment in response to variations in the environment through natural selection, a demographic penalty, such as a higher rate of mortality is incurred. In our study, the demographic penalty associated with increases in winter temperature or high summer precipitation is a reduction in egg-to-smolt survival. Though the relationship between natural selection and environmental change and the demographic response have been modelled extensively, there are very few empirical examples under natural conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C16">Grant &#x00026; Grant 2002</xref>). The end product of these adjustments should be a population that is better adapted to its local environment and consequently is increasing in size towards its carrying capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C28">Kirkpatrick &#x00026; Barton 1997</xref>). However, what is also suggested from our results is that the potential to adapt to environmental change can be thwarted by concurrent and recurrent genetic changes in the wild population following hybridization with captive bred animals, which are subject to domestication and possibly directional selection. Also they will not be not subject to natural selection in benign hatchery environments and as a consequence are less well adapted to life in the wild. This would counteract any positive adaptive response in the wild population to environmental change and increase the demographic costs imposed by natural selection.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><label>(c)</label><title>The risk of extinction and projected future climate scenarios</title><p>Projected impacts of climate change for Western Europe include an increase in air temperature in all seasons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20090799F5">figure&#x000a0;5</xref>) and changes in the seasonal distribution of rainfall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C41">R&#x000e4;is&#x000e4;nen <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>).

We used our model B to assess the egg-to-smolt survival prospects for the Burrishoole wild salmon population under two future climate scenarios, i.e. 60 years hence, with low and high proportions of Burrishoole ranched fish in the wild spawning cohort. The model outputs show no reduction in egg-to-smolt survival when the proportion of eggs from ranched fish is low under either of the future projected climate scenarios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20090799F4">figure&#x000a0;4</xref><italic>a</italic>). If anything they suggest an increase in survival compared to historical levels. In contrast, poor outcomes and considerably lower egg-to-smolt survivals, including some catastrophic results are predicted for the population when the proportion of eggs originating from ranched fish is high. In 11 of the 15 30-year model runs based on the E A2 scenario, zero egg-to-smolt survival was observed in at least one year.

The magnitude of the lag determines the vulnerability to extinction. Based on our analysis, large scale interbreeding with captive-bred fish has the potential to increase the size of this disparity and prevent the population from at least tracking changes in the environment. Even low levels of gene flow from a captive population to a wild population will shift the wild population's mean phenotype so that it approaches the hatchery optimum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C13">Ford 2002</xref>). The effects of this are particularly severe if high levels of hybridization and introgression are reoccurring on a continuous basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C22">Hindar <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>). Furthermore, as the population adapts to a novel environment, its density may fall below critically low levels for a period of time (the burden imposed by natural selection). During this time, it becomes highly vulnerable to extinction by non genetic stochastic demographic processes, in other words &#x02018;the population succumbs before it has a chance to evolve&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C17">Gomulkiewicz &#x00026; Holt 1995</xref>). Our results suggest that high levels of gene flow from the hatchery can impair the adaptive capacity of the Burrishoole wild salmon population enough to jeopardize its long-term viability. The evidence that this occurs by impacting directly on traits associated with the fish's ability to deal with increased winter temperatures at the egg stage of development is compelling, though this is not to say that other important traits are not similarly affected by gene flow from the hatchery.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><label>(d)</label><title>Management implications</title><p>The seemingly intuitive management response to declines in natural production for both salmon and other commercially exploited wild fish species has been to increase the production and release of ranched fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C33">Myers 2004</xref>) with the objective of enhancing or at least sustaining natural production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C3">Bell <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>). However, as we have shown here, such a practice is likely to exacerbate the impact of climate change on natural populations rather than ameliorate it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C1">Araki <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>). Furthermore, an estimated two million salmon escape from farms around the North Atlantic each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C43">Schiermeier 2003</xref>). It is surely a serious cause for concern that a large proportion of the marine production of farmed salmon occurs close to high-latitude Norwegian rivers. In these rivers, where salmon parr require four and even five winters to reach the smolt stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C31">Metcalfe &#x00026; Thorpe 1990</xref>), climate projections show winter temperatures increasing by the greatest magnitude (up to 6&#x000b0;C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20090799F5">figure&#x000a0;5</xref>). Our results imply that the impact of climate change combined with a high proportion of farm escapes that breed in the wild could have an even greater negative impact on the productivity of wild salmon populations at these high latitudes than predicted for western Ireland, particularly as each extra year spent in freshwater must increase the demographic cost of selection.</p><p>We conclude based on this study that ranched fish capable of breeding in the wild, even where strains have been established from local or progenitor stocks, should not be deliberately introduced into natural salmon rivers, and that measures must be found to reduce the numbers of escaped farm salmon in nature, if wild salmon populations are to successfully adapt to climate change. Our findings are likely to hold true for other poikilothermic animals where captive breeding programmes are used in population management. Recent reports suggest that captive breeding is being considered for some of the estimated 1900 species of amphibians that are known to be threatened with extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C14">Frankham 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C45">Stuart <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>). It is pertinent here that much of the extinction risk for amphibians is likely to be also climate mediated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20090799C40">Pounds <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>). Rather than imposing an additional genetic load on wild populations experiencing climate change by releasing captive bred animals, we propose that conservation efforts should focus on optimising conditions for adaptation to occur by reducing exploitation and protecting critical habitats.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the staff of the Marine Institute, Newport, who carry out on-going monitoring and research on the Burrishoole river for their advice and support; E.
