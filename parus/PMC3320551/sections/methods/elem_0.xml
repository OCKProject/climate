  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For purposes of training our model, we selected four reference taxa described in the literature as ring species: the salamander 
   <span class="italic">Ensatina eschscholtzii </span>[
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B19" href="#B19">19</a>]; the tree 
   <span class="italic">Acacia karroo </span>[
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B27" href="#B27">27</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B28" href="#B28">28</a>]; the bird 
   <span class="italic">Phylloscopus trochiloides </span>[
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B12" href="#B12">12</a>]; and the bird species complex 
   <span class="italic">Larus </span>(sp. 
   <span class="italic">argentatus </span>and 
   <span class="italic">fuscus</span>) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B2" href="#B2">2</a>]. Reference ring taxa are also reviewed by Irwin 
   <span class="italic">et al. </span>[
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B6" href="#B6">6</a>]. Importantly, due to recent advances in new taxonomic tools and criteria, these are not necessarily all recognized unambiguously as 'ring species', but do in all cases constitute taxa that are evolving under ring models of divergence - that is, 'ring taxa' that express continuous levels of differentiation with terminal forms above or below species level. Further, we restricted our analysis to these four taxa because they (i) represent true circular overlaps around distinct physical geographic barriers, 
   <span class="italic">sensu </span>Mayr [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B8" href="#B8">8</a>], as opposed to other ring systems produced by rare dispersal events; and (ii) have well described distributions with maps and extensive text-based descriptions that enabled us to extract the reference barriers from our model.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Topographic model</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rather than modeling ring distributions of species, our predictive model targets the geographic barriers that are topographically similar to barriers associated with taxa that are considered ring species. We focus on the geographic barrier because it is a core feature of all well-documented ring species, thus enabling us to make predictions about candidate rings across taxa and environments. Our model involves four steps (Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1</a>): (i) selecting the focal environmental gradient, (ii) deriving the rate of change in the gradient, (iii) extracting all barriers and calculating summary statistics for traits relevant to geographic species formation, and (iv) analyzing the traits in multivariate space. We describe these steps in detail below.
  </p>
  <sec class="sec">
   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Focal gradient</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Step 1 in Figure 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1A</a>. We selected elevation as our focal gradient because it is often correlated with other major environmental gradients that more proximately determine barriers to species distribution [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B29" href="#B29">29</a>], and high-quality elevation data are available from multiple sources for the entire globe. Combined, these features of elevation enabled to us build a topographic model that could be reliably generalized to all environments. The model may be parameterized using other environmental gradients to address more targeted questions in specific taxa or geographies. Elevation data were obtained from the National Geophysical Data Center, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's ETOPO1 One Arc-Minute Global Relief Model [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B30" href="#B30">30</a>]. We selected the bedrock layer in order to define elevations irrespective of spatiotemporally fluctuating ice sheets and glaciers.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Step 2 in Figure 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1B</a>. Our model was based on the rate of change in elevation (topographic slope) because this variable is associated with ecotones at landscape to biome scales [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B13" href="#B13">13</a>] in all terrestrial, aquatic and marine environments around the world. In turn, ecotones, and associated ecoregions, are strong predictors of species' distributions [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B14" href="#B14">14</a>]. We computed slope on the original ETOPO1 bedrock raster and then resampled it using bilinear interpolation to 10 arc minute. This decision was made to provide a spatial resolution that yielded a biologically reasonable minimum barrier size. Since the area of a 10 arc minute cell decreases with increasing latitude, minimum barrier size ranged from 344.2 km
    <span class="sup">2 </span>at the equator to 1.5 km
    <span class="sup">2 </span>at the poles (we accounted for this in our summary statistic calculations using spherical trigonometry, see below). But because the range sizes of taxa tend to decrease with increasing latitude [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B31" href="#B31">31</a>], we considered this to be a biologically reasonable minimum barrier size for low-dispersing or recently diverged taxa, irrespective of their latitude of origin. Furthermore, 10 arc minute resolution was determined through an initial sensitivity analysis to most accurately approximate the range of reference barriers.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Step 3 in Figure 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1C</a>. Empirical field-based studies have described ring species as taxa that diversify around a geographic barrier, which could be as small as the Central Valley of California or as large as Central Asia [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B6" href="#B6">6</a>]. However, because these studies did not require a definition of what is a barrier, the geographic barriers associated with classical ring systems could not be explicitly compared to one another, or to other barriers on the planet. We formally defined barriers in our model as geographically contiguous blocks of grid cells that, at the 10 arc minute resolution of our analysis, had the potential to physically separate two or more taxa. Throughout we refer to these geographically contiguous barriers as being 'cohesive' because they are comprised of cells that stick together. Although slope is a continuous variable, calculations of topographic traits required discrete barriers (that is, groups of cells that constituted a cohesive barrier). We first reclassified into separate sets of grids all grid cells that were either greater than or less than or equal to a certain slope threshold. The resulting sets of cells that met the conditional statement on each grid effectively defined our candidate binary barriers for that threshold. Slope thresholds were allowed to vary from 1 to 87 (maximum observed) degrees, in increments of 1 degree, in order to bracket the complete range of barriers that species could be responding to. The biological rationale for thresholding slope in this fashion relates to the two main conditions that enable ecotones [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B13" href="#B13">13</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B32" href="#B32">32</a>]: (i) steep physical environmental gradients that directly affect key ecological processes and the distribution of organisms, and (ii) gradual physical environmental gradients where threshold or nonlinear responses cause changes in ecosystem dynamics and the distributions of dominant species. Hence, the ecotones that define geographic barriers in our model may be important for taxa irrespective of whether the slope is steep or shallow. For each slope threshold, in determining how to group sets of cells into discrete barriers, we further defined barriers as geographically cohesive blocks of grid cells under one-cell rook chess moves in the four cardinal directions. Cell blocks were then indexed sequentially on a sphere in order to eliminate edge-effects at poles and the International Date Line.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Topographic summary statistics</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Table 
    <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">1</a>. We selected a total of six biologically informative summary statistics that collectively capture the size, position and permeability of candidate barriers: area, perimeter, maximum latitudinal range (controlling for longitude, max latitude minus min latitude), mean distance from equator (based on the absolute value of the centroid of each barrier), perimeter-to-area ratio, and fragmentation. All area and distance summary statistics were computed using spherical trigonometry [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B33" href="#B33">33</a>] to eliminate geographic bias in distortion introduced by imposing planar projections, and also to enable a comprehensible analysis of Polar Regions.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fragmentation was evaluated separately for all candidate barriers in two steps. First, beginning with the slope threshold yielding the largest and globally most inclusive candidate barriers (1 degree for grids greater than each slope threshold and 87 degrees for grids less than or equal to each slope threshold), we determined the number of sequential slope thresholds (
    <span class="italic">x</span>) that maintained the starting barrier unfractured in smaller form as spatially contiguous blocks of cells. We also used barriers identified in 
    <span class="italic">x </span>to derive mean estimates of the other five summary statistics that were computed using spherical trigonometry. Because mountains and valleys serve as barriers to species' distributions in similar ways, we did not distinguish between the two types of barrier inflection, and thus combined them for purposes of analysis. This process effectively reduced the number of redundant barriers (that is, barriers preserved across multiple slope thresholds) from 7,045,548 to 952,147. In other words, our inclusion of fragmentation allowed us to eliminate 6,093,401 spatially redundant or overlapping barriers that were originally extracted from applying the slope thresholds. Second, we calculated fragmentation as 1 - (
    <span class="italic">x</span>/
    <span class="italic">a</span>), where 
    <span class="italic">a </span>= the maximum number of slope thresholds possible, 87 for our analysis.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Step 4 in Figure 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1D</a>. We used the summary statistics to compare the candidate barriers in a principal component analysis (PCA). Log transformations were applied to area, distance, and shape summary statistics; an arcsin transformation was used on fragmentation. The multivariate PCA space (barrier-space) was used to identify candidate barriers that were topographically equivalent to those known to be associated with ring species (see below). We provide our complete model results (data deposited in the Dryad Repository: 
    <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.5856q415" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.5856q415</span>) so that future studies can evaluate new hypotheses of barriers that may be promoting ring divergence.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following development of the topographic model, we identified the barriers associated with our reference taxa ('reference barriers'), and also the other barriers from around the world that were topographically similar to the reference barriers ('candidate barriers').</p>

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reference barriers</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We identified reference barriers by visually inspecting which topographic barriers from the model were circumscribed by the distributions of reference taxa. Data on the distributions of reference taxa were obtained from a combination of georeferenced point localities and range maps and included the following sources: 
    <span class="italic">Ensatina </span>[
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B18" href="#B18">18</a>], 
    <span class="italic">Acacia </span>[

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B34" href="#B34">34</a>]. We then used principal components 1 and 2 (PC1, PC2) to extract the locations in multidimensional space of the reference barriers associated with our reference ring taxa. We determined that both 
    <span class="italic">Ensatina </span>and 
    <span class="italic">Acacia </span>encircled single barriers ('cohesive barriers'), while 
    <span class="italic">Larus </span>and 
    <span class="italic">Phylloscopus </span>each encircled clusters of two or three cohesive barriers in close geographic proximity (thus forming 'composite barriers'). For purposes of describing the geography of each cohesive and composite reference barrier, we identified the common names of the topographic features from multiple world and regional maps.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Candidate barriers</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because geographic species formation depends on the interaction between the 'scale' of the organism and the spatial scale of the barrier associated with it, both the population biology and history of reference and candidate taxa need to be considered when evaluating candidate barriers. Thus, we identified candidate barriers separately with respect to the reference taxa and associated barriers. Because reference barriers were discovered to be either cohesive or composite, we further identified candidate barriers according to two methods.</p>

    <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Candidate cohesive barriers (

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Candidate cohesive barriers are represented in the model by other individual barriers that are topographically similar to the reference barriers in multidimensional barrier space. For this method, we identified candidate cohesive barriers as the 100 nearest neighbors (Euclidean distance) to each reference barrier in the PCA. Yet, other criteria could alternatively be used to define similarity (for example, a Euclidean buffer around reference barriers). For each reference taxon and associated barrier, we mapped the candidates back into geographic space and summed across barriers to detect possible spatial overlap of topographically similar candidates that were not consolidated using our estimate of fragmentation.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Composite barriers are represented in the model by groups of other individual cohesive barriers. In addition to the summary statistics characteristic of all barriers, reference composite barriers are described by a particular combination of individual barriers with four criteria: (i) number of barriers, (ii) total area, (iii) geographic proximity to one another, and (iv) the same inflection. Individual barriers were first queried by identifying the 100 nearest neighbors (Euclidean distance) relative to each of the five reference barriers. Because these barriers clustered with respect to both reference bird taxa, we used a minimum convex polygon around the 500 total nearest neighbors to identify 1,380 candidate barriers. As performed for 
     <span class="italic">Ensatina </span>and 
     <span class="italic">Acacia</span>, we mapped the candidates back into geographic space and summed across barriers to detect spatial overlap of topographically similar candidates that were not consolidated using our estimate of fragmentation. We then queried for candidate composite barriers separately in 
     <span class="italic">Larus </span>and 
     <span class="italic">Phylloscopus </span>using the four criteria above, with similarity thresholds set to 5%. In the case of the Arctic Ocean, which was comprised of three individual reference barriers, we employed a two-barrier approximation because 90% of the total area was explained by two reference barriers (the Canada and Amundsen-Nansen Basins).
