 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of the 952,147 geographic barriers identified on the planet, only about 1% are topographically similar to barriers associated with known ring taxa, with most of the likely candidates occurring in under-studied parts of the world (for example, marine environments, tropical latitudes). Predicted barriers separate into two distinct categories: (i) single cohesive barriers (&lt; 50,000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>), associated with taxa that differentiate at smaller spatial scales (salamander: 
  <span class="italic">Ensatina eschscholtzii</span>; tree: 
  <span class="italic">Acacia karroo</span>); and (ii) composite barriers - formed by groups of barriers (each 184,000 to 1.7 million km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) in close geographic proximity (totaling 1.9 to 2.3 million km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) - associated with taxa that differentiate at larger spatial scales (birds: 
  <span class="italic">Phylloscopus trochiloide</span>s and 
  <span class="italic">Larus </span>(sp. 
  <span class="italic">argentatus </span>and 
  <span class="italic">fuscus</span>)). When evaluated globally, we find a large number of cohesive barriers that are topographically similar to those associated with known ring taxa. Yet, compared to cohesive barriers, an order of magnitude fewer composite barriers are similar to those that favor ring divergence in species with higher dispersal.
