   <span class="bold">B</span>: Candidate composite barriers evaluated for groups of individual barriers showing the same number of sub-units (that is, cohesive barriers), the same inflection, and that are similar in total size and inter-barrier proximity. Seven of the 14 candidate composite barriers are shown to illustrate exemplary barriers and simplify map interpretation; the other candidates are provided in our model database (see Methods).
