A</span>: Phylogenetic relationships suggest diversification along the Atlantic and Pacific slopes of the barrier (major clades) followed by limited gene flow across parapatric boundaries (different symbols within clades). Currently allopatric populations in the northwestern portion of the species' range share mitochondrial haplotypes (dashed arrows) suggesting ancestral gene flow. The most genetically divergent taxa occur at the southeastern end of the known range (adapted from [

The other two arrows represent current barriers to gene flow around the ring between the most phenotypically divergent taxa (dashed arrow), where mitochondrial data suggest ancestral gene flow, and the phylogenetically most divergent taxa (dotted arrow), where, based on current sampling, there is no such evidence and taxa seem to be separated by ecologically unsuitable habitat.
