  <span class="bold">Use of the topographic ring model to identify candidate taxa for ring diversification around a focal barrier near the Baja California Peninsula (USA and Mexico) that is topographically similar to the reference barrier for the Drakensberg Massif (South Africa), which has promoted ring diversification in a tree species, 
   <span class="italic">Acacia karroo</span>
  </span>. The focal barrier (left panel, map) is a low-lying topographic depression located at the land-sea interface in the northern Sea of Cortez. As a result of its particular topography, the barrier has promoted diversification in a number of terrestrial taxa, including 
  <span class="italic">Hypsiglena </span>nightsnakes and the rosy boa 
  <span class="italic">Lichanura trivirgata</span>. In 
  <span class="italic">L. trivirgata</span>, mitochondrial data have been collected to reconstruct its phylogeographic history. In agreement with our model prediction, these data suggest that the focal barrier has strongly influenced non-adaptive divergence among mostly contiguous subspecies of 
  <span class="italic">L. trivirgata</span>, showing evidence of continuous levels of genetic differentiation along either side of the barrier (right panel, phylogenetic network; thick branches are supported by &gt; 0.95 posterior probability). Closure of the ring distribution may occur in the northwest, between two deeply divergent lineages within the subspecies 
  <span class="italic">roseofusca </span>(symbolized by circles and hexagons).
