  <span class="bold">Barrier permeability as measured by fragmentation and shape</span>. Left: barrier permeability (fragmentation) vs. size (area). Right: barrier permeability (shape as measured by the perimeter-to-area ratio) vs. size (area). Vertical lines identify barriers that are 50,000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>. Gray points identify all barriers on the planet, as defined by the topographic model. Green points identify barriers where fragmentation &lt; 1. Numbers correspond to barriers associated with known ring taxa: (1) 
  <span class="italic">Ensatina</span>: Central Valley, California, USA; (2) 
  <span class="italic">Acacia</span>: Drakensberg Massif, South Africa; (3) 
  <span class="italic">Larus</span>: Makarov Basin, Arctic Ocean; (4) 
  <span class="italic">Phylloscopus</span>: Tibetan Plateau, Central Asia; (5) 
  <span class="italic">Phylloscopus</span>: Takla Maka and Gobi Deserts, Central Asia; (6) 
  <span class="italic">Larus</span>: Amundsen and Nansen Basins, Arctic Ocean; (7) 
  <span class="italic">Larus</span>: Canada Basin, Arctic Ocean. Smaller perimeter-to-area ratios describe barriers that are more circular and compact.
