 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Candidate cohesive barriers were identified based solely on their topographic similarity to the two cohesive reference barriers associated with ring diversification in lower dispersing taxa (
  <span class="italic">Ensatina</span>: Central Valley, California; 
  <span class="italic">Acacia</span>: Drakensberg Massif, South Africa). When mapped back into geographic space, these candidates are predicted throughout tropical to temperate latitudes (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">4</a>). This latitudinal bias is due to the influence of position (distance from equator; Table 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">1</a>) in the PCA (Additional file 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3" href="#S3">3</a>). The similarity level chosen (100 most similar barriers, Euclidean distance) retrieved spatially unique candidate cohesive barriers that were topographically equivalent to the reference barriers. Less stringent similarity levels (for example, 500 most similar barriers) would recover candidates at similar latitudes, but with a greater likelihood of spatial overlap. Because reference cohesive barriers are located in a portion of the PCA where barrier density is relatively high (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3B</a>), irrespective of one's choice of similarity threshold there are a relatively large number of individual barriers on the planet that are capable of promoting ring divergence. These candidate cohesive barriers should be evaluated in the context ring-distributed taxa with lower dispersal tendencies or, more generally, with population biologies or histories that are broadly similar to 
  <span class="italic">Acacia </span>or 
  <span class="italic">Ensatina</span>.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to cohesive barriers, candidate composite barriers were identified in two steps by choosing, (i) topographically similar individual barriers to those from reference composite barriers and (ii) combinations of individual barriers with emergent properties similar to reference composite barriers (number of barriers, total area, geographic proximity and inflection). Step 1 recovered 1,380 barriers that were topographically similar to the five barriers associated with reference bird taxa (red polygon in Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3B</a>). When mapped back into geographic space, these candidates are predicted throughout sub-tropical to polar latitudes, with different degrees of spatial overlap (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">5A</a>). The overlap is due to a combination of the relatively large number of candidate cohesive barriers considered, their large size (&gt; 184,000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>), and their sensitivity to fragmentation (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3B</a>). Despite the large number of candidate composite barriers formed by combinations of two to three individual barriers (respectively 951,510 and 875 million), only 14 meet the criteria of similarity to the reference composite barriers (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">5B</a>). The number of candidates did not increase significantly with less stringent similarity levels (for example, threshold of 10%). Hence, at the larger spatial scales characteristic of composite barriers and higher dispersing ring taxa, very few areas on the planet present the topographic conditions associated with ring diversification. Furthermore, because higher dispersing ring taxa can maintain panmixia over such large geographic areas, few will be expected to reach species-level divergence. For example, the existence of a prolonged pelagic life stage in some marine taxa can potentially increase the homogenizing role of gene flow, so that even after circumpolar divergence the terminal taxa do not develop reproductive barriers, and merge at the terminus of the ring distribution (for example, trumpetfishes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B15" href="#B15">15</a>]).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When considered in the context of composite barriers, our model corroborates Mayr's [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B8" href="#B8">8</a>] assertion that few areas of the world present the topographic conditions necessary for ring speciation. However, when considered in the context of cohesive barriers, our model also suggests that a surprisingly large number of candidate barriers exist and merit further study. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that - while most contemporary phylogeographic studies have explored well-developed parts of the globe, like Europe and North America, the barriers most likely to be associated with ring divergence are located in under-studied regions (for example, marine environments, tropical latitudes) where new species continue to be described, their geographic ranges are still being mapped and genetic data are rare. An alternative explanation is that some of those areas have been studied but ring diversification has brought taxa to a stage when they are not clearly recognized as 'ring species'. Instead, recently diverged taxa might express continuous variation at the population level, whereas segments of older taxa might have already 'decayed' into a ring of closely related species (see [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B16" href="#B16">16</a>]), thus making it unlikely that researchers would detect a near continuum of differentiation. Therefore, by providing spatially explicit phylogeographic hypotheses that can be tested with adequate genetic or phenotypic data, the topographic ring model is designed to advance field studies of species formation in ring-like patterns.
