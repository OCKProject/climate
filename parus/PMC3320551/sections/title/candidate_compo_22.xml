 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Composite barriers are represented in the model by groups of other individual cohesive barriers. In addition to the summary statistics characteristic of all barriers, reference composite barriers are described by a particular combination of individual barriers with four criteria: (i) number of barriers, (ii) total area, (iii) geographic proximity to one another, and (iv) the same inflection. Individual barriers were first queried by identifying the 100 nearest neighbors (Euclidean distance) relative to each of the five reference barriers. Because these barriers clustered with respect to both reference bird taxa, we used a minimum convex polygon around the 500 total nearest neighbors to identify 1,380 candidate barriers. As performed for 
  <span class="italic">Ensatina </span>and 
  <span class="italic">Acacia</span>, we mapped the candidates back into geographic space and summed across barriers to detect spatial overlap of topographically similar candidates that were not consolidated using our estimate of fragmentation. We then queried for candidate composite barriers separately in 
  <span class="italic">Larus </span>and 
  <span class="italic">Phylloscopus </span>using the four criteria above, with similarity thresholds set to 5%. In the case of the Arctic Ocean, which was comprised of three individual reference barriers, we employed a two-barrier approximation because 90% of the total area was explained by two reference barriers (the Canada and Amundsen-Nansen Basins).
