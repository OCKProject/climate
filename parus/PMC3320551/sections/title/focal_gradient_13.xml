  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1A</a>. We selected elevation as our focal gradient because it is often correlated with other major environmental gradients that more proximately determine barriers to species distribution [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B29" href="#B29">29</a>], and high-quality elevation data are available from multiple sources for the entire globe. Combined, these features of elevation enabled to us build a topographic model that could be reliably generalized to all environments. The model may be parameterized using other environmental gradients to address more targeted questions in specific taxa or geographies. Elevation data were obtained from the National Geophysical Data Center, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's ETOPO1 One Arc-Minute Global Relief Model [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B30" href="#B30">30</a>]. We selected the bedrock layer in order to define elevations irrespective of spatiotemporally fluctuating ice sheets and glaciers.
