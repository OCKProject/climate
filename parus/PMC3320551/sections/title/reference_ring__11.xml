 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For purposes of training our model, we selected four reference taxa described in the literature as ring species: the salamander 
  <span class="italic">Ensatina eschscholtzii </span>[
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B19" href="#B19">19</a>]; the tree 
  <span class="italic">Acacia karroo </span>[
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B27" href="#B27">27</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B28" href="#B28">28</a>]; the bird 
  <span class="italic">Phylloscopus trochiloides </span>[
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B12" href="#B12">12</a>]; and the bird species complex 
  <span class="italic">Larus </span>(sp. 
  <span class="italic">argentatus </span>and 
  <span class="italic">fuscus</span>) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B2" href="#B2">2</a>]. Reference ring taxa are also reviewed by Irwin 
  <span class="italic">et al. </span>[
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B6" href="#B6">6</a>]. Importantly, due to recent advances in new taxonomic tools and criteria, these are not necessarily all recognized unambiguously as 'ring species', but do in all cases constitute taxa that are evolving under ring models of divergence - that is, 'ring taxa' that express continuous levels of differentiation with terminal forms above or below species level. Further, we restricted our analysis to these four taxa because they (i) represent true circular overlaps around distinct physical geographic barriers, 
  <span class="italic">sensu </span>Mayr [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B8" href="#B8">8</a>], as opposed to other ring systems produced by rare dispersal events; and (ii) have well described distributions with maps and extensive text-based descriptions that enabled us to extract the reference barriers from our model.
