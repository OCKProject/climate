 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We identified reference barriers by visually inspecting which topographic barriers from the model were circumscribed by the distributions of reference taxa. Data on the distributions of reference taxa were obtained from a combination of georeferenced point localities and range maps and included the following sources: 
  <span class="italic">Ensatina </span>[
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B18" href="#B18">18</a>], 
  <span class="italic">Acacia </span>[
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B27" href="#B27">27</a>], 
  <span class="italic">Phylloscopous </span>[
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B34" href="#B34">34</a>], and 
  <span class="italic">Larus </span>[
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B34" href="#B34">34</a>]. We then used principal components 1 and 2 (PC1, PC2) to extract the locations in multidimensional space of the reference barriers associated with our reference ring taxa. We determined that both 
  <span class="italic">Ensatina </span>and 
  <span class="italic">Acacia </span>encircled single barriers ('cohesive barriers'), while 
  <span class="italic">Larus </span>and 
  <span class="italic">Phylloscopus </span>each encircled clusters of two or three cohesive barriers in close geographic proximity (thus forming 'composite barriers'). For purposes of describing the geography of each cohesive and composite reference barrier, we identified the common names of the topographic features from multiple world and regional maps.
