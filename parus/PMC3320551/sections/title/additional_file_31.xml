  <span class="bold">Use of the topographic ring model to identify candidate taxa for ring diversification around a focal barrier in Costa Rica and Panama that is topographically similar to the reference barrier for the Central Valley (California, USA), which has promoted ring diversification in a salamander, 
   <span class="italic">Ensatina eschscholtzii</span>
  </span>. 
  <span class="bold">A</span>: The focal barrier is a long-standing geographic feature known as the Cordillera de Talamanca. 
  <span class="bold">B</span>: As a result of its particular topography, the mountainous barrier is surrounded at lower elevations by higher temperatures. 
  <span class="bold">C</span>: In part due to these temperature gradients, the predicted barrier is considered a distinct ecoregion (Talamancan Montane Forests) that is surrounded by other distinct ecoregions, which form a ring distribution. 
  <span class="bold">D</span>: These climatic and ecoregional conditions have shaped the distribution of many species, including the red-eyed tree frog, 
  <span class="italic">Agalychnis callidryas</span>.
