 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For both cohesive and composite barriers, our topographic model produces spatially explicit predictions of diversification across taxa and environments. Depending on one's chosen taxonomic criteria, whether these candidate barriers affect taxa that presently constitute valid ring species or, more generally, ring distributed taxa in which terminal forms are above or below species-level divergence, is a question that can now be addressed. Yet, the candidate barriers predicted by our model are hypothesized to result in taxa expressing continuous degrees of adaptive and non-adaptive divergence, thus allowing these processes to be investigated directly in the field. Variation in biology and history will determine the level of divergence reached by taxa that are evolving under a ring diversification process, that is, whether taxa are currently recognized as a ring of populations, a ring species or a ring of species.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Establishing whether taxa comprise a valid ring species ultimately requires extensive population-level sampling around the ring distribution to test for increasing levels of divergence between contiguous populations (for example, [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B12" href="#B12">12</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B17" href="#B17">17</a>]), and restricted genetic interaction in secondary contacts across the ring when compared to contacts around the ring [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B18" href="#B18">18</a>]. However, there are three lines of evidence with respect to the candidate barrier that may be considered prior to investing in such detailed population-level sampling: barrier topographic traits, associated environmental gradients and species' distributions. We illustrate these in combination for a barrier in Costa Rica and Panama that, while being a mountain barrier, is topographically similar in size, shape and permeability to the Central Valley of California, which has promoted ring diversification in the salamander 
  <span class="italic">Ensatina eschscholtzii </span>[
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B11" href="#B11">11</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B19" href="#B19">19</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Costa Rica and Panama, the candidate barrier is a mountain range (Cordillera de Talamanca) that separates the Pacific and Caribbean regions of the isthmus (Additional file 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5" href="#S5">5</a>). As a result of its particular topography, the Cordillera de Talamanca is surrounded by warmer habitats that are recognized as Isthmanian Pacific and Atlantic moist forest ecoregions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B14" href="#B14">14</a>]. These climatic conditions, plus the barrier, have shaped the distributions of many low elevation vertebrate and invertebrate species throughout the isthmus, and conditioned the diversification of lineages, which are currently recognized at various taxonomic ranks (see [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B20" href="#B20">20</a>]) and often present evidence of morphologic and genetic intergradation (for example, 
  <span class="italic">Heliconius </span>butterflies [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B21" href="#B21">21</a>]). This diversification process is clearly illustrated by the red-eyed tree frog, 
  <span class="italic">Agalychnis callidryas</span>, which forms a nearly complete ring distribution around the barrier (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">6</a>). Extensive phenotypic (morphology, color pattern) and genotypic (mitochondrial and nuclear DNA) data have been collected to evaluate diversification patterns and their consequences for genetic interactions around the focal barrier [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B22" href="#B22">22</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B23" href="#B23">23</a>]. In agreement with our topographic model prediction, neutral genetic data suggest that taxa have expanded around the central mountain, gradually diverging along the Pacific and Caribbean slopes (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">6A</a>, [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B22" href="#B22">22</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B23" href="#B23">23</a>]). Morphologic (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">6B</a>) and genetic (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">6C</a>) intergradation occurs between populations along either side of the mountain, suggesting ongoing gene flow around most of the ring distribution. Two notable exceptions occur between (i) the phenotypically most divergent populations in the northwestern portion of the range, where mitochondrial data suggest ancestral gene flow (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">6A</a>, dashed arrow) but nuclear markers do not indicate ongoing connectivity (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">6C</a>), and (ii) the phylogenetically most divergent populations in the southeastern portion of the range (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">6C</a>, dotted arrow), where based on current sampling there is no such evidence of ancestral or ongoing gene flow. In order to corroborate the ring species hypothesis, evidence of ring closure with terminal reproductive isolation is needed, as demonstrated in other reference taxa (for example, [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B18" href="#B18">18</a>]). Nevertheless, even without such evidence, published data demonstrate that the candidate barrier has strongly influenced adaptive and non-adaptive divergence among currently contiguous populations of 
  <span class="italic">A. callidryas</span>, in the direction predicted for ring species.
