  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using a standardized set of criteria to formally define a barrier, our topographic model identified a total of 952,147 geographically cohesive barriers on the planet. Many of these barriers aligned with ecoregions (Additional file 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">1</a>), suggesting that barriers predicted by our model do indeed delineate areas that represent valid biogeographic barriers. Furthermore, when overlaying the distributions of reference ring taxa, we find that they encircle topographic barriers identified by our model (Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">2</a>). However, contrary to expectations based on both classical [

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B8" href="#B8">8</a>] and recent [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B6" href="#B6">6</a>] reviews of ring species, at the spatial scale of our analysis not all ring taxa encircle single topographic barriers. While 
   <span class="italic">Ensatina </span>and 
   <span class="italic">Acacia </span>encircle single barriers ('cohesive barriers'; Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">2A, C</a>), the bird taxa 
   <span class="italic">Larus </span>and 
   <span class="italic">Phylloscopus </span>encircle two or more barriers that are in close geographic proximity ('composite barriers'; Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">2B, D</a>). The seven barriers associated with our focal ring taxa align with major topographic features that define important climatic and ecological transitions (numbers correspond to barriers labeled in the PCA, below) are: (1) 
   <span class="italic">Ensatina</span>: Central Valley, California, USA; (2) 
   <span class="italic">Acacia</span>: Drakensberg Massif, South Africa; (3)

   <span class="italic">Larus</span>: Canada Basin, Arctic Ocean. The close spatial proximity of the individual barriers associated with the bird taxa (3 to 7) relate to larger topographic features generally known as Central Asia (barriers 4 and 5) and the Arctic Ocean (barriers 3, 6 and 7). In addition to 
   <span class="italic">Larus </span>and 
   <span class="italic">Phylloscopus</span>, these composite barriers have also contributed to ring divergence in three other birds (Additional file

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our finding that composite barriers exist and can promote ring diversification even in taxa that disperse widely is not simply an artifact of the model or the spatial resolution of the data. At different spatial resolutions of topographic slope (30 arc sec to 3 arc degrees) the model still predicted Central Asia and the Arctic Ocean as composite barriers. Furthermore, composite barriers encompass such large geographic areas (millions of km
   <span class="sup">2 </span>and hundreds of different ecoregions) that it is difficult to imagine any univariate or multivariate environmental approximation of a single barrier (for example, Central Asia, which is comprised of the Takla Maka-Gobi deserts and the Tibetan Plateau - large geographic regions that differ dramatically in terms of climate and vegetation). If ring taxa that disperse widely are in fact distributed around composite barriers, then an important implication for ring speciation is that individual barriers in close spatial proximity can interact with one another to form effective barriers to species distribution that are orders of magnitude larger than any single cohesive barrier. More empirical work is required to determine the spatial characteristics of inter-barrier gaps that prevent ring taxa from maintaining genetic connectivity across composite barriers.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considering all geographic barriers identified globally by our model, most share topographic features that cause them to cluster in two high density peaks of the PCA (Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3A</a>). Meanwhile, the seven reference barriers cluster in a very discrete, low density area of the PCA (Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3B</a>). Despite known species idiosyncrasies, our model is evidently tracking barrier traits that exert effects (Table 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">1</a>) across taxa, since barriers involved in ring diversification in salamander and tree taxa are near one another in multivariate space (points 1 and 2, Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3A</a>), and all individual barriers that comprise composite bird barriers also cluster (points 3 to 7, Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3A</a>). This result indicates that barriers associated with ring taxa share similar topographic features, and that these topographic features are relatively rare on the planet. While our small sample size prevents any formal statistical comparison, the topographic features of the barriers associated with the reference taxa are also distributed along an axis of dispersal behavior (Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3B</a>). As expected, our model shows that ring taxa with higher dispersal (points 3 to 7, Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3B</a>) require larger barriers than lower dispersers (points 1 and 2, Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3B</a>). A better understanding of how characteristics of the barriers scale with the biology of the organism will benefit from the discovery of new ring taxa, which can fill in the biological continuum that is encompassed by the current reference ring taxa, and also expand model predictions.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Compared to the most common barriers on the planet, reference barriers are larger in size (area, perimeter, latitudinal range) and less permeable (shape). These results support initial predictions for four of our six summary statistics (Table 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">1</a>). Notable exceptions include the two summary statistics on PC2: (i) position (distance from equator), where the small number of known ring species prevented us from evaluating whether larger barriers would be required at higher latitudes, and (ii) fragmentation, where we expected more fragmented barriers to allow trans-barrier gene flow and thus prevent ring diversification. In actuality, our measure of fragmentation is reflecting the real topographic complexity of barriers. While small to medium sized barriers (&lt; 50,000 km
   <span class="sup">2</span>) can have lower values for fragmentation (green points in Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3B</a>), larger barriers are more likely to encompass fragmenting features like valleys and ridges, so that fragmentation is maximum for all barriers above 50,000 km
   <span class="sup">2 </span>(Additional file 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4" href="#S4">4</a>). For the same reason, our model recognizes larger topographic features such as the Arctic Ocean and Central Asia as clusters of individual barriers that are so large that they can no longer remain cohesive. In contrast, permeability of the barrier as measured by shape (perimeter-to-area ratio), which loaded heavily on PC1, fully matched our initial predictions, suggesting that this summary statistic might better reflect trans-barrier dispersal, or that its effect is biologically more meaningful than a finer fragmentation of the barrier. Although shape as computed by a perimeter-to-area ratio scales with size, the reference barriers were some of the most geometrically compact barriers within their respective size classes (low perimeter-to-area ratios in Additional file 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4" href="#S4">4</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A minimum bounding box around the seven reference barriers (Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3B</a>) encompassed approximately 1% of all candidate barriers on the planet. This statistic taken at face value suggests that geographic barriers with similar topographic characteristics to those that promote ring divergence are exceedingly rare. However, a statistic of 1% also results in about 10,000 individual cohesive barriers that are similar in terms of size, position and permeability to known ring barriers. In agreement with Mayr's [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B8" href="#B8">8</a>] assertion, those topographic conditions are indeed rare when compared to all candidate barriers on the planet, but numerous when considered relative to the handful of ring species that are well-described by science [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B2" href="#B2">2</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B6" href="#B6">6</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B8" href="#B8">8</a>]. This further raises the possibility that a relatively large number of under-studied barriers on the planet may be associated with taxa that are evolving under ring processes of divergence.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Candidate cohesive barriers were identified based solely on their topographic similarity to the two cohesive reference barriers associated with ring diversification in lower dispersing taxa (
   <span class="italic">Ensatina</span>: Central Valley, California; 
   <span class="italic">Acacia</span>: Drakensberg Massif, South Africa). When mapped back into geographic space, these candidates are predicted throughout tropical to temperate latitudes (Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">4</a>). This latitudinal bias is due to the influence of position (distance from equator; Table 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">1</a>) in the PCA (Additional file 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3" href="#S3">3</a>). The similarity level chosen (100 most similar barriers, Euclidean distance) retrieved spatially unique candidate cohesive barriers that were topographically equivalent to the reference barriers. Less stringent similarity levels (for example, 500 most similar barriers) would recover candidates at similar latitudes, but with a greater likelihood of spatial overlap. Because reference cohesive barriers are located in a portion of the PCA where barrier density is relatively high (Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3B</a>), irrespective of one's choice of similarity threshold there are a relatively large number of individual barriers on the planet that are capable of promoting ring divergence. These candidate cohesive barriers should be evaluated in the context ring-distributed taxa with lower dispersal tendencies or, more generally, with population biologies or histories that are broadly similar to 
   <span class="italic">Acacia </span>or 
   <span class="italic">Ensatina</span>.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to cohesive barriers, candidate composite barriers were identified in two steps by choosing, (i) topographically similar individual barriers to those from reference composite barriers and (ii) combinations of individual barriers with emergent properties similar to reference composite barriers (number of barriers, total area, geographic proximity and inflection). Step 1 recovered 1,380 barriers that were topographically similar to the five barriers associated with reference bird taxa (red polygon in Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3B</a>). When mapped back into geographic space, these candidates are predicted throughout sub-tropical to polar latitudes, with different degrees of spatial overlap (Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">5A</a>). The overlap is due to a combination of the relatively large number of candidate cohesive barriers considered, their large size (&gt; 184,000 km
   <span class="sup">2</span>), and their sensitivity to fragmentation (Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3B</a>). Despite the large number of candidate composite barriers formed by combinations of two to three individual barriers (respectively 951,510 and 875 million), only 14 meet the criteria of similarity to the reference composite barriers (Figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">5B</a>). The number of candidates did not increase significantly with less stringent similarity levels (for example, threshold of 10%). Hence, at the larger spatial scales characteristic of composite barriers and higher dispersing ring taxa, very few areas on the planet present the topographic conditions associated with ring diversification. Furthermore, because higher dispersing ring taxa can maintain panmixia over such large geographic areas, few will be expected to reach species-level divergence. For example, the existence of a prolonged pelagic life stage in some marine taxa can potentially increase the homogenizing role of gene flow, so that even after circumpolar divergence the terminal taxa do not develop reproductive barriers, and merge at the terminus of the ring distribution (for example, trumpetfishes [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B15" href="#B15">15</a>]).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When considered in the context of composite barriers, our model corroborates Mayr's [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B8" href="#B8">8</a>] assertion that few areas of the world present the topographic conditions necessary for ring speciation. However, when considered in the context of cohesive barriers, our model also suggests that a surprisingly large number of candidate barriers exist and merit further study. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that - while most contemporary phylogeographic studies have explored well-developed parts of the globe, like Europe and North America, the barriers most likely to be associated with ring divergence are located in under-studied regions (for example, marine environments, tropical latitudes) where new species continue to be described, their geographic ranges are still being mapped and genetic data are rare. An alternative explanation is that some of those areas have been studied but ring diversification has brought taxa to a stage when they are not clearly recognized as 'ring species'. Instead, recently diverged taxa might express continuous variation at the population level, whereas segments of older taxa might have already 'decayed' into a ring of closely related species (see [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B16" href="#B16">16</a>]), thus making it unlikely that researchers would detect a near continuum of differentiation. Therefore, by providing spatially explicit phylogeographic hypotheses that can be tested with adequate genetic or phenotypic data, the topographic ring model is designed to advance field studies of species formation in ring-like patterns.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For both cohesive and composite barriers, our topographic model produces spatially explicit predictions of diversification across taxa and environments. Depending on one's chosen taxonomic criteria, whether these candidate barriers affect taxa that presently constitute valid ring species or, more generally, ring distributed taxa in which terminal forms are above or below species-level divergence, is a question that can now be addressed. Yet, the candidate barriers predicted by our model are hypothesized to result in taxa expressing continuous degrees of adaptive and non-adaptive divergence, thus allowing these processes to be investigated directly in the field. Variation in biology and history will determine the level of divergence reached by taxa that are evolving under a ring diversification process, that is, whether taxa are currently recognized as a ring of populations, a ring species or a ring of species.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Establishing whether taxa comprise a valid ring species ultimately requires extensive population-level sampling around the ring distribution to test for increasing levels of divergence between contiguous populations (for example, [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B12" href="#B12">12</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B17" href="#B17">17</a>]), and restricted genetic interaction in secondary contacts across the ring when compared to contacts around the ring [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B18" href="#B18">18</a>]. However, there are three lines of evidence with respect to the candidate barrier that may be considered prior to investing in such detailed population-level sampling: barrier topographic traits, associated environmental gradients and species' distributions. We illustrate these in combination for a barrier in Costa Rica and Panama that, while being a mountain barrier, is topographically similar in size, shape and permeability to the Central Valley of California, which has promoted ring diversification in the salamander 
   <span class="italic">Ensatina eschscholtzii </span>[

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Costa Rica and Panama, the candidate barrier is a mountain range (Cordillera de Talamanca) that separates the Pacific and Caribbean regions of the isthmus (Additional file 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5" href="#S5">5</a>). As a result of its particular topography, the Cordillera de Talamanca is surrounded by warmer habitats that are recognized as Isthmanian Pacific and Atlantic moist forest ecoregions [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B14" href="#B14">14</a>]. These climatic conditions, plus the barrier, have shaped the distributions of many low elevation vertebrate and invertebrate species throughout the isthmus, and conditioned the diversification of lineages, which are currently recognized at various taxonomic ranks (see [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B20" href="#B20">20</a>]) and often present evidence of morphologic and genetic intergradation (for example, 
   <span class="italic">Heliconius </span>butterflies [

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B23" href="#B23">23</a>]. In agreement with our topographic model prediction, neutral genetic data suggest that taxa have expanded around the central mountain, gradually diverging along the Pacific and Caribbean slopes (Figure

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B22" href="#B22">22</a>,

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">6C</a>) intergradation occurs between populations along either side of the mountain, suggesting ongoing gene flow around most of the ring distribution. Two notable exceptions occur between (i) the phenotypically most divergent populations in the northwestern portion of the range, where mitochondrial data suggest ancestral gene flow (Figure

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additional barriers predicted by the topographic ring model are similarly surrounded by taxa showing continuous levels of divergence and exhibiting ill-defined taxonomic boundaries towards the terminus of a ring distribution - taxonomic irresolution characteristic of ring species (Figure

   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8" href="#S8">8</a> and 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9" href="#S9">9</a>). In all of these taxa, the absence of clear and concordant genetic and morphologic discontinuities around their distribution has promoted ongoing discussions among taxonomists (for example, [

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B26" href="#B26">26</a>]), and such taxonomic irresolution is indeed expected when continuous stages of species formation are directly observed in nature.
