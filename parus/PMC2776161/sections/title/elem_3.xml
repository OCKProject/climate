  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our data come from birds captured in mist netting as part of an ongoing monitoring effort on the Mettnau peninsula (47.729°N, 8.998°E), Lake Constance, near Radolfzell in south-western Germany. The study area covers about 1 km
   <span class="sup">2</span> and includes various habitats, but predominantly shrubland, wet meadows and reed beds. Since 1972 the mist-netting protocol has remained essentially unchanged, using 52 mist nets (6 m) in a single transect that are set following standardized methods from 30 June to 6 November (Berthold and Schlenker 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">1975</a>; Berthold et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">1991</a>). The only years in which mist netting was not conducted were 1987 and 1999. All mist-netted birds are identified to species, ringed, aged, the time of capture recorded, primary and body molt categorized, and standard measurements taken. Body masses of all birds were determined with an electronic scale with a precision of 0.1 g. The length of the third outermost primary feather (hereafter “feather length”) was measured following Berthold and Friedrich (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">1979</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous work has shown that body mass and morphological characters related to flight may vary with age (e.g. Alatalo et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">1984</a>; Norman 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">1997</a>; Pérez-Tris and Tellerría 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">2001</a>). Therefore, we considered only fully grown first-year birds in our analyses, because it is usually not possible to determine the exact age of older individuals. We did not separate the sexes for the analyses because sex could not be determined for juveniles of many species. Only the data from the first capture were used. We assume that among-year variation in sex ratios is negligible. We selected all species for which more than 1,000 first-year individuals were captured, and plotted cumulative percentages of mist-netted individuals on each day of the mist-netting season. Then we defined all birds as regionally (south-west Germany and adjacent areas) born that were mist netted either before the day when a distinct increase in capture numbers occurred, or before the day after which a second increase in numbers occurred for species for which regionally born birds show an influx at the very beginning of the mist-netting season. We interpreted these increases as influxes of non-regional birds, e.g. migrants from north-eastern Europe. Finally, we excluded all species for which an insufficient number of birds was mist netted (below ten first-year regionally born individuals in many years). For some species, not all morphological data were collected in every year.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We analysed data from the following 12 species (the date before which birds were classified as being local is give in parentheses): dunnock

With respect to migration distance, garden warblers, reed warblers and willow warblers are long-distance migrants wintering in sub-Saharan Africa. Dunnocks, robins, song thrushes, chiffchaffs and reed buntings are short-distance or partial migrants that winter not further than the Mediterranean region or only some individuals of the population migrate. Blackbirds, great tits and blue tits are mainly resident in the region although some individuals may also migrate short distances.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temperature data</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our temperature data are based on standardised daily measurements taken at Konstanz (47,667°N, 9,183°E) by the Deutscher Wetterdienst, approximately 18 km from the study site (
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dwd.de/de/FundE/Klima/KLIS/daten/online/nat/index_standardformat.htm" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.dwd.de/de/FundE/Klima/KLIS/daten/online/nat/index_standardformat.htm</span>) between 1973 and 2006. Annual mean temperatures were calculated from the daily mean temperatures in each year. Mean breeding season temperatures were calculated from daily mean temperatures in April, May and June, the main breeding period for the species concerned.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mean annual temperatures increased significantly between 1972 and 2006 by 0.05°C per year (linear regression on annual means: 
   <span class="italic">t</span> = 5.426, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001, adjusted 
   <span class="italic">R</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.456). However, annual mean temperatures have not changed linearly. Within the overall increase in average temperatures, we observed distinct multi-year decreases in temperatures in the late 1970s, the early 1990s, and again in the most recent years (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). These non-linear patterns were verified when year-to-year variation in mean temperature was modelled as a spline in a generalized additive model (GAM). We fit this, and all other GAMs described in this paper using the mgcv library (Wood 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" href="#CR86">2006</a>) in the program R (R Development Core Team

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used two representations of annual mean temperatures in our analyses of associations between temperature and body size. First, we directly used annual mean breeding season temperatures in statistical analyses of association between temperature and morphology. Juvenile birds which grow under “good” conditions can grow larger (Alatalo and Lundberg 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1984</a>; Ardia 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">2005</a>). Thus, we expect that a correlation of size with breeding season temperature will represent phenotypic plasticity of body size, with body size influenced by the environmental conditions experienced by individual birds. However, body size also has an inherited component (e.g. Boag and Grant 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">1978</a>; Merilä and Gustafsson 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">1996</a>) and therefore selection on multiple generations of birds over periods of consistently changing climate could result in temperature-related changes in body size being most apparent when examining temperatures averaged across multiple years (Hallett et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2004</a>). To examine this possibility, we also created our second temperature measure, a smoothed version of the mean annual temperature data, using a moving-averages smoother. This smoother, the T4253 smoother, starts with a running median of four sequential values, which is centered by a running median of two temperatures. Then the values are re-smoothed by applying a running median of 5 and a running median of 3. Residuals are computed by subtracting the smoothed series from the original series. The process is then repeated on the computed residuals. The final smoothed residuals are computed by subtracting the smoothed values obtained in the first iteration (Norušis 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">2005</a>). A correlation of this smoothed temperature trend with the body size of juveniles could be indicative of a genetic influence on body size, because the smoothed temperatures describe typical conditions experienced by multiple generations and not necessarily the conditions directly experienced by the birds being measured.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While temperature-based selection may be more apparent in winter than in the breeding season, we did not relate birds’ sizes to the mean temperatures in January, the coldest month in the study area because mean annual and mean breeding season temperatures are relevant to all species that we considered, including migrants.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analyses of morphological data</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The longest time series of morphological data that we have are for body mass (measured since 1972) and feather length (measured since 1974). In only four of the 12 species were annual average mass and feather length significantly correlated (bivariate Pearson’s correlation: garden warbler, 
   <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.423, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.018; willow warbler, 
   <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.529, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.002; chiffchaff, 
   <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.356, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.050; great tit, 
   <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.688, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.003). Therefore, we used both as parallel indicators of size, recognizing that mass is not necessarily an adequate surrogate for size (Piersma and Davidson 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">1991</a>), and that even combining information from multiple morphological traits into a single “size” index will be inadequate to describe the potentially complex changes in morphology that could take place through time. While ornithologists are not in agreement on what single measure, if any, best reflects body size (e.g. Gosler et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">1998</a>; Rising and Somers 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">1989</a>; Freeman and Jackson

   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001 for all species) or body mass are considered.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We only analysed data from regional pre-migratory birds (see above) for two reasons. First, migratory birds can double their body mass due to pre-migratory fuel deposition (Bairlein 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2002</a>) and can change their body composition when preparing for migration (e.g. Piersma and Gill 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">1998</a>; Bauchinger and Biebach 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">2005</a>). In examining only pre-migratory birds, variation in body mass due to different fuel loads and body composition was assumed to be negligible. Pre-migratory status is confirmed by the fact that on a nine-unit scale for estimating subcutaneous fat stores (Kaiser 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">1993</a>) more than 95% of the birds whose data were used in our analyses showed low scores between 0 and 3 (unpublished data, regularly available from 1993 onwards; see also Kaiser 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">1992</a>). Second, wing morphology may differ in birds from different populations due to different migratory distances travelled (Leisler and Winkler 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">2003</a>; Fiedler 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">2005</a>). Therefore, the inclusion of migrating birds from north-eastern populations (the assumed origin of non-regional migrants) could bias the results.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Body mass</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analyses needed to account for the possibility that several nuisance factors would obscure inter-annual variation in body mass. Mass of passerines can vary with the time of the day (Lehikoinen 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">1987</a>; Gosler 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">1994</a>; Macleod et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">2005</a>), ambient temperature (Lehikoinen 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">1987</a>; Macleod et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">2005</a>), season (Lehikoinen 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">1987</a>; Gosler 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">1994</a>; Macleod et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">2005</a>) and moult (Ellegren and Fransson 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">1992</a>; Kaiser 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">1992</a>; Gosler 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">1994</a>). Our first analyses were designed to describe changes in expected mass through the years for each species, after accounting for these other sources of variation. We fit data on masses of individual birds using a GAM in which year was a smoothing parameter. The nuisance parameters time when a bird was mist netted (time; hours after the beginning of civil twilight), temperature (mean daily temperature of the day when a bird was mist netted), day (day of the respective mist-netting season when a bird was mist netted) and moult (birds were assigned to be either in moult when more than 20 feathers on the breast, belly or back were growing and/or when they were in primary moult) were entered as fixed effects. All variables except year and moult were treated as continuous covariates; year and moult were fixed, categorical factors. We assume that systematic annual changes in mean body mass are not confounded by daily variation in temperature during the mist-netting season, because daily body mass changes in response to fluctuations in daily temperature during the netting season are the result of birds adjusting food intake to short-term requirements (Gosler 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">2002</a>; Macleod et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">2005</a>). Effectively, we are assuming that daily fluctuations in mass with changes in temperature represent a consistent source of noise around a latent typical mass across all years. We believe that this assumption is reasonable because daily temperatures during the mist-netting season and annual mean temperatures were not highly correlated (
    <span class="italic">R</span>
    <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.010 between all daily temperatures during the ringing season and their associated annual mean temperatures).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, we examined the extent to which inter-annual changes in mass were associated with changes in average ambient temperatures. In this second set of analyses we replaced the year effect with ambient temperature, conducting two separate linear regression analyses for each species: one with smoothed mean annual temperatures and the second with mean breeding season temperatures as independent variables additional to nuisance factors. We determined which of the representations of temperature was a better predictor of changes in body mass by assessing support for the two models using Akaike's information criterion (AIC) values.</p>

  <sec id="Sec7" class="sec">
   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Feather length</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Feather length was measured by many different people and previous studies have documented consistent inter-ringer variation in wing-related measurements (Gosler et al. 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">1995</a>, 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">1998</a>). Unfortunately the identities of people taking measurements were only recorded in our database for the years 1996–2006. If we were to use data from all available years, including those for which we did not know ringers’ identities, we needed to understand the effect of not accounting for observer biases. Therefore, we investigated whether the observer biases were minimal using feather length as the independent variable in a linear mixed model (calculated with SPSS) with year (1996–2006) as a fixed factor and ringer as a random factor. The magnitude of a ringer effect was calculated as the proportion of the residual variance (variance unexplained by fixed effects) that was accounted for by inter-ringer differences. Many ringers were present at the study site over multiple years and there are usually a number of shared years for many ringers. However, we restricted this analyses to main effects only, as preliminary analyses revealed that there were no significant interactions between the variables “year” and “ringer”.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Variance in measurements of feather length due to the ringer effect was in general very low and varied between 0% (garden warbler) and 29% (song thrush) of the total random + error variance in the data (Table 
    <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Additionally the ringer effect was only significant for the blackcap, the chiffchaff and the reed bunting (Wald tests, 
    <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05). However, in these three species the ringer effect was less than 8% of the total random + error variance and the estimated marginal mean of the feather length without the ringer effect always differed by less than 0.3 mm from the mean of the original measurements and was in 20 out of 30 cases (years) below 0.1 mm (unpublished data). Therefore, we assume that inter-ringer variation would have minor impact on annual mean feather length values. Because no relevant ringer effect was found in the period between 1996 and 2006 we assumed that any such effect would also be negligible in the earlier years of the study.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As with our analyses of variation in mass, we used GAMs to describe patterns of year-to-year variation in feather length, using feather length as the independent variable and year as a smoothing parameter. After this, we tested which of our two measures of annual temperature, the breeding-season temperatures or the smoothed annual mean temperatures, best accounted for the observed inter-annual variation in feather length.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A criterion for statistical significance of 
    <span class="italic">P</span> ≤ 0.05 was used for all analyses. For the comparison of models using AIC, a value &lt;2 for ∆AIC was assumed to indicate no difference between models, a value between 2 and 5 was an indication that the models may differ and a value of &gt;5 was an indication that the model with the smaller index certainly explains the data better compared to the model with the higher index (Burnham and Anderson 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2002</a>; Johnson and Omland 2004). Years were treated as independent data points as there was no autocorrelation of the data for temperatures (mean annual temperature, Durbin Watson test,
