 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Changes in mass were significantly associated with at least one temperature variable in six out of seven species that displayed significant inter-annual variation in average mass (Table 
  <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4;</a> Appendix 1). For three out of these six species, mean breeding season temperature as well as smoothed annual temperatures were significantly correlated with body mass (reed warbler, chiffchaff, blue tit; Appendix 1), with higher temperatures associated with lower average mass. For these three species with significant associations for both temperature variables, the regression with smoothed mean annual temperature had ΔAIC values &lt;6 below the model including mean breeding season temperature (Table 
  <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a>), indicating a higher influence of the long-term variable on body mass compared to the short-term variation in temperature described in the raw annual mean breeding season temperatures. For two of the remaining three species, blackbirds and willow warblers, the average body mass was significantly lower when smoothed annual temperatures were higher. However, the body mass of the final species, the blackcap, was significantly higher in years with higher breeding season temperature.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Feather length was significantly associated with at least one temperature variable in seven out of nine species that displayed significant inter-annual variation, although these relationships never explained more than 1% of all variance in feather length (Table 
  <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4;</a> Appendix 2). Effects of both mean breeding season temperatures and smoothed mean annual temperatures were significant for six species (Appendix 2). In species for which both temperature variables explained statistically significant amounts of variation in feather length, smoothed annual temperatures better explained (lower AIC values, ΔAIC &gt; 5) inter-annual variation in feather length in the blackbird and the chiffchaff, but variation in breeding season temperatures was better supported for the blackcap and the reed warbler. In the willow warbler and the blue tit the values for both models were effectively identical. Additionally, mean feather length of robins varied significantly with smoothed annual mean temperatures but not with breeding season temperatures. For five species with significant relationships (blackcap, reed warbler, willow warbler, chiffchaff and blue tit), average feather length declined with higher temperatures. However, with robins and blackbirds, individuals increased feather length with increasing temperatures during the study period.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In both the analyses for mass as well as for feather length we may not have had the statistical power to detect all biologically real effects of temperature on morphology. The possibility of low statistical power is suggested because statistical power decreases with lower sample sizes, and we found that sample sizes were larger for species for which statistical significance was found (

  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.02 for feather length; both from one-tailed Mann–Whitney
