 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The longest time series of morphological data that we have are for body mass (measured since 1972) and feather length (measured since 1974). In only four of the 12 species were annual average mass and feather length significantly correlated (bivariate Pearson’s correlation: garden warbler, 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.423, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.018; willow warbler, 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.529, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.002; chiffchaff, 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.356, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.050; great tit, 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.688, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.003). Therefore, we used both as parallel indicators of size, recognizing that mass is not necessarily an adequate surrogate for size (Piersma and Davidson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">1991</a>), and that even combining information from multiple morphological traits into a single “size” index will be inadequate to describe the potentially complex changes in morphology that could take place through time. While ornithologists are not in agreement on what single measure, if any, best reflects body size (e.g. Gosler et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">1998</a>; Rising and Somers 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">1989</a>; Freeman and Jackson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">1990</a>), often either wing length (highly correlated with feather length, Berthold and Friedrich

  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001 for all species) or body mass are considered.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We only analysed data from regional pre-migratory birds (see above) for two reasons. First, migratory birds can double their body mass due to pre-migratory fuel deposition (Bairlein 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2002</a>) and can change their body composition when preparing for migration (e.g. Piersma and Gill 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">1998</a>; Bauchinger and Biebach 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">2005</a>). In examining only pre-migratory birds, variation in body mass due to different fuel loads and body composition was assumed to be negligible. Pre-migratory status is confirmed by the fact that on a nine-unit scale for estimating subcutaneous fat stores (Kaiser 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">1993</a>) more than 95% of the birds whose data were used in our analyses showed low scores between 0 and 3 (unpublished data, regularly available from 1993 onwards; see also Kaiser 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">1992</a>). Second, wing morphology may differ in birds from different populations due to different migratory distances travelled (Leisler and Winkler 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">2003</a>; Fiedler 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">2005</a>). Therefore, the inclusion of migrating birds from north-eastern populations (the assumed origin of non-regional migrants) could bias the results.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Body mass</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analyses needed to account for the possibility that several nuisance factors would obscure inter-annual variation in body mass. Mass of passerines can vary with the time of the day (Lehikoinen 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">1987</a>; Gosler 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">1994</a>; Macleod et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">2005</a>), ambient temperature (Lehikoinen 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">1987</a>; Macleod et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">2005</a>), season (Lehikoinen 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">1987</a>; Gosler 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">1994</a>; Macleod et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">2005</a>) and moult (Ellegren and Fransson 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">1992</a>; Kaiser 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">1992</a>; Gosler 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">1994</a>). Our first analyses were designed to describe changes in expected mass through the years for each species, after accounting for these other sources of variation. We fit data on masses of individual birds using a GAM in which year was a smoothing parameter. The nuisance parameters time when a bird was mist netted (time; hours after the beginning of civil twilight), temperature (mean daily temperature of the day when a bird was mist netted), day (day of the respective mist-netting season when a bird was mist netted) and moult (birds were assigned to be either in moult when more than 20 feathers on the breast, belly or back were growing and/or when they were in primary moult) were entered as fixed effects. All variables except year and moult were treated as continuous covariates; year and moult were fixed, categorical factors. We assume that systematic annual changes in mean body mass are not confounded by daily variation in temperature during the mist-netting season, because daily body mass changes in response to fluctuations in daily temperature during the netting season are the result of birds adjusting food intake to short-term requirements (Gosler 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">2002</a>; Macleod et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">2005</a>). Effectively, we are assuming that daily fluctuations in mass with changes in temperature represent a consistent source of noise around a latent typical mass across all years. We believe that this assumption is reasonable because daily temperatures during the mist-netting season and annual mean temperatures were not highly correlated (
   <span class="italic">R</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.010 between all daily temperatures during the ringing season and their associated annual mean temperatures).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, we examined the extent to which inter-annual changes in mass were associated with changes in average ambient temperatures. In this second set of analyses we replaced the year effect with ambient temperature, conducting two separate linear regression analyses for each species: one with smoothed mean annual temperatures and the second with mean breeding season temperatures as independent variables additional to nuisance factors. We determined which of the representations of temperature was a better predictor of changes in body mass by assessing support for the two models using Akaike's information criterion (AIC) values.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Feather length</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Feather length was measured by many different people and previous studies have documented consistent inter-ringer variation in wing-related measurements (Gosler et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">1995</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">1998</a>). Unfortunately the identities of people taking measurements were only recorded in our database for the years 1996–2006. If we were to use data from all available years, including those for which we did not know ringers’ identities, we needed to understand the effect of not accounting for observer biases. Therefore, we investigated whether the observer biases were minimal using feather length as the independent variable in a linear mixed model (calculated with SPSS) with year (1996–2006) as a fixed factor and ringer as a random factor. The magnitude of a ringer effect was calculated as the proportion of the residual variance (variance unexplained by fixed effects) that was accounted for by inter-ringer differences. Many ringers were present at the study site over multiple years and there are usually a number of shared years for many ringers. However, we restricted this analyses to main effects only, as preliminary analyses revealed that there were no significant interactions between the variables “year” and “ringer”.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Variance in measurements of feather length due to the ringer effect was in general very low and varied between 0% (garden warbler) and 29% (song thrush) of the total random + error variance in the data (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Additionally the ringer effect was only significant for the blackcap, the chiffchaff and the reed bunting (Wald tests, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05). However, in these three species the ringer effect was less than 8% of the total random + error variance and the estimated marginal mean of the feather length without the ringer effect always differed by less than 0.3 mm from the mean of the original measurements and was in 20 out of 30 cases (years) below 0.1 mm (unpublished data). Therefore, we assume that inter-ringer variation would have minor impact on annual mean feather length values. Because no relevant ringer effect was found in the period between 1996 and 2006 we assumed that any such effect would also be negligible in the earlier years of the study.
