 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our temperature data are based on standardised daily measurements taken at Konstanz (47,667°N, 9,183°E) by the Deutscher Wetterdienst, approximately 18 km from the study site (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dwd.de/de/FundE/Klima/KLIS/daten/online/nat/index_standardformat.htm" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.dwd.de/de/FundE/Klima/KLIS/daten/online/nat/index_standardformat.htm</span>) between 1973 and 2006. Annual mean temperatures were calculated from the daily mean temperatures in each year. Mean breeding season temperatures were calculated from daily mean temperatures in April, May and June, the main breeding period for the species concerned.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mean annual temperatures increased significantly between 1972 and 2006 by 0.05°C per year (linear regression on annual means: 
  <span class="italic">t</span> = 5.426, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001, adjusted 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.456). However, annual mean temperatures have not changed linearly. Within the overall increase in average temperatures, we observed distinct multi-year decreases in temperatures in the late 1970s, the early 1990s, and again in the most recent years (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). These non-linear patterns were verified when year-to-year variation in mean temperature was modelled as a spline in a generalized additive model (GAM). We fit this, and all other GAMs described in this paper using the mgcv library (Wood 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" href="#CR86">2006</a>) in the program R (R Development Core Team 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">2007</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used two representations of annual mean temperatures in our analyses of associations between temperature and body size. First, we directly used annual mean breeding season temperatures in statistical analyses of association between temperature and morphology. Juvenile birds which grow under “good” conditions can grow larger (Alatalo and Lundberg 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1984</a>; Ardia 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">2005</a>). Thus, we expect that a correlation of size with breeding season temperature will represent phenotypic plasticity of body size, with body size influenced by the environmental conditions experienced by individual birds. However, body size also has an inherited component (e.g. Boag and Grant 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">1978</a>; Merilä and Gustafsson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">1996</a>) and therefore selection on multiple generations of birds over periods of consistently changing climate could result in temperature-related changes in body size being most apparent when examining temperatures averaged across multiple years (Hallett et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2004</a>). To examine this possibility, we also created our second temperature measure, a smoothed version of the mean annual temperature data, using a moving-averages smoother. This smoother, the T4253 smoother, starts with a running median of four sequential values, which is centered by a running median of two temperatures. Then the values are re-smoothed by applying a running median of 5 and a running median of 3. Residuals are computed by subtracting the smoothed series from the original series. The process is then repeated on the computed residuals. The final smoothed residuals are computed by subtracting the smoothed values obtained in the first iteration (Norušis 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">2005</a>). A correlation of this smoothed temperature trend with the body size of juveniles could be indicative of a genetic influence on body size, because the smoothed temperatures describe typical conditions experienced by multiple generations and not necessarily the conditions directly experienced by the birds being measured.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While temperature-based selection may be more apparent in winter than in the breeding season, we did not relate birds’ sizes to the mean temperatures in January, the coldest month in the study area because mean annual and mean breeding season temperatures are relevant to all species that we considered, including migrants.</p>
