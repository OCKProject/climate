 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Diverse ecological changes have occurred in response to rising global temperatures (Hughes 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2000</a>; Houghton et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">2001</a>) over the last century. Changes in communities include shifts in tree lines (Payette 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">2007</a>), altered species composition in the North Sea (Hiddink and ter Hofstede 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2008</a>) and changes in species assemblages due to range shifts of mobile species, such as butterflies (Parmesan et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">1999</a>) and birds (Thomas and Lennon 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" href="#CR79">1999</a>). Even species remaining in the same area can be affected by climate change, for example, through altered timing of life history events as has been observed in diverse taxa such as Eurasian taiga trees (Delbart et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2008</a>), Mediterranean butterflies (Peñuelas et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">2002</a>), and birds, for which both earlier breeding (Dunn 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2004</a>) and changes in migration timing have been seen (e.g. Fiedler 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">2003</a>; Tøttrup et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">2006</a>). In some cases, we know that changing phenology can affect other species, as seen in the growing mismatch between times of caterpillar emergence and breeding of pied flycatchers (
  <span class="italic">Ficedula hypoleuca</span>) and great tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) in the Netherlands (Both et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">2004</a>; Visser et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" href="#CR83">2004</a>). Overall, documented responses to climate change are abundant, as seen in multiple review papers on this subject (e.g. Hughes 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2000</a>; Walther et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" href="#CR84">2002</a>; Parmesan and Yohe 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">2003</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Effects of climate change on morphology are relatively undocumented, and apparently rarely studied ; for example, Root et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">2003</a>) only list nine such studies of the 143 reviewed. Nevertheless, changes in morphology, as with changes in phenology, are expected responses to altered climates. The expectation that climate will affect morphology is based largely on observed variations in morphology across longer time intervals and through space (e.g. Barnosky et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">2003</a>; Millien et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">2006</a>). For example, patterns of changing size of homeothermic animals are expected to follow Bergmann’s rule (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">1847</a>, p. 638: within a genus the smaller species should live in a warmer and the larger species in a colder climate), with selection to adjust heat dissipation altering body surface:volume ratios. While strictly Bergmann’s rule refers to variation in sizes of species within genera, Rensch (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">1938</a>) reformulated Bergmann’s rule to populations within a species. Hereafter we will use “Bergmann’s rule” to refer to this within-species variation. While questions have been raised about whether body sizes of homeotherms will respond to changing temperatures (for contradictory evidence in North American mammals see McNab 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">1971</a>; Ashton et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">2000</a>), considerable evidence exists of differences in body size through space along gradients of temperature: in a recent meta-analysis Meiri and Dayan (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">2003</a>) found that 72% of all bird species (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 94) and 65% of all mammal species (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 149) examined showed a pattern following the predictions of Bergmann’s rule. Changes in body size have been described within populations of some bird species in recent decades (e.g. Ludwichowski 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">1997</a>; Tornberg et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" href="#CR80">1999</a>; Jakober and Stauber 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">2000</a>). Bergmann’s rule has been invoked to explain correlations between changes in climate and size in some of these cases (Yom-Tov 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" href="#CR87">2001</a>; Yom-Tov et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" href="#CR89">2006</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, a clear causal link between changing temperatures and changes in body size cannot be presumed without eliminating other causes of systematic variation in body size; direct selection based on the thermal environment [Bergmann’s (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">1847</a>) rule] also needs to be distinguished from less direct effects of climate on morphology when such patterns are found. Changes in environments, co-occurring with but independent of climate change, can alter aspects of animals’ sizes; examples include changes in diet (Tornberg et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" href="#CR80">1999</a>), habitat quality (Richner et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" href="#CR70">1989</a>; Ohlsson and Smith 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">2001</a>; Searcy et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">2004</a>; Garant et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">2005</a>) and predation risk (Gosler et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">1995</a>; Naef-Daenzer et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">2001</a>). Studies are needed that can disentangle effects of climate change from the effects of other systematic changes in environments in recent decades. Previous studies linking changes in temperature and birds’ morphology (Yom-Tov 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" href="#CR87">2001</a>; Yom-Tov et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" href="#CR89">2006</a>) implicitly assumed simple (linear or quadratic) changes in both temperatures and response, thus weakening the strengths of conclusions that could be drawn. One potentially viable approach to providing strong inferences that morphology varies with changing temperatures is to focus on irregularities in the rate of recent temperature increases, looking for these same inter-annual irregularities to appear in variation in body sizes.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Also interesting would be the identification of the cause of any variation in size. Gienapp et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2008</a>) have speculated that most if not all morphological responses to climate change will be the result of phenotypic plasticity and not changes in genetic composition of populations. If this is true then we would expect inter-annual variation in body size of fully grown juveniles to be linked with variation in average temperatures experienced by these birds as they grew, but not with variation of temperatures over a longer time period that would select for changes in phenotype due to both genetic components of size and phenotypic plasticity.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we test the hypothesis that body size of birds decreases in times of global warming, the pattern predicted by Bergmann’s rule, by examining inter-annual variation in body sizes of fully grown juvenile birds. We further test whether body size is more highly correlated with temperatures during the breeding season in which the birds were raised or with a long-term average temperature. We make use of the fact that temperatures have not increased consistently over the last 35 years in south-western Germany to provide the data to strongly infer effects of climate on morphology. We examined data from 12 species of passerines to look at the generalities of the patterns that we find. Changes in both mass and length of flight feathers are examined in our analyses. Our results indicate that the average sizes of juveniles of some species do vary among years in association with changing temperatures, but that this pattern was not statistically detected in the majority of the species examined.</p>
