 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study describes clear differences among three subspecies of 
  <span class="italic">G. gallotia</span> lizards in the overall composition of their femoral gland secretions. Cholesterol and vitamin E were the two main compounds and their abundance also differed among subspecies. Interestingly, we also observed seasonal effects in the composition of secretions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Few studies have examined and reported interpopulational differences in lizard chemical signals. For example, 
  <a rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-18">Escobar et al. (2003)</a> found differences in precloacal secretions between two populations of 
  <span class="italic">Liolaemus fabiani</span> lizards. These authors hypothesized that the variation could be ascribed to the different environmental conditions found in the two populations. Two recent works analyzing femoral gland secretions in insular lizards also showed interpopulational variability. In these studies, the hypothesis that climatic conditions might be shaping the composition of femoral gland secretions was also suggested (
  <a rid="ref-65" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-65">Runemark, Gabirot &amp; Svensson, 2011</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-51" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-51">Martín et al., 2013</a>). Climatic conditions could be an important factor modulating the composition of chemical signals, as it has been suggested not only for lizards (
  <a rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-48">Martín &amp; López, 2013</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-30">Heathcote et al., 2014</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-53">Martín et al., 2017</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-8">Baeckens et al., 2017</a>), but also for other animals (
  <a rid="ref-69" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-69">Sentis et al., 2015</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-12">Boullis et al., 2016</a>). The fact that 
  <span class="italic">G. g. gallotia</span> inhabits dry habitats and secretes the highest level of cholesterol, whereas 
  <span class="italic">G. g. eisentrauti</span> and 
  <span class="italic">G. g. palmae</span> inhabit areas with higher humidity and their secretions bear the highest abundance of vitamin E, is in line with the hypothesis that cholesterol and vitamin E might protect the chemical secretions in dry and wet conditions, respectively (
  <a rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-18">Escobar et al., 2003</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-74" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-74">Weldon, Flachsbarth &amp; Schulz, 2008</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-49">Martín &amp; López, 2014</a>). However, other alternative selective factors influencing signal evolution have been posited, such as differences in predation pressure (e.g., 
  <a rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-33">Hughes, Kelley &amp; Banks, 2012</a>), trophic resources (e.g., 
  <a rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-32">Henneken et al., 2017</a>), intrasexual selection (e.g., 
  <a rid="ref-60" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-60">Ord, Blumstein &amp; Evans, 2001</a>), alternative “sexual strategies” (e.g., 
  <a rid="ref-62" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-62">Pellitteri-Rosa et al., 2014</a>), population density (e.g., 
  <a rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-22">Fowler-Finn, Cruz &amp; Rodríguez, 2017</a>), use of alternative signaling modalities (
  <a rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-35">Johnstone, 1996</a>), the degree of interspecific competition (
  <a rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-44">Losos, 2009</a>), or habitat use (e.g., 
  <a rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-3">Alberts, 1992</a>). We cannot therefore ensure that, in our study, the chemical profile variation among populations is totally driven by climatic variables. The use of a single population for each climatic region hampers an accurate correlation between chemical profiles and climate.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An intriguing and neglected area in the field of lizard chemical communication is to find out whether chemical signaling changes throughout the year, mainly because most of examined species inhabit temperate regions where lizards only produce chemical signals during the mating season. 
  <a rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-4">Alberts et al. (1992)</a> offered the first evidence in this respect, showing that the femoral secretions of 
  <span class="italic">Iguana iguana</span> have more lipids during the reproductive season and thus chemical signals changed between seasons. Several years later, 
  <a rid="ref-52" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-52"> Martins et al. (2006)</a> showed that the amount of secretion produced by follicular glands decreased during the non-reproductive period in comparison with the reproductive one. In that study, however, the information regarding chemical composition was lacking. Our results show that the composition of femoral secretions of 
  <span class="italic">G. g. eisentrauti</span> and 
  <span class="italic">G. g. galloti</span> differed considerably among seasons. Nevertheless, the analyses of the two most abundant compounds (cholesterol and vitamin E) showed seasonal variation in 
  <span class="italic">G. g. eisentrauti</span>, but not in 
  <span class="italic">G. g. galloti</span>. The effect of seasonality in the production and expression of these compounds might be variable. For instance, some compounds must be acquired through the diet (
  <a rid="ref-74" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-74">Weldon, Flachsbarth &amp; Schulz, 2008</a>) and therefore, changes in dietary availability could produce a higher or lesser degree of their expression in femoral gland secretions (
  <a rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-28">García-Roa et al., 2017c</a>). Recent research hypothesize that several compounds may be also under a trade-off between being used in metabolism functions or in chemical signaling (
  <a rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-42">Kopena et al., 2011</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-41">Kopena, López &amp; Martín, 2014b</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-40">Kopena, López &amp; Martín, 2014a</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-50">Martín &amp; López, 2015</a>). If dietary availability and metabolic requirements of these compounds differ between seasons, this might also affect to the secreted lipophilic fraction. This could happen with vitamin E which is used in metabolic processes. In addition, health state (e.g., parasites, immune condition) or the endocrine profile (e.g., testosterone or corticosterone levels) may be also determinant variables affecting chemical signals in different seasons (
  <a rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-50">Martín &amp; López, 2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Summary, we showed quantitative and qualitative interpopulational and seasonal differences in the femoral gland secretions of the insular lizard 
  <span class="italic">G. galloti</span>. Although we could not tease apart the specific factors underlying this variation, our study provides an encouraging scenario to explore whether climate plays a key role shaping the chemical signals of 
  <span class="italic">G. gallotia</span> subspecies. Future research should replicate the effects of climatic conditions on a widespread species over different climatic regions. Finally, given that 
  <span class="italic">Gallotia</span> lizards may use other sensory channels to transfer information (e.g., visual or acoustic), integrative analyses that consider other modes of communication would provide a global view of how these lizards communicate in a multimodal context.
