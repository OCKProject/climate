 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conducted our study in two islands (Tenerife and La Palma) of the Canary Archipelago, Spain (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" href="#fig-1">Fig. 1</a>). Because 
  <span class="italic">G. galloti</span> lizards are active during the whole year, we focused on two different periods, spring (reproductive season; R) and winter (non-reproductive season; NR) (
  <a rid="ref-68" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-68">Salvador, 2015</a>). In Tenerife, we visited two populations of 
  <span class="italic">G. galloti</span>, in March (R) and December (NR) 2013. The 
  <span class="italic">G. g. eisentrauti</span> population was located at El Pris in the North of the island (28°30′46″N, 16°25′4″W) and the 
  <span class="italic">G. g. galloti</span> population was in Malpaís de Güímar, in the Southeast of the island (28°18′3″N, 16°23′49″W). The two sampled populations do not overlap in their distribution. Further, we studied a population of 
  <span class="italic">G. g. palmae</span> close to El Pedregal at La Palma Island (28°37′13″N, 17°54′24″W) in April 2014 (R). Due to logistic reasons we could not sample this population in the non-reproductive season.
