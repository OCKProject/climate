 <div class="title">List of compounds identified in male femoral secretions of the lizard 
  <span class="italic">Gallotia galloti.</span>
 </div>
 <p>Three subspecies were sampled: 
  <span class="italic">G.g. eisentrauti, G.g. galloti and G.g. palmae</span> in the reproductive (R: april) and non-reproductive (NR: december) seasons. The relative proportion of each component was determined as the percent of the total ion current (TIC proportion) and reported as the mean (Â±1SD). Characteristic ions (m/z) are reported for unidentified compounds. RT: Retention time.
