 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess potential differences in the chemical profile among subspecies, we used the software PRIMER v6.1.13 with the PERMANOVA+ v1.0.3 add-on package. We calculated the euclidean distances between every pair of individual samples to produce a resemblance matrix and then used a single factor permutational multivariate analysis of variance test (PERMANOVA) (
  <a rid="ref-57" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-57">McArdle &amp; Anderson, 2001</a>) based on the Euclidean resemblance matrix using 999 permutations. All identified compounds were included in the analysis. Possible differences were also analyzed with a canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP) (

  <span class="italic">G. g. eisentrauti</span> and 
  <span class="italic">G. g. galloti</span> populations. For this, we used a two-way PERMANOVA test and GLM analyses taking into account the effects of population, season and their interaction (
  <a rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-5">Anderson &amp; Willis, 2003</a>). We confirmed both normality of data (Shapiro-Wilk’s test) and homogeneity of variances (Levene’s test) in all cases. Pairwise comparisons were performed with Tukey’s tests. All the statistical analyses were performed with R 3.2.2, SPSS 20.0.0 and STATISTICA v8.0 Software.
