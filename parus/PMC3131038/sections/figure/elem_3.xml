  <p>The occurrence of characteristic birds, carabid beetles and fungi as well as the structure of the carbon content in tons per ha in a forest stand, litter and mineral soil up to 10 cm in depth in a: 
   <span class="bold">a</span> 10 year old pine stand with a MIB value of about 50 mg, created after the clear-cut of a timber pine stand (more than 100 years old) 
   <span class="bold">b</span> ca. 60 year old pine stand with a MIB value about 250 mg. 
   <span class="bold">c</span> ca. 80 year old beech stand created from the undergrowth after the clear-cut of a pine stand with a MIB value of about 350 mg. In all graphs the annual accumulation of carbon in that stand, the value of such accumulation and the value of the entire carbon content (forest stand + litter + mineral soil) are expressed in carbon dioxide at the prices of the European Emission Trade System on 15.08.2008 (all graphs from Szyszko 2007).
