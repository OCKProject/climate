  <div class="title">Environmental dependent response to selection.</div>
  <p>The environmental covariance between strength of selection (measured as the selection gradient) and expression of additive genetic variance as a function of the environment leads to a strong relationship between the predicted response to selection (measured using a modified version of Lande's equation, see
