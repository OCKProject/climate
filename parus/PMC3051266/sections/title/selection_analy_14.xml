 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test for a relationship between spring temperature and the strength of selection on laying date, we took two approaches. First, we used a generalized linear mixed effects model (GLMM) with a Poisson error link fitted in ASREML-R 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-vanBalen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-vanBalen1">[38]</a> to model the relationship between number of recruits a female produced for the given year (as the measure of fitness) and her laying date that year, and to test its dependence on spring temperature (as measured by the interaction term between laying date and spring temperature). Individual identity and year were included as random effects to account for repeated measures on the same individuals and on years. Second, we estimated the annual strength of selection using the number of recruits produced per year divided by the mean number of recruits produced in the given year as a measure of relative fitness (ω) for each individual. Selection was then measured as the selection gradients (β) defined as the covariance between relative fitness and observed laying date divided by the variance in observed laying date, i.e. β  =  cov(ω, LD)/V
  <sub>PLD</sub>. Using this measure of selection allows us to predict the response to selection using the Lande equation: R  =  V
  <sub>A</sub>*β 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Lande1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Lande1">[13]</a>. Predicting the response to selection can also be done using the more familiar Breeder's equation, R  =  h
  <span class="sup">2</span>*S 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Falconer1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Falconer1">[16]</a>, which uses an alternative measure of selection, the selection differentials defined as the covariance between a female's relative fitness (ω) and her observed laying date (LD), i.e. S  =  cov(ω, LD) 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Lande2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Lande2">[15]</a>. Because a previous study examining the association between strength of selection and expression of genetic variance used S and h
  <span class="sup">2</span> as parameters 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Wilson1">[4]</a>, we also present our results using these parameters for comparison. We note, however, that using selection gradients may represent a better measure of selection when the phenotypic variance in a trait changes 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Hereford1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Hereford1">[14]</a>, which it does here. We then regressed the annual selection gradients (and differentials) against the environmental values using a least-squares regression (with 1/se
  <span class="sup">2</span> as weights when considering the selection gradients) in R 2.8.0 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Gilmour1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Gilmour1">[39]</a>.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, to allow comparison with other studies 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-RDevelopmentCoreTeam1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-RDevelopmentCoreTeam1">[40]</a>, we repeated all selection analyses using variance-standardized laying dates (i.e. standardizing laying date values to have zero mean and unit variance within each year). This did not change our conclusions and we report the results from these analyses in the Supporting Information section (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Yearly spring temperature values, standardized spring temperature values, sample size, mean laying dates, selection gradients (β), selection differentials (S), standardized selection differentials, estimated additive genetic variance, and heritability estimates along with annual predicted responses to selection (V
  <sub>A</sub>*β) are all reported in
