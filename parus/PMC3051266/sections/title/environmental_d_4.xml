 <p>Annual selection gradients and selection differentials on laying date regressed against standardized spring temperature. Each point is the estimated temperature-specific selection gradient (Î²) and selection differential (S) in (a) and (b), respectively. The solid line represents the least squares regression lines of selection gradients (
