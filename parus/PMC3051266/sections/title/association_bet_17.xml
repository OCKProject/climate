 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to test for an association between the strength of selection operating on laying date and the expression of additive genetic variance in laying date, we used environment-specific (and thus annual) V
  <sub>A</sub> and h
  <span class="sup">2</span> estimates generated from the random regression animal model and regressed the annual selection gradients on our annual estimates of V
  <sub>A</sub>; we then repeated the regression for annual selection differentials against h
  <span class="sup">2</span>. Regressions using selection gradients were weighted by the inverse of the square of the standard error.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because some individuals bred in multiple environments (i.e. years), estimates of selection will not be entirely independent, potentially violating some of the assumptions of least squares regression analyses. Although this is an inherent problem to all longitudinal studies, we assessed the potential for it to bias our conclusions by repeating our selection analyses using only a single record per individual (its first breeding attempt). Because this did not change the direction or significance of our analyses (regression of β on V
  <sub>A</sub> using 1/se
  <span class="sup">2</span> as weights: b = −0.009, se = 0.005, t
  <sub>33</sub> = −1.70, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.099; regression of S on h
  <span class="sup">2</span>: b = −14.54, se = 5.08, t
  <sub>33</sub> = −2.86, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.007), we conclude that the potential violation of the non-independence criteria caused by multiple breeding events from the same individuals is not a significant issue here.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although annual estimates of V
  <sub>A</sub> and h
  <span class="sup">2</span> are derived from the random regression model, note that in testing for a relationship between them and selection, we use them only as predictor variables in a regression, for which there need not be an assumption of independence of data points.
