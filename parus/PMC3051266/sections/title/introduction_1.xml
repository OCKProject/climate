 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Predicting an evolutionary response to selection in a phenotypic trait requires knowledge of the strength of selection acting on the trait and its genetic basis. Although it has long been recognized that the strength, and direction, of selection may vary with environmental conditions (e.g., 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Grant1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Grant1">[1]</a>), widespread recognition of the fact that additive genetic variance (and thus heritability) may also change with environmental conditions has been more recent 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Hoffmann1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Hoffmann1">[2]</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Charmantier1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Charmantier1">[3]</a>. Taken together, these observations generate an expectation of an environmentally driven association between the two parameters that, in theory, has the potential to either enhance (positive association) or constrain (negative association) any response to selection. Surprisingly, however, to our knowledge only one study to date has quantified the association between annual estimates of selection and expression of genetic variance (measured as heritability) in a heterogeneous environment 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Wilson1">[4]</a>. In this article, we present data from a long-term study of a great tit (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) population known to be experiencing substantial shifts in climatic conditions, and test for the effects of the novel environmental conditions on the expression of additive genetic variance, and the selection on, a key life history trait, breeding time.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many studies have found that selection is often strongest when environmental conditions are adverse (e.g., 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Wilson1">[4]</a>–
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Grant3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Grant3">[8]</a>), and there is a clear indication that “perturbed or stressed” populations have larger standardized selection differentials than “undisturbed” populations (
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Endler1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Endler1">[9]</a> p. 208). For example, Garant and co-workers 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Garant1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Garant1">[5]</a> examined selection on fledgling body mass in a population of great tits and found that selection differentials were greater in years when average body mass was low and when the proportion of individuals surviving to recruitment was low, both indicative of poor/adverse environmental conditions. In general, therefore, selection is often stronger when environmental conditions are adverse.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unlike the general tendency for selection to be stronger in adverse environments, conclusions regarding the effects of good versus adverse environments on the expression of additive genetic variance are more mixed. Laboratory studies investigating the effect of environmental conditions have generally found a weak tendency for heritability to increase in stressful environments with this being caused by changes in both the expression of genetic variance as well as the environmental variance (reviewed in 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Hoffmann2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Hoffmann2">[10]</a>). This pattern, however, is in contrast to most studies from natural populations that find, at least for morphological traits, that additive genetic variance and heritability is often relatively lower in unfavorable conditions 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Charmantier1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Charmantier1">[3]</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Hoffmann2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Hoffmann2">[10]</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Meril1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Meril1">[11]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is important to realize that heritability (h
  <span class="sup">2</span>) may change under different environmental conditions either because of changes in additive genetic variance (V
  <sub>A</sub>) or other variance components (e.g., permanent environmental variance (V
  <sub>PE</sub>) or residual variance (V
  <sub>R</sub>)). However, changes in V
  <sub>A</sub> are of particular interest because they indicate a change in the “evolvability” 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Houle1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Houle1">[12]</a>, or the potential to respond to selection, of a trait. Furthermore, changes in V
  <sub>A</sub> can only be due to a change in the genetic architecture of a trait through mechanisms such as genotype-environment interactions, changes in mutation and recombination rates, and removal of alleles with low fitness by selection (reviewed in 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Hoffmann2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Hoffmann2">[10]</a>). Depending on the direction and scale of these changes, both additive genetic variance and heritability may increase or decrease depending on the relative impact of each of the above factors 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Hoffmann2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Hoffmann2">[10]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The possibility that both the expression of additive genetic variance of a trait and the strength of selection acting on it may vary with environmental conditions is significant, as such environmentally induced variation may be important in determining the evolutionary dynamics of natural populations. In particular, the observation of a general increase in genetic variance of morphological traits 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Charmantier1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Charmantier1">[3]</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Hoffmann2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Hoffmann2">[10]</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Meril1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Meril1">[11]</a> and a reduction in selection 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Wilson1">[4]</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Milner1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Milner1">[6]</a> during favorable conditions in natural populations leads to the expectation of a negative relationship between genetic variance and the strength of selection, such that selection should be strongest in years in which the expression of additive genetic variance is least. This association could severely constrain a response to selection and provide one explanation for the frequently observed scenario of apparent stasis in natural populations 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Wilson1">[4]</a>. However, in contrast to morphometric traits, life history traits do not appear to show a clear indication of increased heritability in stressful environments 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Charmantier1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Charmantier1">[3]</a>. This makes it more difficult to predict how, or if, additive genetic variance and selection on life history traits may covary in a heterogeneous environment.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Surprisingly, despite the potential importance of environmentally induced associations between the strength of selection and expression of genetic variance, we are aware of only one previous study that has tested for such an association. Wilson et al. 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Wilson1">[4]</a> found that the strength of selection on body weight in a free-living population of Soay sheep (
  <span class="italic">Ovis aries</span>) in a given year was negatively correlated with the expression of total genetic variance (assessed via the heritability) of body weight, suggesting a possible constraint on the potential for evolution of body weight in this species. However, so far no study has, to our knowledge, examined the association between strength of selection and V
  <sub>A</sub> (or h
  <span class="sup">2</span>) in a life history trait. Hence, we do not know if such relationships are common in nature, and whether they are generally negative, which may constrain an evolutionary response, or whether there are examples of positive associations between strength of selection and V
  <sub>A</sub> (or h
  <span class="sup">2</span>), which would speed up an evolutionary response.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here we use data from an exceptionally long-term study population of great tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) in the Hoge Veluwe, the Netherlands, to investigate how selection and expression of additive genetic variance of a key life-history trait (timing of breeding, or “laying date”) vary in relation to rapid changes in environmental conditions (spring temperature). The evolutionary response in a trait between generations can be predicted as R  =  V
  <sub>A</sub> * β 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Lande1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Lande1">[13]</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Hereford1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Hereford1">[14]</a>, where β is the selection gradient, defined as the covariance between relative fitness and trait value divided by the phenotypic variance in the trait (i.e., β  =  cov(ω,trait)/V
  <sub>Ptrait</sub>) 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Lande2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Lande2">[15]</a>; we therefore test the association between V
  <sub>A</sub> and the selection gradients β under different environmental conditions. We also consider the alternative format for predicted response, R  =  h
  <span class="sup">2</span> * S 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Falconer1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Falconer1">[16]</a>, where S is the selection differential, defined as the covariance between relative fitness and trait value (i.e., S  =  cov(ω,trait)) and test for an association between heritability and selection differentials.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This system is particularly well suited to an exploration of the association between selection and V
  <sub>A</sub> in a variable environment because phenotypic data, pedigree data, and a thorough understanding of how environmental conditions influence laying date are available 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Visser1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Visser1">[17]</a>,. Previous studies in this population have reported a significant increase in spring temperature over the past four decades 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Husby1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Husby1">[18]</a> and have also shown that warm spring temperatures lead to earlier laying dates 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Visser1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Visser1">[17]</a>. Furthermore, warmer temperatures lead to reproduction being mistimed relative to the food peak 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Visser1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Visser1">[17]</a>, resulting in a decrease in both the number and size of fledglings 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Husby2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Husby2">[19]</a>, and in the proportion of females producing a second clutch 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Visser2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Visser2">[20]</a>. Spring temperatures are thus not only directly related to observed variation in laying dates but can also be used as a measure of environmental quality in the population. In addition, spring temperatures are now significantly above those which the population has previously experienced 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Husby1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Husby1">[18]</a>, providing an ideal opportunity to study how novel environmental conditions may influence evolutionary dynamics. We therefore tested the temperature dependence of the selection gradients and differentials, how expression of additive genetic variance and heritability changed with temperature, and finally, how the measures of selection were associated with the amount of genetic variance present in the population.
