 <p>(a) Estimated change in additive genetic variance (V
  <sub>A</sub>) with 95% confidence interval against standardized spring temperature as predicted from the random regression animal model in which V
  <sub>A</sub> and V
  <sub>PE</sub> vary with temperature. (b) Estimated change in heritability across spring temperature as predicted from a model where V
  <sub>A</sub> and V
  <sub>PE</sub> changed with standardized spring temperature; each point represents the year specific (and thus temperature specific) h
  <span class="sup">2</span> estimate.
