  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found, firstly, strong selection on laying date, with early breeding birds having higher fitness than late breeding individuals (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000585-t001" href="#pbio-1000585-t001">Table 1</a>). Indeed, 29 out of the 35 estimates of annual selection gradients and differentials were negative (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000585-g001" href="#pbio-1000585-g001">Figure 1</a>, 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000585.s002" href="#pbio.1000585.s002">Table S2</a>), reflecting general selection for earlier breeding, as has previously been shown in this population 
   <a rid="pbio.1000585-Visser1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Visser1">[17]</a>,
   <a rid="pbio.1000585-Husby3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Husby3">[21]</a>. Secondly, the interaction between laying date and standardized spring temperature was significantly negative (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000585-t001" href="#pbio-1000585-t001">Table 1</a>), indicating that with increasing spring temperatures the relationship (slope) between fitness and laying date became more negative (i.e., slope steeper in warmer years). Consequently, selection for early breeding was significantly stronger (indicated by more negative values of β) in warm years than in cold years; i.e., the strength of selection on lay date varied with environmental conditions (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000585-g001" href="#pbio-1000585-g001">Figure 1</a>). This result was confirmed by regressing the annual selection gradients (β) against temperature: there was a significant increase in the (absolute) magnitude of the strength of selection with increasing temperatures (regression slope  = −0.044, se  = 0.019, t
   <sub>33</sub>  = −2.203, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.035, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000585-g001" href="#pbio-1000585-g001">Figure 1a</a>). The results were the same for selection differentials (regression slope  = −1.589, se  = 0.450, t
   <sub>33</sub>  = −3.529, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.001,
