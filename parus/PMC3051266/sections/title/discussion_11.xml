 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analysis of long-term records on an important life history trait in a wild bird population found evidence that in years when spring temperatures were highest, selection was strongest, and the magnitude of estimates of additive genetic variance V
  <sub>A</sub> (and hence heritability) was also highest. As a result, there was evidence of a positive association between the strength of selection and the expression of additive genetic variance, and heritability. A positive association such as this between the strength of selection and expression of genetic variance and heritability could make the magnitude of the response strongly environmentally dependent; in this case, warming temperatures would considerably enhance any expected response to selection.

  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Svensson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Svensson1">[25]</a>, selection gradients and differentials were generally negative, indicating that early-breeding individuals had higher fitness than late-breeding individuals. Furthermore, the strength of selection was strongest when temperatures were highest (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000585-g001" href="#pbio-1000585-g001">Figure 1</a>). It has previously been shown that reproductive success 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Perrins1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Perrins1">[26]</a> has declined in this population over the study period, most likely because, with increasing spring temperatures, there is evidence of increased “mistiming” of reproduction relative to the peak in food abundance 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Visser1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Visser1">[17]</a>. This decline in reproductive success suggests that high spring temperature is generally associated with adverse environmental conditions. Hence, our results confirm the expectation in natural populations of stronger selection in adverse environmental conditions 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Endler1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Endler1">[9]</a>. It is important to point out, however, that high temperatures are not necessarily associated with adverse environmental conditions in other systems. For example, a population of great tits in the U.K. has also experienced increasing temperatures, but recruitment rates in this population have increased over time 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Nussey1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Nussey1">[27]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies on natural populations have found that heritability decreased when environmental conditions are stressful 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Charmantier1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Charmantier1">[3]</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Hoffmann2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Hoffmann2">[10]</a>, although we know less about how V
  <sub>A</sub> changes. Here, we found instead that both additive genetic variance and heritability of laying date increased rather than decreased (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000585-g002" href="#pbio-1000585-g002">Figure 2</a>). Although there was substantial evidence that V
  <sub>A</sub> and V
  <sub>PE</sub> changed with environmental conditions (see 
  <a ref-type="sec" rid="s2" href="#s2">Results</a>), the change in V
  <sub>A</sub> alone was not statistically significant 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Husby1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Husby1">[18]</a>, something that is reflected in the large standard errors in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000585-g002" href="#pbio-1000585-g002">Figure 2a</a>. However, the statistical power to detect significant changes in additive genetic variance in relation to varying environmental conditions using a random regression animal model approach may be limited 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Husby1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Husby1">[18]</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Charmantier2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Charmantier2">[28]</a>. Most importantly, the increase in V
  <sub>A</sub> is very large and represents 81.4% of the total change in V
  <sub>P</sub> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000585-g002" href="#pbio-1000585-g002">Figure 2a</a>). This increase in V
  <sub>A</sub> is, for example, much larger than the increase in maternal genetic variance (V
  <sub>M</sub>) for birth weight in Soay sheep 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Wilson1">[4]</a>. Note also that in the Soay sheep analysis, maternal environmental effects were not fitted with the same order polynomials as the maternal genetic effects, so that some of the increase in maternal genetic effects variance estimates could potentially be driven by environmental rather than genetic effects (in the same way as permanent environment variance will inflate additive genetic variance if not fitted explicitly, 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Kruuk1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Kruuk1">[29]</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One possible explanation for why V
  <sub>A</sub> may increase with higher temperatures is that high temperatures constitute not only a stressful, but also a novel, environment. For example, 2005 and 2007 had the highest recorded spring temperatures since this population study began back in 1955. It has been suggested that V
  <sub>A</sub> could increase in novel environments because selection has not yet had the possibility to remove the most deleterious alleles, as it will have in the ancestral environment, thereby causing an increase in the standing genetic variation 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Kruuk2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Kruuk2">[30]</a>; a suggestion that has been confirmed in some empirical studies 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Holloway1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Holloway1">[31]</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Laugen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Laugen1">[32]</a>. More generally, our finding adds support to the idea 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Charmantier1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Charmantier1">[3]</a> that predicting the direction in which V
  <sub>A</sub> should change with environmental conditions is complicated when environmental changes also leads to novel conditions, as is often the case with human-induced changes 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Charmantier1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Charmantier1">[3]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The increase in V
  <sub>A,</sub> heritability and strength of selection with increasing spring temperature meant that there was a positive association between the strength of selection on laying date and the heritability as well as expression of additive genetic variance of laying date (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000585-g003" href="#pbio-1000585-g003">Figure 3a and b</a>, respectively). The relationship between selection and amount of genetic variance was in the same direction whether using β as the measure of selection and V
  <sub>A</sub> as the measure of the potential for the population to adapt, versus using S and h
  <span class="sup">2</span>, but it was stronger (and hence statistically significant) between S and h
  <span class="sup">2</span> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000585-g003" href="#pbio-1000585-g003">Figure 3b</a>) than between β and V
  <sub>A</sub> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000585-g003" href="#pbio-1000585-g003">Figure 3a</a>). One possible explanation for this may be that in the S and h
  <span class="sup">2</span> comparison, both parameters depend on V
  <sub>P</sub> whereas in the β and V
  <sub>A</sub> comparison only β depends on V
  <sub>P</sub> and thus a change in V
  <sub>P</sub> may more quickly lead to a disassociation between β and V
  <sub>A</sub> than between S and h
  <span class="sup">2</span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nevertheless, we believe the fact that the relationships between β and V
  <sub>A</sub> and between S and h
  <span class="sup">2</span> are in the same direction (as well as that between standardized selection and V
  <sub>A</sub>/h
  <span class="sup">2</span>; see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000585.s003" href="#pbio.1000585.s003">Text S1</a>) offers strong support for an environmental coupling between these two parameters. This conclusion is supported by a highly significant temperature dependence of the predicted response to selection (see below, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000585-g004" href="#pbio-1000585-g004">Figure 4</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following traditional methodology we predicted the expected response to selection (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000585.s003" href="#pbio.1000585.s003">Text S1</a>) using the Lande equation: R  =  V
  <sub>A</sub> * β 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Lande1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Lande1">[13]</a>,
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Hereford1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Hereford1">[14]</a> but correcting for overlapping generations and the sex-limited expression of laying date, with the year-specific V
  <sub>A</sub> and β estimates (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000585.s002" href="#pbio.1000585.s002">Table S2</a>), which amounted to an advance of 1.81 days in total over the study period. Furthermore, using the average of the annual V
  <sub>A</sub> and β values gave a predicted response of 1.46 days advancement, which corresponds to only 81.1% of the predicted response using year-specific values. Thus, not incorporating environmental dependence of the expression of genetic variance and strength of selection may underestimate the predicted response by up to 20%, at least in this specific case. Failing to incorporate an environmentally dependent association between the strength of selection and genetic variance may further obscure our understanding of microevolution as the predicted response will be dependent on the environmental variable in question. For example, in our study the predicted response is strongly correlated with spring temperature, with a much larger predicted response in warmer temperatures compared to cold (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000585-g004" href="#pbio-1000585-g004">Figure 4</a>). We caution, however, that the breeder's equation (and equivalent Lande equation) has particularly poor success when applied to studies in natural populations 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Guntrip1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Guntrip1">[33]</a>, presumably because many of its underlying assumptions are not met (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000585.s003" href="#pbio.1000585.s003">Text S1</a> for further discussion on this topic).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Very few studies have simultaneously examined how environmental factors influence genetic expression and selection and the association between them. Indeed, we are only aware of this being examined in a Soay sheep population 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Wilson1">[4]</a>, where there was a negative association between the strength of selection and heritability of body size. Another example where there may be a negative association between the strength of selection and heritability is for juvenile growth rates in North American red squirrels (
  <span class="italic">Tamiasciurus hudsonicus</span>) 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Meril2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Meril2">[34]</a>. Although this study did not explicitly consider the association between selection and genetic variance, they found that V
  <sub>A</sub> and maternal genetic variance increased in years with low cone abundance (poor environment) whereas viability selection was stronger in years of high cone abundance (due to competition for territories 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Meril2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Meril2">[34]</a>). This should generate a negative association between selection and total genetic variance that may hamper a response to selection.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results thus demonstrate a relatively unexplored mechanism that could potentially increase the speed of adaptation to climate change in this population. As temperatures are expected to continue to increase 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-McAdam1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-McAdam1">[35]</a>, a positive association between strength of selection on laying date and its potential to evolve may prove an important factor allowing at least this specific population to adapt to the rapid environmental conditions experienced. As it is ultimately this rate of adaptation that is crucial if species are to cope with climate change 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-IPCC1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-IPCC1">[36]</a>, our findings suggest that models linking population viability to climate change should incorporate such dynamic processes.
