 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Quantitative genetic analyses require knowledge about the relationships among individuals within a population. Here, a pedigree was constructed where all ringed females known to have bred were assigned a mother and father as determined from observational data. In cases where brood manipulation experiments had been carried out and chicks had been moved between nests, we assigned the genetic parent rather than the social parent. If only one parent was known, we “dummy coded” the missing parent to preserve sibship information (note that we did not assign a phenotype to this parent). The extra-pair paternity (EPP) rate is unknown in this population, but is generally found to be low (3%–9%) in other populations of great tits

  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Verboven1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Verboven1">[43]</a> using a social pedigree is unlikely to be problematic.
