 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We then tested whether the effects of increasing temperature on selection and genetic variance generated an association between them.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relationship between the selection gradients (β) and additive genetic variance (V
  <sub>A</sub>) for laying date was negative but non-significant (slope = −0.006, se = 0.005, t
  <sub>33</sub> = 1.18, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.25; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000585-g003" href="#pbio-1000585-g003">Figure 3a</a>, dotted line). However, as random regression models are known to give upwardly biased estimates at the endpoints of the polynomials 
  <a rid="pbio.1000585-Gienapp1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pbio.1000585-Gienapp1">[22]</a>, we also tested this relationship after removing the extreme V
  <sub>A</sub> outliers (V
  <sub>A</sub> &gt;10, see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000585-g003" href="#pbio-1000585-g003">Figure 3a</a>). This resulted in a near-significant relationship between the two (slope = −0.014, se = 0.008, t
  <sub>31</sub> = 1.84, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.075; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000585-g003" href="#pbio-1000585-g003">Figure 3a</a>, solid line). Furthermore, there was a significant negative relationship between the selection differentials S and heritability (slope = −10.96, se = 4.43, t
  <sub>33</sub> = 2.48, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.019, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000585-g003" href="#pbio-1000585-g003">Figure 3b</a>), which was robust to excluding the two extreme heritability estimates (excluding h
  <span class="sup">2</span> &gt;0.25: slope = −13.82, se = 6.2, t
  <sub>31</sub> = 2.23, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.03). Finally, using standardized measures of selection, there was a negative although non-significant significant relationship between selection and additive genetic variance and a significantly negative relationship between strength of selection and heritability (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000585.s003" href="#pbio.1000585.s003">Text S1</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Note that because there is selection for early breeding, selection gradients and differentials are negative, but there is a 
  <span class="italic">positive</span> association between the absolute 
  <span class="italic">strength</span> of selection and levels of additive genetic variance (or heritability). As a result, in years in which selection on laying date was relatively strong, estimated V
  <sub>A</sub> (and h

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000585-g003" href="#pbio-1000585-g003">Figure 3</a>). This association resulted in a highly significant relationship between temperature and the magnitude of the predicted response to selection (
