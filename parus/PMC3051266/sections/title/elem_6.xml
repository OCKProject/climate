 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparing a model in which the additive genetic and permanent environment components of variance (V
  <sub>A</sub> and V
  <sub>PE</sub>) in a given year were constant across different spring temperatures to one in which V
  <sub>A</sub> and V
  <sub>PE</sub> could vary with the temperature gave strong support for environmental dependence of V
  <sub>A</sub> and V
  <sub>PE</sub> (χ
  <span class="sup">2</span>
  <sub>4</sub> = 74.90, 
  <span class="italic">p</span>&lt;0.001). Consequently, we used the predictions from the model in which the two variance components varied with spring temperature to generate estimates of annual V
  <sub>A</sub> and h
  <span class="sup">2</span> and to explore how these annual estimates corresponded to the observed changes in the strength of selection on laying date.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The estimated environment-specific 
  <span class="bold">G</span>-matrix predicted a substantial increase in V
  <sub>A</sub> with increasing standardized spring temperatures (
