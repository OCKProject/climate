 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The data were collected in the Hoge Veluwe National Park, the Netherlands (52°05′ N, 05°50′ E), during the period 1973 to 2007. Nest boxes were visited at least once every week during the breeding season (April–June). The laying date of the first egg of a female's clutch (laying date, LD) was calculated from the number of eggs found during the weekly checks, assuming that one egg was laid per day. Both parents were caught and individually marked on the nest using a spring trap when the young were 7–10 d old. Laying dates are presented as the number of days after March 31 (day 1 =  April 1, day 31 =  May 1). We only used information on the first clutch, defined as any clutch started within 30 d of the first laid egg in any given year. Replacement and second clutches (which currently compromise &lt;5% of breeding attempts, 21]) were thus excluded from the analysis. In total, therefore, we had information about 3,852 breeding records from 2,394 females. More details about the study population can be found in van Balen
