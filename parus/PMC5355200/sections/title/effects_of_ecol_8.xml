 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Effects of ecological conditions on invertebrate prey abundance and diversity</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prior to our main analyses, we explored the ecological relevance of our rainfall measures. To do this, we fitted models predicting invertebrate prey abundance and species diversity in each monthly pitfall trap transect. In these models, we included the following fixed effects: the total rainfall in the past 30 days to test for shorter‐term rainfall effects, the mean and standard deviation of the monthly rainfall in the past 12 months to test for longer‐term rainfall effects and the quadratic terms of this mean and standard deviation to test for any nonlinear effects. We included collection month as a random intercept. The abundance data were overdispersed but not zero‐inflated so we also included an observation‐level random effect in the abundance model and fitted it using a Poisson log‐normal error structure and log link function (Harrison,
