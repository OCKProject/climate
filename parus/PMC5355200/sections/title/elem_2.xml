  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conducted our study between September 1999 and March 2014 on a long‐term study population of banded mongooses on the Mweya Peninsula in Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda (0°12′S, 27°54′E). Cant, Vitikainen, and Nichols (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Banded mongooses (Figure 
   <a rid="ece32747-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece32747-fig-0001">1</a>) are diurnal carnivores (&lt;2 kg) that live in stable, mixed‐sex groups of around 10–30 individuals and whose diet mainly consists of small invertebrates (Rood, 
   <a rid="ece32747-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0067">1975</a>). Individuals sexually mature around the age of 1 year (Cant et al., 
   <a rid="ece32747-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0012">2016</a>) and all individuals within a group reproduce to some extent, though contributions to reproduction are skewed toward older individuals (Nichols, Amos, Cant, Bell, &amp; Hodge, 
   <a rid="ece32747-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0057">2010</a>; Nichols, Bell, Hodge, &amp; Cant, 
   <a rid="ece32747-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0058">2012</a>). Their average lifespan is around 3.5 years (males = 42 months, females = 38 months, max = 149 months, Cant et al., 
   <a rid="ece32747-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0012">2016</a>), and survival rates are constant across all ages (Cant et al., 
   <a rid="ece32747-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0012">2016</a>; Marshall et al., 
   <a rid="ece32747-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0047">2016</a>). At our equatorial study site reproduction occurs all year round and is not synchronized between groups. Reproduction is, however, highly synchronized within groups: around four times per year, all pregnant females in a group give birth in an underground den to a large communal litter, usually on the same morning (Cant, 
   <a rid="ece32747-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0009">2000</a>; Hodge, Bell, &amp; Cant, 
   <a rid="ece32747-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0035">2011</a>). Pups remain in the den for approximately their first 30 days, after which they move with the rest of the group and are cared for by adult “escorts” for around a further 60 days (Gilchrist, 
   <a rid="ece32747-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0025">2004</a>; Gilchrist &amp; Russell, 
   <a rid="ece32747-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0027">2007</a>). We are able to individually recognize the mongooses in our study population using unique hair‐shave patterns or colored collars. Radio collars weighing 26–30 g (Sirtrack Ltd, Havelock North, New Zealand) with a 20‐cm whip antenna (Biotrack Ltd, Dorset, UK) are fitted to one to two individuals in each group to allow them to be located. Most individual are trained to step onto an electronic balance in return for a small milk reward. Two groups have access to human refuse (Otali &amp; Gilchrist, 
   <a rid="ece32747-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0063">2004</a>) and so were excluded from this study (and also a previous complementary study investigating the effects of ecological conditions during adulthood, Marshall et al.,

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We collected climate data daily from a weather station situated centrally at our study site. We selected rainfall as our measure of ecological conditions since it is relatively variable at Mweya (mean monthly rainfall ± 
    <span class="italic">SD</span> = 61 ± 41 mm, 
    <span class="italic">n</span> = 152 months), while temperature is reasonably constant (mean of monthly mean maximum daily temperature ± 
    <span class="italic">SD</span> = 29.5 ± 1.5°C, 
    <span class="italic">n</span> = 162 months) (Marshall et al., 
    <a rid="ece32747-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0047">2016</a>). We defined an individual's “early life” to be its first year of development based on growth and age at sexual maturity. Banded mongooses’ major growth phase occurs in their first year (zone i in Figure 
    <a rid="ece32747-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece32747-fig-0002">2</a>), and 1 year is also the approximate age at which females become regular breeders and males first obtain paternity (Cant et al., 
    <a rid="ece32747-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0012">2016</a>). In addition, the pattern of rainfall at our study site operates over a 12‐month period: two wet seasons, one shorter (March–May) and one longer (August–December), divided by two dry seasons (January–February and June–July; Figure 
    <a rid="ece32747-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece32747-fig-0003">3</a>a, Marshall et al., 
    <a rid="ece32747-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0047">2016</a>). Consequently, we used the mean and standard deviation of the monthly rainfall in mongooses’ first year of life as our measure of the mean and variability of early‐life ecological conditions (Figure 
    <a rid="ece32747-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece32747-fig-0003">3</a>b). At our study site, the mean and standard deviation of monthly rainfall within a year are not correlated (Pearson's 
    <span class="italic">r</span> = .11, 
    <span class="italic">p</span> = .73, 
    <span class="italic">n</span> = 13 years). This standard deviation is, however, positively correlated with the maximum monthly rainfall in the year (
    <span class="italic">r</span> = .91, 
    <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; .001, 
    <span class="italic">n</span> = 13) and negatively correlated with the minimum rainfall in the year (
    <span class="italic">r</span> = −.71, 
    <span class="italic">p</span> = .007, 
    <span class="italic">n</span> = 13). Thus, a high standard deviation in monthly rainfall over a 12‐month period indicates a period with greater extremes of low and high monthly rainfall. As you would expect, mean monthly rainfall in a year is moderately positively correlated with both the minimum (
    <span class="italic">r</span> = .46, 
    <span class="italic">p</span> = .12, 
    <span class="italic">n</span> = 13) and maximum (
    <span class="italic">r</span> = .32, 
    <span class="italic">p</span> = .28, 
    <span class="italic">n</span> = 13) monthly rainfall.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We further explored the ecological relevance of rainfall at our study site by measuring its effect on invertebrates (banded mongooses’ predominant food source; Rood, 
    <a rid="ece32747-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0067">1975</a>) using monthly pitfall trap transects set between August 2013 and February 2015. At the end of each month, we set pitfall traps on 40‐m transects at four randomly chosen locations. Each transect consisted of five pitfall traps set at 10‐m intervals along the transect line. Pitfall traps consisted of smooth‐side plastic drinking cups (9 cm tall with circular tops 7 cm in diameter) buried so that their rims were flush with the level of the ground. These were filled with water to c. 3 cm deep and a drop of detergent to break the water's surface tension and ensure captured invertebrates fell into the water rather than being caught on its surface. The traps were collected after 24 hr, and their contents were sieved out and frozen in ziplock bags in a −20°C freezer. At a later date, the contents of the pitfall traps in each transect were then sorted and the invertebrates were identified to order level. Following Rood (
    <a rid="ece32747-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0067">1975</a>), we identified mongoose prey as those invertebrates belonging to the orders Blattodea, Coleoptera, Diplopoda, Formicidae, and Orthoptera. We measured the abundance and diversity of invertebrate prey collected in each transect. Abundance was measured as the total number of individuals in all five orders. Diversity was calculated using the Shannon–Weiner index of diversity to measure the distribution of these individuals across the five orders. The Shannon–Weiner index (
    <span class="italic">H</span>) for a particular transect was calculated as:

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Banded mongooses</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We visited our study groups for at least 20 min every 1–3 days, during which we noted the presence or absence of individuals. We could distinguish between absences due to dispersal from the group and due to death since in banded mongooses dispersal involves the simultaneous eviction of multiple individuals from the group, often with a conspicuous period of aggression within the group beforehand (Cant, Hodge, Bell, Gilchrist, &amp; Nichols, 
    <a rid="ece32747-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0010">2010</a>; Thompson et al., 
    <a rid="ece32747-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0076">2016</a>). In contrast, death involves the permanent disappearance of single individuals. We were able to weigh most individuals once a week in the morning before foraging started by training them to step on electronic scales in return for a small milk reward. We identified female pregnancy by visual swelling of the abdomen and confirmed this by palpation and ultrasound scans during trapping (Cant, 
    <a rid="ece32747-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0009">2000</a>; Inzani et al., 
    <a rid="ece32747-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0039">2016</a>). Births occur overnight in an underground den and were identified by the absence of pregnant females the following morning and a subsequent change in their body shape and mass loss (Cant, 
    <a rid="ece32747-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0009">2000</a>). To assign parentage, DNA was extracted from 2‐mm skin samples taken from individuals when they were first trapped (either as newly emerged pups or newly arrived immigrants). This DNA was then genotyped using a panel of 43 polymorphic microsatellite markers (see further details of DNA analysis and parentage assignment in Sanderson, Wang, Vitikainen, Cant, &amp; Nichols, 
    <a rid="ece32747-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0071">2015</a>). See Hodge (

   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To answer part of our first question about whether early‐life ecological conditions affect early‐life social environment, we measured the amount of social care an individual received as a pup and the social rank of their parents. The amount of escorting (social care) a mongoose pup receives has been shown to affect its condition and survival during development and later‐life reproduction (Gilchrist, Otali, &amp; Mwanguhya, 
    <a rid="ece32747-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0026">2004</a>; Hodge, 
    <a rid="ece32747-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0033">2005</a>). Similarly, parental social rank has been shown to influence individuals’ access to resources and growth in early‐life, and reproduction in later‐life in other systems (Altmann &amp; Alberts, 
    <a rid="ece32747-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0001">2005</a>; Charpentier, Tung, Altmann, &amp; Alberts, 
    <a rid="ece32747-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0015">2008</a>; Huchard et al., 
    <a rid="ece32747-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0038">2013</a>). We measured the amount of escorting received by a pup as the proportion of group visits they were observed being escorted by an adult during the escorting period. Pups were defined as being escorted if they were within 30 cm of the same adult for more than 50% of the group visit (Gilchrist, 
    <a rid="ece32747-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0025">2004</a>; Sanderson et al., 
    <a rid="ece32747-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0072">2014</a>). Social dominance increases with age in banded mongooses (e.g., Cant, Nichols, Johnstone, &amp; Hodge, 
    <a rid="ece32747-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0011">2014</a>; Nichols et al., 
    <a rid="ece32747-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0057">2010</a>) and so parental rank was measured as the parent's age‐rank within the group on the day of an individual's birth.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prior to our main analyses, we explored the ecological relevance of our rainfall measures. To do this, we fitted models predicting invertebrate prey abundance and species diversity in each monthly pitfall trap transect. In these models, we included the following fixed effects: the total rainfall in the past 30 days to test for shorter‐term rainfall effects, the mean and standard deviation of the monthly rainfall in the past 12 months to test for longer‐term rainfall effects and the quadratic terms of this mean and standard deviation to test for any nonlinear effects. We included collection month as a random intercept. The abundance data were overdispersed but not zero‐inflated so we also included an observation‐level random effect in the abundance model and fitted it using a Poisson log‐normal error structure and log link function (Harrison, 
    <a rid="ece32747-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0031">2014</a>). The diversity model was fitted using a normal error structure and its residuals checked to ensure they were normally distributed with a homogeneous variance.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mirroring our research questions, we conducted our analyses of the effect of early‐life ecological conditions in two stages: (1) effects during early‐life and (2) lifetime fitness effects, fitting our models to males and females separately. Banded mongooses are fully grown and reach sexual maturity between the ages of 1 and 2 years (zone ii in Figure 
    <a rid="ece32747-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece32747-fig-0002">2</a>; Cant et al., 
    <a rid="ece32747-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0012">2016</a>). Therefore, in stage 2 of our analyses, we only included individuals who had survived to 2 years old to ensure we only included fully developed individuals (zone iii in Figure 
    <a rid="ece32747-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece32747-fig-0002">2</a>). Table 
    <a rid="ece32747-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#ece32747-tbl-0001">1</a> lists the models we fitted in each stage and details how the response variable in each model was measured, the sample sizes used, the random effects included and the models’ error structure and link functions. In all models, we fitted the mean and standard deviation of the monthly rainfall in an individual's first year of life as fixed effects. To test for the possibility of a life‐history trade‐off between survival and reproduction, our models of lifespan also included whether an individual had successfully reproduced in their lifetime (0/1) and the interaction between this and the first‐year rainfall variables. Our model of adult mass also included an individual's age as a control variable, while our model predicting the amount of social care received as a pup also included the ratio of adults (potential escorts) to pups in the group as a control variable. Banded mongoose reproduction is synchronized within groups, but not between groups, and in our equatorial study population reproduction occurs all year round. Consequently, population‐wide cohort effects, which can lead to spurious findings in the analysis of life‐history traits (Grosbois et al., 
    <a rid="ece32747-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0029">2008</a>; Murray, 
    <a rid="ece32747-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0053">2006</a>), are not expected in this system. Within‐group reproductive synchrony does form cohorts of individuals born in the same communal litter who all experience the same early‐life ecological conditions, and we controlled for this in stage 1 of our analysis by including breeding attempt as a random effect in our models (Table 
    <a rid="ece32747-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#ece32747-tbl-0001">1</a>). It was not necessary to control for within‐group cohort effects in stage 2 of our analyses because the high mortality rate in our population (e.g., 57% mortality between 1 and 3 months old, Hodge et al., 
    <a rid="ece32747-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0036">2009</a>; see full survival curve in Cant et al., 
    <a rid="ece32747-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0012">2016</a>) meant that individuals included in these analyses were almost entirely from unique breeding attempts.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conducted our analyses using generalized linear mixed effect models (GLMMs). The residuals of models fitted using normal error structures (mass at 1 year old and adult mass) were checked to ensure they were normally distributed with constant variance. Models fitted to count data used a Poisson error structure unless they were overdispersed. Where this occurred, following Harrison (
    <a rid="ece32747-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0031">2014</a>), models were fitted using a Poisson log‐normal error structure and an observation‐level random effect (lifespan models) unless the data were zero‐inflated in which case a negative binomial error structure was used (lifetime reproductive success models). We used the same model selection procedure as our complementary study of the effect of ecological conditions during adulthood on banded mongooses (Marshall et al., 
    <a rid="ece32747-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0047">2016</a>). We used likelihood ratio tests, comparing the full model to a model without a particular variable, to test the significance of this variable's effect (Forstmeier &amp; Schielzeth, 
    <a rid="ece32747-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0020">2011</a>). Where interactions did not have a significant effect, we dropped these from our final model to allow us to test the significance of the main effects in these nonsignificant interactions (Engqvist, 
    <a rid="ece32747-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0018">2005</a>). We did not reduce our model further due to the issues with stepwise model reduction techniques (Forstmeier &amp; Schielzeth, 
    <a rid="ece32747-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0020">2011</a>; Mundry &amp; Nunn,

    <a rid="ece32747-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0078">2006</a>). Correlations between variables fitted in models as fixed effects — including the correlation between the mean and standard deviation of the monthly rainfall in a mongoose's first year — were lower than the levels previously shown to cause model fitting issues such as variance inflation in effect estimates (max

    <a rid="ece32747-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0023">2011</a>). We performed all analyses in R (R Core Team, 
    <a rid="ece32747-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0064">2014</a>), fitting GLMMs using the lme4 package (Bates, Maechler, Bolker, &amp; Walker,
