 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We visited our study groups for at least 20 min every 1–3 days, during which we noted the presence or absence of individuals. We could distinguish between absences due to dispersal from the group and due to death since in banded mongooses dispersal involves the simultaneous eviction of multiple individuals from the group, often with a conspicuous period of aggression within the group beforehand (Cant, Hodge, Bell, Gilchrist, &amp; Nichols, 
  <a rid="ece32747-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0010">2010</a>; Thompson et al., 
  <a rid="ece32747-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0076">2016</a>). In contrast, death involves the permanent disappearance of single individuals. We were able to weigh most individuals once a week in the morning before foraging started by training them to step on electronic scales in return for a small milk reward. We identified female pregnancy by visual swelling of the abdomen and confirmed this by palpation and ultrasound scans during trapping (Cant, 
  <a rid="ece32747-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0009">2000</a>; Inzani et al., 
  <a rid="ece32747-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0039">2016</a>). Births occur overnight in an underground den and were identified by the absence of pregnant females the following morning and a subsequent change in their body shape and mass loss (Cant, 
  <a rid="ece32747-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0009">2000</a>). To assign parentage, DNA was extracted from 2‐mm skin samples taken from individuals when they were first trapped (either as newly emerged pups or newly arrived immigrants). This DNA was then genotyped using a panel of 43 polymorphic microsatellite markers (see further details of DNA analysis and parentage assignment in Sanderson, Wang, Vitikainen, Cant, &amp; Nichols, 
  <a rid="ece32747-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0071">2015</a>). See Hodge (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To answer part of our first question about whether early‐life ecological conditions affect early‐life social environment, we measured the amount of social care an individual received as a pup and the social rank of their parents. The amount of escorting (social care) a mongoose pup receives has been shown to affect its condition and survival during development and later‐life reproduction (Gilchrist, Otali, &amp; Mwanguhya, 
  <a rid="ece32747-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0026">2004</a>; Hodge, 
  <a rid="ece32747-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0033">2005</a>). Similarly, parental social rank has been shown to influence individuals’ access to resources and growth in early‐life, and reproduction in later‐life in other systems (Altmann &amp; Alberts, 
  <a rid="ece32747-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0001">2005</a>; Charpentier, Tung, Altmann, &amp; Alberts, 
  <a rid="ece32747-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0015">2008</a>; Huchard et al., 
  <a rid="ece32747-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0038">2013</a>). We measured the amount of escorting received by a pup as the proportion of group visits they were observed being escorted by an adult during the escorting period. Pups were defined as being escorted if they were within 30 cm of the same adult for more than 50% of the group visit (Gilchrist, 
  <a rid="ece32747-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0025">2004</a>; Sanderson et al., 
  <a rid="ece32747-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0072">2014</a>). Social dominance increases with age in banded mongooses (e.g., Cant, Nichols, Johnstone, &amp; Hodge, 
  <a rid="ece32747-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0011">2014</a>; Nichols et al., 
  <a rid="ece32747-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0057">2010</a>) and so parental rank was measured as the parent's age‐rank within the group on the day of an individual's birth.
