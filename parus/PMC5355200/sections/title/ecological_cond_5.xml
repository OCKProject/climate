 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We collected climate data daily from a weather station situated centrally at our study site. We selected rainfall as our measure of ecological conditions since it is relatively variable at Mweya (mean monthly rainfall ± 
  <span class="italic">SD</span> = 61 ± 41 mm, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 152 months), while temperature is reasonably constant (mean of monthly mean maximum daily temperature ± 
  <span class="italic">SD</span> = 29.5 ± 1.5°C, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 162 months) (Marshall et al., 
  <a rid="ece32747-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0047">2016</a>). We defined an individual's “early life” to be its first year of development based on growth and age at sexual maturity. Banded mongooses’ major growth phase occurs in their first year (zone i in Figure 
  <a rid="ece32747-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece32747-fig-0002">2</a>), and 1 year is also the approximate age at which females become regular breeders and males first obtain paternity (Cant et al., 
  <a rid="ece32747-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0012">2016</a>). In addition, the pattern of rainfall at our study site operates over a 12‐month period: two wet seasons, one shorter (March–May) and one longer (August–December), divided by two dry seasons (January–February and June–July; Figure 
  <a rid="ece32747-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece32747-fig-0003">3</a>a, Marshall et al., 
  <a rid="ece32747-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0047">2016</a>). Consequently, we used the mean and standard deviation of the monthly rainfall in mongooses’ first year of life as our measure of the mean and variability of early‐life ecological conditions (Figure 
  <a rid="ece32747-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece32747-fig-0003">3</a>b). At our study site, the mean and standard deviation of monthly rainfall within a year are not correlated (Pearson's 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = .11, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = .73, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 13 years). This standard deviation is, however, positively correlated with the maximum monthly rainfall in the year (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = .91, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; .001, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 13) and negatively correlated with the minimum rainfall in the year (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = −.71, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = .007, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 13). Thus, a high standard deviation in monthly rainfall over a 12‐month period indicates a period with greater extremes of low and high monthly rainfall. As you would expect, mean monthly rainfall in a year is moderately positively correlated with both the minimum (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = .46, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = .12, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 13) and maximum (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = .32, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = .28, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 13) monthly rainfall.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We further explored the ecological relevance of rainfall at our study site by measuring its effect on invertebrates (banded mongooses’ predominant food source; Rood, 
  <a rid="ece32747-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0067">1975</a>) using monthly pitfall trap transects set between August 2013 and February 2015. At the end of each month, we set pitfall traps on 40‐m transects at four randomly chosen locations. Each transect consisted of five pitfall traps set at 10‐m intervals along the transect line. Pitfall traps consisted of smooth‐side plastic drinking cups (9 cm tall with circular tops 7 cm in diameter) buried so that their rims were flush with the level of the ground. These were filled with water to c. 3 cm deep and a drop of detergent to break the water's surface tension and ensure captured invertebrates fell into the water rather than being caught on its surface. The traps were collected after 24 hr, and their contents were sieved out and frozen in ziplock bags in a −20°C freezer. At a later date, the contents of the pitfall traps in each transect were then sorted and the invertebrates were identified to order level. Following Rood (
  <a rid="ece32747-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0067">1975</a>), we identified mongoose prey as those invertebrates belonging to the orders Blattodea, Coleoptera, Diplopoda, Formicidae, and Orthoptera. We measured the abundance and diversity of invertebrate prey collected in each transect. Abundance was measured as the total number of individuals in all five orders. Diversity was calculated using the Shannon–Weiner index of diversity to measure the distribution of these individuals across the five orders. The Shannon–Weiner index (
  <span class="italic">H</span>) for a particular transect was calculated as:
