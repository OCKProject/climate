  <p>Male mongooses’ reproduction and survival and the mean (left‐hand panels) and variability (right‐hand panels) of rainfall in their first year. Panels show the effect on adult males’: mass (a, b), probability of siring at least one pup (c, d); in those that did sire a pup, the proportion of all pups born into their group that they sired (e, f); their lifespan (g, h); the total number of pups they sired in their lifetime (i, j). Lines show significant relationships predicted by models (see Table 
   <a rid="ece32747-tbl-0003" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#ece32747-tbl-0003">3</a>). Nonsignificant relationships are not plotted. In panel (g), the data and predicted relationships are split by into males who successfully reproduced in their lifetime (purple) and those who did not (black)
