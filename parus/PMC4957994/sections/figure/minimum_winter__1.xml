  <div class="title">Minimum winter temperature (°C) and relative abundance of three example bird species in peninsular Spain, and relationship between these variables.</div>
  <p>(A) Minimum winter temperatures in the study area (peninsular Spain). (B) Location of the study area (black) within the western Palearctic (dark grey). (C, E, G) Winter relative abundance of three sample species (
   <span class="italic">Saxicola rubicola</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Erithacus rubecula</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Turdus viscivorus</span>, respectively), at 1,689 UTM 10 × 10 km
   <span class="sup">2</span> cells within the study area, sampled in three consecutive winters (2008–2011). Relative abundance is the frequency of occurrence in sixty 15-min linear transects carried out in each UTM cell. (D, F, H) Relationship between the relative abundance of these species and minimum winter temperature, as modeled by quadratic 95%-quantile regression models.
