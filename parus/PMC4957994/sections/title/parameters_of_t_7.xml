 <div class="title">Parameters of the response of species abundance to winter temperature.</div>
 <p>Figures are mean, standard deviation and range of parameters derived from 95%-quantile regression models describing the influence of minimum winter temperature on abundance of bird species wintering in peninsular Spain, sampled at 1,689 UTM 10 × 10 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> cells in three consecutive winters (2008–2011). Sample size is 93 species when considering only significant models with a reduction in AIC figures (ΔAIC) lower than −13.82 units, and 103 species when significance of models is not relevant and therefore all species are considered. Detailed data for all species are shown in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-3" href="#supp-3">Table S1</a>.
