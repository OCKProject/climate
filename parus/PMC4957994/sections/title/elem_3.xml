  <a rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-43">2012</a>) for the first Spanish Atlas of Wintering Birds. See 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" href="#fig-2">Fig. 2B</a> for the geographical location of the study area within the Western Palearctic. We calculated the ‘relative abundance’ of each species at 1,689 UTM 10 × 10 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> cells, with very good sampling cover, as the frequency of occurrence in sixty 15-min transects sampled throughout three consecutive winters (see a summary of the methods in the Spanish Atlas of Wintering Birds in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1" href="#supp-1">Text S1</a>). We selected 103 bird species for the analyses, excluding nocturnal and aquatic birds, species that were detected in less than 50 UTM 10 × 10 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> cells, and those that were rare or very difficult to detect (i.e., those with a maximum recorded frequency of occurrence lower than 0.05, or three 15-min transects per 60 transects censused).

Relative abundance is the frequency of occurrence in sixty 15-min linear transects carried out in each UTM cell.

  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.aemet.es" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.aemet.es</span>) provided updated GIS temperature data covering the whole Iberian Peninsula, from which we calculated the average minimum winter temperature of each UTM cell as the daily averages during the period of study (mid-November to mid-February 2007–2010). Average minimum winter temperature during the study period in the 1,689 UTM cells considered was highly correlated with average winter temperature (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.978) and average maximum winter temperature (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.909). The average minimum winter temperature was selected as a measurement of the thermal state of the environment more probably constraining bird distribution and abundance, considering its functional meaning related to maximum thermoregulatory costs. Moreover, minimum temperatures usually occur at night, which is the most constraining period for diurnal species during winter, considering the long duration of nights, foraging inactivity and the lack of heat production from locomotion (
