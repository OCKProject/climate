   <a rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-43">2012</a>) for the first Spanish Atlas of Wintering Birds. See 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" href="#fig-2">Fig. 2B</a> for the geographical location of the study area within the Western Palearctic. We calculated the ‘relative abundance’ of each species at 1,689 UTM 10 × 10 km
   <span class="sup">2</span> cells, with very good sampling cover, as the frequency of occurrence in sixty 15-min transects sampled throughout three consecutive winters (see a summary of the methods in the Spanish Atlas of Wintering Birds in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1" href="#supp-1">Text S1</a>). We selected 103 bird species for the analyses, excluding nocturnal and aquatic birds, species that were detected in less than 50 UTM 10 × 10 km
   <span class="sup">2</span> cells, and those that were rare or very difficult to detect (i.e., those with a maximum recorded frequency of occurrence lower than 0.05, or three 15-min transects per 60 transects censused).

   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.aemet.es" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.aemet.es</span>) provided updated GIS temperature data covering the whole Iberian Peninsula, from which we calculated the average minimum winter temperature of each UTM cell as the daily averages during the period of study (mid-November to mid-February 2007–2010). Average minimum winter temperature during the study period in the 1,689 UTM cells considered was highly correlated with average winter temperature (
   <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.978) and average maximum winter temperature (
   <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.909). The average minimum winter temperature was selected as a measurement of the thermal state of the environment more probably constraining bird distribution and abundance, considering its functional meaning related to maximum thermoregulatory costs. Moreover, minimum temperatures usually occur at night, which is the most constraining period for diurnal species during winter, considering the long duration of nights, foraging inactivity and the lack of heat production from locomotion (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We analyzed the influence of minimum winter temperature (
   <span class="italic">T</span>) on the relative abundance (A) of each species using quantile regression models at percentiles 50th, 75th, 90th and 95th (i.e.,

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" href="#fig-1">Fig. 1A</a>). To account for non-linear effects of temperature, we defined the linear and quadratic terms of the relationship (

   <span class="italic">a</span> + 
   <span class="italic">bT</span> + 
   <span class="italic">cT</span>

   <span class="italic">T</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span>, to mean = 0 and sd = 1 prior to data analyses, in order to obtain standardized regression coefficients, also called beta regression coefficients. Under this standardization, the magnitude of beta coefficients allows to compare the relative contribution of each independent variable in the prediction of the response variable because predictors are on the same measurement scale.

   <span class="italic">R</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> indicates a better fit). In addition, we calculated the increase in AIC of these models with respect to the null model as a measure of the likelihood of the model (
