 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study highlights the high interspecific variability on the response to temperature and thermal tolerance. Bird species wintering in peninsular Spain range from the coldest to the warmest thermal preferences and from thermal specialists to generalists. Nevertheless, the general trend is to select the warmest areas, so that abundance of most species increases with temperature and is predicted to reach its maximum at temperatures higher than the average available temperature in the study region. Even though species attain their maximum abundances at warm areas, a large proportion of the area of distribution of the studied species is in colder locations, probably reflecting a limitation of sites combining thermal optima with other environmental preferences of a species. Our results suggest that minimum winter temperature functions as a physiological constraint on the maximum potential abundance attainable by a species at a certain location, though other environmental factors may be more relevant than temperature defining the biogeographical patterns of species.</p>
