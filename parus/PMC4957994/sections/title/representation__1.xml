 <p>(A) Abundance of 
  <span class="italic">Columba palumbus</span> in relation to minimum winter temperature along 1,689 UTM cells, and fitting curves for quantile regression models (from top to bottom: models on 95th, 75th, 50th and 25th percentiles). Relative abundance is the number of 15 min transects over 60 in which the species is detected at each UTM 10 × 10 km

  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>MEAN</sub> and 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>BREATH</sub> of 
  <span class="italic">Columba palumbus</span>. Environmental preferred temperature (
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>PREF</sub>) is the temperature at which the maximum abundance of the species is predicted by the quantile regression model for percentile 95th in (A). Mean temperature (
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>MEAN</sub>) is the mean winter minimum temperature in those UTM cells where the species was present, weighed by the relative abundance of the species at each cell. Thermal breadth (
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>BREATH</sub>) is the standardized area under the curve of quantile regression model for percentile 95th in (A), from −2 to 10 °C (shaded area in B).
