 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The distribution of overwintering animals is assumed to be strongly influenced by environmental energy availability, notably in regions with a marked year-round seasonality such as temperate ecosystems. Peninsular Spain is an important destination for many avian populations of the southwestern Palearctic during the winter (
  <a rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-32">Moreau</a>, 
  <a rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-32">1972</a>), when there are massive migrations of northern populations towards circum-Mediterranean countries. Even though conditions are milder than in the north, it is an energy-limiting period in which food resources are scarce and/or difficult to locate and the low temperatures impose a high metabolic cost to maintain a constant body temperature for homeothermic animals (

  <a rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-10">1974</a>). Specifically, average winter temperature in peninsular Spain (7.2 °C) is well below the lower critical temperature for a broad variety of bird species (ca. 18–22 °C,

  <a rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-25">1977</a>). Thus, winter survival depends primarily on a positive energy balance, obtaining enough food for self-maintenance and reducing metabolic costs of thermoregulation (e.g.,

  <a rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-34">1998</a>). In this ecological scenario, species abundances are expected to reach their maxima in warmer areas, through the direct effects of reduced thermoregulation costs and reduced mortality by hypothermia, or indirectly via the improvement of the winter foraging environment (e.g.,

  <a rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-13">2012</a>). However, the availability of “optimal environments,” combining preferred temperatures together with other habitat or trophic requirements, may be restricted. As a consequence, the environments in which the individuals of a species end up wintering may show a mean temperature different from the thermal preference of the species (at which the maximum abundances are attained). On the other hand, although general patterns are expected in relation to thermal optima, there might be notable interspecific differences on the thermal tolerance of species. Thermal breadth of species may define how individuals utilize the thermal space and ultimately the geographical area occupied by species (

  <a rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-44">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moreover, while the abundance of species may be limited by temperature at some points, it might be further limited by other environmental factors related to species-specific habitat or trophic preferences at other locations (
  <a rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-22">Herrando et al.</a>, 
  <a rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-22">2011</a>;

  <a rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-23">2015</a>). Thus, the correlation between species abundance and temperature may often display a solid distribution as that shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" href="#fig-1">Fig. 1A</a>. The upper limit of this distribution is defined by locations in which temperature is the factor actually limiting abundance, while the points below this limit correspond to locations in which other environmental factors are limiting abundance further than temperature. The upper limit of these distributions would represent the maximum potential abundance of species attainable at each environmental temperature, which in theory is independent of other environmental factors (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first goal of this study is to test the hypothesis that minimum winter temperature—as a surrogate of environmental energy availability—limits the maximum potential abundance of terrestrial birds wintering in the Iberian Peninsula, so that warmer environments will have the potential to maintain a higher number of individuals. Specifically, we test two predictions of this hypothesis: (1) that the maximum abundance of species will correlate positively with minimum winter temperature, (2) that, on average, species will prefer temperatures above the mean environmental temperature available in the region. The second goal is to test the hypothesis that as a consequence of species being limited by other factors (e.g., habitat preferences, food availability), mean temperatures at which species are found (
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>MEAN</sub>) do not coincide with the preferred temperature at which the species abundance is maximized (
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>PREF</sub>). Finally, we analyze the interspecific variation on the level of specialization to use the available thermal space (i.e., the thermal breadth of species,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We modeled the influence of minimum winter temperature on the abundance of 103 species of terrestrial birds wintering in the Iberian Peninsula using quadratic 95%-quantile regression models (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" href="#fig-1">Fig. 1A</a>). To analyze macroecological patterns in the abundance-temperature relationship across species, we use the standardized regression coefficients and two parameters derived from quantile regression models: the ‘environmental preferred temperature’ of species, calculated as the temperature at which its abundance is maximal within the thermal span of the study region (
  <span class="italic">T</span>

  <sub>BREADTH</sub>
