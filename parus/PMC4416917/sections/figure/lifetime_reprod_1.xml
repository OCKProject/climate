  <div class="title">Lifetime reproductive success and juvenile infection.</div>
  <p>The predicted relationship between faecal egg count (FEC) of the parasite 
   <span class="italic">Syngamus trachea</span> and individual lifetime reproductive success of juvenile female house sparrows on the island of Hestmannøy, northern Norway, measured as the number of recruits produced in an individual’s lifetime. The solid line indicates predicted values from the highest ranked generalized linear mixed model as judged by AIC
   <sub>C</sub> (see 
   <a rid="pone.0125773.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0125773.s005">S4 Table</a>). Dotted lines indicate lower and upper limits of the 95% confidence interval of predicted values. “Sunflower” points indicate sample size of observed values (one observation omitted to improve clarity).
