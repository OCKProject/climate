  <div class="title">Fledgling failure and maternal infection.</div>
  <p>The relationship between fledgling failure (i.e. probability that eggs fail to develop into fledglings) over a 11-day interval with maternal faecal egg count (FEC) of the parasite 
   <span class="italic">Syngamus trachea</span> in house sparrows on the island of Hestmannøy, northern Norway. The solid line indicates predicted values from the highest ranked generalized linear mixed model as judged by AIC

   <a rid="pone.0125773.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0125773.s003">S2 Table</a>). The model included individual identity as a random factor, and maternal tarsus length and hatch day as fixed covariates. Dotted lines indicate lower and upper limits of the 95% confidence interval of predicted values. “Sunflower” points indicate sample size of observed values.
