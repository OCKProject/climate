 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study has found a negative relationship between reproductive success of female house sparrows and the number of parasite eggs found in faeces in an insular population on the coast of Helgeland in northern Norway. A negative relationship with FEC was found both for reproductive success of adult females in a given year (measured as fledging failure) and adult reproductive success of juvenile females (LRS). To our knowledge this is the first study to find a negative relationship between FEC of a parasite eggs and reproductive success in wild populations of avian hosts. However, Redpath et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref036">36</a>] showed that experimental reductions of parasite infections led to an increased brood size in red grouse (
  <span class="italic">Lagopus lagopus scoticus</span>). Correlations between faecal larval counts and reproductive success of the host have also been found in red deer [
  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref037">37</a>]. Combining the results of the current study with the results of Holand et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref021">21</a>] suggest that parasite infection may increase variation in individual fitness in the metapopulation. However, to fully investigate the role of parasites in population dynamics of hosts, experimental manipulation of parasite prevalence has been suggested as vital in order to demonstrate the effect of parasites [
  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref038">38</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref039">39</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relationship between faecal egg counts and infection intensity may not be straightforward. As faecal egg counts may vary over the lifespan of the parasite [
  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref030">30</a>], this may have introduced variation in the relationship between the number of adult parasites present in the host and FEC. Ideally, the number of adult parasites present in a given host should be estimated by post mortem examinations. This was not possible for this long term, non-invasive study. In addition, we were unable to standardize the egg count (i.e. egg per gram) due to the generally very low mass of faeces samples produced by house sparrows. This may have caused unexplained variation in the relationship between FEC and response variables. However, repeated samples (20 samples over 40 days) from an infected house sparrow under laboratory conditions (Holand et al. unpublished results) indicated a strong positive relationship between standardized egg counts and FEC (
  <span class="italic">r</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">p</span>
  </sub> = 0.85, 
  <span class="italic">df</span> = 18, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.0001). In addition, the positive relationship between symptoms of infection and FEC [
  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref021">21</a>] may be explained by a correlation between FEC and infection severity/intensity.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The apparent lack of support in our models for the importance of infection status (compared to FEC) may be expected if infected hosts vary substantially in their parasite load [
  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref040">40</a>]. Therefore, the effect of classifying hosts only as “infected” or “not infected” may not optimally reflect the variation within the “infected” group. Given that FEC reflects the variation in the “infected” group better than the simple categorical variable, this may explain why FEC was generally favoured more than infection status in the model selection.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We did not find evidence for a relationship between infection by 
  <span class="italic">S</span>. 
  <span class="italic">trachea</span> and clutch size. Indeed, none of our explanatory variables were present in the highest ranked model (
  <a rid="pone.0125773.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0125773.s002">S1 Table</a>). Clutch size in house sparrows has been found to vary with time of year, habitat, density and female age [
  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref028">28</a>]. However, the general strength of these relationships appears to vary among studies [
  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref028">28</a>]. A lack of a relationship between infection by 
  <span class="italic">S</span>. 
  <span class="italic">trachea</span> and clutch size may be expected as egg production and egg laying in passerines may be energetically less costly than post-hatch parental care [
  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref041">41</a>]. If the parasite reduces the amount of energy available to the host for reproduction, this effect may not be as strong in the less costly stages (i.e. egg production) of host reproduction (but see [
  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref042">42</a>]).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The variation in fledging failure of eggs in nests was most parsimoniously explained by the additive effects of maternal FEC, hatch day and maternal tarsus length (
  <a rid="pone.0125773.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0125773.s003">S2 Table</a>). That fledging failure increased as the maternal FEC increased (
  <a rid="pone.0125773.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0125773.g001">Fig 1</a>) suggests that nestlings suffered higher mortality if the mother was heavily infected. This could be caused by a reduction in energy available to the mother in caring for the offspring. Female house sparrows in our study system have been shown to have higher feeding rate of nestlings compared to males [
  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref032">32</a>]. Therefore, if the female suffered significantly reduced energy reserves due to parasite infection, this could potentially increase nestling mortality. Also, in a study of survival rates using capture-mark-recapture models we found that individuals with symptoms of infection by 
  <span class="italic">S</span>. 
  <span class="italic">trachea</span> had lower reencounter probability, compared to non-infected house sparrows [
  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref021">21</a>]. If severe infection by 
  <span class="italic">S</span>. 
  <span class="italic">trachea</span> caused a reduction in the level of host activity, this could explain both the increased fledging failure and lower reencounter probability. Because our analysis contained observations of 46 individuals in total, where 11 mothers were infected, one should be cautious in interpreting the generality of the results (see 
  <a rid="pone.0125773.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0125773.g001">Fig 1</a>). Nevertheless, we did not find any reason to doubt the validity of these observations (e.g. due to measurement errors or other special circumstances). Few experimental studies have demonstrated an increased fledging failure in birds due to maternal infection by endoparasites. However, Marzal et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref006">6</a>] found that adult house martins (
  <span class="italic">Delichon urbica</span>) treated for avian malaria (
  <span class="italic">Haemoproteus prognei</span>) produced more fledglings compared to untreated adults. Also, negative effects of parental infection on offspring survival have been found in the European shag (
  <span class="italic">Phalacrocorax aristotelis</span>) infected by endoparasites [
  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref043">43</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found no clear relationship between recruitment failure and maternal characteristics (including FEC and infection status) or brood characteristics such as hatch day. This suggests that after a fledgling has left the nest, its survival may depend more on other factors which are not conditional on the nest or mother. For example, a previous investigation in the study system [
  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref021">21</a>] found that survival probability of juveniles and adults decreased as population density increased.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also found that LRS of juvenile females decreased with increasing juvenile FEC after accounting for the effect of lifespan and tarsus length (
  <a rid="pone.0125773.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0125773.g002">Fig 2</a>). This suggests that infection of 
  <span class="italic">S</span>. 
  <span class="italic">trachea</span> when the individual was juvenile had a negative effect on reproductive success as an adult. Negative effects of parasite infection on LRS have previously been found in cliff swallows (
  <span class="italic">Hirundo pyrrhonota</span>) infected by ectoparasites [
  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref008">8</a>]. In addition, Fitze et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref009">9</a>] found that Great tit (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) nestlings that grew up in nests containing ectoparasites had a lower lifetime production of reproducing offspring compared to nestlings that grew up in uninfected nests. However, to our knowledge the current study is the first to find a relationship between adult reproductive success and juvenile FEC of an avian host. As only 15 of the juveniles had a known age (i.e. had been marked as fledglings), we were unable to account for the effects of development on measurements of juvenile morphology. This may have added variation in the relationships between LRS and juvenile morphology.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study has found negative relationships between parasite infection, measured as eggs in faeces, and host reproduction that could indicate a negative effect of parasites on host reproductive success in a given year and in reproductive success as an adult (LRS) of a host individual. Whether the pattern found in this study was caused by an adaptive exploitation of the host by the parasite, a trade off strategy by the host or simply a consequence of a general loss of energy/resources caused by the infection, should be a topic for further investigations, ideally using an experimental design. Both the underlying (co)evolutionary mechanisms and ecological impact of parasite-induced reduction in host fitness has become an area of increased interest in recent years due to the possible effect of climate change on these mechanisms [
  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref044">44</a>]. Understanding the causes and consequences of such effects could have considerable impact for our understanding of the population dynamics of both parasite and host species.
