  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref021">21</a>], the nematode worm 
  <span class="italic">S</span>. 
  <span class="italic">trachea</span> has a global distribution and has been found in a majority of terrestrial bird genera [
  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref024">24</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref025">25</a>]. The parasite is commonly known as “gapeworm” or “gapes” in the domestic bird industry, where previous outbreaks have been known to cause large problems [
  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref024">24</a>]. The lifecycle of 
  <span class="italic">S</span>. 
  <span class="italic">trachea</span> may include one transport/paratenic host (i.e. a host which is not necessary for development of the parasite egg or larva) in addition to the final avian host. These transport/paratenic hosts can be species of earthworms, insects or and snails [
  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref024">24</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref026">26</a>]. The development-time from embryo to infective larvae is temperature dependant, with a lower limit of 16° C and an upper limit of 35° C [
  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref027">27</a>]. As the body temperature of house sparrows are often above 35° C [
  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref028">28</a>], this entails that eggs must develop outside the host in order to achieve transmission. Accordingly, vertical transmission (i.e. from parent to offspring) of 
  <span class="italic">S</span>. 
  <span class="italic">trachea</span> does not appear to be the main life history strategy of the parasite. After an avian host has orally ingested mature parasite larva(e), the parasite makes its way from the digestive system of the bird, through the blood vascular system to the lungs or trachea. Having reached the lungs or trachea, the parasite grows into an adult and finds a mate with which it permanently copulates [
  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref024">24</a>]. The eggs produced by the adult parasite(s) are coughed up by the host, swallowed and passed in the faeces [

  <span class="italic">S</span>. 
  <span class="italic">trachea</span> feed on blood in the tracheal tissue and may cause anaemia, inflammation and mechanical damage to the tissue and excess mucus production in the lungs and trachea. Birds that are infected by 
  <span class="italic">S</span>. 
  <span class="italic">trachea</span> may develop visible symptoms consisting of coughing, gasping and shaking of the head. Discomfort caused by these symptoms may reduce food uptake, and combined with the blood loss, may lead to host mortality [
  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref024">24</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref029">29</a>]. Egg production of 
  <span class="italic">S</span>. 
  <span class="italic">trachea</span> in domestic species has been shown to peak in the first 40 days of infection [
  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref030">30</a>]. The average life span of adult 
  <span class="italic">S</span>. 
  <span class="italic">trachea</span> in domestic bird species has been found to be 2–4 months [
  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref030">30</a>]. A previous study of 
  <span class="italic">S</span>. 
  <span class="italic">trachea</span> in the study population also indicated that house sparrows very rarely become infected by 
  <span class="italic">S</span>. 
  <span class="italic">trachea</span> more than once in their lifetime [

  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref028">28</a>]. House sparrows live in close vicinity to human settlements [
  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref028">28</a>]. House sparrows on Hestmannøy live in the vicinity of dairy farms and build their nests inside barns, silos or underneath ceilings. The survival probability of house sparrows is generally found to be low. This means that even if a house sparrow survives to become an adult, few survive more than two years [
