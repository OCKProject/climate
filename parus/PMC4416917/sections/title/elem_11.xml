 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the analysis of variation in clutch size, the highest ranked model contained only the intercept; i.e. none of our explanatory variables. There were also four alternative models which had a ∆ AIC
  <sub>C</sub> &lt; 2 (
  <a rid="pone.0125773.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0125773.s002">S1 Table</a>). These four models were univariate and only contained the effect of either bill length, wing length, age or body condition, respectively.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fledging failure was best explained (i.e. lowest AIC
  <sub>C</sub>) by FEC of the mother, hatch day and tarsus length of the mother. Fledging failure was higher for mothers with higher FECs (0.007 ± 0.002, see 
  <a rid="pone.0125773.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0125773.g001">Fig 1</a>), mothers breeding later in the breeding season (- 0.017 ± 0.005) and for mothers with shorter tarsus length (- 0.286 ± 0.092). The seven models with ∆ AIC
  <sub>C</sub> &lt; 2 all contained a positive relationship between fledging failure and FEC, in addition to the additive effects of hatch day and tarsus length (
  <a rid="pone.0125773.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0125773.s003">S2 Table</a>). The highest ranked model which included infection status (rank = 148, ∆ AIC
  <sub>C</sub> = 11.51), contained an uncertain estimate of the relationship between fledging failure and maternal infection status (0.235 ± 0.311).

   <p>The relationship between fledgling failure (i.e. probability that eggs fail to develop into fledglings) over a 11-day interval with maternal faecal egg count (FEC) of the parasite 
    <span class="italic">Syngamus trachea</span> in house sparrows on the island of Hestmannøy, northern Norway. The solid line indicates predicted values from the highest ranked generalized linear mixed model as judged by AIC
    <sub>C</sub> (see 
    <a rid="pone.0125773.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0125773.s003">S2 Table</a>). The model included individual identity as a random factor, and maternal tarsus length and hatch day as fixed covariates. Dotted lines indicate lower and upper limits of the 95% confidence interval of predicted values. “Sunflower” points indicate sample size of observed values.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recruitment failure was best explained by a model that contained only the intercept; i.e. none of the explanatory variables were included. However there were eight other candidate models which did not obtain a substantially higher AIC
  <sub>C</sub> value (∆ AIC
  <sub>C</sub> &lt; 2) compared to the highest ranked model (
  <a rid="pone.0125773.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0125773.s004">S3 Table</a>). Although one of these models contained FEC of the mother, the age and wing length of the mother, and hatch day appeared to be of higher importance.
