  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adult and juvenile house sparrows were captured using mist nets. Upon first capture, they were banded with a metal ring engraved with a unique id-number and three plastic colour rings (two rings on each tarsus). Tarsus length (to nearest 0.01 mm), body mass (to nearest 0.1 g), bill (length and depth, to nearest 0.01 mm) and wing length (to nearest mm) were measured. A body condition index (BC) was estimated as the unstandardized residuals obtained by regressing body mass on tarsus length with a linear model (all years pooled), i.e. individual body mass accounting for the skeletal body size. Variation in measurements among fieldworkers was accounted for by obtaining a relationship between each individual fieldworker and the most experienced fieldworker by using general linear regression techniques (see [

In addition we visited nests at least once per week and counted the number of eggs and chicks and their age. When a house sparrow had been captured in a mist net, it was placed in a paper bag with a flat bottom and with a small hole at the top to prevent asphyxiation. The bird was placed in the paper bag as soon as possible after capture (1–5 minutes). A faecal sample was obtained by the bird defecating in the paper bag. The sample was then placed in a 1.5 mL cryo-tube filled with 1 mL of MilliQ H
   <sub>2</sub>O. The samples were stored at temperatures of 1–8°C until they could be analysed (max. 12 months after collection). Eggs of 
   <span class="italic">S</span>. 
   <span class="italic">trachea</span> stored for 12 months were found to be viable (i.e. L3-larvae could be cultivated successfully).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our first dataset was used for investigations of reproductive success of adult female house sparrows in a given clutch and consisted of observations of 257 eggs and 153 fledglings in 53 nests where all 53 mothers (46 unique birds) were sampled for faeces during the summer of 2007–2011 (01 May—15 August). Our second dataset was used to investigate individual lifetime reproductive success of female house sparrows and contained 55 faeces samples from 42 juvenile females collected in the summer and autumn of 2007–2009 (01 May—07 October).

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We first investigated the relationship between maternal infection and reproductive success measured as either clutch size (number of eggs), fledging failure or recruitment failure (first dataset, see above). To test if there was a mean difference between infected/non-infected mothers or a linear relationship with faecal egg count (FEC), we used maternal infection status (no/yes) or FEC as explanatory variables. We included females which had been captured and sampled during the period when their nest contained eggs or chicks. This period corresponds to hatch date ± 14 days, as egg laying and incubation may take 14 days [
    <a rid="pone.0125773.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref028">28</a>] and chicks generally leave the nest when they are 14 days old [
    <a rid="pone.0125773.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref028">28</a>]. In addition to infection status and FEC, we included clutch number, clutch size, hatch day, hatch day
    <span class="sup">2</span>, calendar year (as a factor) and the mothers; age, age
    <span class="sup">2</span> and morphology (BC, bill depth, bill length, tarsus length and wing length) as explanatory variables. Because 6 birds appeared as mothers more than once in our dataset, we used maternal identity as a random factor in all models in order to avoid pseudoreplication.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first analysis focused on the relationship between clutch size (measured as the number of eggs laid by a female) and infection. In this analysis we used the clutch size as the response variable in generalized linear mixed models (package lme4, function = glmer, family = poisson, link = log). In the second part of our first section, we investigated the probability of fledging failure measured as the proportion of eggs in a nest that failed to develop into fledglings (nestlings with age 9–13 days) by using generalized linear mixed models (package lme4, function = glmer, family = binomial, link = cloglog). In these models, we also included the age of fledglings (9–13) as an offset in all models to account for differences in survival intervals from egg to fledgling [
    <a rid="pone.0125773.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref034">34</a>]. We also weighted the proportion of fledgling failure in a given nest by the number of eggs present in the nest (i.e. number of trials). Lastly in our first section, we investigated the probability of fledglings failing to become recruits (i.e. probability of fledglings in a given nest that failed to survive their first winter) by using generalized linear mixed models (package lme4, function = glmer, family = binomial, link = cloglog). We only included nests that produced fledglings (n = 51). We also weighted the proportion of recruitment failure in a given nest by the number of fledglings present in the nest (i.e. number of trials). We thus investigated if maternal infection could have a delayed relationship with mortality of offspring after fledging.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our second section of analyses investigated the relationship between female lifetime reproductive success (LRS) and their infection status or FEC as a juvenile. In these analyses we used our second dataset (see above) which was collected from captured female juveniles and only included female juveniles that survived to become adults. None of these individuals were observed or captured in 2013 and were assumed to be dead after 2012. Previous analyses [
    <a rid="pone.0125773.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref021">21</a>] have found a very high mean resighting probability (~ 0.9) on Hestmannøy. Accordingly, we assumed that the estimated total number of recruits produced per female 2007–2012 represented an estimate of the LRS for these individuals. For these analyses we used generalized linear models (function = glm, family = poisson, link = log) with LRS as the response variable. As explanatory variables we used FEC, infection status and juvenile morphology (BC, bill depth, bill length, tarsus length and wing length). In addition we included the lifespan (number of years) and the hatch year of individuals as explanatory variables.

In order to prevent any problems due to multicollinearity, all explanatory variables were assessed for collinearity visually, by the use of Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r

Due to the relatively small size of our datasets, we did not include interactions between explanatory variables in any models. We also did not allow FEC and infection status to feature together in the same candidate model(s) due to their collinearity.
