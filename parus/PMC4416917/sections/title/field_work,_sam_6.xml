 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adult and juvenile house sparrows were captured using mist nets. Upon first capture, they were banded with a metal ring engraved with a unique id-number and three plastic colour rings (two rings on each tarsus). Tarsus length (to nearest 0.01 mm), body mass (to nearest 0.1 g), bill (length and depth, to nearest 0.01 mm) and wing length (to nearest mm) were measured. A body condition index (BC) was estimated as the unstandardized residuals obtained by regressing body mass on tarsus length with a linear model (all years pooled), i.e. individual body mass accounting for the skeletal body size. Variation in measurements among fieldworkers was accounted for by obtaining a relationship between each individual fieldworker and the most experienced fieldworker by using general linear regression techniques (see [

In addition we visited nests at least once per week and counted the number of eggs and chicks and their age. When a house sparrow had been captured in a mist net, it was placed in a paper bag with a flat bottom and with a small hole at the top to prevent asphyxiation. The bird was placed in the paper bag as soon as possible after capture (1–5 minutes). A faecal sample was obtained by the bird defecating in the paper bag. The sample was then placed in a 1.5 mL cryo-tube filled with 1 mL of MilliQ H
  <sub>2</sub>O. The samples were stored at temperatures of 1–8°C until they could be analysed (max. 12 months after collection). Eggs of 
  <span class="italic">S</span>. 
  <span class="italic">trachea</span> stored for 12 months were found to be viable (i.e. L3-larvae could be cultivated successfully).

  <a rid="pone.0125773.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0125773.ref020">20</a>]. Due to the small volume of individual faecal samples and hence small variation in mass between them, all faecal samples were analysed in the same volume of sucrose solution. The sample was then centrifuged again at 151 g for 45 seconds [

  <span class="italic">trachea</span> were identified by their characteristic shape (bipolar and visible opercula at both ends) and size (approximately 80–100 μm × 50–60 μm) [

  <span class="italic">trachea</span> in the population of house sparrows has been confirmed by post-mortem examinations by the Norwegian Veterinary Institute (adult parasite- and egg morphology) of birds (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 2) that died during handling (prior to this study) due to blockage of the trachea by the parasite (Unpublished results). The repeatability (0.97) of the faecal egg counting procedure has been found to be very high [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our first dataset was used for investigations of reproductive success of adult female house sparrows in a given clutch and consisted of observations of 257 eggs and 153 fledglings in 53 nests where all 53 mothers (46 unique birds) were sampled for faeces during the summer of 2007–2011 (01 May—15 August). Our second dataset was used to investigate individual lifetime reproductive success of female house sparrows and contained 55 faeces samples from 42 juvenile females collected in the summer and autumn of 2007–2009 (01 May—07 October). Estimation of reproductive success was based on genetic parentage analyses of DNA from blood samples (see
