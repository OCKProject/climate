 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">LRS was best explained by a model that included the lifespan, juvenile FEC and bill depth of the individual female. LRS was highest for individuals with a long lifespan (0.416 ± 0.146), large juvenile bill depth (1.249 ± 0.567) and low juvenile FEC (- 0.066 ± 0.033, see 
  <a rid="pone.0125773.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0125773.g002">Fig 2</a> and 
  <a rid="pone.0125773.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0125773.s005">S4 Table</a>). All of the seven models with ∆ AIC
  <sub>C</sub> &lt; 2 contained the effect of lifespan and FEC. The highest ranked model which included infection status (rank = 14, ∆ AIC
  <sub>C</sub> = 2.57) contained a negative estimate of the relationship between juvenile infection and LRS (- 0.634 ± 0.357).

   <p>The predicted relationship between faecal egg count (FEC) of the parasite 
    <span class="italic">Syngamus trachea</span> and individual lifetime reproductive success of juvenile female house sparrows on the island of Hestmannøy, northern Norway, measured as the number of recruits produced in an individual’s lifetime. The solid line indicates predicted values from the highest ranked generalized linear mixed model as judged by AIC
    <sub>C</sub> (see 
    <a rid="pone.0125773.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0125773.s005">S4 Table</a>). Dotted lines indicate lower and upper limits of the 95% confidence interval of predicted values. “Sunflower” points indicate sample size of observed values (one observation omitted to improve clarity).
