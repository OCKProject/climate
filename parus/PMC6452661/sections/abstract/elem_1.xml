  <span class="italic">Crucihimalaya himalaica</span>, a close relative of 
  <span class="italic">Arabidopsis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Capsella</span>, grows on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP) about 4,000 m above sea level and represents an attractive model system for studying speciation and ecological adaptation in extreme environments. We assembled a draft genome sequence of 234.72 Mb encoding 27,019 genes and investigated its origin and adaptive evolutionary mechanisms. Phylogenomic analyses based on 4,586 single-copy genes revealed that 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> is most closely related to 
  <span class="italic">Capsella</span> (estimated divergence 8.8 to 12.2 Mya), whereas both species form a sister clade to 
  <span class="italic">Arabidopsis thaliana</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Arabidopsis lyrata</span>, from which they diverged between 12.7 and 17.2 Mya. LTR retrotransposons in 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> proliferated shortly after the dramatic uplift and climatic change of the Himalayas from the Late Pliocene to Pleistocene. Compared with closely related species, 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> showed significant contraction and pseudogenization in gene families associated with disease resistance and also significant expansion in gene families associated with ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and DNA repair. We identified hundreds of genes involved in DNA repair, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and reproductive processes with signs of positive selection. Gene families showing dramatic changes in size and genes showing signs of positive selection are likely candidates for 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span>’s adaptation to intense radiation, low temperature, and pathogen-depauperate environments in the QTP. Loss of function at the S-locus, the reason for the transition to self-fertilization of 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span>, might have enabled its QTP occupation. Overall, the genome sequence of 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> provides insights into the mechanisms of plant adaptation to extreme environments.
