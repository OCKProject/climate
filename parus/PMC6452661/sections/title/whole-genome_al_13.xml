 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We aligned the 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> genome to those of 
  <span class="italic">A. thaliana, A. lyrata</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">C. rubella</span> using LASTZ (
  <a rid="r93" ref-type="bibr" href="#r93">93</a>) with the following parameter values: M = 254 K = 4500 L = 3000 Y = 15000 -seed = match 12 -step = 20 -identity = 85. To avoid the interference caused by repetitive sequences for sequence alignment, RepeatMasker and RepBase library were used to mask repetitive sequences of the above four genomes. The raw alignments were combined into larger blocks using the ChainNet algorithm. We identified orthologous genes among the 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span>, 
  <span class="italic">A. thaliana</span>, 
  <span class="italic">A. lyrata</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">C. rubella</span> genomes and paralogous genes within 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> and other relatives using BLASTP (E value &lt; 1E-7). MCscanx (
  <a rid="r94" ref-type="bibr" href="#r94">94</a>) was used to identify syntenic blocks within the genome. For each gene pair in a syntenic block, the 4DTv distance was calculated; values of all gene pairs were plotted to identify putative whole-genome duplication events and divergence in two species.
