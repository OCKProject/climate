 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Orthologs that show signs of positive selection usually underwent adaptive divergence (
  <a rid="r47" ref-type="bibr" href="#r47">47</a>). Previously, we observed that the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS or ω) in 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> is higher than those of closely related species, suggestive of accelerated evolution in 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> after divergence from its ancestral lineage (
  <a rid="r4" ref-type="bibr" href="#r4">4</a>). In the present study, we conducted a positive selection analysis using the genomic sequences of 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> and four close relatives. Among the 21,383 orthogroups, 11,085 contained single-copy orthologous genes. We used the branch-site model of the PAML 4 package (
  <a rid="r35" ref-type="bibr" href="#r35">35</a>) to identify genes with signs of positive selection. As a result, 844 genes possibly under positive selection were identified in the 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> genome (ω &gt; 1, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05). Of these genes, 610 showed highly significant (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.01) positive selection (

   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Table S14
  </span>). A KEGG functional classification of the 610 significant PSGs in the 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> genome (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1817580116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Table S15
  </span>) showed that several categories associated with DNA repair, the ubiquitin system, as well as plant hormone biosynthesis and signal transduction were enriched. Genes involved in DNA repair were also identified as being under positive selection pressure in a previous transcriptomic study of 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> (
  <a rid="r4" ref-type="bibr" href="#r4">4</a>). It is notable that significantly expanded gene families and PSGs were both enriched in DNA repair and protein ubiquitination pathways. Signal transduction-related CheY-like genes were also found to have undergone both significant positive selection and expansion events in our previous study on the adaptive evolution of the cyanobacterium 
  <span class="italic">Trichormus</span> sp. NMC-1 on the QTP (
  <a rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" href="#r3">3</a>), again providing evidence that expansion/duplication and (subsequent) positive selection of genes are an important mechanism for plant adaptive evolution.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The extremely intense UV radiation on the QTP may influence plant growth and developmental processes such as photoperiodism and flowering, or cause DNA, RNA, and protein damage (
  <a rid="r48" ref-type="bibr" href="#r48">48</a>). Our results showed that 10 PSGs in the 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> genome are involved in the DNA repair pathway (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1817580116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Table S15
  </span>). Notably, several genes in the nucleotide excision repair pathway showed signatures of positive selection. One of them encodes the DNA excision repair protein ERCC-1 (or UV hypersensitive 7), which was also identified previously (
  <a rid="r4" ref-type="bibr" href="#r4">4</a>) and is reported to function as a component of a structure-specific endonuclease that cleaves on the 5ʹ side of UV photoproducts in DNA (
  <a rid="r49" ref-type="bibr" href="#r49">49</a>). In addition to ERCC-1, we identified PSGs that encode the AP endonuclease 2 protein (APEX2), DNA polymerase delta subunit 2 (POLD2), DNA mismatch repair protein MLH1, and DNA repair and recombination protein RAD54 (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1817580116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Table S14
  </span>). These PSGs are involved in base excision repair, mismatch excision repair, and homologous recombination, suggesting that 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> has evolved an integrated DNA-repair mechanism to adapt to the harsh habitats caused by the uplift of the QTP. Moreover, high UV-B radiation is a common stress that both animals and plants on the QTP must cope with. The DNA repair and radiation responses pathways similarly have played crucial roles in the highland adaptation of the Tibetan highland barley (
  <a rid="r6" ref-type="bibr" href="#r6">6</a>), Tibetan antelope (
  <a rid="r50" ref-type="bibr" href="#r50">50</a>), Tibetan chicken (
  <a rid="r51" ref-type="bibr" href="#r51">51</a>), and Tibetan hot-spring snake (
  <a rid="r52" ref-type="bibr" href="#r52">52</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analyses also indicated that ubiquitin system-related gene families underwent significant expansion and natural selection. Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis impacts almost every aspect of plant growth and development, including plant hormone signal transduction, photomorphogenesis, reproduction, and abiotic stress responses (
  <a rid="r53" ref-type="bibr" href="#r53">53</a>). Such a multifunctional biological process is of even greater importance for plants in the complex harsh environment on the QTP. Among the seven PSGs in the ubiquitin system based on the KEGG annotation, for instance, one encodes an ortholog of the COP10 protein in 
  <span class="italic">A. thaliana</span>, which can enhance the activity of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) (
  <a rid="r54" ref-type="bibr" href="#r54">54</a>) and participates in light signal transduction and photomorphogenesis (
  <a rid="r55" ref-type="bibr" href="#r55">55</a>). An additional PSG encodes the ortholog of the auxin transport protein BIG (E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase UBR4) in 
  <span class="italic">A. thaliana</span>, which not only influences multiple auxin-mediated developmental processes (e.g., lateral root production and inflorescence architecture) but also plays a critical role in a multitude of light and phytohormone pathways (
  <a rid="r56" ref-type="bibr" href="#r56">56</a>). These PSGs enriched in the ubiquitin system might be important for 
  <span class="italic">Crucihimalaya</span> to better survive the harsh environment in the QTP. Similarly, in three mangrove species, the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway includes 12 genes that have experienced convergent evolution at conservative sites, presumably important for adaptation of mangroves to the harsh coastal habitat (
  <a rid="r57" ref-type="bibr" href="#r57">57</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moreover, many of the identified PSGs were associated with reproduction pathways (92 PSGs, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 5.40E-06) based on GO annotation (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1817580116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Table S16
  </span>). One of the PSGs encodes the phytochrome and flowering time regulatory protein 1 (PFT1), which represses the PhyB-mediated light signaling and regulates the expression of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and CONSTANS (CO) (
  <a rid="r58" ref-type="bibr" href="#r58">58</a>, 
  <a rid="r59" ref-type="bibr" href="#r59">59</a>). In a low-red to far-red ratio environment, plants require CO and FT to fully accelerate flowering in long days (
  <a rid="r58" ref-type="bibr" href="#r58">58</a>, 
  <a rid="r59" ref-type="bibr" href="#r59">59</a>). PFT1 acts as a hub to integrate a variety of interdependent environmental stimuli, including light quality and jasmonic acid-dependent defense responses. An additional gene encodes TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1), which controls inflorescence meristem identity and regulates flowering time in the long-day flowering pathway. As the QTP experiences a long sunshine duration and a short vegetation growing season, flowering time is particularly critical and affects both the life cycles and reproductive success of many alpine plants (
  <a rid="r60" ref-type="bibr" href="#r60">60</a>). In the wild, 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> initiates flowering relatively early (April). However, this species rarely blossoms in low-altitude areas outside the QTP. These observations suggest that 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> has evolved specific reproductive strategies on photoperiodism and flowering-related pathways as an adaptation to the long sunshine duration and short growing season on the QTP.
