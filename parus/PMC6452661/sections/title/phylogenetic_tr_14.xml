 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We selected genomes of 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> and eight other species (
  <span class="italic">A. thaliana</span>, 
  <span class="italic">A. lyrata</span>, 
  <span class="italic">C. rubella</span>, 
  <span class="italic">C. hirsuta</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Eutrema salsugineum</span>, 
  <span class="italic">B. rapa</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Schrenkiella parvula</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Aethionema arabicum</span>) to identify orthologs. To remove redundancy caused by alternative splicing variations, we retained only gene models at each gene locus that encoded the longest protein sequence. To exclude putative fragmented genes, genes encoding protein sequences shorter than 50 aa were filtered out. All filtered protein sequences of these plants were compared with each other using BLASTP (E value &lt; 1E-7) and clustered into orthologous groups using OrthoMCL (inflation parameter, 1.5) (
  <a rid="r33" ref-type="bibr" href="#r33">33</a>). Protein sequences from 4,586 single-copy gene families were used for phylogenetic tree construction. MUSCLE (
  <a rid="r95" ref-type="bibr" href="#r95">95</a>) was used to generate multiple sequence alignment for protein sequences in each single-copy family with default parameters. The alignments of each family were concatenated to a super alignment matrix, which was then used for phylogenetic tree reconstruction through the PROTCATJTT model in RAxML software.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Divergence time between nine species was estimated using MCMCtree in PAML (
  <a rid="r35" ref-type="bibr" href="#r35">35</a>) with the options “independent rates” and “GTR” model. A Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis was run for 10,000 generations, using a burn-in of 1,000 iterations. Three calibration points were applied based on a recent study using 53 plastomes of Brassicales: 
  <span class="italic">A. arabicum</span> and other crucifers divergence time (29.0 to 41.8 Mya), core Brassicaceae origination time (21.3 to 29.8 Mya), and core 
  <span class="italic">Arabidopsis</span> origination time (4.8 to 9.7 Mya) (
