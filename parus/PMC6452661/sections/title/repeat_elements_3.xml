 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Compared with the genome size of closely related species, such as 
  <span class="italic">C. rubella</span> (which has an assembled genome size of 134.8 Mb, whereas the genome size estimated from flow cytometry was 219 Mb) (
  <a rid="r18" ref-type="bibr" href="#r18">18</a>) and 
  <span class="italic">A. thaliana</span> [125 Mb (
  <a rid="r19" ref-type="bibr" href="#r19">19</a>) and the estimated genome size of the reference accession Col-0 from flow cytometry is 166 Mb (
  <a rid="r20" ref-type="bibr" href="#r20">20</a>)], the 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> genome is considerably larger. It has been well documented that polyploidization (whole-genome duplication, WGD) events and transposable element (TE) amplification are major causes of genome expansion (
  <a rid="r21" ref-type="bibr" href="#r21">21</a>, 
  <a rid="r22" ref-type="bibr" href="#r22">22</a>). Analyses of age distributions built from transversion substitutions at fourfold degenerate sites (4DTv) indicated that, except for the α (4DTv distance = ∼0.3) and β (4DTv distance = ∼0.6) polyploidy events shared among members of the Brassicaceae (
  <a rid="r23" ref-type="bibr" href="#r23">23</a>), 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> has not undergone an additional species-specific WGD event (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2
   <span class="italic">A</span>
  </a>). Next, we investigated the content and evolutionary history of TEs in 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span>. Using de novo prediction of TEs (
  <a ref-type="sec" rid="s9" href="#s9">
   <span class="italic">Materials and Methods</span>
  </a>), we identified and marked 46.91% of the assembly as repeat regions, among which TEs occupied 45.78% of the genome assembly length (

  <span class="italic">A. lyrata</span> and 
  <span class="italic">A. thaliana</span> (29.7% and 23.7%, respectively) (
  <a rid="r24" ref-type="bibr" href="#r24">24</a>). This was also apparent in a CIRCOS genomic comparison plot, which showed that the density of TEs in 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> was higher than that in 
  <span class="italic">A. thaliana</span> or 
  <span class="italic">C. rubella</span>, whereas the density of genes in 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> was lower than that in 
  <span class="italic">A. thaliana</span> or

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In particular, a high proportion of TEs in 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> were LTR retrotransposons (30.37%), whereas other retrotransposons (short and long interspersed nuclear elements) only constituted 3.31% collectively (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1817580116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Table S10
  </span>). The retrotransposon proliferation might be responsible for the genome-size expansion in 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span>. To investigate the evolutionary dynamics of LTR retrotransposons, we estimated their insertion dates in four closely related species (
  <a ref-type="sec" rid="s9" href="#s9">
   <span class="italic">Materials and Methods</span>
  </a>). Compared with 
  <span class="italic">A. thaliana</span>, which shows a large number of microdeletions in noncoding DNA and transposons (
  <a rid="r24" ref-type="bibr" href="#r24">24</a>), 
  <span class="italic">A. lyrata</span> has a comparatively high proportion of recent insertions (
  <a rid="r18" ref-type="bibr" href="#r18">18</a>) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2
   <span class="italic">B</span>
  </a>), possibly contributing to its larger genome size (207 Mb). The proliferation of LTR retrotransposons in 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2
   <span class="italic">B</span>

   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S4 and Table S11
  </span>) peaks at ∼2.0 Mya, shortly after the dramatic elevational and climatic changes of the QTP between the late Miocene and late Pliocene (
  <a rid="r1" ref-type="bibr" href="#r1">1</a>, 
  <a rid="r13" ref-type="bibr" href="#r13">13</a>). The activity of TEs (including LTR retrotransposons) can lead to diverse genetic changes (e.g., chromosomal rearrangements and gene duplication, creation, and disruption) that may drive lineage-specific diversification and adaptation (
  <a rid="r25" ref-type="bibr" href="#r25">25</a>, 
  <a rid="r26" ref-type="bibr" href="#r26">26</a>). We therefore hypothesize that the proliferation of LTR retrotransposons likely contributed to the diversification, speciation, and adaptation of 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span>, similar to the proliferation of 
  <span class="italic">BARE</span>-1 retrotransposons in wild barley (
  <a rid="r27" ref-type="bibr" href="#r27">27</a>) and 
  <span class="italic">DIRS1</span> retrotransposons in Antarctic teleost (
  <a rid="r28" ref-type="bibr" href="#r28">28</a>), which might have facilitated the adaptation of plants to drier slopes and subzero temperatures, respectively. Another example from apples involves a major burst of retrotransposons ∼21.0 Mya, which coincided with the uplift of the Tianshan mountains, the postulated center of origin of apples (
  <a rid="r29" ref-type="bibr" href="#r29">29</a>).
