 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We selected four close relatives (
  <span class="italic">A. thaliana</span>, 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">lyrata</span>, 
  <span class="italic">C. rubella</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">C. hirsuta</span>) of 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> to identify orthogroups (gene families). Expansions and contractions of orthologous gene families were determined using CAFÃ‰ v. 4.1 (
  <a rid="r96" ref-type="bibr" href="#r96">96</a>). The program uses a birth and death process to model gene gain and loss over a phylogeny. For each significantly expanded and contracted gene family in 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span>, functional information was inferred based on its ortholog in 
  <span class="italic">A. thaliana</span>. GO enrichment analyses of genes were conducted using web-based agriGO (

  <a rid="r97" ref-type="bibr" href="#r97">97</a>) with the singular enrichment analysis method and TAIR10 database. The KOBAS and BlastKOALA software (
  <a rid="r98" ref-type="bibr" href="#r98">98</a>) was also used to test the statistical enrichment of genes in KEGG pathways (
