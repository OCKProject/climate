   <a rid="r38" ref-type="bibr" href="#r38">38</a>). The tribe Crucihimalayeae is mainly distributed in Central Asia, with one species (
   <span class="italic">Transberingia bursifolia</span>) extending into North America. Therefore, we speculate that the ancestor of 
   <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> dispersed from Central Asia into the Himalayas, and speciation of 
   <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> was likely triggered by the rapid uplift of the Himalayas, which resulted in the evolution of specialized phenotypic and physiological characters as adaptations to the extreme environment (discussed further below).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gene Family Expansion and Contraction.</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Significant expansion or contraction in the size of particular gene families is often associated with the adaptive divergence of closely related species (
   <a rid="r39" ref-type="bibr" href="#r39">39</a>, 
   <a rid="r40" ref-type="bibr" href="#r40">40</a>). Comparisons of the genomes of

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2
    <span class="italic">D</span>
   </a>) identified a total of 151 gene families that are significantly (
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.01) expanded in 
   <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> and 89 gene families that are significantly contracted (
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1817580116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
    <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Table S13
   </span>). Based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) annotations, expanded gene families were highly enriched in ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) activity (
   <span class="italic">P</span> = 7.17E-40) and DNA repair pathways (
   <span class="italic">P</span> = 1.45E-12) (
   <a rid="t02" ref-type="table" href="#t02">Table 2</a>). It is notable that the most significantly contracted gene families in the 
   <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> genome were found to be functionally related to disease and immune responses, such as the Toll-like receptor and NF-κB signaling pathway (
   <a rid="t02" ref-type="table" href="#t02">Table 2</a>). The majority of bacteria interact with Toll-like receptors on the surface of the host cell membrane, stimulating the NF-κB signaling pathway in the immune response (
   <a rid="r41" ref-type="bibr" href="#r41">41</a>). The Toll and interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) is an N-terminal component of the nucleotide-binding site (NBS) disease resistance protein family, which includes the TIR-NBS-LRR (TNL) and CC-NBS-LRR (CNL) subfamilies. In the 
   <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> genome, both TNL and CNL subfamilies underwent severe contractions compared with their close relatives (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3
    <span class="italic">A</span>
   </a>). In particular, disease resistance RPP8-like proteins (belonging to CNL) have undergone the most significant contraction in the 
   <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> genome (6 vs. 16∼29 members, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> = 1.26E-10). These proteins are major players in plant defense against pathogens by triggering hypersensitive responses (
   <a rid="r42" ref-type="bibr" href="#r42">42</a>). The rapid evolutionary expansion or contraction of the NBS gene family may be a fundamental strategy for plants to adapt to the rapidly changing species-specific pathogen spectrum (
   <a rid="r43" ref-type="bibr" href="#r43">43</a>, 
   <a rid="r44" ref-type="bibr" href="#r44">44</a>). As fewer microorganisms exist on the QTP owing to the harsh environments characterized by cold temperatures, aridity, and high UV radiation (
   <a rid="r45" ref-type="bibr" href="#r45">45</a>), it is reasonable to presume that the reduction in number of NBS genes in the 
   <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> genome is due to a lighter load of pathogens present in the environment and therefore the scarcity of pathogen infection on the QTP. We performed additional searches for NBS pseudogenes, which were assumed to have frameshift mutations and/or premature stop codons. Only one pseudogene could be found in 
   <span class="italic">A. thaliana</span> and 
   <span class="italic">A. lyrata</span>, but 20, 15, and 7 NBS pseudogenes could be identified in the 
   <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span>, 
   <span class="italic">C. rubella</span>, and 
   <span class="italic">C. hirsuta</span> genomes, respectively (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3
    <span class="italic">B</span>
   </a>). Therefore, pseudogenization of NBS disease resistance genes in 
   <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> is at least partly responsible for the contraction of this gene family. Similar observations were made for the genome of the ground tit (
   <span class="italic">Parus humilis</span>), native to the QTP, where MHC genes involved in the cellular immune defense against pathogens also show significant contractions (
   <a rid="r46" ref-type="bibr" href="#r46">46</a>). Although the mechanism of MHC gene evolution in ground tit remains unclear, it is worth noting that both ground tit and 
   <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> show a convergent evolution with respect to the contraction of gene families involved in defense against pathogens.

Genes involved in DNA repair were also identified as being under positive selection pressure in a previous transcriptomic study of 
   <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> (
   <a rid="r4" ref-type="bibr" href="#r4">4</a>). It is notable that significantly expanded gene families and PSGs were both enriched in DNA repair and protein ubiquitination pathways. Signal transduction-related CheY-like genes were also found to have undergone both significant positive selection and expansion events in our previous study on the adaptive evolution of the cyanobacterium 
   <span class="italic">Trichormus</span> sp. NMC-1 on the QTP (
   <a rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" href="#r3">3</a>), again providing evidence that expansion/duplication and (subsequent) positive selection of genes are an important mechanism for plant adaptive evolution.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The extremely intense UV radiation on the QTP may influence plant growth and developmental processes such as photoperiodism and flowering, or cause DNA, RNA, and protein damage (
   <a rid="r48" ref-type="bibr" href="#r48">48</a>). Our results showed that 10 PSGs in the 
   <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> genome are involved in the DNA repair pathway (
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1817580116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
    <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Table S15
   </span>). Notably, several genes in the nucleotide excision repair pathway showed signatures of positive selection. One of them encodes the DNA excision repair protein ERCC-1 (or UV hypersensitive 7), which was also identified previously (
   <a rid="r4" ref-type="bibr" href="#r4">4</a>) and is reported to function as a component of a structure-specific endonuclease that cleaves on the 5ʹ side of UV photoproducts in DNA (
   <a rid="r49" ref-type="bibr" href="#r49">49</a>). In addition to ERCC-1, we identified PSGs that encode the AP endonuclease 2 protein (APEX2), DNA polymerase delta subunit 2 (POLD2), DNA mismatch repair protein MLH1, and DNA repair and recombination protein RAD54 (
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1817580116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
    <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Table S14
   </span>). These PSGs are involved in base excision repair, mismatch excision repair, and homologous recombination, suggesting that 
   <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> has evolved an integrated DNA-repair mechanism to adapt to the harsh habitats caused by the uplift of the QTP. Moreover, high UV-B radiation is a common stress that both animals and plants on the QTP must cope with. The DNA repair and radiation responses pathways similarly have played crucial roles in the highland adaptation of the Tibetan highland barley (
   <a rid="r6" ref-type="bibr" href="#r6">6</a>), Tibetan antelope (
   <a rid="r50" ref-type="bibr" href="#r50">50</a>), Tibetan chicken (

   <a rid="r52" ref-type="bibr" href="#r52">52</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analyses also indicated that ubiquitin system-related gene families underwent significant expansion and natural selection. Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis impacts almost every aspect of plant growth and development, including plant hormone signal transduction, photomorphogenesis, reproduction, and abiotic stress responses (
   <a rid="r53" ref-type="bibr" href="#r53">53</a>). Such a multifunctional biological process is of even greater importance for plants in the complex harsh environment on the QTP. Among the seven PSGs in the ubiquitin system based on the KEGG annotation, for instance, one encodes an ortholog of the COP10 protein in 
   <span class="italic">A. thaliana</span>, which can enhance the activity of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) (
   <a rid="r54" ref-type="bibr" href="#r54">54</a>) and participates in light signal transduction and photomorphogenesis (
   <a rid="r55" ref-type="bibr" href="#r55">55</a>). An additional PSG encodes the ortholog of the auxin transport protein BIG (E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase UBR4) in 
   <span class="italic">A. thaliana</span>, which not only influences multiple auxin-mediated developmental processes (e.g., lateral root production and inflorescence architecture) but also plays a critical role in a multitude of light and phytohormone pathways (
   <a rid="r56" ref-type="bibr" href="#r56">56</a>). These PSGs enriched in the ubiquitin system might be important for 
   <span class="italic">Crucihimalaya</span> to better survive the harsh environment in the QTP. Similarly, in three mangrove species, the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway includes 12 genes that have experienced convergent evolution at conservative sites, presumably important for adaptation of mangroves to the harsh coastal habitat (
   <a rid="r57" ref-type="bibr" href="#r57">57</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moreover, many of the identified PSGs were associated with reproduction pathways (92 PSGs, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> = 5.40E-06) based on GO annotation (
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1817580116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
    <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Table S16
   </span>). One of the PSGs encodes the phytochrome and flowering time regulatory protein 1 (PFT1), which represses the PhyB-mediated light signaling and regulates the expression of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and CONSTANS (CO) (
   <a rid="r58" ref-type="bibr" href="#r58">58</a>, 
   <a rid="r59" ref-type="bibr" href="#r59">59</a>). In a low-red to far-red ratio environment, plants require CO and FT to fully accelerate flowering in long days (
   <a rid="r58" ref-type="bibr" href="#r58">58</a>, 
   <a rid="r59" ref-type="bibr" href="#r59">59</a>). PFT1 acts as a hub to integrate a variety of interdependent environmental stimuli, including light quality and jasmonic acid-dependent defense responses. An additional gene encodes TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1), which controls inflorescence meristem identity and regulates flowering time in the long-day flowering pathway. As the QTP experiences a long sunshine duration and a short vegetation growing season, flowering time is particularly critical and affects both the life cycles and reproductive success of many alpine plants (
   <a rid="r60" ref-type="bibr" href="#r60">60</a>). In the wild, 
   <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> initiates flowering relatively early (April). However, this species rarely blossoms in low-altitude areas outside the QTP. These observations suggest that 
   <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> has evolved specific reproductive strategies on photoperiodism and flowering-related pathways as an adaptation to the long sunshine duration and short growing season on the QTP.

   <span class="italic">C. himalaica.</span>
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Self-incompatibility in Brassicaceae is controlled by the S-locus recognition system, which prevents self-fertilization (
   <a rid="r61" ref-type="bibr" href="#r61">61</a>, 
   <a rid="r62" ref-type="bibr" href="#r62">62</a>). Whereas self-fertilization often leads to decreased fitness of homozygous offspring, it also ensures reproduction in absence of pollinators or suitable mates, and therefore can be advantageous for plants to expand their distribution edges and occupy new niches (
   <a rid="r63" ref-type="bibr" href="#r63">63</a>, 
   <a rid="r64" ref-type="bibr" href="#r64">64</a>). The QTP is characterized by harsh conditions including a short growing season and low pollinator activities. Therefore, it is not surprising that 
   <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> is a selfing plant (
   <a rid="r9" ref-type="bibr" href="#r9">9</a>). The 
   <span class="italic">Arabidopsis</span>/
   <span class="italic">Capsella</span>-like S-locus contains the female specificity gene (S-receptor kinase, SRK) and the male specificity gene (S-locus cysteine-rich protein, SCR) (
   <a rid="r65" ref-type="bibr" href="#r65">65</a>). Self-compatibility is achieved when the SRK receptor fails to recognize the SCR ligand, usually through a loss of SCR function (
   <a rid="r66" ref-type="bibr" href="#r66">66</a>
   <a href="#r67">*</a>
   <a href="#r68">*</a>–
   <a rid="r69" ref-type="bibr" href="#r69">69</a>). We manually annotated the S-locus flanking genes (
   <span class="italic">AKR3</span> and 
   <span class="italic">U-box</span>) and the 
   <span class="italic">SCR</span> gene on scaffold 29 of the 
   <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> genome assembly. Alignment of 
   <span class="italic">Crucihimalaya SCR</span> coding sequences with homologs from miscellaneous 
   <span class="italic">Arabidopsis halleri</span>, 
   <span class="italic">A. lyrata</span>, 
   <span class="italic">A. thaliana</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Capsella grandiflora</span>, 
   <span class="italic">C. rubella</span>, and 
   <span class="italic">C. hirsuta</span> S-locus haplotypes showed that the closest haplotype to 
   <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> was the one from 
   <span class="italic">A. halleri S15</span> (

    <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S5

   <a rid="r66" ref-type="bibr" href="#r66">66</a>, 
   <a rid="r68" ref-type="bibr" href="#r68">68</a>, 
   <a rid="r70" ref-type="bibr" href="#r70">70</a>, 
   <a rid="r71" ref-type="bibr" href="#r71">71</a>). Note that, due to strong balancing selection on the S-locus, highly diverged S-alleles are shared across species and 
   <span class="italic">SCR</span> gene phylogeny does not follow species phylogeny (
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1817580116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
    <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S5
   </span>) (
   <a rid="r72" ref-type="bibr" href="#r72">72</a>, 
   <a rid="r73" ref-type="bibr" href="#r73">73</a>). SCR protein sequence alignment showed that 
   <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> appears to have lost two out of eight conserved cysteines (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">Fig. 4
    <span class="italic">A</span>
   </a>) that are essential for structural and functional integrity of SCR ligand (
   <a rid="r66" ref-type="bibr" href="#r66">66</a>, 
   <a rid="r74" ref-type="bibr" href="#r74">74</a>). This alone may explain the transition to self-fertilization in 
   <span class="italic">C. himalaica.</span> Interestingly, neither 
   <span class="italic">SRK</span> from the S15 haplogroup nor any other 
   <span class="italic">SRK</span> had a BLAST hit to the 
   <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> genome (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">Fig. 4
    <span class="italic">B</span>
   </a>). To investigate whether SRK is indeed lost from the genome, we mapped short reads (450-bp insert size library) of 
   <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> to the combination of the 
   <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> genome assembly and 
   <span class="italic">A. halleri</span> S15 haplogroup of S-locus. The 
   <span class="italic">SRK</span> gene region did not have any reads mapped, and therefore we conclude that 
   <span class="italic">SRK</span> is not present in the 
   <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> genome and likely has been lost. Taken together, we reason that the transition to self-compatibility of 
   <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> was accomplished by both (
   <span class="italic">i</span>) loss of function in the male recognition gene 
   <span class="italic">SCR</span> and (
   <span class="italic">ii</span>) loss of the female recognition gene 
   <span class="italic">SRK</span>. It is often suggested that self-fertilization rates of alpine plants increase at higher altitudes (
   <a rid="r75" ref-type="bibr" href="#r75">75</a>), due to the reduction in pollinator abundance and seed production in alpine plants (
   <a rid="r76" ref-type="bibr" href="#r76">76</a>, 
   <a rid="r77" ref-type="bibr" href="#r77">77</a>). This suggestion is consistent with the fact that self-fertilizing populations also exist in 
   <span class="italic">Arabis alpina,</span> a close relative of 
   <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> that grows at high altitudes (
   <a rid="r78" ref-type="bibr" href="#r78">78</a>, 
   <a rid="r79" ref-type="bibr" href="#r79">79</a>). Moreover, previous studies also found that the rate of self-fertilizing hermaphroditic plants is increasing on the QTP and autonomous self-fertilization provides substantial reproductive assurance in the pollinator scarcity condition of the QTP (
   <a rid="r80" ref-type="bibr" href="#r80">80</a>, 
   <a rid="r81" ref-type="bibr" href="#r81">81</a>). Therefore, the transition to a self-compatibility mating system in 
   <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> likely facilitated its occupation of the QTP.
