 <p content-type="flushleft" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Organisms that live on the QTP face a variety of abiotic stresses under the harsh environmental conditions and presumably have been subjected to a series of adaptive evolutionary changes. In the present study, we de novo-sequenced the genome of 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span>, a species exclusively found in the Himalayan region. Based on phylogenetic reconstruction and estimated divergence times, we propose that the speciation of 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> was triggered by the uplift of the QTP, mediated by genomic evolution to adapt to the altered environment. The proliferation of LTR retrotransposons may at least partly be responsible for the increased genome size of 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span>. The significant contraction and pseudogenization of NBS gene families reflect the strong reduction in pathogen incidence on the QTP. Gene families that underwent significant expansion and genes that show signs of positive selection are enriched in DNA repair and protein ubiquitination pathways, which probably reflect to the adaptation of 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> to high radiation, low temperature, and pathogen-depauperate environments on the QTP. Occupation of the QTP by 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> was likely facilitated by self-compatibility, which, as we have shown here, involved both male and female components of the recognition system. Both similarities (e.g., DNA repair and disease-resistance pathways) and differences (e.g., reproduction and plant hormone-related pathways) in adaptive mechanisms have been identified among plants and animals that grow at high altitudes. Although further experimental verification is needed, our results provide insights into how plants adapt to harsh and extreme environments.
