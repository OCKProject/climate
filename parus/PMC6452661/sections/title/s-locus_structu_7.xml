  <span class="italic">C. himalaica.</span>
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Self-incompatibility in Brassicaceae is controlled by the S-locus recognition system, which prevents self-fertilization (
  <a rid="r61" ref-type="bibr" href="#r61">61</a>, 
  <a rid="r62" ref-type="bibr" href="#r62">62</a>). Whereas self-fertilization often leads to decreased fitness of homozygous offspring, it also ensures reproduction in absence of pollinators or suitable mates, and therefore can be advantageous for plants to expand their distribution edges and occupy new niches (
  <a rid="r63" ref-type="bibr" href="#r63">63</a>, 
  <a rid="r64" ref-type="bibr" href="#r64">64</a>). The QTP is characterized by harsh conditions including a short growing season and low pollinator activities. Therefore, it is not surprising that 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> is a selfing plant (
  <a rid="r9" ref-type="bibr" href="#r9">9</a>). The 
  <span class="italic">Arabidopsis</span>/
  <span class="italic">Capsella</span>-like S-locus contains the female specificity gene (S-receptor kinase, SRK) and the male specificity gene (S-locus cysteine-rich protein, SCR) (
  <a rid="r65" ref-type="bibr" href="#r65">65</a>). Self-compatibility is achieved when the SRK receptor fails to recognize the SCR ligand, usually through a loss of SCR function (
  <a rid="r66" ref-type="bibr" href="#r66">66</a>
  <a href="#r67">*</a>
  <a href="#r68">*</a>â€“
  <a rid="r69" ref-type="bibr" href="#r69">69</a>). We manually annotated the S-locus flanking genes (
  <span class="italic">AKR3</span> and 
  <span class="italic">U-box</span>) and the 
  <span class="italic">SCR</span> gene on scaffold 29 of the 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> genome assembly. Alignment of 
  <span class="italic">Crucihimalaya SCR</span> coding sequences with homologs from miscellaneous 
  <span class="italic">Arabidopsis halleri</span>, 
  <span class="italic">A. lyrata</span>, 
  <span class="italic">A. thaliana</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Capsella grandiflora</span>, 
  <span class="italic">C. rubella</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">C. hirsuta</span> S-locus haplotypes showed that the closest haplotype to 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> was the one from 
  <span class="italic">A. halleri S15</span> (

   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S5
  </span>) (
  <a rid="r66" ref-type="bibr" href="#r66">66</a>, 
  <a rid="r68" ref-type="bibr" href="#r68">68</a>, 
  <a rid="r70" ref-type="bibr" href="#r70">70</a>, 
  <a rid="r71" ref-type="bibr" href="#r71">71</a>). Note that, due to strong balancing selection on the S-locus, highly diverged S-alleles are shared across species and 
  <span class="italic">SCR</span> gene phylogeny does not follow species phylogeny (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1817580116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S5
  </span>) (
  <a rid="r72" ref-type="bibr" href="#r72">72</a>, 
  <a rid="r73" ref-type="bibr" href="#r73">73</a>). SCR protein sequence alignment showed that 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> appears to have lost two out of eight conserved cysteines (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">Fig. 4
   <span class="italic">A</span>
  </a>) that are essential for structural and functional integrity of SCR ligand (
  <a rid="r66" ref-type="bibr" href="#r66">66</a>, 
  <a rid="r74" ref-type="bibr" href="#r74">74</a>). This alone may explain the transition to self-fertilization in 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica.</span> Interestingly, neither 
  <span class="italic">SRK</span> from the S15 haplogroup nor any other 
  <span class="italic">SRK</span> had a BLAST hit to the 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> genome (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">Fig. 4
   <span class="italic">B</span>
  </a>). To investigate whether SRK is indeed lost from the genome, we mapped short reads (450-bp insert size library) of 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> to the combination of the 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> genome assembly and 
  <span class="italic">A. halleri</span> S15 haplogroup of S-locus. The 
  <span class="italic">SRK</span> gene region did not have any reads mapped, and therefore we conclude that 
  <span class="italic">SRK</span> is not present in the 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> genome and likely has been lost. Taken together, we reason that the transition to self-compatibility of 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> was accomplished by both (
  <span class="italic">i</span>) loss of function in the male recognition gene 
  <span class="italic">SCR</span> and (
  <span class="italic">ii</span>) loss of the female recognition gene 
  <span class="italic">SRK</span>. It is often suggested that self-fertilization rates of alpine plants increase at higher altitudes (
  <a rid="r75" ref-type="bibr" href="#r75">75</a>), due to the reduction in pollinator abundance and seed production in alpine plants (
  <a rid="r76" ref-type="bibr" href="#r76">76</a>, 
  <a rid="r77" ref-type="bibr" href="#r77">77</a>). This suggestion is consistent with the fact that self-fertilizing populations also exist in 
  <span class="italic">Arabis alpina,</span> a close relative of 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> that grows at high altitudes (
  <a rid="r78" ref-type="bibr" href="#r78">78</a>, 
  <a rid="r79" ref-type="bibr" href="#r79">79</a>). Moreover, previous studies also found that the rate of self-fertilizing hermaphroditic plants is increasing on the QTP and autonomous self-fertilization provides substantial reproductive assurance in the pollinator scarcity condition of the QTP (
  <a rid="r80" ref-type="bibr" href="#r80">80</a>, 
  <a rid="r81" ref-type="bibr" href="#r81">81</a>). Therefore, the transition to a self-compatibility mating system in 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> likely facilitated its occupation of the QTP.
