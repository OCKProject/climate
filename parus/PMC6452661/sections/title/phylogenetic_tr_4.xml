 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies suggest that 
  <span class="italic">Crucihimalaya</span> forms an endemic genus in the Himalayas and is most closely related to 
  <span class="italic">Arabidopsis</span> (
  <a rid="r30" ref-type="bibr" href="#r30">30</a>, 
  <a rid="r31" ref-type="bibr" href="#r31">31</a>). However, our earlier phylogenetic analyses of transcriptome sequences found that 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> formed a clade sister to 
  <span class="italic">C. rubella</span> (
  <a rid="r4" ref-type="bibr" href="#r4">4</a>). Applying OrthoMCL (
  <a rid="r32" ref-type="bibr" href="#r32">32</a>) to nine published whole-genome sequences from Brassicaceae (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1817580116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Table S12
  </span>), we identified a total of 22,670 orthogroups. Among these orthogroups, 4,586 contained putative single-copy gene families. To verify the phylogenetic position of 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span>, we generated a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree with a trimmed and concatenated protein sequence alignment from 4,586 single-copy genes in nine species. The resulting phylogeny indicated that 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> was most closely related to 
  <span class="italic">C. rubella</span>, and that these two species in turn formed a clade with 
  <span class="italic">A. lyrata</span> and 
  <span class="italic">A. thaliana</span> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2
   <span class="italic">C</span>
  </a>), confirming our previous results (
  <a rid="r4" ref-type="bibr" href="#r4">4</a>)
  <sub>.</sub> The above-mentioned four genera (which are classified in the tribe Camelineae), together with the allied 
  <span class="italic">Cardamine hirsuta</span>, were often recognized as Lineage I or Clade A in previous phylogenetic studies (
  <a rid="r33" ref-type="bibr" href="#r33">33</a>, 
  <a rid="r34" ref-type="bibr" href="#r34">34</a>).

  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. rubella</span> were estimated to have diverged ∼10.6 (8.8 to 12.2) Mya in our analyses using MCMCtree (
  <a rid="r35" ref-type="bibr" href="#r35">35</a>) with three calibration points (
  <a ref-type="sec" rid="s9" href="#s9">
   <span class="italic">Materials and Methods</span>
  </a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2
   <span class="italic">C</span>
  </a>); the two species diverged from 
  <span class="italic">Arabidopsis</span> ∼14.6 (12.7 to 17.2) Mya and from 
  <span class="italic">Brassica rapa</span> ∼23.6 (20.9 to 27.8) Mya. These results are in agreement with previous estimates (
  <a rid="r11" ref-type="bibr" href="#r11">11</a>, 
  <a rid="r36" ref-type="bibr" href="#r36">36</a>). Given the absence of genomic information for the remaining species of 
  <span class="italic">Crucihimalaya</span>, we are unable to date the exact origin of 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span>, which was estimated previously at ∼3.56 Mya (
  <a rid="r11" ref-type="bibr" href="#r11">11</a>, 
  <a rid="r12" ref-type="bibr" href="#r12">12</a>). However, 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> must have evolved after the split with 
  <span class="italic">Capsella</span> and almost certainly less than 10.6 Mya. Such estimation is in accordance with the timing of the most recent rapid uplift of the QTP from late Miocene to late Pliocene (
  <a rid="r1" ref-type="bibr" href="#r1">1</a>, 
  <a rid="r13" ref-type="bibr" href="#r13">13</a>). The genus 
  <span class="italic">Crucihimalaya</span> is assigned to the tribe Crucihimalayeae, which includes two additional genera, 
  <span class="italic">Ladakiella</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Transberingia</span> (
  <a rid="r37" ref-type="bibr" href="#r37">37</a>, 
  <a rid="r38" ref-type="bibr" href="#r38">38</a>). The tribe Crucihimalayeae is mainly distributed in Central Asia, with one species (
  <span class="italic">Transberingia bursifolia</span>) extending into North America. Therefore, we speculate that the ancestor of 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> dispersed from Central Asia into the Himalayas, and speciation of 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> was likely triggered by the rapid uplift of the Himalayas, which resulted in the evolution of specialized phenotypic and physiological characters as adaptations to the extreme environment (discussed further below).
