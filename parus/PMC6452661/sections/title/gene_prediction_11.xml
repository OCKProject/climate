  <a rid="r84" ref-type="bibr" href="#r84">84</a>) to generate UTRs and provide information on alternative splicing variants. The predicted genes were analyzed for functional domains and homologs using InterProScan and BLAST against the NCBI nonredundant protein sequence database, TrEMBL and SwissProt with an E-value cutoff 1E-15 and Blast2GO with default parameters. Completeness of the genome was also assessed by performing core gene annotation using the BUSCO (
  <a rid="r17" ref-type="bibr" href="#r17">17</a>) methods. Transcription factors were identified and classified into different families using the iTAK pipeline (
