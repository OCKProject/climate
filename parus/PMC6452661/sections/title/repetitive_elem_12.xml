 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A combined strategy based on homologous sequence alignment and de novo searches was used to identify repeat elements in the 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> genome. We de novo predicted TEs using RepeatModeler (

  <a rid="r87" ref-type="bibr" href="#r87">87</a>) (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tlife.fudan.edu.cn/tlife/ltr_finder" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">tlife.fudan.edu.cn/tlife/ltr_finder</span>) with default parameters. For alignment of homologous sequences to identify repeats in the assembled genome, we used RepeatProteinMask and RepeatMasker (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.repeatmasker.org/" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.repeatmasker.org</span>) with the repbase library (
  <a rid="r88" ref-type="bibr" href="#r88">88</a>). TEs overlapping with the same type of repeats were integrated, while those with low scores were removed if they overlapped over 80% of their lengths and belonged to different types.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Intact LTR retrotransposons were identified by searching the genomes of 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> with LTRharvest (
  <a rid="r89" ref-type="bibr" href="#r89">89</a>) (-motif tgca -motifmis 1) and LTR_Finder (LTR length 100 to 5,000 nt; length between two LTRs: 1,000 to 2,0000 nt). We combined results from both analyses after integrating the overlap sites. Candidate sequences were filtered by a two-step procedure to reduce false positives. First, LTRdigest (
  <a rid="r90" ref-type="bibr" href="#r90">90</a>) was used to identify the primer binding site (PBS) motif, and only elements containing PBS were retained; then, protein domains (pol, gag, and env) in candidate LTR retrotransposons were identified by searching against HMM profiles considered as intact. Second, clustering of candidate LTR retrotransposons was performed using the SiLiX software package (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://lbbe.univ-lyon1.fr/SiLiX" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">lbbe.univ-lyon1.fr/SiLiX</span>). Using a substitution rate (r) of 7*10
  <span class="sup">−9</span> substitutions per site per year (
  <a rid="r91" ref-type="bibr" href="#r91">91</a>, 
  <a rid="r92" ref-type="bibr" href="#r92">92</a>), the insertion date (T) can be calculated for each LTR retrotransposons (T = K/2r, K: genetic distance). Tandemly repeated gene arrays were identified using BLASTP with a threshold E value &lt; 10
  <span class="sup">−8</span>; fragmental alignments were conjoined for each gene pair. The tandem repeat gene clusters were identified using a cutoff of sequence identity &gt;70% and distance &lt;150 kb. Each cluster with more than two genes was retained.
