  <span class="italic">Crucihimalaya himalaica</span> is a close relative of 
  <span class="italic">Arabidopsis</span> with typical Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP) distribution. Here, by combining short- and long-read sequencing technologies, we provide a de novo genome sequence of 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span>. Our results suggest that the quick uplifting of the QTP coincided with the expansion of repeat elements. Gene families showing dramatic contractions and expansions, as well as genes showing clear signs of natural selection, were likely responsible for 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span>’s specific adaptation to the harsh environment of the QTP. We also show that the transition to self-pollination of 
  <span class="italic">C. himalaica</span> might have enabled its occupation of the QTP. This study provides insights into how plants might adapt to extreme environmental conditions.
