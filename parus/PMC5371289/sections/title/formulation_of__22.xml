 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The combinations of 19 species with five phenological indicators led to 95 situations of potential species-specific phenological changes detection. Moreover, 46 situations of predator/prey interactions are documented. Accordingly, it was necessary to extract from those multiple situations an intelligible comparison of phenological and trophic situations among periods. We chose to summarize the information into the four previously mentioned trajectory scenarios of phenological evolution. The four trajectory were coded as “C”, “Ɔ”, “/”, and “\” and presented in a decision tree (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the phenological indicators T and quantiles 10, 50 and 90, the “/” corresponds to phenological precocity across periods. For the residence time and overlap, the “/” corresponds to an increase of both parameters across periods.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the phenological indicators T and quantiles 10, 50 and 90, the “\” corresponds to phenological delay across periods. For the residence time and overlap, the “\” corresponds to a decrease of both parameters across periods.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the phenological indicators T and quantiles 10, 50 and 90, the “C” corresponds to phenological precocity of the second period compared to the first and third periods, withhe third period presenting or not a similar situation than the first period. For the residence time and overlap, the “C” corresponds to a decrease in the second period compared to others, and a re-increase in the third period.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the phenological indicators T and quantiles 10, 50 and 90, the “Ɔ” corresponds to phenological delay of the second period compared to the first and third periods, the third period presenting or not a similar situation than the first period. For the residence time and overlap, the “Ɔ” corresponds to an increase in the second period compared to others, and a re-decrease in the third period.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Situations in which no phenological change was detected were noted with “NS” (No Significant changes).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The different situations of phenological evolution among the three periods P1, P2 and P3 are summarized into four trajectories [nomenclature given in the text]. The decision tree presented each trajectory with its code and an example (referred to the
