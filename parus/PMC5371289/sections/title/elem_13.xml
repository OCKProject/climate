 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phenological modifications were explored by estimating yearly patterns of abundance for each species and period. Those patterns were estimated using a flexible Bayesian model. Such a model was used because it facilitates uncertainty quantification and therefore the comparison among periods. Moreover, our model allows flexibility for the use of non-normally distributed data, as compared to normal distributions assumptions usually associated with other modeling techniques used in literature to model phenological event. Two questions were addressed using this approach: (i) did phenological modifications occur for each species individually and, if so, which kind of modifications (Early arrival? late departure? longer residence time?), (ii) what were the possible consequences of those modifications on trophic interactions, through the analysis of temporal overlap of estuarine residency between prey and predators? For both questions, we classified phenological and trophic situations into four trajectories (Figs

   <p>The red arrows correspond to peak of abundance of species for the period 1 to 3 (noted: P1, P2, P3). A) The annual peak of E. encrasicolus abundance shiftedf earlier in the year for the period two and three. B) The annual peak of A. regius abundance shifted later in the year for the period three. C) The annual peak of E. affinis shifted earlier in the year for the period two and returned near the first situation during the third period. D) The annual peak of S. sprattus shifted later in the year for the period two and returned near the first situation at the third period (note: for this species, only the first peak of presence in the estuary was considered).</p>
