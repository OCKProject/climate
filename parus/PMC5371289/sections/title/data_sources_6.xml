 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Daily estuary water discharge data were provided by the Bordeaux Port Authority (Bordeaux Port Atlantique). Air temperature data were provided by the Méteo France Center of Mérignac (data collected at the Pauillac meteorological station; middle estuary). These daily air temperature records were measured locally from 1985 to 2010, and are assumed herein to combine effects of global patterns and and local variations.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Salinity data were obtained from several routine monitoring programs of the Gironde estuary, including the Blayais nuclear power plant ecological survey (Irstea-EDF) and the SOMLIT monitoring program (Service d’Observation en Milieu Littoral, INSU-CNRS,

In the later program, water samples were collected monthly from March to November (at 1 m below the water surface and 1 m above the bottom, at 3 h intervals during the tidal cycle) in two sampling stations (E and F;
