 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We tested 95 cases (19 species x 5 phenological indicators) of potential phenological change. Amongst these 95 possible cases, 45.3% exhibited significant changes. Among the 19 species studied, five (L. ramada, A. Anguilla, O. eperlanus, P. flesus, and Solea sp.) exhibited no phenological modification. Regarding the first four indicators (central tendency, Q10, Q50 and Q90), we observed significant modifications of species’ patterns in almost half of the cases (27 upon 56) for fish and zooplankton (9 upon 20). In most cases (20 cases upon 27 for fish and 9 upon 9 for zooplankton), these changes are associated with earlier occurrences in period 3 compared to period 1 and/or 2 (/ and C patterns). These modifications were allocated for 23.15% to precocity symbols (/), 11.57% to earlier peak in period 2 (C), 6.3% to later peak in period 2 (Ɔ), and 4.6% to lag symbols (\). Considering only the “time of residence” indicator (19 cases), seven cases (37%) presented significant modifications, and all concerned fish. The most frequent modification was a decrease in the time of residence (the “/”symbol represented 42.7% of the 7 significant modifications). Among the five phenological indicators used, the indicators of central tendency and quantile 50 were those presenting the highest number of modifications. They were modified for 58% of species. Each of the three other indicators represented 7.4% of the total modifications and they were modified for 35% of species.</p>
