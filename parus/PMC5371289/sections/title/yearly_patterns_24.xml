  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0173752.s001" href="#pone.0173752.s001">S1 Fig</a>. Among the 19 species, 14 showed significant modifications of their yearly pattern (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0173752.s001" href="#pone.0173752.s001">S1 Fig</a>) for at least one indicator. The five phenological indicators and their credibility intervals used to characterize changes in yearly patterns are presented in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0173752.s003" href="#pone.0173752.s003">S3 Fig</a> and summarized in 
  <a rid="pone.0173752.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0173752.t002">Table 2</a>. To ensure that the observed significant changes did not occur by chance, we compared the number of observed changes with the theoretical number of changes that would have occurred only by chance. For each species/indicator couple, three pairwise differences were theoretically possible (period 1 ≠ period 2 ≠ period 3, except for A.regius which did not occur in the middle part of the estuary during the first period, so that only one difference was possible). A total of 55 pairwise differences (18 species * 3 pairwise comparisons = 54 + 1 species (Meager)* 1 pairwise comparison) were possible for each phenological indicator. The sum of pairwise comparisons counted for each indicators led respectively to 17, 9, 15, 10 and 10 differences (
  <a rid="pone.0173752.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0173752.t002">Table 2</a>). This corresponds to 30%, 16%, 27%, 18% and 18%, respectively, of the theoretical possible situations. All five indicators were therefore greater than the random threshold of 5%.
