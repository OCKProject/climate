  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref046">46</a>] previously reported significant long term trends for the three aforementioned hydro-climatic variables. They specifically observed a significant increase in air temperature and estuarine water salinity, which the authors associated to a decrease of water discharge. Meanwhile, these variables exhibited seasonal modifications (

  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref045">45</a>] especially related to conditions observed in spring, i.e., from March to May. Mean spring values of air temperature and salinity indeed increased after 1988 while mean spring river flow decreased.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The three columns correspond to the mean seasonal pattern of the air temperature, salinity and river flow, respectively, for each of the three periods considered in our study (period 1 1985–1988 top row: white boxplot, period 2 1989–2002 middle row: light-grey boxplot, and period 3 2003–2010 lower row: dark-grey boxplot). The thick line of the boxplot presents the median, the box to the first and third quartile and the whiskers to the 0.025 and 0.975 percentile. Horizontal dotted-line shows the mean value of the “spring months” (March, April and May) for the period considered.</p>
