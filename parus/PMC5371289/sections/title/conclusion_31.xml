 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present study confirmed that coastal and estuarine ecosystems can be heavily impacted by global change, affecting not only the structure of biological communities but also ecological patterns and phenology. This can lead to shifts in predator/prey relationships able to cause deep modifications in the structure and functioning of the food web. This can affect the ecological functions associated with estuarine areas for both marine and diadromous fish species. In particular, the synchronistic decrease in species’ residence time and fish predation potential could, in the future, threaten the sustainability of the nursery function of the estuary for many species.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although its situation is very illustrative of this current problem, the particular case of the Gironde estuary is somehow paradoxical. While studies have highlighted a deep modification in biodiversity during the last three decades [

  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref045">45</a>], the present study highlighted the mistiming of juvenile fish and their preferential prey in the Gironde estuary, associated with a decrease in residence time and potential mismatch in situations of predation. This situation questions the efficiency—and even the viability–of nursery functions of this system for fish, including marine species. As the Gironde estuary, because its size is one of the most important nursery grounds of the Bay of Biscay, this could have implication for coastal fisheries in this area.
