 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over the last few decades, many authors have reported ongoing biological effects of climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref001">1</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref006">6</a>] impacting species and their habitats and shaping the structure of ecological communities as well as overall functioning of ecosystems [
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref001">1</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref007">7</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref010">10</a>]
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among those effects, alterations of species phenology are assumed to have major consequences on ecosystems [
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref003">3</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref011">11</a>]. Phenology is defined as the timing of recurring (seasonal) animal and vegetal life cycle processes [
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref006">6</a>], including spawning, migrations, bud break, growth and flowering, in response to seasonal variations in their environment [see 
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref012">12</a> for a review]. The synchronization between biological processes and seasonal environmental fluctuations has crucial importance for individuals’ fitness, because most species generally rely on limited suitable environmental windows [
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref013">13</a>]. Most of these phenological events at the species scale are however particularly sensitive to climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref003">3</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref014">14</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref016">16</a>]. In particular, most aquatic animals are ectothermic and their biology and ecology are therefore driven by water temperature. An increase in temperature thus accelerates their metabolism. Consequently, until now, most studies have reported precocious occurrence of life cycle events as a response to climate change and temperature rise [
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref006">6</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref017">17</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref019">19</a>], either because of earlier favorable environmental conditions [see exemple of producers in 20,21] or because of phenological modifications in preys or predators dynamics [
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref022">22</a>]. The timing or, more specifically, the mismatch of species’ life cycle events with favorable environmental conditions, can have various implications at the community, assemblage, and species scales. The interactions between predators and prey at different levels within a food web indeed depend on spatial overlap and temporal synchrony. An increase in time-lag between predator and prey dynamics (occurrence and/or abundance) can lead to so-called mismatches described in the framework of the Match-mis Match Hypothesis (MMH) [
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref023">23</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the Match-mismatch hypothesis is prevalent in the literature, examples actually illustrating it in aquatic ecosystems remain scarce Many reports can be found from terrestrial species and food chains, like in the famous example of oak (
  <span class="italic">Quercus robur</span>), moth (
  <span class="italic">Opheroptera brumata</span>) and great tit (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) [
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref019">19</a>]. In aquatic environments, Philippart [
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref024">24</a>] described a mismatch between phytoplankton, bivalve (
  <span class="italic">Macoma balthica</span>) and shrimp (
  <span class="italic">Crangon crangon</span>) predation induced by mild winter’s temperature in northwestern European estuaries. The earlier spawning period of 
  <span class="italic">Macoma balthica</span> due to warmer temperature, caused a mismatch with the phytoplankton bloom (not related to temperature) which was then followed by a decrease of 
  <span class="italic">Macoma</span> food availability and consequentincreased mortality. Furthermore, precocious spawning 
  <span class="italic">Macoma</span> resulted in an increase of the predation pressure exerted by 
  <span class="italic">Crangon crangon</span>. In this example, the cold-water species 
  <span class="italic">Macoma</span> clearly highlights the vulnerability of some species to phenological changes. [
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref019">19</a>] Coastal environments, especially temperate ones, are considered among the most vulnerable to climate change pressure and mismatch risk [
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref017">17</a>]. It is therefore essential to examine potential phenological variations in these systems, as such variations can have substantial consequences on trophic relationships and coastal ecosystem functioning.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This question is even more pressing in estuarine ecosystems as they represent important nursery grounds for many juvenile fish. The question of potential climate change-induced match-mismatch between fish (predators) and plankton production (preys) in estuaries is therefore crucial. Recruitment at higher trophic levels is indeed sensitive both to the degree of synchronization with pulsed zooplanktonic production [
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref025">25</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref026">26</a>] as well as to the number of recruits becoming mature and joining fishing stocks. Furthermore, for most species, recruitment is also partly depends on an estuarine growth phase [
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref027">27</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref030">30</a>]. Ottersen [

  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref034">34</a>] explored the impacts of phenological mismatch on fish-plankton interactions in coastal areas. Other authors focused on phenological modifications in estuaries using a monospecific approach, for example for the larval herring (
  <span class="italic">Clupea harengus</span>) in the St Lawrence estuary [
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref035">35</a>] or the striped bass (
  <span class="italic">Morone saxatilis</span>) in Chesapeake Bay [
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref036">36</a>]. David [
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref037">37</a>] and Selleslagh [
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref038">38</a>], described the seasonal life-cycle of the main zooplankton and fish species, respectively, in the Gironde estuary. To our knowledge, no study has yet combined phenological species evolution with an analysis of its implications in an estuarine ecosystem context.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Gironde estuary is one of the largest macro-tidal estuaries in Western Europe [
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref039">39</a>], as well as being one of the main nursery area for juvenile marine fish from the Bay of Biscay [
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref029">29</a>]. It is also an important migratory corridor for various diadromous fish species (e.g.,

  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref039">39</a>]). Significant alterations in the Gironde estuary ecosystem structure and functioning have been documented and related to global changes [
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref037">37</a>,

  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref043">43</a>]. David [
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref037">37</a>] and Chaalali [
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref044">44</a>] put forward deep changes in the structure, abundance and dynamics of zooplankton and suprabenthic assemblages. Pasquaud [
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref045">45</a>] also highlighted significant changes in the structure and dynamics of assemblages of small pelagic fish (anchovy, sprat, and shad) in the middle part of the estuary. Chaalali [
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref046">46</a>], implementing a multivariate analysis of time series (Principal Component Analysis), described two abrupt ecosystem shifts between 1979 and 2009 (circa 1987 and 2001), in relation with hydro-climatic parameters. Chevillot [
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref010">10</a>], who focused on estuarine fishes, implemented both a multivariate and STARS (Sequential algorithm for testing climate regime shift) [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Zooplankton (copepods) and suprabenthic (mysids) species [
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref037">37</a>]) are key species in the Gironde estuarine food web [
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref048">48</a>]. In this context, moving further from Chevillot et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0173752.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0173752.ref010">10</a>], the present article aims at depicting phenological modifications between the aforementioned intershift periods for fish and zooplankton species and at assessing the potential resulting mismatches at a community scale. We focused on the 1985-2010time series. Phenological evolutions of considered species were analyzed by tracking changes in yearly patterns of abundance in long-term scientific survey data. These patterns were estimated using a Bayesian hierarchical model with hidden Markov process. Traditional phenological indicators were computed in this Bayesian context to characterize these changes. This allowed to us to describe changes in the time overlap of predator-prey couples in the estuarine area, leading to discuss implications of those changes and potential mismatch between prey and predators for the Gironde estuary food web dynamics.
