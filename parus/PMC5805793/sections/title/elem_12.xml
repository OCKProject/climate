 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even though some of the evolutionary factors underlying coping are becoming clear (see “
  <a rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec6">Why the early-life environment affects the development of coping</a>” section (Øverli et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR243" href="#CR243">2007</a>; Wolf et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR349" href="#CR349">2008</a>; Hengartner 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144" href="#CR144">2017</a>)), the developmental processes through which coping behaviours emerge have been studied to a much lesser degree (Stamps and Groothuis 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR297" href="#CR297">2010</a>; Groothuis and Trillmich 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133" href="#CR133">2011</a>), and the mechanisms leading to coping behaviours later in life are largely unexplored (Haun et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139" href="#CR139">2013</a>; Miranda 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR221" href="#CR221">2017</a>). Here, we review the literature to shed light on the way coping behaviours develop, by categorising the developmental processes impacted by environmental factors. We discuss six important biological processes that affect development of coping behaviours during the early years of life: maternal effects, filial imprinting, habituation, conditioning and social learning (see 
  <a ref-type="sec" rid="Sec31" href="#Sec31">Suppl. material</a>). We illustrate the relevance of those developmental processes shown to affect later-life coping behaviours, and illustrate key differences between them in onset and development where possible. In this, we do not consider (epi)genetic effects as a separate process but rather acknowledge that epigenetics may well play a mechanistic role in each of the processes detailed below, the details of which are already explained excellently elsewhere (Weaver et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR339" href="#CR339">2004</a>; McClelland et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR208" href="#CR208">2011</a>; Cowan et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" href="#CR80">2016</a>). For the same reason, we do not consider theoretical models, or empirical evidence of non-behavioural traits concerning these developmental processes. The most important processes were identified from the literature and discussed below.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Parental effects</div>
  <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Maternal effects, defined as the direct effect of a mother’s phenotype on that of her offspring (Bernardo 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">1996</a>; Reddon 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR258" href="#CR258">2012</a>), have been researched in detail both in animals and humans over the past decades. Developmentally, maternal effects relate to the need for developing systems to receive the appropriate (amount of) input. Depending on the quality and quantity of input received, the young develop or fail to develop a variety of phenotypic characteristics, including many coping behaviours. Maternal effects have been found across many species during the gestation period and after (Bernardo 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">1996</a>; Mousseau and Fox 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR231" href="#CR231">1998</a>) and have been studied with respect to hormones (Adkins-Regan et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">2013</a>), nutrition (Langley-Evans et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183" href="#CR183">2005</a>), behaviour (Weaver et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR339" href="#CR339">2004</a>), predator experience (Bell et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2016</a>; Freinschlag and Schausberger 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121" href="#CR121">2016</a>), birth weight (Taborsky 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR306" href="#CR306">2006a</a>) and maternal care (Champagne et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" href="#CR76">2003</a>; Champagne and Meaney 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" href="#CR77">2006</a>), or a combination of all of the above. More recently, paternal effects have received more interest as well, although compared to maternal effects, still much less is known regarding the role of paternal factors (Rodgers et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR268" href="#CR268">2013</a>). The most significant difference between maternal and paternal effects is the gestation period, during which the maternal phenotype is in intimate physical contact with that of the offspring, which allows for nourishment and hormones to pass from mother to child. Instead of separating between maternal and paternal effects, some studies consider the more generic parental effects (Uller 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR322" href="#CR322">2008</a>; Badyaev and Uller 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">2009</a>; Burgess and Marshall 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">2014</a>). The topic knows a rich literature of its own (reviewed in Badyaev and Uller 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">2009</a>; Reddon 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR258" href="#CR258">2012</a>) that falls outside our scope to review in its entirety.
  </p>
  <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Early-life influences that affect offspring coping behaviours through parental effects can be as straightforward as parental behaviour, although this is underrepresented in empirical studies. Parents can change key parameters of offspring’s regulatory system through their behaviour prior to and after the offspring’s experience of a stressor and, in this way, change the offspring’s experience of the stressor and the way its developmental processes are impacted (Tang et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR310" href="#CR310">2014</a>). Furthermore, cross-fostering experiments in zebra finches (
   <span class="italic">T. guttata</span>) showed that offspring exploratory type was predicted by exploratory type of the foster, but not the genetic parents (Schuett et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR279" href="#CR279">2013</a>). In addition, the amount and quality of parental care seems to strongly affect the development of effective coping behaviours (Budaev et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">1999</a>; Moons et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR225" href="#CR225">2005</a>). In convict cichlid (
   <span class="italic">Cichlasoma archocentrus</span>), parental activity during parental care was negatively correlated with the freezing versus activity factor in female offspring (Budaev et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">1999</a>). However, parental effects seem to be more complicated than a simple case of more care is better (Tang et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR310" href="#CR310">2014</a>). The predictability of parental sensory signals has been shown to affect cognitive development, with unpredictable maternal signals leading to poor cognitive performance in behavioural tests (Davis et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" href="#CR84">2017</a>). Beyond providing care and behavioural example, parental affects can prepare for fluctuating environments (Proulx and Teotónio 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR253" href="#CR253">2017</a>), mediate the impact of environmental input or stressors, as well as change the offspring’s experience of an environmental situation (Tang et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR310" href="#CR310">2014</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Especially maternal stress (Thornberry et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR314" href="#CR314">2009</a>) and maternal care (see “
   <a rid="Sec20" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec20">Parents</a>” section) have been shown to affect offspring coping behaviours (Champagne et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" href="#CR76">2003</a>; Fish et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118" href="#CR118">2004</a>). It is becoming increasingly evident that maternal exposure to adversity during pregnancy can lead to life-long effects in offspring (Matthews and Phillips 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR205" href="#CR205">2010</a>). For example, male offspring of stressed rat mothers were more active in maze tests and entered the open arms of the maze more often than male offspring of control mothers (Götz and Stefanski 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129" href="#CR129">2007</a>). The effects of maternal stress during pregnancy on behavioural outcomes in the first-generation offspring are thought to be highly dependent on species, sex and age (Sullivan et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR303" href="#CR303">2011</a>), as well as on the time in pregnancy when stress is experienced (Matthews and Phillips 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR205" href="#CR205">2010</a>), although this is predominantly studied in rodents at the moment.
  </p>
  <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There has been some discussion whether the effects that parents have on their offspring’s phenotype are necessarily adaptive (Uller et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR323" href="#CR323">2013</a>). Some maternal effects seem to have a clear adaptive advantage either for the mother, the offspring or both (Wells 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR340" href="#CR340">2007a</a>). For example, female western bluebirds (
   <span class="italic">Sialia mexicana</span>) increase androgen concentrations in their eggs as competition from their sister species increases, resulting in more aggressive male offspring that are more likely to disperse and create new colonies (Duckworth et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" href="#CR97">2015</a>).While a body of experimental work implies adaptive advantages to parental effects (Mousseau and Fox 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR231" href="#CR231">1998</a>; Marshall and Uller 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200" href="#CR200">2007</a>; Nätt et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR233" href="#CR233">2009</a>; Jensen et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157" href="#CR157">2014</a>) and the term maternal programming is being used increasingly to indicate mother’s active preparation of offspring for future circumstances (Fish et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118" href="#CR118">2004</a>; Weaver et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR339" href="#CR339">2004</a>; Langley-Evans et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183" href="#CR183">2005</a>), there are also indications that adaptive advantage cannot be assumed for all parental effects (Marshall and Uller 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200" href="#CR200">2007</a>; Tang et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR310" href="#CR310">2014</a>; Freinschlag and Schausberger 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121" href="#CR121">2016</a>). For example, maternal exposure to predation risk actually decreases offspring anti-predator behaviour in three-spined sticklebacks (McGhee et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR212" href="#CR212">2012</a>). It has been argued that the information a foetus receives is not in fact about the environment it is likely to face in its lifetime, but rather about the condition of its mother (Wells 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR341" href="#CR341">2007b</a>). Overall, the adaptive value of maternal effects is strongly ecologically dependent and can backfire under variable conditions. In such situations, parents may benefit by producing offspring that vary in sensitivity to particular experiences (Frankenhuis and Panchanathan 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120" href="#CR120">2011</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Filial imprinting</div>
  <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another process, which has often been overlooked since the initial interest in the 1960s (Bateson 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">1966</a>), and which deserves much greater attention both in empirical work and theoretical study (Junco 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160" href="#CR160">2017</a>), is filial imprinting. Related to the better studied sexual imprinting (Irwin and Price 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152" href="#CR152">1999</a>; Witte and Sawka 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR347" href="#CR347">2003</a>; Kozak et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR177" href="#CR177">2011</a>), filial imprinting is a process through which young individuals are capable of assimilating information and behavioural strategies necessary for their development (Hoffman and Ratner 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149" href="#CR149">1973</a>), even when there is little information available or only for a short time. It has been most studied in bird species, as the preference of offspring to approach a stimulus to which they have been exposed early in their development (Bolhuis and Honey 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">1998</a>), and an avoidance of dissimilar stimuli beyond normal avoidance of unfamiliar cues. For example, young male zebra finches preferred a song during which they were exposed during a sensitive period for song learning over their own song, or a new song (Adret 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">1993</a>). Filial imprinting provides a means for information to be acquired at a time when sensory faculties have not yet developed, through processes different from learning (Ewer 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107" href="#CR107">1956</a>), that seem to operate much earlier in ontogeny. Imprinting is expected to be especially relevant for those aspects of development that are sensitive to receiving the correct input on which to base development, for which there is a high cost of failure to receive correct input, and that concerns cues that occur early in the developmental process and are comparatively stable across evolutionary history (Remy 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR259" href="#CR259">2010</a>). It has been suggested that through imprinting, young can recognise their parents across a variety of conditions and respond appropriately to a particular posture or movement by a conspecific or predator which they have never seen before (Bateson 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">1966</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Filial imprinting is based on an ensemble of characteristics presented by the parents (Bolhuis and Honey 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">1998</a>), rather than on a single attribute or stimulus, and can happen visually, auditory or entirely subconsciously (Bateson 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">1966</a>; Batista et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2016</a>). Some of the early work on imprinting indicates that imprinted preferences are surprisingly stable across an individual’s lifetime, even in the face of considerable experience with or even conscious training upon other stimuli (Ewer 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107" href="#CR107">1956</a>; Bateson 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">1966</a>; Salzen and Meyer 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR275" href="#CR275">1968</a>), and it has been known to affect offspring’s behaviour later in life, up to and including their mate choice (Witte and Sawka 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR347" href="#CR347">2003</a>; Bereczkei et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2004</a>). Although the exact mechanisms through which juveniles imprint on their parents and others within the social group are still unclear, work in avian biology shows that juveniles are more likely to imprint on more conspicuous cues than less interesting stimuli (Bolhuis and Honey 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">1998</a>). Great shock, among a number of factors, has been found to interfere either with the ability to imprint itself or with the coping behaviour given in response to imprinted stimuli (Bateson 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">1966</a>), although there is also indication that increased stress during development should lead to individuals imprinting more strongly and rapidly (Kovach and Hess 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR176" href="#CR176">1963</a>). There is some suggestion that imprinting processes relate to sensitive periods in behavioural development (Knudsen 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172" href="#CR172">2004</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par48" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the last few years, there has been an increasing interest in imprinting, specifically related to the development of behaviour. It is being considered as much more important to developmental processes than previously thought (Martinho and Kacelnik 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR203" href="#CR203">2016</a>; Santolin et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR277" href="#CR277">2016</a>). Some consider imprinting a process similar to learning, responsible for early discriminatory abilities and social bonding (Junco 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160" href="#CR160">2017</a>), or a process causing the young to be predisposed to social partners (Gyuris et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136" href="#CR136">2010</a>; Di Giorgio et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" href="#CR87">2017</a>). However, it is becoming increasingly clear that imprinting does not only cause preferences that affect sociality. The process can also set preferences for more abstract concepts, such as preference for similarity or difference in a pair of objects (Martinho and Kacelnik 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR203" href="#CR203">2016</a>), preference for types of motion (Miura and Matsushima 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR223" href="#CR223">2016</a>), and even response to novelty (Versace et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR331" href="#CR331">2017</a>). When chicks (
   <span class="italic">Gallus gallus</span>) were exposed to imprinting on similar or dissimilar items and through visual or acoustic modes or both, males showed more positive response to novel stimuli when they had been imprinted on dissimilar items. This response was even stronger when they had been imprinted across both modes. Females, on the other hand, were more attracted by familiar patterns (Versace et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR331" href="#CR331">2017</a>). In that sense, it links closely to the aforementioned precursors to coping, perception (Di Giorgio et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" href="#CR87">2017</a>, “
   <a rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec2">Perception</a>” section) and evaluation (“
   <a rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec3">Evaluation</a>” section). Recent evidence shows a close connection between imprinting and other developmental processes such as maternal care (Junco 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160" href="#CR160">2017</a>) and relational concept learning (Martinho and Kacelnik 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR203" href="#CR203">2016</a>). For example, juvenile chickens showed a stronger preference for imprinted objects when they were being brooded or fed, suggesting that experiencing stimuli through usual maternal care is important for acquisition of imprinted information or preference (Junco 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160" href="#CR160">2017</a>). Some success has been made using filial imprinting principles to affect the way domestic piglets cope with postweaning and crowding challenges (Mesarec et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR217" href="#CR217">2017</a>). Although recent empirical work is lacking, it is likely that imprinting applies to behavioural cues as much as physiological cues, especially as imprinting has been shown to be sensitive to behavioural cues (Bolhuis and Honey 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">1998</a>; Di Giorgio et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" href="#CR87">2017</a>) and to similarity in coping strategies as well as auditory strategies.

 <sec id="Sec14" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Habituation</div>
  <p id="Par49" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Habituation is an important process through which individuals tune their coping behaviour to environmental cues, and one that is especially relevant during the developmental period. It is defined as a behavioural response decrement that results from repeated stimulation and that does not involve sensory adaptation/sensory fatigue or motor fatigue, and is commonly described by nine characteristics (described in Rankin et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR254" href="#CR254">2009</a>). Practically, this means that animals tend not to give a startle response anymore when faced with environmental cues they have safely experienced many times before. Habituation to frequently occurring stimuli provides an evolutionary advantage as it shortens the time needed to evaluate a response, allows animals to disregard irrelevant repetitive stimuli (Caputi et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">2016</a>) and prevents unnecessary activation of defensive or aggressive behaviours. It is sometimes considered a prerequisite for other forms of learning and behavioural development as it allows animals to focus selectively on important stimuli (Rankin et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR254" href="#CR254">2009</a>). In this, animals need to balance past experience against current threat levels (Hellström and Magnhagen 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142" href="#CR142">2017</a>). Like filial imprinting, habituation is linked to parental care, and it has been shown that early-life stress by isolation disrupts habituation to external stimuli (Finamore and Port 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115" href="#CR115">2000</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par50" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Habituation has been studied especially within the context of response to novelty, as a confounder of experimental values of repeatability or exploration of novel situations. Individual differences in habituation are rarely studied (Martin and Réale 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR202" href="#CR202">2008</a>). However, rats reared in a social setting showed more rapid habituation to novel objects than rats reared in social isolation, which may account for higher exploration scores in isolated animals (Einon and Morgan 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102" href="#CR102">1976</a>). Habituation of minnows (
   <span class="italic">Cyprinidae</span> sp
   <span class="italic">.</span>) to a predator cue was most rapid with the least realistic models (Magurran and Girling 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR198" href="#CR198">1986</a>), indicating a link between habituation and perceptual learning. More recently, differences in predator exposure during the first year of life in the Eurasian perch (
   <span class="italic">Perca fluviatilis</span>) were found to lead to differences in risk-taking behaviour even after being kept in a predator-free environment for 9 months (Hellström and Magnhagen 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142" href="#CR142">2017</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par51" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Processes of habituation are relevant especially in light of changing environments (Miranda 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR221" href="#CR221">2017</a>), where animals are often faced with repetitive environmental stimuli that they have no evolutionary experience with, and that they may not be able to estimate an appropriate coping response to (see “
   <a rid="Sec1" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec1">Coping behaviours: definitions and precursors</a>” section). Animals who can successfully habituate to urban noise (Potvin 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR252" href="#CR252">2017</a>), light and other disturbances while still accurately estimating environmental threats have an important advantage in coping with change. This is illustrated by a study showing that urban house sparrows (
   <span class="italic">Passer domesticus</span>) habituated faster to urban disturbance than their rural conspecifics: while rural and urban birds were initially equally likely to hide, the urban birds came out of hiding faster over repeat trials (Vincze et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR332" href="#CR332">2016</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conditioning</div>
  <p id="Par52" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Contrary to habituation, which occurs through simple repetition, behavioural conditioning occurs when a certain coping behavioural is consistently met with positive or negative reinforcement, through which the animal learns to perform one response and/or avoid another. For example, hatchery-reared rainbow trout (
   <span class="italic">Oncorhynchus mykiss</span>) that were conditioned to recognise chemical predator cues as dangerous, significantly increased anti-predator behaviours (decreased foraging, increased hiding), unlike trout from a control group. This response was still exhibited up to 21 days after conditioning (Brown and Smith 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">1998</a>). Conditioning can work fast, when it concerns stimuli that are sufficiently harmful, but often works slowly if the negative reinforcement is not very consistent or if the payoff from taking the risk is higher than the cost of negative reinforcement (Adret

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR194" href="#CR194">2002</a>). As such, predictability of the response, both in quality and in timing, is essential in learning whether to avoid or approach a challenging situation (Krebs et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179" href="#CR179">2017</a>). For example, when mice were exposed to conditioned and unconditioned stimuli in unpredictable patterns, they began to express freezing behaviours even at the conditioned response (Seidenbecher et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR280" href="#CR280">2016</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par53" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Like other processes that allow for coping behaviours to be tuned to environmental conditions, conditioning appears to be especially effective early in life. In young male zebra finches (
   <span class="italic">T. guttata</span>), conditioning with a song as reward influenced the effectiveness of song learning during development but not song preferences in adulthood (Adret 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">1993</a>). The effects of conditioning depend not only on age, but within that have also been shown to depend on state: within a small time window around nursing, rabbit pups (
   <span class="italic">O. cuniculus</span>) could be habituated to human handling, but not outside this window (Pongrácz and Altbäcker 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR251" href="#CR251">1999</a>). Similar to habituation, there are differences between species and individuals in the way conditions affect behaviour. For example, two closely related species of tadpoles (
   <span class="italic">Rana lessonae</span> and 
   <span class="italic">R. esculenta</span>) were conditioned for 30 days to a variety of predators, after which species differences were found in the ways general activity levels and use of refuge changed, as well as differences in the type of predator they responded to (Semlitsch and Reyer 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR282" href="#CR282">1992</a>). Finally, again similar to habituation, behavioural conditioning depends strongly on the predictability of challenging situations and, as such, is relevant to changing environments, as animals often exhibit modulating behavioural changes (freeze, approach, etc.) preceding a predictable event they are conditioned to (Krebs et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179" href="#CR179">2017</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Perceptual learning</div>
  <p id="Par54" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Perceptual learning is considered as any relatively permanent change of perception as a result of experience (Fahle 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108" href="#CR108">2004</a>). This process allows individuals to distinguish between similar cues in their environment, for example to differentiate between a dangerous predator and a harmless animal (Brown et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">2011</a>) or to signal and perceive the identity of intra-group conspecifics (Rendall et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR260" href="#CR260">1996</a>). Perceptual learning can occur not only under training conditions but also in situations of passive sensory stimulation, without awareness and without any task relevance (Watanabe et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR338" href="#CR338">2001</a>; Seitz and Dinse 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR281" href="#CR281">2007</a>), which means that frequently occurring stimuli may sensitise perceptual systems, just as habituation desensitised them. It relates to threat and opportunity recognition (“
   <a rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec2">Perception</a>” section) and the ability to evaluate the correct response to environmental stimuli (“
   <a rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec3">Evaluation</a>” section), and subsequently can often affect adult behaviour (Beach and Jaynes 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">1954</a>). Studies in humans have shown that perceptual learning can account for more than 76% of the rapid early improvement in performance (Hawkey et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140" href="#CR140">2004</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par55" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Retention of perceptual learning is shaped by a suite of factors such as the strength of initial conditioning as well as individual personality. In a more recent empirical study, shy versus bold rainbow trout showed no difference in conditioned response, but there was a significant effect of personality on retention of learned predator recognition, where shy fish continued to display a conditioned response after 8 days but bold fish did not (Brown et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">2013</a>). In accord with this study, a low-responsive strain in the same species displayed longer retention of a conditioned response (Øverli et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR243" href="#CR243">2007</a>). Recently, it has been argued that rather than having multiple perceptual systems, the animal-environment interaction cannot be correct unless individual forms of ambient energy such as light and sound exist in emergent, higher order patterns, i.e. a single overarching perceptual system that includes all kinds of perception (Stoffregen et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR301" href="#CR301">2017</a>). This is relevant to the study of early perceptual learning, as empirical work is often (but not always) biased towards visual cues.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Social learning</div>
  <p id="Par56" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Social learning includes a wide range of mechanisms through which individuals receive and integrate information from other members of their social group. In animals, juveniles learn in very similar ways as humans, namely through mimicking the role model provided by conspecifics (most commonly parents), through active parenting by means of example and correction, and through conditional parenting based on offspring performance. What all such mechanisms have in common is that they involve learning from observation of a conspecific or from interaction with them (Heyes 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148" href="#CR148">1994</a>; Hoppitt and Laland 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150" href="#CR150">2008</a>). A special subset of social learning in humans and perhaps some kinds of primates is teaching, where older or more experienced members of the same social group intentionally pass on information, techniques or behaviours to juveniles. Through social learning, animals can acquire more information, skills and behaviours that allow them to deal with their environment than they might reasonably acquire based on personal experience, as shown for example in a study of wild meerkats (
   <span class="italic">Suricata suricatta</span>) where adults were shown to teach pups prey-handling skills (Thornton and McAuliffe 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR315" href="#CR315">2006</a>). Social learning also helps juveniles to learn the dominance hierarchy within a group, which facilitates group living and, as such, the protection and cooperation provided by a larger group size. A potential disadvantage is that individuals rely on others for the signal they get about environmental conditions rather than relying on their own sensory systems. Social learning is especially common in species where offspring are dependent on their parents for survival for a long time (van Schaik 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR329" href="#CR329">2010</a>), or where they live in strongly social groups. Mice, for example, are highly social animals, and young mice reared in a communal nest develop relevant social behaviours that mice reared with single mothers do not (Branchi 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">2009</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par57" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Models of social learning predict that animals living in stable environments should be more attentive to socially acquired information than animals living in variable environments (Zentall and Galef 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR351" href="#CR351">1988</a>), as social learning can be maladaptive when the information modelled by the parents has become outdated with regard to the current environment or when the environment is highly variable (Galef and Whiskin 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125" href="#CR125">2004</a>; Laland 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR181" href="#CR181">2004</a>), causing juveniles to acquire coping behaviours that are mismatched to their environment (Lof et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR191" href="#CR191">2012</a>). It can also be adaptive, as shown when fairy wren (
   <span class="italic">Malurus cyaneus</span>) learned to recognise unfamiliar sounds as alarm calls through social “eavesdropping” (Magrath et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR197" href="#CR197">2015</a>). Models also predict that animals should be influenced more by the coping behaviour of older than younger group members (Benskin et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2002</a>), as they are more experienced. Empirical work on rats supported the first, but not the second of these models (Galef and Whiskin 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125" href="#CR125">2004</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par58" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Through the development of behavioural patterns within social groups, rearing conditions can have lasting effects on the expression of adult coping behaviours (Rice 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR261" href="#CR261">2008</a>; Roulin et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR272" href="#CR272">2010</a>). Of concern to conservation and coping with challenges of a changing world is recent evidence that wildlife can learn harmful behaviours from each other: whether or not bottlenose dolphins (
   <span class="italic">Tursiops aduncus</span>) become conditioned to being illegally fed by recreational fishers depended on both the degree to which the dolphins would frequent areas with a lot of tourism, and the degree to which they associated with previously conditioned dolphins (Donaldson et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95" href="#CR95">2012</a>). Not only is social learning in this way related to conditioning, it is also, like many of the other processes that link coping behaviours to the early-life environment, modulated by maternal care (Lindeyer et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR189" href="#CR189">2013</a>).
