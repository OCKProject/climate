 <p id="Par49" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Habituation is an important process through which individuals tune their coping behaviour to environmental cues, and one that is especially relevant during the developmental period. It is defined as a behavioural response decrement that results from repeated stimulation and that does not involve sensory adaptation/sensory fatigue or motor fatigue, and is commonly described by nine characteristics (described in Rankin et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR254" href="#CR254">2009</a>). Practically, this means that animals tend not to give a startle response anymore when faced with environmental cues they have safely experienced many times before. Habituation to frequently occurring stimuli provides an evolutionary advantage as it shortens the time needed to evaluate a response, allows animals to disregard irrelevant repetitive stimuli (Caputi et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">2016</a>) and prevents unnecessary activation of defensive or aggressive behaviours. It is sometimes considered a prerequisite for other forms of learning and behavioural development as it allows animals to focus selectively on important stimuli (Rankin et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR254" href="#CR254">2009</a>). In this, animals need to balance past experience against current threat levels (Hellström and Magnhagen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142" href="#CR142">2017</a>). Like filial imprinting, habituation is linked to parental care, and it has been shown that early-life stress by isolation disrupts habituation to external stimuli (Finamore and Port 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115" href="#CR115">2000</a>).

 <p id="Par50" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Habituation has been studied especially within the context of response to novelty, as a confounder of experimental values of repeatability or exploration of novel situations. Individual differences in habituation are rarely studied (Martin and Réale 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR202" href="#CR202">2008</a>). However, rats reared in a social setting showed more rapid habituation to novel objects than rats reared in social isolation, which may account for higher exploration scores in isolated animals (Einon and Morgan 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102" href="#CR102">1976</a>). Habituation of minnows (
  <span class="italic">Cyprinidae</span> sp
  <span class="italic">.</span>) to a predator cue was most rapid with the least realistic models (Magurran and Girling 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR198" href="#CR198">1986</a>), indicating a link between habituation and perceptual learning. More recently, differences in predator exposure during the first year of life in the Eurasian perch (
  <span class="italic">Perca fluviatilis</span>) were found to lead to differences in risk-taking behaviour even after being kept in a predator-free environment for 9 months (Hellström and Magnhagen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142" href="#CR142">2017</a>).

 <p id="Par51" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Processes of habituation are relevant especially in light of changing environments (Miranda 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR221" href="#CR221">2017</a>), where animals are often faced with repetitive environmental stimuli that they have no evolutionary experience with, and that they may not be able to estimate an appropriate coping response to (see “
  <a rid="Sec1" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec1">Coping behaviours: definitions and precursors</a>” section). Animals who can successfully habituate to urban noise (Potvin 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR252" href="#CR252">2017</a>), light and other disturbances while still accurately estimating environmental threats have an important advantage in coping with change. This is illustrated by a study showing that urban house sparrows (
  <span class="italic">Passer domesticus</span>) habituated faster to urban disturbance than their rural conspecifics: while rural and urban birds were initially equally likely to hide, the urban birds came out of hiding faster over repeat trials (Vincze et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR332" href="#CR332">2016</a>).
