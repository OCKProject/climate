 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, if an animal responds with a particular coping behaviour, it must be able to incur the costs of that behaviour; otherwise, the coping response will lead to a loss of fitness rather than a gain, either immediately or over a longer time span. Such costs can come in many forms. An animal that responds to the appearance of a competitor at the feeding ground with flight, freezing or hiding loses the opportunity to forage and obtain resources (McArthur et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR207" href="#CR207">2014</a>). An animal that responds with aggression, on the other hand, may incur cost to its physical health sustained in fighting displays (Marler and Moore 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR199" href="#CR199">1988</a>; Johnstone 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158" href="#CR158">2001</a>; Lane and Briffa 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182" href="#CR182">2017</a>). If the aggression is part of a behavioural construct, where the same coping behaviour is habitually displayed across contexts (Bell and Stamps 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">2004</a>), the individual may incur costs when the same aggression effectively displayed towards a rival male becomes lethal when displayed towards a predator, or alternatively, when effective aggressive behaviour towards predators may incur costs on other coping behaviours such as vigilance (Hess et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146" href="#CR146">2016</a>).

 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Life-history aspects such as offspring weight (Ferrari et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114" href="#CR114">2015</a>), parental care (Budaev et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">1999</a>; Reddon 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR258" href="#CR258">2012</a>; van Oers et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR328" href="#CR328">2015</a>), rank within the social structure (Verbeek et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR330" href="#CR330">1999</a>) and predation pressure are important in determining physical strength as well as resultant behavioural flexibility across an individual lifetime, and so affect whether or not an animal can afford the cost of a particular coping behaviour or behavioural syndrome (Fish et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118" href="#CR118">2004</a>; Rödel and Monclús 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR267" href="#CR267">2011</a>). For example, physically strong individuals, as well as animals reared in nutritionally challenging environments, may have higher chances of survival if they develop coping behaviours involving boldness, exploration and high levels of activity (Krause et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178" href="#CR178">2009</a>; Noguera et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR237" href="#CR237">2015</a>). However, for physically weak animals, or those living under high predation pressures, active and bold coping behaviours may be extremely costly, illustrated by the inducement of a boldness-aggression behavioural correlation in sticklebacks under predation pressure (Bell and Sih 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">2007</a>), which suggests that in this high-risk environment, it is adaptive for animals to be bold only if they are also (able to be) aggressive. In addition, the cost of a coping behaviour relates to the experience an animal has performing this behaviour, as it is considered risky to attempt novel coping behaviours when faced with a threat (King et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168" href="#CR168">2003</a>; Martin and Réale 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR202" href="#CR202">2008</a>; Rothwell et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR271" href="#CR271">2011</a>).
