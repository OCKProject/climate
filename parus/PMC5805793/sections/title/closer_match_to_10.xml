 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A sometimes oversimplified cause for developmental sensitivity to early-life circumstances is that it allows animals to acquire useful coping behaviours fine-tuned to their personal characteristics. Even in (relatively) stable and unchanging environments, close and individualised adaptation to the environment is relevant. There are two main reasons for this: differential experience or impact and differential susceptibility or biological sensitivity to context. Although these are not new ideas (Rosenzweig and Bennett 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR270" href="#CR270">1996</a>), they have only recently been considered in terms of animal personality and coping (Ungar 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR324" href="#CR324">2017</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The same early-life environment may be experienced differently by individuals based on life-history aspects such as birth order and birth weight (Biro and Stamps 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">2008</a>), or any number of stochastic (life-history) events. In addition, the same environment may affect individuals differentially based on their innate susceptibility (Belsky and Pluess 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">2009b</a>; Ellis et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105" href="#CR105">2011</a>; Jolicoeur-Martineau et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159" href="#CR159">2017</a>), as some individuals are more sensitive to negative effects of adversity as well as positive effects of opportunity (Pluess 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR249" href="#CR249">2015</a>). It has been suggested that there are also individual differences in underlying cognitive systems that are thought to facilitate individual’s capacity to plan effective coping behaviour, and that allow for the coping process to begin before a stressful event (Derryberry et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" href="#CR86">2003</a>). Cognitive systems and life-history aspects, in turn, may differ due the impact of the early-life environment, causing complex interactions between the way individuals relate to their environment and are in turn impacted by it.
 </p>
 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a result, it is adaptive for animals to acquire behavioural patterns in early life that are adjusted for their unique individual circumstances, as shaped by the interplay between their phenotype, life history and personal early-life environment (Nettle and Bateson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR234" href="#CR234">2015</a>). Individual differences in any number of such characteristics may necessitate non-genetic flexibility in the development of coping behaviours (Rödel et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR265" href="#CR265">2017</a>) and lead to differences in the coping behaviours animals use throughout life (Wilson and Krause 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR343" href="#CR343">2012</a>). These differences often become consistent within individuals over the course of development (McGue et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR213" href="#CR213">1993</a>; Derryberry et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" href="#CR86">2003</a>; Bell and Stamps 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">2004</a>; Caspi et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">2005</a>; Dall et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" href="#CR83">2012</a>; Dochtermann and Dingemanse 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94" href="#CR94">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both differential experience and susceptibility link into the previously detailed precursors to coping (see “
  <a rid="Sec1" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec1">Coping behaviours: definitions and precursors</a>” section): the amount of experience an animal has with a challenging situation, the extent to which it has seen examples of effective strategies, the degree to which it has practised those behavioural strategies and the resources it has available may be different even for its sibling growing up in the same habitat. It explains why individual differences in behaviour exist even for genetically identical twins growing up within a shared family environment (Asbury et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2003</a>). A well-designed study on within-litter differences in rabbits (
  <span class="italic">Oryctolagus cuniculus</span>) showed that offspring consistently differed in postnatal body temperature and early growth. These individual differences in life history corresponded to consistent differences in coping behaviours: pups with lower body mass struggled more when handled and explored more in an open field test, while pups with higher body mass jumped sooner from a platform (Rödel et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR265" href="#CR265">2017</a>). An earlier study showed that whether or not a rabbit becomes tame and relaxes, its stress behaviour when responding to humans is dependent on the state pups are in when exposed to human handling (Pongrácz and Altbäcker 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR251" href="#CR251">1999</a>). In cichlids (
  <span class="italic">N. pulcher</span>), a cooperatively breeding species of fish, rearing group size and the time juveniles spent in these groups affected the development of later-life social behaviours (Fischer et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116" href="#CR116">2015</a>). These empirical examples illustrate the importance of life-history aspects and other individual differences in the development of coping behaviours and suggest that early-life cues allow animals to develop coping behaviours better suited to their individual circumstances.
