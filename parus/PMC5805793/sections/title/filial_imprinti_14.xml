 <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another process, which has often been overlooked since the initial interest in the 1960s (Bateson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">1966</a>), and which deserves much greater attention both in empirical work and theoretical study (Junco 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160" href="#CR160">2017</a>), is filial imprinting. Related to the better studied sexual imprinting (Irwin and Price 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152" href="#CR152">1999</a>; Witte and Sawka 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR347" href="#CR347">2003</a>; Kozak et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR177" href="#CR177">2011</a>), filial imprinting is a process through which young individuals are capable of assimilating information and behavioural strategies necessary for their development (Hoffman and Ratner 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149" href="#CR149">1973</a>), even when there is little information available or only for a short time. It has been most studied in bird species, as the preference of offspring to approach a stimulus to which they have been exposed early in their development (Bolhuis and Honey 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">1998</a>), and an avoidance of dissimilar stimuli beyond normal avoidance of unfamiliar cues. For example, young male zebra finches preferred a song during which they were exposed during a sensitive period for song learning over their own song, or a new song (Adret 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">1993</a>). Filial imprinting provides a means for information to be acquired at a time when sensory faculties have not yet developed, through processes different from learning (Ewer 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107" href="#CR107">1956</a>), that seem to operate much earlier in ontogeny. Imprinting is expected to be especially relevant for those aspects of development that are sensitive to receiving the correct input on which to base development, for which there is a high cost of failure to receive correct input, and that concerns cues that occur early in the developmental process and are comparatively stable across evolutionary history (Remy 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR259" href="#CR259">2010</a>). It has been suggested that through imprinting, young can recognise their parents across a variety of conditions and respond appropriately to a particular posture or movement by a conspecific or predator which they have never seen before (Bateson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">1966</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Filial imprinting is based on an ensemble of characteristics presented by the parents (Bolhuis and Honey 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">1998</a>), rather than on a single attribute or stimulus, and can happen visually, auditory or entirely subconsciously (Bateson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">1966</a>; Batista et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2016</a>). Some of the early work on imprinting indicates that imprinted preferences are surprisingly stable across an individual’s lifetime, even in the face of considerable experience with or even conscious training upon other stimuli (Ewer 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107" href="#CR107">1956</a>; Bateson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">1966</a>; Salzen and Meyer 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR275" href="#CR275">1968</a>), and it has been known to affect offspring’s behaviour later in life, up to and including their mate choice (Witte and Sawka 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR347" href="#CR347">2003</a>; Bereczkei et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2004</a>). Although the exact mechanisms through which juveniles imprint on their parents and others within the social group are still unclear, work in avian biology shows that juveniles are more likely to imprint on more conspicuous cues than less interesting stimuli (Bolhuis and Honey 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">1998</a>). Great shock, among a number of factors, has been found to interfere either with the ability to imprint itself or with the coping behaviour given in response to imprinted stimuli (Bateson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">1966</a>), although there is also indication that increased stress during development should lead to individuals imprinting more strongly and rapidly (Kovach and Hess 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR176" href="#CR176">1963</a>). There is some suggestion that imprinting processes relate to sensitive periods in behavioural development (Knudsen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172" href="#CR172">2004</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par48" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the last few years, there has been an increasing interest in imprinting, specifically related to the development of behaviour. It is being considered as much more important to developmental processes than previously thought (Martinho and Kacelnik 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR203" href="#CR203">2016</a>; Santolin et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR277" href="#CR277">2016</a>). Some consider imprinting a process similar to learning, responsible for early discriminatory abilities and social bonding (Junco 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160" href="#CR160">2017</a>), or a process causing the young to be predisposed to social partners (Gyuris et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136" href="#CR136">2010</a>; Di Giorgio et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" href="#CR87">2017</a>). However, it is becoming increasingly clear that imprinting does not only cause preferences that affect sociality. The process can also set preferences for more abstract concepts, such as preference for similarity or difference in a pair of objects (Martinho and Kacelnik 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR203" href="#CR203">2016</a>), preference for types of motion (Miura and Matsushima 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR223" href="#CR223">2016</a>), and even response to novelty (Versace et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR331" href="#CR331">2017</a>). When chicks (
  <span class="italic">Gallus gallus</span>) were exposed to imprinting on similar or dissimilar items and through visual or acoustic modes or both, males showed more positive response to novel stimuli when they had been imprinted on dissimilar items. This response was even stronger when they had been imprinted across both modes. Females, on the other hand, were more attracted by familiar patterns (Versace et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR331" href="#CR331">2017</a>). In that sense, it links closely to the aforementioned precursors to coping, perception (Di Giorgio et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" href="#CR87">2017</a>, “
  <a rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec2">Perception</a>” section) and evaluation (“
  <a rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec3">Evaluation</a>” section). Recent evidence shows a close connection between imprinting and other developmental processes such as maternal care (Junco 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160" href="#CR160">2017</a>) and relational concept learning (Martinho and Kacelnik 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR203" href="#CR203">2016</a>). For example, juvenile chickens showed a stronger preference for imprinted objects when they were being brooded or fed, suggesting that experiencing stimuli through usual maternal care is important for acquisition of imprinted information or preference (Junco 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160" href="#CR160">2017</a>). Some success has been made using filial imprinting principles to affect the way domestic piglets cope with postweaning and crowding challenges (Mesarec et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR217" href="#CR217">2017</a>). Although recent empirical work is lacking, it is likely that imprinting applies to behavioural cues as much as physiological cues, especially as imprinting has been shown to be sensitive to behavioural cues (Bolhuis and Honey 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">1998</a>; Di Giorgio et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" href="#CR87">2017</a>) and to similarity in coping strategies as well as auditory strategies.
