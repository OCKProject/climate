 <p id="Par65" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In many of the studies we reviewed, the role of the parents is extensive. Parents affect their offspring through genes, through the security and nutrition they provide, through the example they set, through their parenting behaviours such as grooming and licking, and the behaviour they actively encourage in their offspring through means of correction and approval. In addition, mothers affect their offspring through hormonal influences (Dufty Jr et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98" href="#CR98">2002</a>; Weaver et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR339" href="#CR339">2004</a>; Champagne 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" href="#CR75">2011</a>; Giesing et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127" href="#CR127">2011</a>) during gestation. To an extent, and depending on the species, the environment the mother lives in actually creates the environment of her offspring (Duckworth et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" href="#CR97">2015</a>). While some studies include parent-offspring interactions in their definition of social interactions, as juveniles learn important behavioural systems from both parents and others in their social group, for the purpose of this study, we consider them separate influences in order to clarify effects unique to the parent-offspring relationship. Within eligible studies, parenting was studied especially in the last decade in the context of maternal isolation or separation (Biagini et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">1998</a>; Caldji et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">2000</a>; Martin 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR201" href="#CR201">2002</a>; Ruedi-Bettschen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR273" href="#CR273">2004</a>; Moons et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR225" href="#CR225">2005</a>) and, more recently, maternal stress (Champagne and Meaney 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" href="#CR77">2006</a>; Kiryanova et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171" href="#CR171">2017</a>; Rooke et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR269" href="#CR269">2017</a>), which has often been related to intergenerational effects (see “
  <a rid="Sec25" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec25">Stable or stuck across generations?</a>” section), and parental care and provisioning (van Oers et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR328" href="#CR328">2015</a>).

 <p id="Par66" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many studies found detrimental effects of maternal separation early in life. For example, rats (
  <span class="italic">Rattus rattus</span>) separated from their mothers early in life displayed reduced activity and risk taking, and increases in orienting time (Spivey et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR296" href="#CR296">2008</a>), while other rats showed impaired coping (Ruedi-Bettschen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR273" href="#CR273">2004</a>). Calves (
  <span class="italic">Bos primigenius</span>) reared by mothers showed more escape and vigilance behaviour than automat-reared cows when faced with an isolation test, and displayed overall more social behaviours towards conspecifics (Wagner et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR335" href="#CR335">2013</a>). In addition, chimpanzees (
  <span class="italic">Pan troglodytes</span>) separated from their mothers and/or social group as juveniles showed decreased activity and increased abnormal behaviours, with stronger effects in younger individuals (Martin 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR201" href="#CR201">2002</a>). Other studies found an effect of early postnatal handling but not of maternal separation on the ability of juvenile rats to cope with novelty (Biagini et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">1998</a>), and adult rats who had been handled as juveniles showed reduced startle responsivity, increased exploration and decreased suppression of feeding, whereas those that were maternally separated as juveniles did not (Caldji et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">2000</a>). Such effects of handling (see also Núñez et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR238" href="#CR238">1996</a>; Spivey et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR296" href="#CR296">2008</a>) indicate that separation and handling cannot be considered comparable influences, and call for caution when studying the effects of parental separation. In addition, some studies have considered more complex systems and interactions between life history and parental behaviour on the young. For example, in Japanese quail (
  <span class="italic">C. japonica</span>), mothers of large broods emitted more maternal vocalisations at the start of mothering but covered the young less towards the end. Chicks in turn huddled more and had higher social motivation than chicks in small broods (Aigueperse et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">2017</a>). Impaired maternal care (Champagne et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" href="#CR76">2003</a>; Lindeyer et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR189" href="#CR189">2013</a>), which may in turn be caused by poor habitat conditions (Ivy et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153" href="#CR153">2008</a>), and maternal stress (Rooke et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR269" href="#CR269">2017</a>) have also been empirically linked to the development of coping behaviours.
 </p>
 <p id="Par67" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Beyond maternal stress, care and separation, some studies have looked at parental behavioural traits in relation to offspring coping, showing that juvenile cats (
  <span class="italic">Felis catus</span>) from friendly fathers were quicker to approach, touch and rub an unfamiliar person and remain in close contact with novel objects than those from unfriendly fathers (McCune 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR211" href="#CR211">1995</a>). In contrast, offspring of exploratory zebrafish females were always highly exploratory regardless of behavioural traits of the father (Wisenden et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR345" href="#CR345">2011</a>). Such similarities cannot blindly be ascribed to genetics. In zebra finches (
  <span class="italic">T. guttata</span>), offspring exploratory type was predicted by the exploratory behaviour of the foster, but not the genetic parents (Schuett et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR279" href="#CR279">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par68" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, parental experience has been shown to affect offspring coping behaviours. In lizards (
  <span class="italic">Zootoca vivipara</span>), offspring of mothers exposed to predator cues dispersed three times more in an unfamiliar semi-natural environment than offspring from unexposed mothers (Bestion et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">2014</a>). In sticklebacks (
  <span class="italic">Gasterosteus aculeatus</span>), females exposed to predator cues produced offspring with altered behaviour, and males (who provide parental care) exposed to predator cues produced offspring that were less active (Bell et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2016</a>). Not only predatory experience but also social experience of parents can be a relevant factor. In wild cavies (
  <span class="italic">Cavia porcellus</span>), an unstable social environment experienced by mothers during pregnancy and lactation led to camouflage behaviours in male offspring, whereas a stable social environment led to earlier reproductive behaviour (Siegeler et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR288" href="#CR288">2017</a>). No differences were found between coping behaviours of cavies whose mothers experienced a socially unstable environment compared to those who experienced stable social conditions (Kemme et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167" href="#CR167">2008</a>). It should be emphasised that parental experience and parental stress are often overlapping factors in the studies reviewed here, and that while it is often assumed that parental exposure to predation constitutes as stress, it may have ecological implications beyond stress especially with regards to parental effects on offspring coping behaviours.
