 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under certain circumstances, the early-life environment can reliably predict the later-life environment (McLinn and Stephens 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR214" href="#CR214">2006</a>; Branchi and Cirulli 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">2014</a>), much like a “weather forecast” of the conditions in which an animal will mature, making it adaptive for an animal to develop a phenotype suitable for this expected environment (external predictive adaptive responses) (Nettle et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR235" href="#CR235">2013</a>). Practically, this may translate to physical changes in body size or developmental time (Beckerman et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">2007</a>; Niemelä et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR236" href="#CR236">2012</a>), but also to behavioural changes in foraging strategies, aggression, shyness, social behaviour, activity and exploration (Wells 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR341" href="#CR341">2007b</a>). Some theoretical models suggest that it is only possible for species to evolve developmental sensitivity to early-life cues when developing individuals get accurate cues about their future adult environment (Proulx and Teotónio 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR253" href="#CR253">2017</a>). Some empirical work, however, seems to point towards a more complex mechanism that takes into account multiple life-history aspects (Biro and Stamps 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">2008</a>; Burton and Metcalfe 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">2014</a>). Gaining information about future adult environment is considered more important in some species than in others, depending on the life-history aspects relevant to species, although there is still discussion about the relevance of external prediction especially in longer lived species (Burton and Metcalfe 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One way for offspring to predict conditions of their later-life environments is through parental cues. Parents can adjust the phenotype of their offspring to match the local environment through anticipatory parental effects (APEs), so as to increase the fitness of both parents and offspring. When wild cavy mothers (
  <span class="italic">Cavia porcellus</span>) experienced an unstable social environment, her male offspring developed a behavioural camouflage strategy, hypothesised to be beneficial at the time of social challenge (Siegeler et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR288" href="#CR288">2017</a>). In Japanese quail (
  <span class="italic">Coturnix japonica</span>), pre-natal stress experienced by the mother resulted in inheritance of the same stress-coping traits in offspring across neuroendocrine, physiological and behavioural traits. These responses have been suggested as adaptations to preparing offspring for a future environment in which the same stressors are experienced (Zimmer et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR353" href="#CR353">2017</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effect of parental cues is predicated on the idea that parental environment is a reliable predictor of offspring environment, which is not always the case (Burgess and Marshall 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">2014</a>). Parental effects on offspring coping behaviours do not always favour the offspring, but in some cases seem to exclusively benefit the mother (Wells 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR340" href="#CR340">2007a</a>; Sheriff and Love 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR285" href="#CR285">2013</a>). In some cases, the early-life environment itself is shaped by the parents through parental provisioning, nest building and other environment-changing behaviours, which increases the predictive validity of parental signalling.
 </p>
 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within parental cues about the environment, especially parental predator warnings are important in demonstrating the evolutionary relevance of sensitivity to the early-life environment. Offspring of female fall field crickets (
  <span class="italic">Gryllus pennsylvanicus</span>) exposed to a predator spider during gestation showed greater anti-predator immobility in response to spider cues than offspring of non-exposed females. “Warned” offspring then survived better when faced with spiders (Storm and Lima 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR302" href="#CR302">2010</a>), clearly demonstrating the adaptive value of this parental effect. Similarly, in common lizards (
  <span class="italic">Zootoca vivipara</span>), maternal exposure to snake cues during gestation affected juvenile behaviour and dispersal towards increased risk avoidance strategies (Bestion et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">2014</a>). Studies such as these show that cues from mothers during gestation can trigger adaptive anti-predator responses aimed at increasing offspring survival, although adaptiveness depends on the stressor, the reliability of the parental and offspring environments and the evolutionary history of the population (Bell et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2016</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to parental cues, exposure to environmental cues such as conspecific signalling or direct predator cues may provide juveniles with relevant information regarding the make-up of the forthcoming environment (DiRienzo et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93" href="#CR93">2012</a>). In rats, chronic stress during adolescence caused long-term changes both in foraging behaviour and foraging performance: under high-threat conditions, rats previously exposed to stress began foraging much sooner, made more transitions between foraging patches and consumed more rewards than previously unstressed rats (Chaby et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">2015</a>), indicating that early-life stress may be adaptive as it can enhance behavioural functioning in future high-threat environments. Evolutionary reasoning here is that when lack of food, unfavourable habitat or predation, sometimes collectively considered stress (see also “
  <a rid="Sec24" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec24">Stress</a>” section), is experienced early in life, behavioural processes such as migratory, foraging and exploration behaviours need to be adjusted in order to maintain fitness later in life (Kasumovic and Andrade 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163" href="#CR163">2009</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Predictability of the later-life environment can be unreliable, causing behavioural adjustments that are mis-matched to future environments. The environment experienced in early-life may not match the environment experienced in later life for a variety of reasons, including environmental change, stochastic events and niche shifts, but also dispersal and migration (Burton and Metcalfe 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">2014</a>). In addition, environmental cues are not always accurately perceived by parent or offspring (Paglianti et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR244" href="#CR244">2010</a>; Bocedi et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">2012</a>). In order to optimise predictability of future environments, biological processes should have evolved to use as broad a sampling window and as diverse a range of cues as possible (Burton and Metcalfe 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">2014</a>). It has been convincingly argued that a broader and more integrated life-history perspective is needed in order to understand the adaptive value of environmentally induced behavioural adjustments, taking into account both immediate and longer-term environmental context (Sheriff and Love 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR285" href="#CR285">2013</a>).
