 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evaluating an effective response to a situation can be defined simply as carrying out any response that successfully mediates the challenging situation to where there is no longer a threat or opportunity. When an individual does not correctly estimate which response should be given, it creates a mismatch between behaviour and environment that can be fatal to the animal. This was observed, for example, when captive-bred angelfish (
  <span class="italic">Pterophyllum scalare</span>), who had never experienced a predator before, were challenged to respond to predator cues, to which they responded less appropriately than wild-bred fish with past experience of a predator (El Balaa and Blouin-Demers 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103" href="#CR103">2011</a>). Such a mismatch also occurs when individuals respond too readily to possible threats. Responding only to individuals of a predator species that display sufficiently threatening behaviour allows prey species to minimise energy expenditure and other costs of predator avoidance, which is especially relevant if the predator is common but attacks are infrequent (Papworth et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR245" href="#CR245">2013</a>).

 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It must be noted that the coping responses that animals display are often non-conscious and part of a stimulus-response bond (Liddell et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR187" href="#CR187">2004</a>), a pathway that has become engrained through a myriad of developmental processes (see “
  <a rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec11">How the early-life environment affects the development of coping/developmental processes affecting coping behaviours</a>” section). Yet there is indication that animals choose from multiple available strategies, as outlined below, when environmental conditions incite them to respond to a threat (Benus et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">1991</a>; Belsky 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2007</a>; Mathot et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR204" href="#CR204">2012</a>). Which strategy is estimated as the most effective is dependent upon current environmental conditions as well as past experience and the animal’s personal success rate with the available coping strategies. The threat-sensitive predator avoidance model (Bishop and Brown 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">1992</a>; Brown et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">2006</a>; Chamaillé-Jammes et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">2014</a>; Rieucau et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR262" href="#CR262">2014</a>) predicts that animals should take into account perceived predation risk to balance the intensity of their antipredator response. Research on cichlids showed that when threatened, isolated individuals exhibited reduced time moving and foraging than individuals in shoals, and small shoals exhibited a higher response threshold than large shoals (Brown et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">2006</a>). Similarly, wild-caught herrings provided the strongest avoidance reactions when exposed to versatile predator sensory cues (Rieucau et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR262" href="#CR262">2014</a>). These findings and others (Bishop and Brown 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">1992</a>) indicate that response patterns are flexible and situation dependent, and subject to natural selection processes.
 </p>
 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As much as threat perception, threat evaluation is dependent at least to a degree on experiences during early life (Olff et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR242" href="#CR242">2005</a>). Familiarity with the situation and habituation, both of which play a role in estimating effective coping behaviours, are built through either personal experience with similar situations earlier in life (Snell-Rood et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR294" href="#CR294">2013</a>), or learning from others who previously experienced the situation (Brown et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">2006</a>; Rieucau et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR262" href="#CR262">2014</a>). Domestically raised animals, for example, no longer perceive humans as threats, whereas many wild animals do. While they perceive similar cues, they evaluate the presence of a human differently and so display different coping behaviours. The ability to evaluate which response to take under different circumstances is especially relevant in coping with novelty, when little previous experience is available (Tang et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR311" href="#CR311">2011</a>).
