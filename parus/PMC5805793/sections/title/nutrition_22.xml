 <p id="Par69" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nutrition is perhaps the most important building block for development of the physical body. More recently, it has also been linked to the development of behaviour (Noguera et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR237" href="#CR237">2015</a>; van Oers et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR328" href="#CR328">2015</a>), as lack of appropriate nutrition affects the mechanics of developmental systems, potentially stunting or derailing healthy development. Several studies examined the effects of yolk reserves (Andersson and Hoglund 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2012</a>), food availability (Carere et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">2005</a>; Edenbrow and Croft 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" href="#CR99">2011</a>), food quality (Krause et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178" href="#CR178">2009</a>; Tremmel and Müller 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR317" href="#CR317">2013</a>) and body weight (Rödel and Monclús 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR267" href="#CR267">2011</a>) on coping behaviours and found that effects depend strongly on species and an interplay of surrounding factors.
 </p>
 <p id="Par70" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Exploration and activity are behaviours often studied in relation to early-life nutrition. Female zebra finches raised on low-quality food were faster to show exploration and foraging behaviours than those raised on high-quality food, although there were no differences in latency to move after the start of the experiments (Krause et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178" href="#CR178">2009</a>). Similarly, low availability of dietary micronutrients during the postnatal period was found to lead to reduced boldness in male zebra finches, but did not affect fear of novelty and did not affect females at all (Noguera et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR237" href="#CR237">2015</a>). In European rabbits (
  <span class="italic">O. cuniculus</span>), exploratory behaviour and anxiety levels were correlated with body mass in early life, but not with body mass and age at the time of testing (Rödel and Monclús 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR267" href="#CR267">2011</a>). In a species of beetle (
  <span class="italic">Phaedon cochlaeriae</span>), low-quality food induced boldness, and by extension, potential foraging success, while animals raised on high-quality food were more active (Tremmel and Müller 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR317" href="#CR317">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par71" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, many studies found that food conditions during early-life affected later-life aggression. Young trouts (
  <span class="italic">O. mykiss</span>) with larger yolks showed more aggressive personality traits than siblings with smaller yolks and, subsequently, were more aggressive in territory establishment and more socially dominant (Andersson and Hoglund 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2012</a>). However, in mangrove killifish (
  <span class="italic">Kryptolebias marmoratus</span>), low food conditions reduced exploration but not boldness or aggression (Edenbrow and Croft 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" href="#CR99">2011</a>). In a selection line of great tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) selected for fast exploration, food rationing was linked to increased aggression (Carere et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">2005</a>), yet in a different line of great tits, juveniles provisioned with less food exhibited a stronger stress response and faster exploration later in life than juveniles provisioned with more food (van Oers et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR328" href="#CR328">2015</a>). Bulb mites (
  <span class="italic">Rhyzoglyphus</span> sp
  <span class="italic">.</span>) raised on rich diets developed an aggressive phenotype, whereas those raised on poor nutrition became non-aggressive “scramblers” (Smallegange 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR293" href="#CR293">2011</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par72" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These studies indicate that the effects of nutrition do influence adult coping behaviours across many different species, but nutrition does not necessarily affect all behaviours, or both sexes, or in the same way. It has been argued that the quantity, quality and predictability of resources can act as ecological stressors in mothers (Love et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR193" href="#CR193">2013</a>) and, as such, affect their offspring through various developmental pathways. Negative consequences of food deprivation during ontogeny may reappear especially when environmental conditions deteriorate in adulthood (Krause et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178" href="#CR178">2009</a>).
