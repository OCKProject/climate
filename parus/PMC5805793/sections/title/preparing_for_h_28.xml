 <p id="Par88" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast with prevailing views that stress effects are cumulative and increase stress vulnerability throughout life (Santarelli et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR276" href="#CR276">2017</a>), many recent studies have begun to suggest that the effects of early-life environment may help buffer later-life hardship. By receiving cues early in life that the environment in adulthood is likely to be difficult, animals have an opportunity to adjust their development towards coping behaviours that are more likely to be successful. For example, male Balb/c strain mice were exposed to adverse and supportive early-life conditions, and then given a socially adverse or supportive environment in adulthood. Negative consequences for stress responsiveness and anxiety-related coping behaviours were found mainly in mice that were exposed to either early-life or adult adversity, but not in mice that were exposed to both (Santarelli et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR276" href="#CR276">2017</a>). Another study in mice found that early-life stress through maternal separation improved coping with and recovery from a traumatic social experience in adulthood (Zoicas and Neumann 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR354" href="#CR354">2016</a>).

  <sub>2</sub> levels, but parental exposure to high CO
  <sub>2</sub> reduced these effects in some—but not all—traits (Allan et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">2014</a>).
