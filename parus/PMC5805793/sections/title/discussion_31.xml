 <p id="Par99" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As previously indicated by several studies (Stamps and Groothuis 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR297" href="#CR297">2010</a>; Gracceva et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130" href="#CR130">2011</a>; Groothuis and Trillmich 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133" href="#CR133">2011</a>), the relationship between external events and individual’s resulting coping behaviours has been surprisingly understudied. These statements are corroborated by our review, which yielded comparatively few papers that specifically addressed developmental processes, and the majority of those addressed epigenetic mechanisms and parental effects (see 
  <a ref-type="sec" rid="Sec31" href="#Sec31">Supplementary material</a>). The reason for the lack of a framework for developmental processes becomes clearer when reviewing the large number of coping behaviours studied in the literature and the diversity of early-life conditions: a multitude of behavioural aspects, the correlations between which are still poorly understood, are influenced by an equally large number of environmental conditions in sometimes opposite directions, with important differences between and within species, genders and even individuals. As different fields of study each has its preferred study species, environmental conditions and coping behaviours, comparing the available studies and constructing a bigger picture poses a challenge. Especially for that reason, however, there is a need to study and uncover the pathways through which early-life condition affects coping, so that a linear “this condition leads to that expression” can be replaced with a deeper understanding of the development of behavioural patterns.
 </p>
 <p id="Par100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although of course the mechanisms leading to intergenerational transfer of behaviours and coping traits consist of a complex interplay between ecological and physiological factors (Wells 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR342" href="#CR342">2011</a>), of the processes linking early-life environment to development as discussed in the section “
  <a rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec11">How the early-life environment affects the development of coping/developmental processes affecting coping behaviours</a>”, maternal effects and imprinting are likely to be the most important in generating intergenerational effects. And indeed, we find many examples in the literature of cases where such processes affect coping in juveniles (Mousseau and Fox 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR231" href="#CR231">1998</a>; Agrawal et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">2001</a>; Marshall and Uller 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200" href="#CR200">2007</a>; Moran et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR227" href="#CR227">2010</a>; Champagne 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" href="#CR75">2011</a>), although more attention has been paid to maternal effects than to imprinting (Champagne 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" href="#CR75">2011</a>; Drake et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" href="#CR96">2011</a>). The early-life influences responsible, following recent literature, are most likely to be social and reproductive behaviour and stressors experienced in these areas (Champagne 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">2010</a>), although there appears to be somewhat of a bias in the literature towards studying mainly maternal influences (Champagne and Meaney 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" href="#CR77">2006</a>) on offspring social and emotional behaviour, and mainly in rodents and primates.
 </p>
 <p id="Par101" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We recommend more targeted studies that focus less on relating an environmental influence to a behavioural expression, and more on the functioning of processes through which individuals ascertain and integrate external information, and in turn translate this information to behavioural patterns. Individual developmental processes, such as maternal effects, imprinting, habituation, conditioning or social learning, have been well studied for decades across fields of animal ecology, neurology and psychology, but with the exception of maternal effects, have not been extensively studied in the context of the development of coping behaviours. In relation to this, we suggest a move towards understanding the complex interactions between life history and development of coping behaviour. Nutrition, for example, tends to relate to body weight, which in turn has been shown to affect boldness (Mayer et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR206" href="#CR206">2016</a>). Increased nutrition, however, can relate to better habitat, position in the nest, quality of maternal care, offspring’s own behaviour or any combination of these. These interactions between life history and developmental processes are complicated further by individual differences in sensitivity and experience, which cause differences in coping behaviours between animals that make us question potentially all of behavioural work. Differential susceptibility and developmental causes for such susceptibility may provide invaluable insights into the evolutionary reasons for early-life effects on the development of coping behaviours.
 </p>
 <p id="Par102" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, there is a need to understand parental effects and stress under natural or at least semi-natural conditions, and to begin to re-interpret findings from lab studies on behaviour in their ecological context, as behaviours from developmentally disturbed animals. We expect that such an approach will shed light on inconsistencies currently reported in this field (Moons et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR225" href="#CR225">2005</a>), especially relating to parental effects and stress, as interactions of developmental system become better understood. A clearer understanding of more complex interactions will be especially useful in relation to resilience and reversibility of unfavourable traits, both of which are becoming increasingly important at the moment as most species, including humans, are challenged with large amounts of environmental change.
 </p>
 <p id="Par103" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We call for more cross-fertilisation between different fields with regards to understanding how early-life influences impact animals’ ability to cope with their environment, a topic that is becoming increasingly important in behavioural ecology, conservation, under the topic Evo-Eco-Devo, as well as animal husbandry. It is clear that there are preferences within different fields to study certain factors of interest only in certain species, which inevitably causes a bias in our understanding of the various early-life influences and makes it difficult to consider ontogeny of coping behaviours more holistically. Currently, the effects of parenting and parental are studied largely in rodents and within that almost inclusively in relation to understanding stress reactivity and parental separation. Imprinting is considered only in birds. Intergenerational transmission of early-life trauma across multiple generations is studied almost exclusively in humans, generally without regard for developmental processes beyond parental effects. Yet, each of the developmental processes reviewed here is likely to affect later-life coping behaviours, both independently and through complex interactions between different processes. Factors driving the development of behaviour cannot be well understood by studying one process in one group of animals, and another process exclusively in another group of animals with completely different life histories.</p>
 <p id="Par104" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When considering vulnerability and reversibility of maladaptive coping behaviours, there is a need to distinguish between two different, though perhaps partially overlapping factors: sensitivity to receiving the necessary input (Bolhuis and Honey 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">1998</a>; Zala et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR350" href="#CR350">2012</a>) and sensitivity to negative influences such as stress or malnutrition (Krause et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178" href="#CR178">2009</a>; McClelland et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR208" href="#CR208">2011</a>), although this distinction is rarely tested for empirically in studies on coping behaviours. Behaviours developed early in life can generally be applied later in life, but not all behaviours can be developed later in life. Often the pre-existing conditions simply do not exist or have developed (canalised) into a different direction. Alternatively, damage may have been done early in development that prohibits development in a certain direction. Deprivation of such necessary input during the sensitive stage may mean the juvenile will never develop the appropriate behaviour. Negative influences, on the other hand, can consist of (but not be limited to) momentary disruption of a developmental pathway and, as such, not necessarily be limited to a sensitive stage. For this reason, early life stress (ELS, Fuentes et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123" href="#CR123">2014</a>) should be considered within the context of the stressor, as evolutionary speaking, insufficient or abusive maternal care cannot be easily equated to lack of nutrition or lack of social interaction with conspecifics. Specifically, there is a need to move away from studying “stress” as a generic factor, and be more much focussed as to which developmental process is impacted by which early-life influence(s) specifically, and in what ecologically relevant way.
 </p>
 <p id="Par105" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although we have an increased understanding of the ultimate reasons why early-life environment affects developmental processes so strongly, and of some of the proximate mechanisms through which early-life development are shaped, there are still important gaps in our understanding, especially in the areas of threat perception and assessment, and non-genetic ways through which offspring copy parental coping behaviours. Further study in these areas, especially in the context of recent new thinking on evolutionary synthesis (Pigliucci 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR248" href="#CR248">2009</a>; Schoener 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR278" href="#CR278">2011</a>), will allow us to understand and perhaps even predict mismatches between environment and coping behaviours in animals, and ultimately, in ourselves.
