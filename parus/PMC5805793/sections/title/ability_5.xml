 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even when a challenge has been perceived and an appropriate response has been evaluated, successful coping is not guaranteed. Animals may not be able to give the response that is most effective, due to physical or developmental constraints or negative experiences earlier in life (Long

Stressors or deprivation of nutrients, care, personal experience or parental example early in life may have made it impossible to give an adaptive response. For example, the nest environment in young rats was shown to affect ontogeny of personality types, with heavier individuals being more bold and more explorative than lighter individuals, and individuals from both small and large litters being more anxious than individuals from medium-sized litters (RÃ¶del and Meyer 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR266" href="#CR266">2011</a>). Thus, the appropriate coping behaviour for a rural rat facing food shortage might be to go into an urban area to forage, but because the rat in question had a low birth weight and came from a large litter, its coping behaviours were developed towards the shy and anxious range, leaving it behaviourally unable to cope with the noise and novelty of an urban environment. A rat with even slightly different early-life circumstances, by contrast, might make the transition to the new environment and survive the food shortage. In addition to stressors or deprivation, which focuses specifically on negative early-life events, development of behavioural processes may of necessity have canalised (Hermanussen et al.
