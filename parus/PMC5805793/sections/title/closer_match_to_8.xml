 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most straightforward reason why the development of coping behaviours is strongly affected by early-life conditions is to allow for a closer match between coping behaviour and juvenile environment than if behavioural development were solely determined by genes (Grether 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131" href="#CR131">2005</a>; Lof et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR191" href="#CR191">2012</a>; Taborsky 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR308" href="#CR308">2017</a>). Natural environments are fluid and can fluctuate strongly with respect to climate, available resources, habitat size and connectivity, predation and competition pressures, social dynamics and more. When young animals are born, they have little conscious knowledge of the surroundings that will define their survival, the challenges ahead, or exactly what strategies will be effective in dealing with the predators, the social hierarchy and the resources they will find in their habitat. From an evolutionary perspective, there is therefore a distinct benefit to maintaining developmental processes that facilitate fast and targeted learning in the very first stages of life, as well as processes that fine-tune coping behaviours to existing environmental conditions. As the early-life environment can be almost indistinguishable from life history, an additional advantage is a closer match to life-history aspects such as birth weight and number of offspring (Wolf et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR348" href="#CR348">2007</a>; Edenbrow and Croft 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" href="#CR99">2011</a>; Niemelä et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR236" href="#CR236">2012</a>; Hengartner 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144" href="#CR144">2017</a>). Developmental processes that are sensitive to input from the immediate surroundings allow organisms a degree of flexibility and adaptability across generations, and increase the chances that young are capable of responding quickly and appropriately to surroundings that they do not yet have the personal experience with. Young animals with effective and efficient coping behaviours are more likely to survive to adulthood and to do so with a higher body mass than those with less well-adjusted behaviours, which has been shown to impact later life success (Lindström 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR190" href="#CR190">1999</a>; Noguera et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR237" href="#CR237">2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Heightened sensitivity of development to conditions experienced during early life may increase an animal’s chances of developing behaviours that are functional within their surroundings. If young individuals experience an unsafe environment in which their life and health are in constant danger, it is beneficial to them to develop keener senses (Aron et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">2012</a>), build a cognitive database on hiding places and learn to respond to unexpected stimuli by freezing in place or bolting for cover. However, if they experience a relatively safe environment, there is a greater benefit to engaging a new situation and exploring unexpected stimuli, as there is little risk and a better opportunity of finding additional resources. In line with this reasoning, a large body of evidence indicates that the environment young animals experience is essential in determining how they develop their coping behaviours (see “
  <a rid="Sec18" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec18">What in the early-life environment affects later-life coping behaviours</a>” section). For example, rodent young who grow up in a large family context develop a greater awareness of social subtleties than young who receive only a little social stimulation (Ahern and Young 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">2009</a>; Branchi 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">2009</a>), and cichlids (
  <span class="italic">Neolamprologus pulcher</span>) raised in larger social context developed greater social competence (Fischer et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116" href="#CR116">2015</a>). Similarly, cichlids raised in the presence of predator fish compared to environments without predators develop more sensitive behaviour (Fischer et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117" href="#CR117">2017</a>). An excellent example of adaptiveness of early-life conditions is found in a study on zebra finches (
  <span class="italic">Taeniopygia guttata</span>). In this species, juveniles generally learn foraging skills from their parents. When juveniles were exposed to developmental stress, however, they switched to learning foraging skills exclusively from biologically unrelated adults. Stress has been suggested as an environmental cue (Farine et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112" href="#CR112">2015</a>) and may represent an honest signal that parental coping behaviours are insufficient and should not be copied.
 </p>
 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, too much sensitivity to details of the early-life environment can in turn lead to maladaptation, as environments are naturally changeable and prone to stochasticity. It is essential that developmental processes are maximally sensitive to those cues that are predictive of the environment (for example, low winter temperatures caused by a mini-ice age), and at the same time minimally sensitive to those that are caused by short-term stochastic processes (an especially chilly week). One way to navigate this trade-off is through sensitivity to maternal stress, which is increasingly argued as potentially beneficial to offspring (Sheriff et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR284" href="#CR284">2017</a>). Indiscriminate sensitivity causes vulnerability to behavioural mismatch with the environment later in life (Raubenheimer et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR256" href="#CR256">2012</a>; Jensen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157" href="#CR157">2014</a>). Being able to differentiate between predictive and stochastic early-life input is a challenge to developmental processes, especially due to the short developmental window available to most species (weeks to months), and especially in times of great change (Roberts et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR264" href="#CR264">2011</a>) where it cannot be assumed that parental environment equates offspring environment. Evolutionary speaking, it is therefore essential that developmental processes maintain a balance between robustness and adaptiveness (see also “
  <a rid="Sec29" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec29">Resilience and reversibility</a>” section). There is a need for sufficient sensitivity and specificity to relevant environmental cues, while at the same time minimising judgement errors, which sensitivity to early-life environments can in some circumstances provide (see “
  <a rid="Sec25" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec25">Stable or stuck across generations?</a>” section).
