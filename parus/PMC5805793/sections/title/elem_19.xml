 <p id="Par59" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After reviewing why and how the early-life environment affects coping behaviours, we provide an overview of factors in the early-life environment that have been shown to trigger developmental processes to generate different coping behaviours. We discuss habitat, parents, nutrition, social environment, a selection of less studied influences and finally stress as an overarching influence. Various factors in early life may affect the developmental trajectory simultaneously (Rödel and Monclús 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR267" href="#CR267">2011</a>) and interact with the kind of experiences animals have during their life, the way they interact with conspecifics, as well as various life-history traits. It is expected that there will be a lot of variation both within (Belsky and Pluess 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">2009b</a>) and between species in the extent to which environmental influences impact the different developmental systems. Furthermore, it should be noted that each of these influences likely impacts developmental processes differently depending on the sensitive window in development during which they are experienced (Fawcett and Frankenhuis 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113" href="#CR113">2015</a>). However, given the structured and inherently canalising nature of developmental processes (Ellis and Boyce 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104" href="#CR104">2008</a>), cross-species patterns are expected in the types of environmental influences that matter at different stages of development.
 </p>
 <p id="Par60" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As epigenetics are likely to be involved in each of the developmental processes listed in the “
  <a rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec11">How the early-life environment affects the development of coping/developmental processes affecting coping behaviours</a>” section, stress appears to be a relevant detrimental influence across all of the categories below, whether it concerns stress from maternal separation (Biagini et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">1998</a>), lack of nutrition or unpredictable nutrition (Krause et al.

  <p id="Par61" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within eligible studies in this review (see Supplementary materials), effects of early-life habitat conditions were studied by means of natural habitat (Kelley et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166" href="#CR166">2005</a>; Moretz et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR228" href="#CR228">2007a</a>; Aubret and Shine 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2008</a>; Sweeney et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR304" href="#CR304">2013</a>), housing environment (Bolhuis et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">2004</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">2005</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">2006</a>), restricted bedding (Fuentes et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123" href="#CR123">2014</a>) and environmental enrichment (Roberts et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR264" href="#CR264">2011</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par62" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most current work on the effects of early-life habitat on coping behaviours studies the question how laboratory and housing conditions affect animal’s coping style. Early-life housing conditions were extensively studied in pigs (
   <span class="italic">Sus domesticus</span>), where they were shown to affect coping behaviours: barren housed pigs were less active, less explorative and less playful and showed more social aggression than pigs raised in enriched housing (Bolhuis et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">2005</a>). Similarly, pigs from enriched housing were shown to have more difficulty responding to changes in a spatial discrimination maze than pigs from barren housing (Bolhuis et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">2004</a>), behaviour which relates to their ability to cope with changes in foraging conditions. Housing conditions did not affect all individuals equally: low-resisting pigs were more affected by adverse housing than high-resisting pigs across various behaviours, including chewing, manipulative and play behaviours (Bolhuis et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">2006</a>). In rats, behavioural effects due to restricted bedding during the first days after birth (in addition to another early life stressor) were shown to affect males and females differently across different coping behaviours (Fuentes et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123" href="#CR123">2014</a>). However, the effects of laboratory environment are by no means restricted to mammals. Laboratory-reared skiffia fish (
   <span class="italic">Skiffia multipunctata</span>) displayed increased courtship, aggression and curiosity towards a novel predator compared to pond-reared fish and commenced foraging on novel food more rapidly (Kelley et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166" href="#CR166">2005</a>). In juvenile Atlantic salmon (
   <span class="italic">Salmo salar</span>), exposure to enriched conditions improved learning and ability to navigate a maze without errors (Salvanes et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR274" href="#CR274">2013</a>). Similarly, enrichment of rearing environment was found to affect several aspects of mahseer fish (
   <span class="italic">Tor putitora</span>) behaviour: exploratory behaviour, predation and anti-predation response were higher in fish reared in enriched or semi-natural environments than in barren environments (Ullah et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR321" href="#CR321">2017</a>). Laboratory-reared spiders (penultimate 
   <span class="italic">Agelenopsis pennsylvanica</span>) never exhibited a behavioural syndrome between boldness and foraging aggressiveness, while field-reared penultimates (but not juveniles) did (Sweeney et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR304" href="#CR304">2013</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par63" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a more ecological setting, snakes (
   <span class="italic">Notechis scutatus</span>) were found to base habitat choice, an important life-history decision that affects coping success in many aspects of life, on the habitat type in which they had been reared—an adaptive effect as they were also found to be more effective in locomotion in these habitats than in others (Aubret and Shine 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2008</a>). There is some indication of effects of variation in temperature, humidity and wind speed, possibly modulated by resource availability, although this has not been studied specifically with regards to early-life environment (Love et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR193" href="#CR193">2013</a>). While there is increasing interests in the effects of urbanisation, habitat fragmentation and quality on behavioural development, few studies have specifically considered how experiencing such habitats during early-life affects coping behaviours later in life.
  </p>
  <p id="Par64" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It seems clear from the examples above that the early-life habitat has important effects on the development of coping behaviours, partially through the amount and quality of stimuli received, which impacts neurological development, and partially through a lack of experience with relevant environmental cues. Consequences of a suboptimal habitat include inability to survive in a natural setting, anxiety and aggressive behaviours, and difficulty in responding to novelty and change. Such effects of habitat and housing conditions experienced early in life are especially relevant with regards to experimental design of animal behaviour studies (Bolhuis et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">2006</a>; Trocino and Xiccato 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR319" href="#CR319">2006</a>) and the extent to which we can interpret coping behaviours from animals with non-ecologically valid early-life housing (Salvanes et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR274" href="#CR274">2013</a>), but are also interesting in relation to an animal’s ability to adapt to shifts in habitat quality or size and to better understand the impact of urban conditions on previously rural species (Lapiedra et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR184" href="#CR184">2017</a>; Miranda 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR221" href="#CR221">2017</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Parents</div>
  <p id="Par65" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In many of the studies we reviewed, the role of the parents is extensive. Parents affect their offspring through genes, through the security and nutrition they provide, through the example they set, through their parenting behaviours such as grooming and licking, and the behaviour they actively encourage in their offspring through means of correction and approval. In addition, mothers affect their offspring through hormonal influences (Dufty Jr et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98" href="#CR98">2002</a>; Weaver et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR339" href="#CR339">2004</a>; Champagne 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" href="#CR75">2011</a>; Giesing et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127" href="#CR127">2011</a>) during gestation. To an extent, and depending on the species, the environment the mother lives in actually creates the environment of her offspring (Duckworth et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" href="#CR97">2015</a>). While some studies include parent-offspring interactions in their definition of social interactions, as juveniles learn important behavioural systems from both parents and others in their social group, for the purpose of this study, we consider them separate influences in order to clarify effects unique to the parent-offspring relationship. Within eligible studies, parenting was studied especially in the last decade in the context of maternal isolation or separation (Biagini et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">1998</a>; Caldji et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">2000</a>; Martin 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR201" href="#CR201">2002</a>; Ruedi-Bettschen et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR273" href="#CR273">2004</a>; Moons et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR225" href="#CR225">2005</a>) and, more recently, maternal stress (Champagne and Meaney 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" href="#CR77">2006</a>; Kiryanova et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171" href="#CR171">2017</a>; Rooke et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR269" href="#CR269">2017</a>), which has often been related to intergenerational effects (see “
   <a rid="Sec25" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec25">Stable or stuck across generations?</a>” section), and parental care and provisioning (van Oers et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR328" href="#CR328">2015</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par66" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many studies found detrimental effects of maternal separation early in life. For example, rats (
   <span class="italic">Rattus rattus</span>) separated from their mothers early in life displayed reduced activity and risk taking, and increases in orienting time (Spivey et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR296" href="#CR296">2008</a>), while other rats showed impaired coping (Ruedi-Bettschen et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR273" href="#CR273">2004</a>). Calves (
   <span class="italic">Bos primigenius</span>) reared by mothers showed more escape and vigilance behaviour than automat-reared cows when faced with an isolation test, and displayed overall more social behaviours towards conspecifics (Wagner et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR335" href="#CR335">2013</a>). In addition, chimpanzees (
   <span class="italic">Pan troglodytes</span>) separated from their mothers and/or social group as juveniles showed decreased activity and increased abnormal behaviours, with stronger effects in younger individuals (Martin 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR201" href="#CR201">2002</a>). Other studies found an effect of early postnatal handling but not of maternal separation on the ability of juvenile rats to cope with novelty (Biagini et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">1998</a>), and adult rats who had been handled as juveniles showed reduced startle responsivity, increased exploration and decreased suppression of feeding, whereas those that were maternally separated as juveniles did not (Caldji et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">2000</a>). Such effects of handling (see also Núñez et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR238" href="#CR238">1996</a>; Spivey et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR296" href="#CR296">2008</a>) indicate that separation and handling cannot be considered comparable influences, and call for caution when studying the effects of parental separation. In addition, some studies have considered more complex systems and interactions between life history and parental behaviour on the young. For example, in Japanese quail (
   <span class="italic">C. japonica</span>), mothers of large broods emitted more maternal vocalisations at the start of mothering but covered the young less towards the end. Chicks in turn huddled more and had higher social motivation than chicks in small broods (Aigueperse et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">2017</a>). Impaired maternal care (Champagne et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" href="#CR76">2003</a>; Lindeyer et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR189" href="#CR189">2013</a>), which may in turn be caused by poor habitat conditions (Ivy et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153" href="#CR153">2008</a>), and maternal stress (Rooke et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR269" href="#CR269">2017</a>) have also been empirically linked to the development of coping behaviours.
  </p>
  <p id="Par67" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Beyond maternal stress, care and separation, some studies have looked at parental behavioural traits in relation to offspring coping, showing that juvenile cats (
   <span class="italic">Felis catus</span>) from friendly fathers were quicker to approach, touch and rub an unfamiliar person and remain in close contact with novel objects than those from unfriendly fathers (McCune 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR211" href="#CR211">1995</a>). In contrast, offspring of exploratory zebrafish females were always highly exploratory regardless of behavioural traits of the father (Wisenden et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR345" href="#CR345">2011</a>). Such similarities cannot blindly be ascribed to genetics. In zebra finches (
   <span class="italic">T. guttata</span>), offspring exploratory type was predicted by the exploratory behaviour of the foster, but not the genetic parents (Schuett et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR279" href="#CR279">2013</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par68" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, parental experience has been shown to affect offspring coping behaviours. In lizards (
   <span class="italic">Zootoca vivipara</span>), offspring of mothers exposed to predator cues dispersed three times more in an unfamiliar semi-natural environment than offspring from unexposed mothers (Bestion et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">2014</a>). In sticklebacks (
   <span class="italic">Gasterosteus aculeatus</span>), females exposed to predator cues produced offspring with altered behaviour, and males (who provide parental care) exposed to predator cues produced offspring that were less active (Bell et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2016</a>). Not only predatory experience but also social experience of parents can be a relevant factor. In wild cavies (
   <span class="italic">Cavia porcellus</span>), an unstable social environment experienced by mothers during pregnancy and lactation led to camouflage behaviours in male offspring, whereas a stable social environment led to earlier reproductive behaviour (Siegeler et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR288" href="#CR288">2017</a>). No differences were found between coping behaviours of cavies whose mothers experienced a socially unstable environment compared to those who experienced stable social conditions (Kemme et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167" href="#CR167">2008</a>). It should be emphasised that parental experience and parental stress are often overlapping factors in the studies reviewed here, and that while it is often assumed that parental exposure to predation constitutes as stress, it may have ecological implications beyond stress especially with regards to parental effects on offspring coping behaviours.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nutrition</div>
  <p id="Par69" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nutrition is perhaps the most important building block for development of the physical body. More recently, it has also been linked to the development of behaviour (Noguera et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR237" href="#CR237">2015</a>; van Oers et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR328" href="#CR328">2015</a>), as lack of appropriate nutrition affects the mechanics of developmental systems, potentially stunting or derailing healthy development. Several studies examined the effects of yolk reserves (Andersson and Hoglund 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2012</a>), food availability (Carere et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">2005</a>; Edenbrow and Croft 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" href="#CR99">2011</a>), food quality (Krause et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178" href="#CR178">2009</a>; Tremmel and Müller 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR317" href="#CR317">2013</a>) and body weight (Rödel and Monclús 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR267" href="#CR267">2011</a>) on coping behaviours and found that effects depend strongly on species and an interplay of surrounding factors.
  </p>
  <p id="Par70" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Exploration and activity are behaviours often studied in relation to early-life nutrition. Female zebra finches raised on low-quality food were faster to show exploration and foraging behaviours than those raised on high-quality food, although there were no differences in latency to move after the start of the experiments (Krause et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178" href="#CR178">2009</a>). Similarly, low availability of dietary micronutrients during the postnatal period was found to lead to reduced boldness in male zebra finches, but did not affect fear of novelty and did not affect females at all (Noguera et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR237" href="#CR237">2015</a>). In European rabbits (
   <span class="italic">O. cuniculus</span>), exploratory behaviour and anxiety levels were correlated with body mass in early life, but not with body mass and age at the time of testing (Rödel and Monclús 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR267" href="#CR267">2011</a>). In a species of beetle (
   <span class="italic">Phaedon cochlaeriae</span>), low-quality food induced boldness, and by extension, potential foraging success, while animals raised on high-quality food were more active (Tremmel and Müller 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR317" href="#CR317">2013</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par71" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, many studies found that food conditions during early-life affected later-life aggression. Young trouts (
   <span class="italic">O. mykiss</span>) with larger yolks showed more aggressive personality traits than siblings with smaller yolks and, subsequently, were more aggressive in territory establishment and more socially dominant (Andersson and Hoglund 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2012</a>). However, in mangrove killifish (
   <span class="italic">Kryptolebias marmoratus</span>), low food conditions reduced exploration but not boldness or aggression (Edenbrow and Croft 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" href="#CR99">2011</a>). In a selection line of great tits (
   <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) selected for fast exploration, food rationing was linked to increased aggression (Carere et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">2005</a>), yet in a different line of great tits, juveniles provisioned with less food exhibited a stronger stress response and faster exploration later in life than juveniles provisioned with more food (van Oers et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR328" href="#CR328">2015</a>). Bulb mites (
   <span class="italic">Rhyzoglyphus</span> sp
   <span class="italic">.</span>) raised on rich diets developed an aggressive phenotype, whereas those raised on poor nutrition became non-aggressive “scramblers” (Smallegange 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR293" href="#CR293">2011</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par72" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These studies indicate that the effects of nutrition do influence adult coping behaviours across many different species, but nutrition does not necessarily affect all behaviours, or both sexes, or in the same way. It has been argued that the quantity, quality and predictability of resources can act as ecological stressors in mothers (Love et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR193" href="#CR193">2013</a>) and, as such, affect their offspring through various developmental pathways. Negative consequences of food deprivation during ontogeny may reappear especially when environmental conditions deteriorate in adulthood (Krause et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178" href="#CR178">2009</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Social group</div>
  <p id="Par73" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relationship between individuals and a group of conspecifics is often referred to as their social environment or social group, which especially in recent years has been an increasingly studied topic in animal behaviour. The social group is important in processes of social learning (see “
   <a rid="Sec17" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec17">Social learning</a>” section) but also relates to safety from predators for animals living in groups, competition for resources and dominance interactions (Love et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR193" href="#CR193">2013</a>). Within selected studies, the effects of early-life social environment were studied quantitatively in the context of early-life social isolation (Van Den Berg et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR326" href="#CR326">1999</a>; Tuchscherer et al.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR263" href="#CR263">2017</a>), and qualitatively in the context of relationships with siblings and other conspecifics (Carere et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">2005</a>; Moretz et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR228" href="#CR228">2007a</a>; Hudson et al.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR346" href="#CR346">2014</a>). The effects of social group are predominantly studied in rodents, specifically rats. Frequency, duration and latency of various social behavioural elements such as social exploration, approach/following and anogenital sniffing were affected when juvenile rats were isolated from their social group. However, once social contact was initiated, a relatively normal behavioural pattern was displayed (Van Den Berg et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR326" href="#CR326">1999</a>). Other studies found that socially isolated juvenile rats had difficulty with social recognition (Tanaka et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR309" href="#CR309">2010</a>). In rodent species like rats and mice, social environment can be studied through the communal nest, an experimental setting similar to a natural nest, in which juveniles can interact with peers as well as with their mother and siblings (Branchi 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">2009</a>). Communally reared rats were found to display reduced anxiety-like behaviour when exposed to novel environments, and females were more subordinate and less aggressive when exposed to an intruder male (Curley et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" href="#CR82">2009</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par74" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The influence of the presence and absence of a social group has also been studied in other species. Group housing in zebra finches (
   <span class="italic">T. guttata</span>), for example, was related to a higher number of social interactions in males (Bölting and von Engelhardt 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">2017</a>). In cichlids (
   <span class="italic">N. pulcher</span>), fry raised with adults showed more aggressive and submissive behaviour to each other than fish raised with siblings only (Arnold and Taborsky 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">2010</a>). When early-life social rearing was combined with simulated predation threat in cichlids, individuals developed specialised behavioural competences leading to different developmental trajectories with respects to, among others, dispersal (Fischer et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117" href="#CR117">2017</a>). In addition, a study on water striders (Gerridae sp
   <span class="italic">.</span>) showed that being raised in a social environment affected the degree of behavioural plasticity males exhibited later in life, i.e. the flexibility they had to choose a coping behaviour depending on the situation at hand, something that can significantly affect a male’s fitness (Han and Brooks 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137" href="#CR137">2014</a>). Spiders (
   <span class="italic">Marpissa muscosa</span>) reared in groups are better at exploration of a maze and at sociality than those reared in isolation, which is especially relevant since isolated rearing adds no known additional stress in this species (Liedtke and Schneider 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR188" href="#CR188">2017</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par75" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Not only the presence or absence of the group was found to be relevant to behavioural development, but also size of the group. Litter size affected anxiety in rats in a non-linear way: young rats born to small- or large-sized litters had higher scores of anxiety-like behaviours than those from medium-sized litters (Rödel and Meyer 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR266" href="#CR266">2011</a>). A review on rabbits, rats and mice showed that early sibling relations, such as position in the huddle, contributed to the development of individual differences in behavioural style (Hudson et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151" href="#CR151">2011</a>). Group size also affected aggression, fear and display behaviours in black-headed gulls (
   <span class="italic">Larus ridibundus</span>), which was not reversed after birds were re-housed in larger groups (Groothuis and Mulekom 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132" href="#CR132">1991</a>). Rearing-group size and the time juveniles spent in these groups interactively influenced the development of social skills in cichlids (Fischer et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116" href="#CR116">2015</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par76" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Social group appears to not affect the development of all coping behaviours, even in species that are sensitive to social cues during development, nor does it necessarily affect sociality itself. An interesting study into the effects of housing different strains of zebrafish (
   <span class="italic">Danio rerio</span>) together as juveniles showed that the type of social experience during early life affected social behaviours: all mixed-group fish were more inclined to biting, while mixed-group fish of one strain were also more exploratory. No effects were found on activity, predator response or stress recovery (Moretz et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR229" href="#CR229">2007b</a>). In field crickets (
   <span class="italic">G. integer</span>), young males reared in the presence of conspecific acoustic sexual signals were less aggressive and less likely to become dominant relative to those reared in the absence of acoustic signals (DiRienzo et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93" href="#CR93">2012</a>). Studies such as these show that there is a need to look beyond simple presence/absence of social group when studying sociality as an early-life factor impacting coping behaviours.

  <p id="Par77" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are many environmental influences beyond habitat, parents, nutrition and social group, which affect the developmental processes leading to coping behaviours. Among them, predation is perhaps the most studied due to its evolutionary relevance, although it is unclear whether it is also the most relevant to development. The lesser studied early-life influences appear to be very relevant in affecting development of coping behaviours, either by affecting the coping behaviour directly or by affecting the degree to which coping behaviours are canalised into behavioural syndromes or animal personalities.</p>
  <p id="Par78" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Predation is considered a very strong selection pressure. Predation can have a very strong impact on behavioural processes. Even a single cat encounter was shown to cause lasting increases in anxious behaviour in laboratory rats (Adamec and Shallow 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">1993</a>). The effects of predator cues are often studied in relation to behavioural syndromes consisting of multiple coping behaviours (Bell and Sih 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">2007</a>; Brown et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">2013</a>). Tadpoles (
   <span class="italic">Rana dalmatina</span>) reared alone and without predatory cues showed no personality and no behavioural syndrome between activity and risk-taking behaviours, while those raised with predator cues displayed activity and risk-taking personality traits, and those raised with predators and conspecifics both displayed an activity—risk-taking behavioural syndrome (Urszán et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR325" href="#CR325">2015</a>). The effects of predation are neither consistent nor predictable. Wild-caught guppies (
   <span class="italic">Poecilia reticulata</span>) born and raised in high predation localities showed more boldness than those from low predation localities (Harris et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138" href="#CR138">2010</a>), rather than less. Understanding the effects of predation on behavioural development and coping is increasingly relevant in relation to human disturbance of natural populations, as to a certain extent, human-caused disturbance can be experienced by animals as a kind of predation (Frid and Dill 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122" href="#CR122">2002</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par79" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Increasingly, immunology is also considered a relevant early-life influence on behavioural development. In mallard ducks (
   <span class="italic">Anas platyrhynchos</span>), non-pathogenic immune challenges, administered at different stages of development, were found to affect both activity and exploratory behaviour, as well as colour-dependent novel object exploration. Specifically, individuals immune-challenged during mid and late developmental stages were more active in novel environments (Butler et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">2012</a>). In mice, pups born through C-section showed more anxiety behaviours in later life than those born vaginally, presumably through changes in the microbiota gut-brain axis (Morais et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR226" href="#CR226">2017</a>). Similarly, neonatal exposure to environmental bacteria was shown to alter the development of anxiety-like behaviours in Fischer-344 rats, which expressed during adulthood but not during adolescence (Walker et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR337" href="#CR337">2004</a>). In field crickets (
   <span class="italic">G. integer</span>), early pathogen exposure did not influence mean boldness behaviour directly, but it did affect the presence of a personality construct (DiRienzo et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" href="#CR92">2015</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par80" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other influences include early-life cognitive stimulation, which in case of the red junglefowl (
   <span class="italic">G. gallus</span>) altered later-life personality traits of vigilance and escape attempts (Zidar et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR352" href="#CR352">2017</a>) and in case of dogs decreased fear of novel objects (Pluijmakers et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR250" href="#CR250">2010</a>). Photoperiod, especially in tandem with birth weight and size rank in the litter, was shown to affect exploration and boldness, in that where heavy females born in spring were more bold and explorative, but heavy females born in autumn were less explorative. Lighter females showed no such difference (Guenther and Trillmich 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134" href="#CR134">2013</a>). Related to this, it has been suggested that differences in photoperiod and acoustic environment were the cause for conflicting results between studies into zebra finches’ (
   <span class="italic">T. guttata</span>) social behaviour (Bölting and von Engelhardt 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">2017</a>). In dogs, the largest environmental factor associated with separation anxiety and stress sensitivity to noise was the amount of daily exercise during early life (Tiira and Lohi 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR316" href="#CR316">2015</a>).There is a growing interest in human-influenced effects on behavioural development, often in the context of global change, on topics including human disturbance, ecological stressors, temperature and climate variability, several of which are reviewed in Love et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR193" href="#CR193">2013</a>). Some human-influenced early-life factors that were shown to affect coping behaviours include pollution effects like lower visibility or nutritional richness (Krause et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178" href="#CR178">2009</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stress</div>
  <p id="Par81" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is overwhelming empirical evidence that negative early environmental influences impact adult behaviour (Blanchard et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">2001</a>; O’Mahony et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR239" href="#CR239">2009</a>; Enoch et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106" href="#CR106">2010</a>; McClelland et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR208" href="#CR208">2011</a>; Burton and Metcalfe 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">2014</a>; Bolton et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">2017</a>). The effects of such negative influences are often clustered as “stress”. Rather than a separate type of early-life influence, stress represents unfavourable conditions beyond what the animal’s biology can easily cope with and can occur in many variations (Moberg 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR224" href="#CR224">1985</a>; Belsky and Pluess 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">2009b</a>; McClelland et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR208" href="#CR208">2011</a>). Stress during early life can cause disease and cognitive impairment but has been also argued to program developmental pathways (Farine et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112" href="#CR112">2015</a>; see also “
   <a rid="Sec27" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec27">Preparing for hardship</a>” section). Stress experienced by the previous generation can produce profound and long-lasting perturbations of individual adaptive capacities, as shown in prenatally stressed rats who displayed impaired social play behaviour, enhanced anxiety and increased stress reactivity (Morley-Fletcher et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR230" href="#CR230">2003</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par82" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It would be too short-sighted to see early-life stress only as a detrimental factor. In a very inclusive review on the effects of early-life stress in squirrel monkeys (
   <span class="italic">Saimiri sciureus</span>), it is described how brief intermittent exposure to early life stress (through short maternal separation) actually promoted the development of arousal regulation and resilience, rather than leading to vulnerability (Lyons et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR195" href="#CR195">2010</a>; Beehner and Bergman 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2017</a>). At 9 months of age, previously separated monkeys showed fewer signs of anxiety and increased exploration compared to non-separated monkeys, and at 2.5 years of age, they exhibited more curiosity in stress-free situations. These differences could not be ascribed to maternal mediation or long-lasting changes in maternal care following separation (Parker et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR246" href="#CR246">2007</a>). However, very similar experiments in rats showed phenotypic changes including increased anxiety and health problems (O’Mahony et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR239" href="#CR239">2009</a>). Rats who were exposed to chronic social, physical and predation stress in adolescence were slower to explore a foraging patch in later life under low threat, but also obtained more rewards under high threat (Chaby et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">2015</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par83" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Examples such as these illustrate that animal behavioural development is complex, and operates as a well-tuned system to adjust behaviour to the experienced environment both when that environment is favourable, and when it causes stress. Findings on male Balb/c strain mice, for example, suggested that exposure to adverse early-life conditions did not make mice more vulnerable to later-life stress, but rather prepared them to better cope with a challenging adult environment (Santarelli et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR276" href="#CR276">2017</a>). As most empirical studies consider stress through maternal separation in mammals, there is insufficient comparative material to indicate how stress in any of the other main environmental influences would impact development differentially. Some theoretical models regarding early-life stress on behavioural syndromes are given in Sih (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR289" href="#CR289">2011</a>)).
