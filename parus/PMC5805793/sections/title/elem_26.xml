 <p id="Par84" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Perhaps one of the most important environmental challenges for animals to cope with in our current world is change. Changes in the environment are especially unsettling because they require animals to respond in new, different ways, with no guarantee that the response they select will be functional. While developmental processes (see “
  <a rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec11">How the early-life environment affects the development of coping/developmental processes affecting coping behaviours</a>” section) have formed over evolutionary time through survival of those young animals who most effectively adjusted their coping behaviours to environmental cues, such processes may suddenly be disadvantageous under changing conditions. There is growing evidence from natural systems for intergenerational effects of early-life conditions (Berman 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">1990</a>; Maestripieri 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR196" href="#CR196">2005</a>; Matthews and Phillips 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR205" href="#CR205">2010</a>; Zimmer et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR353" href="#CR353">2017</a>), where environmental experiences during ontogeny of one generation affect the expression of phenotypes in the next generation (Champagne 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">2010</a>; Moran et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR227" href="#CR227">2010</a>; Cowan et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" href="#CR80">2016</a>). Such effects can be generated by multiple environmental cues, affect offspring in many ways and can be transmitted directly or indirectly by both parental lines for several generations (Burton and Metcalfe 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">2014</a>). Through intergenerational transmission, once-adaptive robust developmental processes may cause offspring to be adapted to environmental conditions of several generations ago rather than their current or predicted future environment. In addition, developmental processes for many animal species may not be equipped to acquire accurate information about or under novel environmental conditions, such as street lights and urban noise (Miranda et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR222" href="#CR222">2013</a>). Given the strong effects of the early-life environment to shape a multitude of behaviours and coping skills later in life, we have to ask the question: in our current radically and fast changing environment, do our early life experiences help to create stable behaviours and coping skills, or do they leave individuals stuck in the past?
 </p>
 <p id="Par85" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we discuss literature pertaining to the extent to which environmental effects on the development of coping behaviours allow for a stable adaptation to the environment, with the flexibility to adjust to change, or alternatively make animals vulnerable to unfavourable traits inherited from previous generations. In the literature, there exists a confusing overlap in terminology between parental effects (see “
  <a rid="Sec12" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec12">Parental effects</a>” section) and intergenerational effects. To mediate this confusion, we define intergenerational transmission as non-genomic effects in which a particular phenotypic expression is transmitted from one generation to the next, whereas maternal effects can be considered simply the effects of maternal phenotype on offspring phenotype. Following this, to borrow an example from studies on humans, cases where offspring experience behavioural disorders linked to maternal smoking during pregnancy (Abbott and Winzer-Serhan 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2012</a>) constitute maternal effects, while cases where offspring suffer from a smoking addiction due to maternal smoking during pregnancy (Hellström-Lindahl and Nordberg 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143" href="#CR143">2002</a>) should be considered intergenerational transmission of coping.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Flexible adaptations</div>
  <p id="Par86" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the most-named advantages of developmental sensitivity to early-life environments is that it allows animals to generate phenotypes more likely to be adaptive, regardless of the genetic blueprint. One of the ways in which this has been demonstrated is through mediation of previous negative effects, thus re-adjusting developmental processes that may have become derailed by adversity. The early-life environment seems to have a capacity to normalise behavioural dysfunctions produced by prenatal stress, at least in some situations. Juvenile prenatally stressed rats showed reduced play behaviour and increased emotionality. Enriched housing increased the amount of time these juveniles engaged in positive species-typical behaviour and reduced emotionality, and mediated induced immune challenges (Laviola et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185" href="#CR185">2004</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par87" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recently, with the rise in studies into global change, intergenerational effects have been mentioned specifically as a mechanism through which animals can adjust to fast changing and novel environments that their genetic make-up, as a product of natural selection, has not prepared them for (Meylan et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR219" href="#CR219">2012</a>; Miranda et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR222" href="#CR222">2013</a>; Lapiedra et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR184" href="#CR184">2017</a>; Spadafora 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR295" href="#CR295">2017</a>), although such effects might be rarer than commonly thought (Uller et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR323" href="#CR323">2013</a>). This may be particularly relevant in situations where animals have to adapt their coping behaviours quickly to evolutionary novel environments, as found in the move from rural to urban habitats (Vincze et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR332" href="#CR332">2016</a>; Miranda 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR221" href="#CR221">2017</a>). For example, lizards (
   <span class="italic">Anolis sagrei</span>) from a population in urban areas were more tolerant of humans, less aggressive and bolder after a simulated predator attack and spent more time exploring new environment than lizards from a population in a nearby forest. These changes in behaviour were suggested to be due to adaptive behavioural adaptations to novel selective regimes (Lapiedra et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR184" href="#CR184">2017</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Preparing for hardship</div>
  <p id="Par88" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast with prevailing views that stress effects are cumulative and increase stress vulnerability throughout life (Santarelli et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR276" href="#CR276">2017</a>), many recent studies have begun to suggest that the effects of early-life environment may help buffer later-life hardship. By receiving cues early in life that the environment in adulthood is likely to be difficult, animals have an opportunity to adjust their development towards coping behaviours that are more likely to be successful. For example, male Balb/c strain mice were exposed to adverse and supportive early-life conditions, and then given a socially adverse or supportive environment in adulthood. Negative consequences for stress responsiveness and anxiety-related coping behaviours were found mainly in mice that were exposed to either early-life or adult adversity, but not in mice that were exposed to both (Santarelli et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR276" href="#CR276">2017</a>). Another study in mice found that early-life stress through maternal separation improved coping with and recovery from a traumatic social experience in adulthood (Zoicas and Neumann 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR354" href="#CR354">2016</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par89" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Preparatory effects of the early-life environment are not limited to stress. Juvenile cinnamon anemone fish (
   <span class="italic">Amphiprion melanopus</span>) were less reactive and had poorer locomotive performance when exposed to elevated CO
   <sub>2</sub> levels, but parental exposure to high CO
   <sub>2</sub> reduced these effects in some—but not all—traits (Allan et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">2014</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Passing on the past</div>
  <p id="Par90" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is increasing evidence that environmental effects experienced even before conception can be transmissible to subsequent generations (Burton and Metcalfe 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">2014</a>). There are several cases, notably in rodents, in which unfavourable conditions in previous generations negatively impacted coping behaviours of current and future generations. For example, dams that were exposed to chronic social stress displayed impaired maternal care to their first generation (F1) offspring, who in turn displayed impaired maternal care to their (F2) offspring. Both male and female offspring displayed decreased social behaviour (Babb et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">2014</a>). Hypo-responsiveness to stress across several behavioural categories was shown in rhesus macaques (
   <span class="italic">Macaca mulatta</span>) whose mothers had been exposed to early-life stress, even when those mothers no longer displayed hypo-responsiveness themselves (Kinnally et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169" href="#CR169">2013</a>). Similar patterns were found in Japanese quail (
   <span class="italic">C. japonica</span>), where prenatal stress experienced by mothers resulted in the same stress-coping traits in the offspring across all phenotypic levels studied, including behavioural traits (Zimmer et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR353" href="#CR353">2017</a>). Abusive behaviour as well can be transmitted across generations: more than half of the female rhesus monkeys who were abused by their mothers during their first month of life displayed abusive parenting with their firstborn offspring, regardless of whether they were reared by their biological mother or a foster mother (Maestripieri 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR196" href="#CR196">2005</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par91" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A recent term for negative effects from multiple generations ago is ancestral stress or ancestral trauma (McCreary et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR210" href="#CR210">2016</a>; Ambeskovic et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">2017</a>; Faraji et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110" href="#CR110">2017</a>), to differentiate from single-generation parental effects. There is some indication that ancestral trauma can be advantageous to a certain extent, but causes greater vulnerability to additional stressors later in life. In rats, a family history of recurrent ancestral prenatal stress was related to improved movement and skilled reaching, relevant in foraging behaviours, compared to rats without ancestral stress. The advantage of ancestral stress disappeared when rats experienced another stressor in adulthood, suggesting multiple stressors may limit behavioural flexibility rather than improve it (Faraji et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110" href="#CR110">2017</a>), even in a system where ancestral stress leads to adaptive developmental adjustments. In similar studies, social isolation during later-life stress caused cognitive retardation and reduced stress coping in rats from ancestral stress lines, but not in rats from unstressed lines (Faraji et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111" href="#CR111">2017</a>). In mice, postnatal trauma of unpredictable maternal separation and maternal stress altered coping behaviours in adverse conditions both in males when adult, and in their adult male offspring. These behavioural symptoms were not transmitted to the next generation when fathers experienced an enriched environment (Gapp et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126" href="#CR126">2016</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par92" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is not only negative experience that is passed on through intergenerational effects, however. Mouse dams rearing pups in communal nests displayed increased maternal care, to which their F1 offspring displayed reduced anxiety-like behaviour when placed in a novel environment, and increased quality of parenting behaviours towards their own offspring. F2 offspring also displayed reduced anxiety-like behaviour and better parenting compared to mice raised outside a communal nest (Curley et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" href="#CR82">2009</a>). An elegant early study in vervet monkeys (
   <span class="italic">Cercopithecus aethiops sabaeus</span>) showed that the amount of contact mothers had with their offspring was related to the amount of contact they themselves had with their mothers. In this, a female’s experience in infancy was a better predictor of adult mothering than variables such as social learning as a juvenile, shared circumstances and average similarity between mothers and daughters (Fairbanks 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109" href="#CR109">1989</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par93" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effects of (negative) environmental cues across multiple generations have been studied almost exclusively in rodents and are often targeted to understanding depression, anxiety and effects of stress in humans. This one-sided approach makes it more difficult to place empirical findings in an ecologically relevant context, although it does provide advantages in testing the limits of the developmental system in ways ecological studies in the wild would not. It might be argued, given the positive effects on coping behaviours consistently shown by cage enrichment and communal housing, that laboratory conditions in themselves represent multigenerational environmental stress on the level of habitat, parents, social group and possibly other influences.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Resilience and reversibility</div>
  <p id="Par94" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Important concepts when discussing the adaptive advantages and disadvantages that come with sensitivity of developmental processes to early-life conditions are resilience and reversibility. Resilience, the capacity to recover from difficulties, is important in estimating the strength with which negative experiences continue to influence animal health and fitness (Walker et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR336" href="#CR336">2006</a>; Cicchetti 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">2010</a>). Reversibility relates to the ability to reverse or undo the effects of (harmful) environmental conditions (Francis et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119" href="#CR119">2002</a>; Ruedi-Bettschen et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR273" href="#CR273">2004</a>), and is especially important once coping behaviours have been established yet found unfavourable, or when the conditions on which their development was based have changed. While adaptation to early-life conditions can clearly be an adaptive mechanism, the ability to reverse the effects of early-life environments seems equally adaptive especially in the case of improved conditions or changed environments from infancy to adulthood.
  </p>
  <p id="Par95" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although some negative influences of the early-life environment have been shown to be reversible, this reversibility does not appear to apply to all affected coping behaviours. While there is evidence that beneficial later-life circumstances can partially remedy or even completely negate developmental limitations (Salzen and Meyer 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR275" href="#CR275">1968</a>; Francis et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119" href="#CR119">2002</a>; Gabriel 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124" href="#CR124">2005</a>), there is also evidence that negative experiences during development continue to negatively affect behavioural functioning for the entire lifespan of an individual (Champagne 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">2010</a>). For example, the effects of prenatal stress have been shown to be reversible by enrichment of the physical environment. Cage enrichment during pre-adolescence increased social behaviour and reduced response to stress in prenatally stressed rats, while the same enrichment showed no effects on non-stressed rats (Morley-Fletcher et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR230" href="#CR230">2003</a>). In part, this may be linked to the timing of the negative influence (Keiley et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165" href="#CR165">2001</a>; Knudsen 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172" href="#CR172">2004</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par96" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reversibility of early-life damage such as stress experienced by either mother or child has been shown in mice (Curley et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" href="#CR82">2009</a>), rats (Champagne et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" href="#CR76">2003</a>; Cui et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">2006</a>) and humans (Keay and Bandler 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164" href="#CR164">2001</a>; Francis et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119" href="#CR119">2002</a>). Reversibility of imprinting on early-life stimuli, however, seems to be much harder as imprinted behaviours appear quite stable throughout later in life even with extensive training upon other stimuli (Salzen and Meyer 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR275" href="#CR275">1968</a>). As the processes of early perceptual learning, habituation and conditioning as such have not received much attention, little is known as to the differences between these processes in resilience and reversibility. However, the reversibility of the effects that social learning has on coping behaviours has been studied to a greater extent, and the effects of maternal separation and social deprivation have been shown to be reversible in some species and some situations. For example, for young chimpanzees who grew up without their mother or without conspecifics at all, recovery of healthy behaviours may occur with access to an enriched social environment (Martin 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR201" href="#CR201">2002</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par97" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In some cases, especially when environmental conditions impact developmental processes that occur early in ontogeny or canalisation, negative behavioural consequences of environmental influences may not be reversible. In such a case, the individual finds itself stuck with the coping strategies developed during early life and may suffer fitness consequences. For example, cross-over studies in animals suggest that exposure to adversity in early life does not necessarily increase fitness in tough adult environments. Rather, those malnourished in early life do worse in adult environments, but particularly so in tough adult conditions (Taborsky 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR307" href="#CR307">2006b</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par98" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In other cases, however, the effects of early-life conditions, even when they have been carried over across many generations, may still be reversed. For example, the Balb/c mouse strain is often considered “socially-incompetent” and anxious, yet when the young of this strain were reared in a communal nest instead of under regular laboratory conditions, anxiety-like behaviours and parental care were improved in both first- and second-generation offspring (Curley et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" href="#CR82">2009</a>). Results such as these imply that the harmful coping behaviours in this strain may be a result of intergenerational effects of standard housing conditions, which can be attenuated both within and across generations in cases where the appropriate environmental cues allow the harmful coping behaviours to become reversible. This example from animal models is encouraging and may be applied in other species, including humans.
