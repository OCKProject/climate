 <p id="Par81" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is overwhelming empirical evidence that negative early environmental influences impact adult behaviour (Blanchard et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">2001</a>; O’Mahony et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR239" href="#CR239">2009</a>; Enoch et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106" href="#CR106">2010</a>; McClelland et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR208" href="#CR208">2011</a>; Burton and Metcalfe 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">2014</a>; Bolton et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">2017</a>). The effects of such negative influences are often clustered as “stress”. Rather than a separate type of early-life influence, stress represents unfavourable conditions beyond what the animal’s biology can easily cope with and can occur in many variations (Moberg 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR224" href="#CR224">1985</a>; Belsky and Pluess 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">2009b</a>; McClelland et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR208" href="#CR208">2011</a>). Stress during early life can cause disease and cognitive impairment but has been also argued to program developmental pathways (Farine et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112" href="#CR112">2015</a>; see also “
  <a rid="Sec27" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec27">Preparing for hardship</a>” section). Stress experienced by the previous generation can produce profound and long-lasting perturbations of individual adaptive capacities, as shown in prenatally stressed rats who displayed impaired social play behaviour, enhanced anxiety and increased stress reactivity (Morley-Fletcher et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR230" href="#CR230">2003</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par82" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It would be too short-sighted to see early-life stress only as a detrimental factor. In a very inclusive review on the effects of early-life stress in squirrel monkeys (
  <span class="italic">Saimiri sciureus</span>), it is described how brief intermittent exposure to early life stress (through short maternal separation) actually promoted the development of arousal regulation and resilience, rather than leading to vulnerability (Lyons et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR195" href="#CR195">2010</a>; Beehner and Bergman 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2017</a>). At 9 months of age, previously separated monkeys showed fewer signs of anxiety and increased exploration compared to non-separated monkeys, and at 2.5 years of age, they exhibited more curiosity in stress-free situations. These differences could not be ascribed to maternal mediation or long-lasting changes in maternal care following separation (Parker et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR246" href="#CR246">2007</a>). However, very similar experiments in rats showed phenotypic changes including increased anxiety and health problems (O’Mahony et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR239" href="#CR239">2009</a>). Rats who were exposed to chronic social, physical and predation stress in adolescence were slower to explore a foraging patch in later life under low threat, but also obtained more rewards under high threat (Chaby et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par83" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Examples such as these illustrate that animal behavioural development is complex, and operates as a well-tuned system to adjust behaviour to the experienced environment both when that environment is favourable, and when it causes stress. Findings on male Balb/c strain mice, for example, suggested that exposure to adverse early-life conditions did not make mice more vulnerable to later-life stress, but rather prepared them to better cope with a challenging adult environment (Santarelli et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR276" href="#CR276">2017</a>). As most empirical studies consider stress through maternal separation in mammals, there is insufficient comparative material to indicate how stress in any of the other main environmental influences would impact development differentially. Some theoretical models regarding early-life stress on behavioural syndromes are given in Sih (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR289" href="#CR289">2011</a>)).
