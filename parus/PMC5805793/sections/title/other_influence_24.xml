 <p id="Par77" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are many environmental influences beyond habitat, parents, nutrition and social group, which affect the developmental processes leading to coping behaviours. Among them, predation is perhaps the most studied due to its evolutionary relevance, although it is unclear whether it is also the most relevant to development. The lesser studied early-life influences appear to be very relevant in affecting development of coping behaviours, either by affecting the coping behaviour directly or by affecting the degree to which coping behaviours are canalised into behavioural syndromes or animal personalities.</p>
 <p id="Par78" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Predation is considered a very strong selection pressure. Predation can have a very strong impact on behavioural processes. Even a single cat encounter was shown to cause lasting increases in anxious behaviour in laboratory rats (Adamec and Shallow 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">1993</a>). The effects of predator cues are often studied in relation to behavioural syndromes consisting of multiple coping behaviours (Bell and Sih 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">2007</a>; Brown et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">2013</a>). Tadpoles (
  <span class="italic">Rana dalmatina</span>) reared alone and without predatory cues showed no personality and no behavioural syndrome between activity and risk-taking behaviours, while those raised with predator cues displayed activity and risk-taking personality traits, and those raised with predators and conspecifics both displayed an activity—risk-taking behavioural syndrome (Urszán et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR325" href="#CR325">2015</a>). The effects of predation are neither consistent nor predictable. Wild-caught guppies (
  <span class="italic">Poecilia reticulata</span>) born and raised in high predation localities showed more boldness than those from low predation localities (Harris et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138" href="#CR138">2010</a>), rather than less. Understanding the effects of predation on behavioural development and coping is increasingly relevant in relation to human disturbance of natural populations, as to a certain extent, human-caused disturbance can be experienced by animals as a kind of predation (Frid and Dill 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122" href="#CR122">2002</a>).

 <p id="Par79" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Increasingly, immunology is also considered a relevant early-life influence on behavioural development. In mallard ducks (
  <span class="italic">Anas platyrhynchos</span>), non-pathogenic immune challenges, administered at different stages of development, were found to affect both activity and exploratory behaviour, as well as colour-dependent novel object exploration. Specifically, individuals immune-challenged during mid and late developmental stages were more active in novel environments (Butler et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">2012</a>). In mice, pups born through C-section showed more anxiety behaviours in later life than those born vaginally, presumably through changes in the microbiota gut-brain axis (Morais et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR226" href="#CR226">2017</a>). Similarly, neonatal exposure to environmental bacteria was shown to alter the development of anxiety-like behaviours in Fischer-344 rats, which expressed during adulthood but not during adolescence (Walker et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR337" href="#CR337">2004</a>). In field crickets (
  <span class="italic">G. integer</span>), early pathogen exposure did not influence mean boldness behaviour directly, but it did affect the presence of a personality construct (DiRienzo et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" href="#CR92">2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par80" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other influences include early-life cognitive stimulation, which in case of the red junglefowl (
  <span class="italic">G. gallus</span>) altered later-life personality traits of vigilance and escape attempts (Zidar et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR352" href="#CR352">2017</a>) and in case of dogs decreased fear of novel objects (Pluijmakers et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR250" href="#CR250">2010</a>). Photoperiod, especially in tandem with birth weight and size rank in the litter, was shown to affect exploration and boldness, in that where heavy females born in spring were more bold and explorative, but heavy females born in autumn were less explorative. Lighter females showed no such difference (Guenther and Trillmich 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134" href="#CR134">2013</a>). Related to this, it has been suggested that differences in photoperiod and acoustic environment were the cause for conflicting results between studies into zebra finches’ (
  <span class="italic">T. guttata</span>) social behaviour (Bölting and von Engelhardt 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">2017</a>). In dogs, the largest environmental factor associated with separation anxiety and stress sensitivity to noise was the amount of daily exercise during early life (Tiira and Lohi 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR316" href="#CR316">2015</a>).There is a growing interest in human-influenced effects on behavioural development, often in the context of global change, on topics including human disturbance, ecological stressors, temperature and climate variability, several of which are reviewed in Love et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR193" href="#CR193">2013</a>). Some human-influenced early-life factors that were shown to affect coping behaviours include pollution effects like lower visibility or nutritional richness (Krause et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178" href="#CR178">2009</a>).
