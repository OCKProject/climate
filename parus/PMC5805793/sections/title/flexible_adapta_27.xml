 <p id="Par86" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the most-named advantages of developmental sensitivity to early-life environments is that it allows animals to generate phenotypes more likely to be adaptive, regardless of the genetic blueprint. One of the ways in which this has been demonstrated is through mediation of previous negative effects, thus re-adjusting developmental processes that may have become derailed by adversity. The early-life environment seems to have a capacity to normalise behavioural dysfunctions produced by prenatal stress, at least in some situations. Juvenile prenatally stressed rats showed reduced play behaviour and increased emotionality. Enriched housing increased the amount of time these juveniles engaged in positive species-typical behaviour and reduced emotionality, and mediated induced immune challenges (Laviola et al.

 <p id="Par87" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recently, with the rise in studies into global change, intergenerational effects have been mentioned specifically as a mechanism through which animals can adjust to fast changing and novel environments that their genetic make-up, as a product of natural selection, has not prepared them for (Meylan et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR219" href="#CR219">2012</a>; Miranda et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR222" href="#CR222">2013</a>; Lapiedra et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR184" href="#CR184">2017</a>; Spadafora 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR295" href="#CR295">2017</a>), although such effects might be rarer than commonly thought (Uller et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR323" href="#CR323">2013</a>). This may be particularly relevant in situations where animals have to adapt their coping behaviours quickly to evolutionary novel environments, as found in the move from rural to urban habitats (Vincze et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR332" href="#CR332">2016</a>; Miranda 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR221" href="#CR221">2017</a>). For example, lizards (
  <span class="italic">Anolis sagrei</span>) from a population in urban areas were more tolerant of humans, less aggressive and bolder after a simulated predator attack and spent more time exploring new environment than lizards from a population in a nearby forest. These changes in behaviour were suggested to be due to adaptive behavioural adaptations to novel selective regimes (Lapiedra et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR184" href="#CR184">2017</a>).
