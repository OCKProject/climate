   <a rid="pone.0017857-Fischer1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0017857-Fischer1">[37]</a> with study sites on the Schwäbische Alb near the city of Münsingen (south-western Germany; N 48°25′, E 9°26′) and in the Hainich-Dün National Park near Mühlhausen (central Germany; N 51°13′, E 10°27′). The Schwäbische Alb is characterized by submontane calcareous bedrock (500–900 m a.s.l.) with 6–7°C annual mean temperatures and 700–1,000 mm annual mean precipitation. About 41% of the area is covered by forest patches typically consisting of beech, deciduous-mixed and spruce monocultures, whereas oak trees are relatively rare. The Hainich-Dün consists of a limestone area (300–400 m a.s.l.) with an annual mean temperature of 6.5–7.5°C and annual mean precipitation of 750–800 mm. Approximately 24% of the area is covered with forest; the area contains one of the largest forests of Germany with 16,000 hectares of beech and beech-mixed forests that harbour numerous oak trees within stands, (for more details, see Fischer et al.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conducted experiments, over two consecutive years, to exclude vertebrate predators from oaks. In 2007, we randomly selected 12 young common oaks (
   <span class="italic">Quercus robur</span>, ≈ 15 years old) along a forest track within a 3-ha oak plantation (pole wood) on the Schwäbische Alb. In 2008, we conducted experiments on 16 randomly selected mature trees with eight trees on the Schwäbische Alb and eight trees in the Hainich-Dün (both stands ≈ 80–120 years). On the Schwäbische Alb, oaks were located at the edge of a beech-dominated forest. In Hainich-Dün, the oaks stood within a patch of deciduous-mixed forest. The distance between individual trees ranged from 15 to 1,700 m (mean 171.5±203.7 m) within each exploratory.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Half of the trees were used as controls and half were fitted each with 150-m
   <span class="sup">2</span> bird exclusion nets (mesh size 20×20 mm, polypropylene, material thickness 1–1.5 mm, black, Huck, Asslar-Berghausen, Germany). Nets covered the whole canopy of young trees and about one third of the total crown volume (≈ 1,000 m
   <span class="sup">3</span>) of mature oaks. The nets were tied at the stem to prevent birds and bats from entering. The canopy nets of mature trees were installed by professional tree climbers. Trees were covered with nets between July and October 2007 and between June and October 2008 (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Leaves of young oaks were repeatedly sampled during the vegetation period between July and October in 2007 (three times: 18-Jul, 29-Aug, and 08-Oct) and leaves from mature trees were collected between June and October in 2008 (four times: 02-Jun, 25-Jul, 08-Sep, and 17-Oct) to assess leaf damage. Each sample consisted of 60 randomly collected leaves per tree. Although this sample comprised only a small proportion of leaves available in a tree crown, we expect this random sample to be sufficient to examining treatment effects on relative herbivory. Our sample size followed other studies about the impact of birds on leaf damage [e.g., 13]. The leaves were flattened with a Perspex plane on millimetre paper and photographed with a digital camera (350D, Canon, Tokyo, Japan).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each leaf, we calculated leaf damage by differentiating between mean percentage of damaged leaf area and mean number of holes (≥1 mm
   <span class="sup">2</span>) per leaf chewed by arthropods. Missing leaf area was measured with ImageJ 1.40 (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA) by using a polygon selection tool. If holes were located at the edge of the leaf, the missing edge was manually reconstructed. The remaining undamaged leaf area was measured with WinRhizo

The treatment and time of leaf sampling were used as fixed effects, whereas the randomly selected individual trees were considered as random effects in the models. Models were fitted separately for the two sampling years and regions. To analyse the effects of the study site and the age of the trees on leaf damage, we constructed another GLMM by using treatment, study site, age of trees, and sampling time as fixed effects. Tree individuals were treated again as a random effect in this model. Significance of treatment was tested by a comparison of models fitted with and without treatment with the
