 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Birds were monitored near the study trees within a 50-m radius. We conducted five 60-minute surveys between June and October 2007 near young oaks and between May and October 2008 near mature oaks and investigated species richness and abundance of birds on the basis of sightings and acoustic encounters.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, we used bat monitoring data of a large-scale monitoring study on the Schwäbische Alb and in the Hainich-Dün that was conducted in the vicinity of the study trees. Species richness and activity of bats were acoustically recorded by conducting a line-transect monitoring with a bat detector (Pettersson D1000X) and subsequent analysis of the recorded calls in the lab (Kirsten Jung, unpublished data).</p>
