The treatment and time of leaf sampling were used as fixed effects, whereas the randomly selected individual trees were considered as random effects in the models. Models were fitted separately for the two sampling years and regions. To analyse the effects of the study site and the age of the trees on leaf damage, we constructed another GLMM by using treatment, study site, age of trees, and sampling time as fixed effects. Tree individuals were treated again as a random effect in this model. Significance of treatment was tested by a comparison of models fitted with and without treatment with the

  <a rid="pone.0017857-Bates1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0017857-Bates1">[39]</a>). Leaf area damage and number of holes were square-root-transformed for analysis; means are given ± 1 SE. To compare species richness of birds between young trees and mature oaks in the two study sites we used the One-way Anova.
