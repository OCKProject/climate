 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The question of “Why is the world green?” raised by Hairston et al. 
  <a rid="pone.0017857-Hairston1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0017857-Hairston1">[1]</a> has encouraged many ecologists to investigate whether herbivore population dynamics are limited by the availability of food plants and plant defence mechanisms or rather by top-down control through predators. In each case, herbivorous arthropods play a decisive role in ecosystem functioning because, as mid-trophic level species, they are influenced by bottom-up and top-down forces. In turn, herbivorous arthropods impact the fitness of many plant species and associated nutritional cycles

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Numerous studies have demonstrated that leaf quality (e.g. content of secondary metabolites) is a major determinant affecting the distribution and abundance of herbivorous arthropods 
  <a rid="pone.0017857-Wright1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0017857-Wright1">[3]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0017857-Forkner1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0017857-Forkner1">[6]</a>. In addition, studies focusing on top-down forces have revealed significant impacts of predators on lower trophic levels, such as herbivorous arthropods 
  <a rid="pone.0017857-VanBael1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0017857-VanBael1">[7]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0017857-Gunnarsson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0017857-Gunnarsson1">[11]</a>. These, in turn, can drastically reduce leaf area through their feeding activities and hence can affect the biomass and fitness of trees

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The function of predators in food webs is assumed to be positively correlated with species richness and abundance. Higher species diversity increases the likelihood of the presence of more specialized and/or efficient predators that will eventually feed on species not consumed by generalist predators and hence increase the overall range of prey species. This, in turn, might also affect functional relationships over multiple levels in food webs such that mid-trophic level species (e.g. herbivorous arthropods) impact primary producers 
  <a rid="pone.0017857-VanBael1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0017857-VanBael1">[7]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0017857-Perfecto1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0017857-Perfecto1">[18]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0017857-Philpott1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0017857-Philpott1">[19]</a>. However, empirical evidence combined with the quantification of leaf damage as a means to demonstrate the effects of vertebrates as top-down controllers of herbivores is still scarce, especially in the canopies of temperate ecosystems.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Whereas various field studies suggest that abundance of terrestrial arthropods in the understorey (i.e. in shrubs and small trees) is tightly controlled by insectivorous birds and bats in both tropical and temperate forests, plantations and gardens 
  <a rid="pone.0017857-Kalka1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0017857-Kalka1">[8]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0017857-Gunnarsson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0017857-Gunnarsson1">[11]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0017857-VanBael2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0017857-VanBael2">[14]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0017857-Gradwohl1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0017857-Gradwohl1">[20]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0017857-Schwenk1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0017857-Schwenk1">[27]</a>, only limited empirical evidence for this control is available to date in temperate forest canopies. Among the few exceptions are the studies of Gunnarsson and co-workers reporting the reduction of spruce-living spiders through insectivorous birds in Sweden 
  <a rid="pone.0017857-Gunnarsson2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0017857-Gunnarsson2">[28]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0017857-Gunnarsson4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0017857-Gunnarsson4">[30]</a>. Studies in Europe on the control of herbivory by birds in forest canopies are limited to oaks (
  <span class="italic">Quercus pyrenaica</span>
  <a rid="pone.0017857-Sanz1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0017857-Sanz1">[13]</a>) in the Spanish Pyrenees and to apple orchards in The Netherlands 
  <a rid="pone.0017857-Mols1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0017857-Mols1">[25]</a>. Whereas Mols &amp; Visser 
  <a rid="pone.0017857-Mols1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0017857-Mols1">[25]</a> have demonstrated that the abundance of 
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span> (great tit) is negatively correlated with the number of caterpillars feeding on apples, Sanz 
  <a rid="pone.0017857-Sanz1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0017857-Sanz1">[13]</a> has shown that the amount of leaf damage and abundance of caterpillars decreases with increasing number of insectivorous birds.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although comparative studies from different tree species are important to determining whether the impact of insectivorous predators on leaf damage is similar within and between temperate ecosystems 
  <span class="italic">per se</span>, a next important step is to take environmental heterogeneity and various diversity scenarios across trophic levels into account. Such studies need to compare regions that differ in one or more of the following traits: species richness and abundance, land-use, climatic zones, or climate change 
  <a rid="pone.0017857-Millar1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0017857-Millar1">[31]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, tree crowns of 
  <span class="italic">Quercus robur</span> (common oak) play particularly important roles in temperate forest food webs as they harbour large numbers and highly diverse assemblages of arthropods 
  <a rid="pone.0017857-Feeny2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0017857-Feeny2">[32]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0017857-Southwood1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0017857-Southwood1">[34]</a>. Although oaks are distributed across central Europe, they vary in local abundance mainly because of differences in forest management practices. Nowadays, in northern and central Europe natural beech and oak forests have been almost completely replaced by tree plantations of commercial interest 
  <a rid="pone.0017857-Knoot1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0017857-Knoot1">[35]</a>, in particular conifers. Consequently, the abundance of oaks is low across most of its original distribution range. However, given the high economic value of oak wood and the higher resilience of deciduous trees against storm damage compared to conifer monocultures, which have suffered serious damage in the past decades, a rethinking in forest management practice with a stronger focus on deciduous forests has recently taken place. This is an important development also in terms of maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and may also affect the control of herbivorous insects by vertebrates.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As most bird species in temperate forests feed on herbivorous arthropods, they favour oaks as foraging substrate over other tree species during the vegetation period 
  <a rid="pone.0017857-Bhm1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0017857-Bhm1">[36]</a>. It is of particular interest whether the intensive foraging activities of insectivorous birds in oaks impact the abundance of herbivorous arthropods in canopies and the way in which this might occur. Specifically, quantification of the cascading effects of predation on herbivore abundance and the amount of leaf damage might contribute to a better understanding of ecosystem processes on a broader scale. Furthermore, as the diversity of predators is positively correlated with the amount of herbivore reduction, investigations of ecosystem functioning under various diversity scenarios of predators and prey might enhance possibilities for implementing site-specific conservation plans

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we experimentally excluded birds and bats from the tree crowns of oak trees to assess their impact as predators on intensity of arthropod herbivory on 
  <span class="italic">Quercus robur</span>. We selected two regions in Germany that differ in overall forest composition and oak density as well as in species richness of vertebrate predators. We conducted studies on both young and old trees and quantified the numbers of chewed holes and percentages of missing leaf area caused by arthropod feeding activities. We expected that intensity of arthropod herbivory in the canopy would increase with the exclusion of vertebrate predators. Furthermore, the diversity of vertebrate predators might also influence intensity of arthropod herbivory, with a higher species richness and abundance of foliage-gleaning birds and bats leading to a stronger reduction in leaf damage.
