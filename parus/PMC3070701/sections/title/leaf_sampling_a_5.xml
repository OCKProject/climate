 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Leaves of young oaks were repeatedly sampled during the vegetation period between July and October in 2007 (three times: 18-Jul, 29-Aug, and 08-Oct) and leaves from mature trees were collected between June and October in 2008 (four times: 02-Jun, 25-Jul, 08-Sep, and 17-Oct) to assess leaf damage. Each sample consisted of 60 randomly collected leaves per tree. Although this sample comprised only a small proportion of leaves available in a tree crown, we expect this random sample to be sufficient to examining treatment effects on relative herbivory. Our sample size followed other studies about the impact of birds on leaf damage [e.g., 13]. The leaves were flattened with a Perspex plane on millimetre paper and photographed with a digital camera (350D, Canon, Tokyo, Japan).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each leaf, we calculated leaf damage by differentiating between mean percentage of damaged leaf area and mean number of holes (â‰¥1 mm
  <span class="sup">2</span>) per leaf chewed by arthropods. Missing leaf area was measured with ImageJ 1.40 (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA) by using a polygon selection tool. If holes were located at the edge of the leaf, the missing edge was manually reconstructed. The remaining undamaged leaf area was measured with WinRhizo
  <span class="italic">Pro</span> (Regent Instruments Inc., Ottawa, Canada) by automatic colour analysis measurements.
