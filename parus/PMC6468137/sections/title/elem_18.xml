  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Does climate play a role in explaining observed variation in survival?</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although temperatures at the study site increased in both summers and winters over time, and precipitation in summer declined over the span of this study (as expected from larger regional trends), snow depth at our site did not significantly change. Snow depth did not appear to be an important variable in any of the survival models. Interestingly, phenological variables (emergence and season length) did not indicate a significantly linear change over time either, despite changes in climate. However, it would be difficult to detect a linear change in emergence phenology from only 7 data points spread over 50 years. Hence, the importance of long‐term study in addressing the role climate change plays in shifting phenologies and other key life history traits (Clutton‐Brock &amp; Sheldon, 
   <a rid="ece35000-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0012">2010</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Below‐freezing winter temperatures are associated with increased arousal costs but substantial energy savings due to a decreased cost of thermoregulation, limiting energy expenditure (Geiser &amp; Kenagy, 
   <a rid="ece35000-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0021">1988</a>). Overall, one would still expect the cost of hibernation (i.e., increased catabolization of fat reserves) to prevail under such conditions, unless snowpack insulation is sufficient to create a buffer (Tafani et al., 
   <a rid="ece35000-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0055">2013</a>). Relying on few data points, our results suggest that juvenile survival responds differently to winter temperatures compared to yearlings/adults (Table 
   <a rid="ece35000-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" href="#ece35000-tbl-0002">2</a> and Figure 
   <a rid="ece35000-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35000-fig-0003">3</a>). It seems that colder ambient temperatures (which strongly correlate with snow pack in our system; correlation coefficient = 0.895, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.001) convey a survival benefit to yearlings and adults, but a survival cost to juveniles. In other words, “lower” hibernacula temperatures only decrease the cost of thermoregulation in yearlings and adults, but not in juveniles. Juveniles have a larger surface‐to‐volume ratio than yearling and adults, likely forcing them to expend more energy while hibernating (Kortner &amp; Geiser, 
   <a rid="ece35000-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0034">2000</a>; Sherman &amp; Runge, 
   <a rid="ece35000-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0052">2002</a>); this could explain why they tend to survive over‐winter at a higher rate when ambient winter temperatures are above freezing. Social dynamics within hibernacula, timing of immergence (i.e., juvenile typically enter estivation 2–3 weeks after older age classes; Knopf, 
   <a rid="ece35000-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0032">1973</a>) and hibernacula depth (Knopf &amp; Balph, 
   <a rid="ece35000-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0033">1977</a>) could also explain observed differences in juvenile survival when compared to older age classes. On the other hand, colder temperatures could benefit adults/yearling UGS as they can reduce the energetic output necessary during hibernation (Kronfeld‐Schor &amp; Dayan, 
   <a rid="ece35000-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0035">2013</a>) and allow UGS to remain in hibernation longer (Turbill &amp; Prior, 
   <a rid="ece35000-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0056">2016</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Maximum temperatures in March (March 15–31) have increased significantly over the span of this study (by 3.56°C; 
   <span class="italic">p = </span>0.007, Adj. 
   <span class="italic">R</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.111). Hotter March temperatures did not have an effect on juvenile survival but did have a negative effect on adult/yearling survival (Table 
   <a rid="ece35000-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" href="#ece35000-tbl-0003">3</a>). The hotter temperatures at this time could be related to earlier snowmelt and the start of spring green‐up of vegetation. Previous research on the same population found that in early springs, more UGS females failed to produce litters or disappeared entirely prior to recruitment (Walker, 
   <a rid="ece35000-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0062">1968</a>), which supports our results for adult and yearling UGS. Earlier springs led to asynchronous emergence across age classes, with adults emerging earlier than yearlings. When this happens, adults act more aggressively toward yearlings, since they are more likely to have already established territories and mated, which often results in yearlings failing to reproduce or emigrating away from their natal colony (Paul, 
   <a rid="ece35000-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0045">1977</a>; Walker, 
   <a rid="ece35000-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0062">1968</a>). Earlier emergence may also expose UGS to predation for a longer period of time. In other hibernating species, a later emergence led to increased survival since remaining in hibernation provided protection from predation by most predators (Bieber, Lebl, Stalder, Geiser, &amp; Ruf, 
   <a rid="ece35000-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0005">2014</a>; Bryant &amp; Page, 
   <a rid="ece35000-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0007">2005</a>; Turbill, Bieber, &amp; Ruf, 
   <a rid="ece35000-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0057">2011</a>), with the exception of burrowing predators such as badgers (
   <span class="italic">Taxidea taxus</span>) and weasels (
   <span class="italic">Mustela </span>spp.) (Walker, 
   <a rid="ece35000-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0062">1968</a>). Although badgers are present at our site, hawks (e.g., 
   <span class="italic">Buteo jamaicensis</span>), foxes (
   <span class="italic">Vulpes vulpes</span>), and coyotes (
   <span class="italic">Canus latrans</span>) are also known predators of UGS (Amend, 
   <a rid="ece35000-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0001">1970</a>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although summer climate variables did not rank in our model selection, we had expected hotter and drier summers to have a negative impact on the quality of food or cause estivation to begin earlier. In 1966, the warmest and driest year within the historical study, the active season ended the earliest and was the shortest (even though emergence from hibernation that year was intermediate to the other years), while the cooler and rainier years had seasons that ended later (Knopf, 
   <a rid="ece35000-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0032">1973</a>). In UGS, juvenile emergence from their natal burrows typically coincides with peak food abundance (Walker, 
   <a rid="ece35000-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0062">1968</a>), and growing degree days can reflect the phenology of food resources. The presence of cheatgrass at the study site (C. Falvo, unpublished data), that was never mentioned to be present historically (Walker, 
   <a rid="ece35000-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0062">1968</a>), may be increasing forage availability to UGS by outcompeting sagebrush (Stewart &amp; Hull, 
   <a rid="ece35000-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0054">1949</a>). Sagebrush is only consumed in small amounts by UGS (~10%) and is not their preferred food (Walker, 
   <a rid="ece35000-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0062">1968</a>)). Juveniles emerge at a time when grasses are most abundant (Walker, 
   <a rid="ece35000-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0062">1968</a>), further suggesting that juveniles do not eat large amounts of sagebrush. The substitution of sagebrush by cheatgrass may have improved forage availability for juveniles, particularly via massive seed production, and continued warming may allow cheatgrass to further dominate the area (Chambers, Roundy, Blank, Meyer, &amp; Whittaker, 
   <a rid="ece35000-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0011">2007</a>; Compagnoni &amp; Adler, 
   <a rid="ece35000-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0013">2014</a>) and benefit this particular UGS population unless it alters the fire regime (as it does at lower elevations; Knapp, 
   <a rid="ece35000-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0031">1996</a>). Cheatgrass establishment, biomass, and seed production are most strongly constrained by cold temperatures (Chambers et al., 
   <a rid="ece35000-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0011">2007</a>), further suggesting that warming temperatures benefit its establishment and persistence. The increase in cheatgrass biomass which persists through the summer at high elevations within its range could outweigh the negative effects of a decline in native grasses for UGS. However, the only years in this study with warmer than average summers were 2016 and 2017. Although we did not detect any changes in the number of growing degree days over the last 50 years, overall summer temperatures are predicted to continue warming; it will be interesting to assess whether cheatgrass can buffer UGS against the predicted negative impacts of hotter and drier summer in the future.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the historical capture area was more heterogeneous in its vegetation than it currently is, and the trapping area today might not be exactly in line with what it used to be, we used the Horvitz–Thompson estimator (Horvitz &amp; Thompson, 
   <a rid="ece35000-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0024">1952</a>) to calculate approximate density (Figure 
   <a rid="ece35000-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35000-fig-0005">5</a>). Since juveniles are more likely to emigrate, density was only calculated for adults and yearlings (i.e., residents). We observed an increase in population density during that time period (Figure 
   <a rid="ece35000-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35000-fig-0005">5</a>), suggesting resources are less limited today than they used to be. This supports the idea that cheatgrass, which now dominates the study site, may provide a better food source to UGS than native plants did historically.
