 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used QAICc to score model(s) in each tier of our model selection process (see above), while ensuring that each model reflected ecological hypotheses of interest, as per Lebreton et al. (
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0038">1992</a>). Because time‐varying climate variables are redundant with annual changes in survival, generic (fixed effect) time variation in survival (if selected in our demographic set of models) was never considered along with time‐varying covariates in the final model set. Overall, this tiered approach was preferred because it allowed us to consider models that reflected relevant ecological hypotheses while restricting the number of models considered to a reasonable level.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To evaluate how well our best‐performing models fit the data, we calculated 
  <span class="italic">R</span>, the ratio of deviance reduction for a model relative to a fully saturated model and a null model (Iles et al., 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0026">2013</a>). This involved calculating the deviance reduction measure (
  <span class="italic">D</span>
  <sub>MOI</sub> = 1 − dev
  <sub>MOI</sub>/dev
  <sub>NULL</sub>) where MOI is the model of interest and NULL is the least parameterized model that was considered (~age class). This value was used to calculate the ratio of deviance reduction (
  <span class="italic">R</span> = 
  <span class="italic">D</span>
  <sub>MOI</sub>/
  <span class="italic">D</span>
  <sub>FULL</sub>) where FULL refers to a fully saturated temporal model (~ age class * time), providing a relative measure of deviance reduction.
