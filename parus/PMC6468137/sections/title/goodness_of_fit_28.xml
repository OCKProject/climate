 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used goodness‐of‐fit tests computed in the RELEASE software implemented in program MARK, which tests the assumptions of the CJS model that every marked animal present at time 
  <span class="italic">t</span> has the same probability of recapture, and that every marked animal immediately after 
  <span class="italic">t</span> has the same probability of surviving until 
  <span class="italic">t</span> + 1 (Cooch &amp; White 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0014">2006</a>). We considered a global model where survival was allowed to vary by age, sex, and time period (historical vs. contemporary) to test these assumptions; results are presented in Table 
  <a rid="ece35000-tbl-0004" ref-type="table" href="#ece35000-tbl-0004">B1</a>. The null hypothesis is that the assumptions of the CJS model are true so rejecting the null indicates a violation of assumptions. The GOF test conducted on this model indicated that juveniles in 1967 violated the assumptions of Test 3 (
  <span class="italic">χ</span>
  <span class="sup">2 </span>= 74.1728, 
  <span class="italic">df</span> = 19, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0). However, the addition of cohort effects for these two groups resolved the issue (Table 
  <a rid="ece35000-tbl-0005" ref-type="table" href="#ece35000-tbl-0005">B2</a>; 
  <span class="italic">χ</span>
  <span class="sup">2 </span>= 15.6503, 
  <span class="italic">df</span> = 16, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.4776). Test 3 determines whether individuals tagged that particular year are seen again at the same rate as individuals tagged in previous years, and the survival interval that violated assumptions was the last for our study period, so we are not concerned about this violation which simply results from the fact that our study ended.
