 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used goodness‐of‐fit (GOF) tests computed in the RELEASE software implemented in program MARK (Cooch &amp; White, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0014">2006</a>), which tests assumptions of the CJS model that every marked animal present at time 
  <span class="italic">t</span> has the same probability of recapture, and that every marked animal immediately after 
  <span class="italic">t</span> has the same probability of surviving to

  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0064">2012</a>) (see Appendix 
  <a rid="ece35000-app-0002" ref-type="app" href="#ece35000-app-0002">B</a> for details). We considered a global model where survival was allowed to vary by age, sex, and time period (historical vs. contemporary). Although a global model may pass GOF tests, this does not imply that assumptions of the CMR modeling framework are met perfectly. We therefore estimated
