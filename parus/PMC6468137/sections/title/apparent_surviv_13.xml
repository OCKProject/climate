 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To keep our model selection process down to a reasonable number of models (Burnham &amp; Anderson, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0009">2002</a>), we first examined the influence of demographic categories and time (age, sex, and year) on apparent survival. We carried forward the highest‐ranked term(s) into a final set of models where we considered univariate effects of phenological variables and seasonal climate variables (emergence dates, season length; winter, spring, summer, or fall climate) interacting with age. By avoiding model dredging, we acknowledge we may have overlooked certain variable combinations supported by the data, and of importance in affecting actual UGS survival.

     <span class="italic">Demographic categories</span>. Within each subset of models, we only considered models that tested for ecological hypotheses of interest. For instance, we expected survival to be different between males and females because females bear the cost of reproduction, and after gestation and provisioning for their offspring, they have less time to gain mass before estivation begins (Knopf, 
     <a rid="ece35000-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0032">1973</a>). We also anticipated differences in survival between juveniles and older age classes because juveniles have the shortest amount of time to gain mass prior to estivation. Models with three age classes (juvenile, yearling, and adult) vs. two age classes (juvenile, yearling, and adult combined) were compared, as we did not anticipate large differences in survival between yearlings and adults (Oli et al., 
     <a rid="ece35000-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0041">2001</a>).

   <div class="list-item">
    <p>
     <span class="italic">Phenological variables</span>. We compared models that accounted for the effect of emergence date, season length, and a cross‐seasonal effect of either on survival (
     <span class="italic">t </span>− 1 to 
     <span class="italic">t</span> and 
     <span class="italic">t</span> to 
     <span class="italic">t </span>+ 1). Emergence date was the calendar date the first squirrel was seen in a given year, and season length was based on the amount of time squirrels were known to be active, from emergence to estivation in a given year. An early emergence date may be beneficial (if forage availability and snowmelt are also initiated early), or detrimental (if snow cover persists beyond emergence). Similarly, a longer season may be beneficial if food resources have not yet senesced, and nutritional quality is not compromised.

     <span class="italic">Seasonal climate variables</span>. We considered the number of below‐freezing days after estivation and before permanent snowpack, winter temperature, winter snowfall, maximum March temperature, growing degree days (GDD), Bagnouls‐Gaussen summer drought index (BGI), summer temperature, and summer precipitation.
