 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Uinta ground squirrels typically emerge from hibernation between March and April and enter estivation by August, depending on elevation, age, and sex (Eshelman &amp; Sonnemann, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0019">2000</a>). UGS mate within a week of emergence, and adult and yearling females can produce a single litter each year of four to six juveniles (Eshelman &amp; Sonnemann, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0019">2000</a>). Maximum life expectancy is 7 years in the wild, but average life expectancy for juveniles is approximately 1.46 years (Oli et al., 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0041">2001</a>). Yearling males rarely emerged from hibernation in breeding condition, while the number and sequence of emergence of females in the early spring affected breeding and social organization by limiting the number of females which retained residences in the study area (Paul, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0045">1977</a>; Walker, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0062">1968</a>). Spring climatic conditions influence emergence date and emergence order of each sex and age class: adult males and females emerge before yearlings in warmer springs, but colder springs cause a more synchronous delayed emergence of sex and age classes (Knopf, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0032">1973</a>), making it more likely for yearling females to breed (Walker, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0062">1968</a>). The diet of UGS is composed of graminoids and forbs, and historically they primarily consumed Kentucky bluegrass (
  <span class="italic">Poa pratensis</span>; Walker, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0062">1968</a>). Contemporary surveys show that the site is now dominated by cheatgrass (
  <span class="italic">Bromus tectorum</span>), but 
  <span class="italic">Poa </span>spp. including 
  <span class="italic">Poa pratensis</span> are still present (C. Falvo, unpublished data). Extensive data were collected from 1964 to 1971 on UGS behavior and demography (Knopf &amp; Balph, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0033">1977</a>; Slade &amp; Balph, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0053">1974</a>; Walker, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0062">1968</a>), but in 1968 the population was reduced by approximately half to study density‐dependent dynamics (Slade &amp; Balph, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0053">1974</a>); thus, we excluded those later years from our analysis. Contemporary data collection began in 2014 up to 2017 in the same location, in order to make comparisons to historical survival probabilities.
