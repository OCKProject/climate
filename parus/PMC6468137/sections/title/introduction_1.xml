 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change is impacting the phenology of many species, ultimately altering their fitness and population dynamics (Parmesan, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0043">2006</a>; Visser &amp; Both, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0058">2005</a>). For instance, earlier snowmelt in montane habitats causes wildflowers to germinate earlier, increasing their susceptibility to mid‐June frost‐kills, ultimately leading to a reduction in recruitment by phenological mismatch (Inouye, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0027">2008</a>). Shifts in phenology have been documented across a variety of taxa and ecosystems, although the direction of these shifts is inconsistent (Kharouba et al., 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0030">2018</a>; Parmesan &amp; Yohe, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0044">2003</a>). Phenological mismatches can occur when the phenology of a given organism does not line up with that of relevant abiotic factors, food resources, conspecifics, or predators, complicating our ability to understand how phenological shifts may affect the focal organism's fitness (Miller‐Rushing, Høye, Inouye, &amp; Post, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0039">2010</a>). In a long‐term study of great tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) in the Netherlands, disparities in the phenological response to climate change across trophic levels have increased the asynchrony between great tit hatching date and peak caterpillar biomass (Visser, van Noordwijk, Tinbergen, &amp; Lessells, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0060">1998</a>), the preferred source of food for nestlings, which has decreased fledging success (Visser, Holleman, &amp; Gienapp, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0059">2006</a>). However, in a long‐term study of great tits in Wytham Woods, England, the birds have shifted their phenology in response to warming springs while managing to maintain synchrony of their hatch date with peak food abundance by altering their incubation period (Cresswell &amp; McCleery, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0015">2003</a>; Reed, Jenouvrier, &amp; Visser, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0048">2013</a>). These studies illustrate how difficult it can be to predict demographic consequences of phenology shifts, particularly because linking phenology and demography requires extensive and individually based data that are often unavailable (Miller‐Rushing et al., 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0039">2010</a>; Plard et al., 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0046">2014</a>). Although there are several studies that have directly quantified the effects of phenological shifts on fitness components (Arlt &amp; Pärt, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0003">2017</a>; Møller, Rubolini, &amp; Lehikoinen, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0040">2008</a>; Saino et al., 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0050">2011</a>), only a few pertain to mammals (Lane, Kruuk, Charmantier, Murie, &amp; Dobson, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0037">2012</a>; Ozgul et al., 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0042">2010</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hibernating mammals may be particularly susceptible to changes in climate through phenological shifts because they have a relatively short active season in which to mate and gain enough weight to survive the following winter (Humphries, Thomas, &amp; Speakman, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0025">2002</a>). In yellow‐bellied marmots (
  <span class="italic">Marmota flaviventris</span>), for example, years with earlier snowmelt led to an earlier emergence from hibernation and a longer growing season, resulting in an increase in over‐winter survival and reproduction (Ozgul et al., 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0042">2010</a>; van Vuren &amp; Armitage, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0061">1991</a>). In Alpine marmots (
  <span class="italic">Marmota marmota</span>), earlier snowmelt also led to earlier emergence, but the loss of winter snow cover resulted in a decrease in both litter size and juvenile survival (Rezouki et al., 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0049">2016</a>; Tafani, Cohas, Bonenfant, Gaillard, &amp; Allaine, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0055">2013</a>). Thinner snow cover can force marmots to catabolize their fat reserves faster than under the insulation of a deeper snowpack (Tafani et al., 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0055">2013</a>), outweighing the benefits of a longer active season. Although buffering against below‐ground freezing temperature can help save on thermoregulatory costs, metabolic costs decrease with decreasing ambient temperature, while arousal costs increase (Geiser &amp; Kenagy, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0021">1988</a>). The extent to which hibernator condition depends on climatic cues is important because even the same climatic variables (e.g., winter snow depth, minimum winter temperatures) can have opposing effects on a given individual, making associated fitness outcomes difficult to predict (Bjorkman, Elmendorf, Beamish, Vellend, &amp; Henry, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0006">2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A better understanding of how hibernator phenology is influenced by seasonal environmental conditions and how this may affect fitness will be key in addressing why climate change leads to different fitness outcomes, even in closely related species (Doak &amp; Morris, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0016">2010</a>). Few studies have considered the effects of pertinent season‐specific climatic variables on hibernator phenology and fitness, but a study by Dobson, Lane, Low, and Murie (
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0017">2016</a>) indicates that a focus on seasonality will help predict how hibernators may respond to warming and increased climate variability in the future.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For instance, snow depth influences soil temperatures and can prevent the ground from freezing (Happold, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0023">1998</a>; Inouye, Barr, Armitage, &amp; Inouye, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0028">2000</a>), which could potentially affect thermoregulatory costs by buffering against below‐ground freezing temperature (as long as they reach the hibernacula). Indeed, while metabolic costs decrease with decreasing ambient temperature during hibernation, arousal costs increase with decreasing ambient temperature (Geiser &amp; Kenagy, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0021">1988</a>). However, this relationship can be complicated by the use of food caches, differing thermal conductance of nests, or differences in individual hibernation energetics that are not related to the gradient between body and soil temperatures (Buck &amp; Barnes, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0008">1999</a>). Although a handful of studies have found that winter conditions can affect fitness up to, and at spring emergence (Rezouki et al., 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0049">2016</a>; Tafani et al., 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0055">2013</a>; Williams, Buck et al., 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0065">2017</a>), the general prediction that below‐freezing hibernacula temperatures should lead to lower body mass and higher mortality rate up to emergence remains extremely difficult to test.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spring snow dynamics can further affect fitness after emergence because snowmelt determines when food resources become available (Inouye et al., 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0028">2000</a>; Ozgul et al., 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0042">2010</a>; Rezouki et al., 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0049">2016</a>; Vuren &amp; Armitage, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0061">1991</a>; Walker, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0062">1968</a>). Reproduction and subsequent juvenile emergence is generally timed with peak food abundance in hibernators (Walker, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0062">1968</a>), as observed in other taxa (Visser et al., 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0059">2006</a>). Hot and dry summers can cause grasses to senesce earlier, while additional precipitation can delay this process (Walker, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0062">1968</a>), affecting whether juvenile emergence is matched with peak food abundance or not.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These seasonal responses are further complicated by demography, since phenological and fitness responses to climate can vary across age classes (Rezouki et al., 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0049">2016</a>) and sex (Sheriff, Richter, Buck, &amp; Barnes, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0051">2013</a>). Juveniles have the least amount of time to gain body mass before hibernation, and they may also expend more energy while hibernating due to their large surface‐to‐volume ratio (Kortner &amp; Geiser, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0034">2000</a>; Sherman &amp; Runge, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0052">2002</a>), making them more susceptible to phenological mismatches than older age classes (Miller‐Rushing et al., 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0039">2010</a>). In relatively short‐lived species, this may have a large impact on overall population abundance and persistence because population growth is quite sensitive to proportional changes in juvenile survival (Oli, Slade, &amp; Dobson, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0041">2001</a>). In arctic ground squirrels (
  <span class="italic">Spermophilus parryii</span>)
  <span class="italic">,</span> snow cover affects the emergence of females, while male emergence is more influenced by female emergence (Sheriff, Richter et al., 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0051">2013</a>), providing support for the idea that males and females have the potential to be affected differently by specific climatic variables, with consequences for sex‐specific fitness. Indeed, a recent study has shown that female and non‐reproductive male arctic ground squirrels can extend or reenter hibernation to avoid late spring snowstorms, but that plasticity in the use of heterothermy in spring did not extend to reproductive males, who have to end hibernation early to undergo spermatogenesis (Williams, Klaassen et al., 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0066">2017</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because worldwide temperatures are predicted to continue increasing (IPCC, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0029">2013</a>), it is essential to broaden our understanding of how hibernators respond to season‐specific variability in climate. We analyzed mark–recapture data from a population of Uinta ground squirrels (UGS, 
  <span class="italic">Urocitellus armatus</span>; Figure 
  <a rid="ece35000-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35000-fig-0001">1</a>) over a 50‐year period to assess how climate variability affected the survival of a hibernating species endemic to the western U.S. In northern Utah, where the data were collected, temperatures have been increasing (dos Santos, Neale, Rao, &amp; Silva, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0018">2011</a>) and winter snowfall has already decreased by nearly ten percent in the last half‐century, with an increasing proportion of winter precipitation falling as rain instead of snow (Gillies, Wang, &amp; Booth, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0022">2012</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We estimated annual survival using historical (1964–1968) and contemporary (2014–2017) mark–recapture data in an effort to understand how season‐specific climate affected long‐term changes in a key fitness component of the species’ life cycle. We expected that a declining snowpack could cause a decrease in survival, especially for juveniles, or an increase in survival if snow recedes sooner in the spring, leading to earlier availability of forage that would benefit all age classes. We also predicted that warmer summers may cause food resources (i.e., grasses) to senesce earlier, leading to a shortage of food before estivation that would have a negative impact on UGS over‐winter survival, particularly in juveniles. By examining annual changes in survival as they relate to key phenological events in the UGS life cycle (emergence, reproduction, juvenile emergence, and estivation), we hope to determine whether survival has changed over the last 50 years in response to warming, and pinpoint which of the season‐specific climatic and phenological variables may affect this key vital rate across age‐ and sex‐classes.</p>
