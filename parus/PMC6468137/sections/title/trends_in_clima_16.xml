 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Trends in the climate variables recorded at the Utah State University weather station that we considered in our analysis indicated warming over the study period, consistent with global and regional trends (IPCC, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0029">2013</a>; Figure 
  <a rid="ece35000-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece35000-fig-0002">2</a>). Specifically, average winter temperatures marginally increased over time (by 1.58°C; 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.054, Adj. 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.051), and maximum temperatures in March (March 15–31) have increased significantly over time (by 3.56°C; 
  <span class="italic">p = </span>0.007, Adj. 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.111). Unlike regional trends (i.e., the state of Utah), average winter snow depth did not decline at the local weather station (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.435, Adj. 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = −0.007). Average summer temperatures also increased (1.79°C; 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001, Adj. 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.199), while average summer precipitation declined over the study period (−0.60 mm; 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.012, Adj. 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.097). Although the BG drought index declined over time (−4.14; 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001, Adj. 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.201), indicating drier summer conditions in recent years, growing degree days (from average emergence to average juvenile emergence from their natal burrow) did not significantly change over time (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.692, Adj. 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = −0.016). Phenological variables did not exhibit any temporal trend (emergence: Welch's 
  <span class="italic">t</span> test, 
  <span class="italic">t = </span>0.0258, 
  <span class="italic">df</span> = 5.5412, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.9803; season length: 
  <span class="italic">t</span> = 0.9381, 
  <span class="italic">df</span> = 6.4662, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.3819): the average emergence dates (historical calendar date = 92.4, contemporary Julian date = 92.3) and season length (historical = 128.6 days, contemporary = 123.4 days) did not change over time either.
