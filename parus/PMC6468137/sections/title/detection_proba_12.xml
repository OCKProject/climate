 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because of a 46‐year gap in the CMR data, appropriate recapture and survival parameters were fixed to 0 between the historical and contemporary study periods. Additionally, data on adult males were not available during the first 2 years of the historical study, and thus, these parameters were also fixed to 0. For historical years, we fixed 
  <span class="italic">p</span> to 1 because trapping was considered a census in those years (Slade &amp; Balph, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0053">1974</a>). Since estimates for 
  <span class="italic">p</span> consistently converged to 1 for females, and for both sexes in 2016, we also fixed 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 1 for those sex‐year combinations. All other recapture probabilities were estimated by comparing models that allowed variability by age, sex, and year using QAICc (AIC adjusted for sample size and over‐dispersion; Burnham &amp; Anderson, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0009">2002</a>). The top performing model for 
  <span class="italic">p</span> was then used alongside alternative parameterizations for 
  <span class="italic">ϕ</span>.
