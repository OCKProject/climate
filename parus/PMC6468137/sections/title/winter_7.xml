 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because winter conditions could affect over‐winter survival as well as fitness postemergence, we considered the average snow depth and temperature from December of the previous year (
  <span class="italic">t </span>− 1) until emergence the next spring (
  <span class="italic">t</span>) in examining the influence of winter conditions on survival from 
  <span class="italic">t</span> − 1 to

  <span class="italic">t</span> to
