 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Snow acts as an insulator and can prevent the ground from freezing (Happold, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0023">1998</a>; Inouye et al., 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0028">2000</a>). In Alpine marmots, when snow depth is &gt;110 cm, the burrow temperatures are thought to be buffered against air temperatures (Tafani et al., 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0055">2013</a>, Appendix D). To assess the potential influence of below‐freezing temperatures on UGS survival before an insulating layer of snow was present, the number of days below freezing that occurred after estivation began and before permanent snow cover occurred (August–November or December) were tallied up each year 
  <span class="italic">t</span> (e.g., August to December 2015), and the impact of that variable on survival was assessed between year 
  <span class="italic">t</span> and 
  <span class="italic">t</span> + 1.
