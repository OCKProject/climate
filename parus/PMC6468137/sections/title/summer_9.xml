 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Summer precipitation and temperatures influence food availability, with hot and dry summers causing earlier plant senescence (Walker, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0062">1968</a>). Precipitation may be positively correlated with survival through improved forage quality (Armitage, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0004">1994</a>). Previous studies have shown that timing of UGS estivation roughly coincides with the drying out of vegetation (Knopf, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0032">1973</a>), suggesting declines in precipitation have the potential to shorten the active season via changes in plant availability. To examine the influence of summer food conditions in relation to UGS phenology, growing degree days (at 0°C; Frank, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0020">1996</a>) were calculated from emergence until the estimated date of juvenile emergence, when forage quality and quantity is essential to this age class. We also considered an aridity index that incorporates average temperature and precipitation from June to August (BGI, Bagnouls‐Gaussen Index: daily rainfall (mm) minus twice the average temperature (°C) (Canale, Ozgul, Allainé, &amp; Cohas, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0010">2016</a>; Aridity Index, 
  <a rid="ece35000-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0002">2014</a>), as well as average temperature and average precipitation alone as variables that could influence survival to the following year.
