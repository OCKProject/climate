We considered a global model where survival was allowed to vary by age, sex, and time period (historical vs. contemporary). Although a global model may pass GOF tests, this does not imply that assumptions of the CMR modeling framework are met perfectly. We therefore estimated

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because of a 46‐year gap in the CMR data, appropriate recapture and survival parameters were fixed to 0 between the historical and contemporary study periods. Additionally, data on adult males were not available during the first 2 years of the historical study, and thus, these parameters were also fixed to 0. For historical years, we fixed 
   <span class="italic">p</span> to 1 because trapping was considered a census in those years (Slade &amp; Balph, 
   <a rid="ece35000-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0053">1974</a>). Since estimates for 
   <span class="italic">p</span> consistently converged to 1 for females, and for both sexes in 2016, we also fixed 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 1 for those sex‐year combinations. All other recapture probabilities were estimated by comparing models that allowed variability by age, sex, and year using QAICc (AIC adjusted for sample size and over‐dispersion; Burnham &amp; Anderson,

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To keep our model selection process down to a reasonable number of models (Burnham &amp; Anderson, 
   <a rid="ece35000-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0009">2002</a>), we first examined the influence of demographic categories and time (age, sex, and year) on apparent survival. We carried forward the highest‐ranked term(s) into a final set of models where we considered univariate effects of phenological variables and seasonal climate variables (emergence dates, season length; winter, spring, summer, or fall climate) interacting with age. By avoiding model dredging, we acknowledge we may have overlooked certain variable combinations supported by the data, and of importance in affecting actual UGS survival.

     <p>
      <span class="italic">Demographic categories</span>. Within each subset of models, we only considered models that tested for ecological hypotheses of interest. For instance, we expected survival to be different between males and females because females bear the cost of reproduction, and after gestation and provisioning for their offspring, they have less time to gain mass before estivation begins (Knopf, 
      <a rid="ece35000-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0032">1973</a>). We also anticipated differences in survival between juveniles and older age classes because juveniles have the shortest amount of time to gain mass prior to estivation. Models with three age classes (juvenile, yearling, and adult) vs. two age classes (juvenile, yearling, and adult combined) were compared, as we did not anticipate large differences in survival between yearlings and adults (Oli et al., 
      <a rid="ece35000-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0041">2001</a>).

     <p>
      <span class="italic">Phenological variables</span>. We compared models that accounted for the effect of emergence date, season length, and a cross‐seasonal effect of either on survival (
      <span class="italic">t </span>− 1 to 
      <span class="italic">t</span> and 
      <span class="italic">t</span> to 
      <span class="italic">t </span>+ 1). Emergence date was the calendar date the first squirrel was seen in a given year, and season length was based on the amount of time squirrels were known to be active, from emergence to estivation in a given year. An early emergence date may be beneficial (if forage availability and snowmelt are also initiated early), or detrimental (if snow cover persists beyond emergence). Similarly, a longer season may be beneficial if food resources have not yet senesced, and nutritional quality is not compromised.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used QAICc to score model(s) in each tier of our model selection process (see above), while ensuring that each model reflected ecological hypotheses of interest, as per Lebreton et al. (
   <a rid="ece35000-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0038">1992</a>). Because time‐varying climate variables are redundant with annual changes in survival, generic (fixed effect) time variation in survival (if selected in our demographic set of models) was never considered along with time‐varying covariates in the final model set. Overall, this tiered approach was preferred because it allowed us to consider models that reflected relevant ecological hypotheses while restricting the number of models considered to a reasonable level.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To evaluate how well our best‐performing models fit the data, we calculated 
   <span class="italic">R</span>, the ratio of deviance reduction for a model relative to a fully saturated model and a null model (Iles et al., 
   <a rid="ece35000-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece35000-bib-0026">2013</a>). This involved calculating the deviance reduction measure (
   <span class="italic">D</span>
   <sub>MOI</sub> = 1 − dev
   <sub>MOI</sub>/dev
   <sub>NULL</sub>) where MOI is the model of interest and NULL is the least parameterized model that was considered (~age class). This value was used to calculate the ratio of deviance reduction (
   <span class="italic">R</span> = 
   <span class="italic">D</span>
   <sub>MOI</sub>/
   <span class="italic">D</span>
   <sub>FULL</sub>) where FULL refers to a fully saturated temporal model (~ age class * time), providing a relative measure of deviance reduction.
