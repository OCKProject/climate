 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The contemporary data were collected from 2014 to 2017 at the Utah State University Forestry Field Station in Logan Canyon, UT, in accordance with IACUC protocol #2220. Sites were checked approximately every 3–6 days starting in March for signs of emergence, and there were 9 capture dates in 2014, 12 in 2015, 19 in 2016, and 23 in 2017. There were 95 unique captures in 2014, 55 in 2015, 86 in 2016, and 44 in 2017. Historical data from 1964 to 1968 were collected in the same location by previous researchers detailing the behavior, social, and population dynamics of UGS. Historical data collection was considered a census since technicians were present at the site the entire summer, from emergence until estivation (i.e., prolonged torpor during a hot period; UGS transition to estivation from hibernation without emerging from their burrows; for more detailed description of site and capture methods, see Knopf &amp; Balph,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">UGS were caught using Tomahawk live‐traps (Tomahawk, Wisconsin, USA) that were baited with rolled oats and peanut butter. Traps were set early in the morning before squirrels were active, checked within an hour, and squirrels were processed within 2–3 hr of capture. At initial capture, the age of the animal was determined and individuals were classified as juveniles (young of the year), yearling (1‐year‐old), or adult (≥2‐year‐old) based primarily on body mass, reproductive status, and comparison with individuals of known age from previous years of trapping. Each individual's mass was determined by placing the animal in a cloth bag and using a Pesola scale (±2 g.; Pesola Company, Baar, Switzerland). For contemporary data, additional morphometric variables (body, hind foot, and tail length) were measured using a measuring tape or calipers. The reproductive status of males and females was recorded (males as scrotal or non‐scrotal; females as pregnant, lactating, or non‐reproductive). Small, numbered, noncorrosive metal ear tags (Monel 1005‐1, National Band and Tag Company, Newport, Kentucky) were placed on each squirrel at first capture for identification upon recapture. Passive Integrative Transponders (PIT tags, Biomark) were also injected under the skin to keep track of individuals in case of ear tag loss.</p>
