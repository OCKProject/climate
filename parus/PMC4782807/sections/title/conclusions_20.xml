 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The major threats to Alpine birds identified through expert knowledge were those that, for the most part, could be addressed with concrete actions such as targeted grazing or shrub clearance to maintain open habitats, adopting more sympathetic forestry practices (e.g., 
  <a rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-7">Braunisch et al., 2014</a>), restricting, or planning more environmentally sustainable, urban developments, and better management of potential disturbance factors (e.g., winter sports and other leisure activities) at high altitudes. There was less emphasis on threats that have a higher degree of uncertainty, at least in part due to lack of knowledge (e.g., mining and fire), and therefore for which it is difficult to formulate a management strategy. Despite that most climate change research is based on long-term forecasts and concerns direct effects (
  <a rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-13">Chapman et al., 2014</a>), climate change was perceived as a minor threat. Even when asked for long-term predictions (50 years in this case), threats associated with current conservation issues seemed to be perceived as more important. Policy decisions are typically taken on relatively short timescales. Longer-term threats may indeed be of lesser importance, but it may also be that, despite a huge body of research on potential consequences of climate change for biodiversity, scientists and practitioners still do not fully consider long-term issues.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Whilst there are caveats on the interpretation of expert knowledge surveys, including some potential biases present in this survey, we believe that this approach has highlighted some conservation priorities in the Alps, and has also identified some species that may be of concern in the future, despite not yet being of conservation interest. Development of the approaches given in this paper, including addressing biases in the selection of experts and adopting a more detailed ranking procedure, could prove useful in the future in identifying future threats, and in carrying out risk assessments based on levels of threat to the whole bird community.</p>
