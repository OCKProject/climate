 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The NMDS ordinations lead to satisfactory projections into two-dimensional space indicated by relatively low stress values (maximum mode values = 0.061, minimum mode values = 0.065). A comparison of the two NMDS ordinations (i.e., maximum or minimum mode) by means of a PROTEST analysis revealed that these were virtually identical (
  <span class="italic">m</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.94 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001), so we only report the results from the NMDS performed on the consensus matrix containing the maximum values of the mode.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A bi-plot of the threat scores on the first two axes, and the species categories plotted in the same dimension, is shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" href="#fig-2">Fig. 2</a> (the modes upon which this figure is based are given in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-5" href="#supp-5">Table S2</a>). Axis 1 was associated with 
  <span class="italic">Urban</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Leisure</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Hunting</span>. Axis 2 was associated with 
  <span class="italic">Abandonment</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Grazing</span> and negatively with 
  <span class="italic">Energy</span>. The majority of species were characterized by low threat scores and hence were clustered around the origin, with no link to any particular threat (these are not shown on 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" href="#fig-2">Fig. 2</a>). Species associated with axis 1 were those with the highest perceived threats for 
  <span class="italic">Urbanization</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Leisure</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Hunting</span>, and to a lesser extent 
  <span class="italic">Climate Change</span> (i.e., those to the right of the figure), and included raptors (Golden Eagle 
  <span class="italic">Aquila chrysaetos</span> and Lammergeier 
  <span class="italic">Gypaetus barbatus</span>) and Galliformes (Black Grouse 
  <span class="italic">Tetrao tetrix</span>, Ptarmigan 
  <span class="italic">Lagopus muta</span>, Rock Partridge 
  <span class="italic">Alectoris graeca</span>). In a similar manner, the major trend along axis 2 was a division of raptors (Golden Eagle, Lammergeier, Buzzard 
  <span class="italic">Buteo buteo</span>, Peregrine Falcon 
  <span class="italic">Falco peregrinus</span> in the lower half of the graph), suggesting 
  <span class="italic">Energy</span> as a major perceived threat, and species of open or transitional habitat (e.g., Black Grouse, Quail 
  <span class="italic">Coturnix coturnix</span>, Whinchat 
  <span class="italic">Saxicola rubetra</span>, Red-backed Shrike 
  <span class="italic">Lanius collurio</span>, Yellowhammer 
  <span class="italic">Emberiza citronella</span>, in the upper half of the figure) suggesting 
  <span class="italic">Abandonment</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Grazing</span> as the greatest perceived threats.

   <p>Filled triangles are scores for each threat on the two NMDS axes. Open diamonds are scores for each species distributed along a threat gradient, codes identify species. For clarity, species with low scores on both axes (i.e., those clustered around the origin) are not identified to species. Species codes are: BGR, Black Grouse; BUZ, Buzzard; GEA, Golden Eagle; LAM, Lammergeier; PER, Peregrine Falcon; PTA, Ptarmigan; QUA, Quail; RBS, Red- Backed Shrike; RPA, Red-legged Partridge; WHI, Whinchat; YEL, Yellowhammer.</p>
