 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The greatest perceived threats to populations of Alpine birds over the next fifty years were mostly associated with land management, in particular urbanization, land abandonment, changes in forestry practices and changes in leisure activities. The species groups considered most threatened were clearly Galliformes and raptors. There was a high degree of concordance between experts at the species group level, and a reasonable level of concordance at the species level, indicating that responses were generally consistent across experts.</p>
 <sec class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Caveats on interpretation</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Caution needs to be taken when interpreting expert knowledge surveys (
   <a rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-30">Martin et al., 2012</a>). A particular caveat for our study was that some threats may not be independent. For example, climate change may result in less snow in winter, which in turn may mean that ski pistes are constructed at higher altitudes, increasing disturbance in these areas (
   <a rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-17">Elsasser &amp; Messerli, 2001</a>). In this case, although the ultimate cause may be climate change, an expert may rank leisure as a greater threat. We were aware of this, but decided not to provide guidance to the experts to avoid influencing their scores. However, in such cases we feel that the experts identified the main proximate threats.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A second caveat is that sample size was not large (19 experts completed the questionnaire correctly), although it was comparable to many other (e.g., 
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 20, 
   <a rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-31">Martin et al., 2005</a>; 
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 10, 
   <a rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-35">O’Neill et al., 2008</a>; 
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 8, 
   <a rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-14">Czembor et al., 2011</a>; 
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 16, 
   <a rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-26">Lukey et al., 2011</a>), but by no means all (e.g., 
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 244, 
   <a rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-16">Donlan et al., 2010</a>), published expert knowledge surveys. Rather than the small sample size 
   <span class="italic">per se</span>, the geographical distribution of experts and small sample sizes for certain regions may present more of a bias. Despite that we requested that experts judge threats for the whole Alpine region, and not just their own country or region, we cannot rule out that opinions were influenced by regional issues. Geographical variation may cause different experts to assign different threats depending on local, regional or national land use trends. For example, land abandonment is a major issue in the Western Italian Alps (e.g., 
   <a rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-33">Motta, Morales &amp; Nola, 2006</a>), whereas intensification of grassland management is occurring in some parts of Switzerland, at least towards the lower altitudinal limit considered here (e.g., 
   <a rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-1">Andrey et al., 2014</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There was no evidence overall that the experts’ ranking was associated with the extent of knowledge on the species, as measured by the number of citations. Furthermore, for the experts that responded to the follow-up survey, there was no correlation between the number of cases (i.e., all species across experts, as in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" href="#fig-1">Fig. 1</a>) classed as a non-zero threat and the number of experts claiming research experience for a given threat (Spearman correlation 
   <span class="italic">r</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">s</span>
   </sub> = 0.32, 
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 12, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.40), nor was there any correlation when considering only species classed as moderate or severely threatened (
   <span class="italic">r</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">s</span>
   </sub> = 0.52, 
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 12, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.12). However, it should be noted that the two threats with the lowest concordance, 
   <span class="italic">Fire</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Mining</span>, were also those for which the experts had hardly any experience. We cannot therefore completely discount that for some species, the experts were influenced by their own research experience, or by the published literature in assigning threats. It should also be pointed out, however, that a number of species were perceived as more threatened than average for which little research had been carried out in alpine environments (e.g., Quail, Wheatear 
   <span class="italic">Oenanthe oenanthe</span>, Whinchat, Red-backed Shrike, Yellowhammer all &lt;10 citations and 
   <span class="italic">T</span>
   <sub>mean</sub> ≥ 0.57, the overall mean across species being 0.44). These species therefore may warrant further research in the future.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The respondents were selected based on the choice of the authors, often through previous professional collaborations, rather than being selected in any systematic way. This may have biased the outcomes. For example, most experts were Italian, male and middle-aged. However, there is likely to be a trade-off between the response rate and the degree to which experts are selected based on wholly objective criteria (as per 
   <a rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-14">Czembor et al., 2011</a>). Indeed, the response rate here was exceptionally high (83%, not including the incorrectly compiled questionnaire) compared to other similar studies (e.g., 17%, 
   <a rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-14">Czembor et al., 2011</a>; 32%, 
   <a rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-26">Lukey et al., 2011</a>). Even in these studies, it seems plausible to expect that those experts that responded would have been dominated by those known to the authors. Nevertheless, a more diverse panel in terms of nationality, age and gender would have been desirable, in keeping with the recommendations of 
   <a rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-48">Sutherland &amp; Burgman (2015)</a>. The extent to which such biases can affect the outcomes of expert knowledge surveys would need a large sample of both individually selected and objectively selected experts.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Key perceived threats</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several threats that were perceived as most important were associated with land use changes in the Alps that have been ongoing for several decades. Land abandonment by human populations has been an ongoing process in many parts of the Alps over the course of the past century (
   <a rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-10">Cernusca, Tappeiner &amp; Bayfield, 1999</a>), and this has been accompanied by a decrease in farming activity resulting in encroachment of shrubs and subsequently forest in formerly open areas. Whilst this may mean a return to a more ‘natural’ state, there is nevertheless evidence that the loss of the cultural landscape mosaic of shrubs, trees and grassland in the Alps has had a negative overall impact on biodiversity (e.g., 
   <a rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-24">Laiolo et al., 2004</a>). At the same time, many areas have moved away from farming to leisure activities, in particular winter sports, which have several reported negative effects on biodiversity (e.g., 
   <a rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-2">Arlettaz et al., 2007</a>; 
   <a rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-42">Rolando et al., 2007</a>). Whilst the urban working population of Alpine settlements declined over the course of the last century (
   <a rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-10">Cernusca, Tappeiner &amp; Bayfield, 1999</a>), urbanization was perceived as a continuing threat largely due to developments to accommodate the current main economic contributor, tourism.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change is undoubtedly considered one of the major potential threats to biodiversity globally (
   <a rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-36">Parmesan, 2006</a>), and also specifically to mountain biodiversity (
   <a rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-46">Sekercioglu et al., 2008</a>). However, climate change was rarely ranked as moderate or severe, and had relatively low concordance for individual species and for species groups defined according to SPEC status, despite that recent models have indicated potential negative effects of climate change on alpine birds in the future (
   <a rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-12">Chamberlain et al., 2013</a>; 
   <a rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-7">Braunisch et al., 2014</a>; 
   <a rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-29">Maggini et al., 2014</a>; 
   <a rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-5">Brambilla et al., 2015</a>). This may reflect the fact that most models of climate change impacts on biodiversity are considered over a relatively longer term (
   <a rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-13">Chapman et al., 2014</a>) and are therefore perceived as being less relevant to current conservation problems. The results concur with the view that habitat degradation and loss are the key general threats to terrestrial biodiversity (e.g., 
   <a rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-43">Sala et al., 2000</a>; 
   <a rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-23">Jetz, Wilcove &amp; Dobson, 2007</a>).

 <sec class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Species perceived as threatened</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Galliformes and raptors were the two groups perceived to be most threatened, both in terms of individual (NMDS) and group-level (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4" href="#fig-4">Fig. 4</a>) analyses. Both of these groups are quite sensitive to disturbance (e.g., 
   <a rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-2">Arlettaz et al., 2007</a>; 
   <a rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-49">Watson, 2010</a>) and are also often killed either for, respectively, food (grouse, 
   <a rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-50">Watson &amp; Moss, 2008</a>) or illegal shooting (raptors, 
   <a rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-37">Pedrini &amp; Sergio, 2001</a>). Historically, it seems likely that raptor populations in the Alps have been limited by persecution, although this threat has declined in recent years (e.g., 
   <a rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-18">Fasce et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, large raptors are likely to be relatively vulnerable to collisions with wind turbines (e.g., 
   <a rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-27">Madders &amp; Whitfield, 2006</a>; 
   <a rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-3">Bellebaum et al., 2013</a>), hence changes in energy generation are considered a threat. Neither 
   <span class="italic">Hunting</span> nor 
   <span class="italic">Energy</span> were perceived as the commonest overall threats, but they clearly were perceived as being very important for particular species groups.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other species groups (passerines and other non-passerines) had on average much lower threat scores, with many not being considered as threatened by many of the factors considered. In terms of habitat groups, this was also true for generalists (often widespread adaptable species found in small numbers at the limit of their altitudinal range in our study) and forest species. Open habitat species were perceived as the most threatened habitat group overall, although this was largely driven by a relatively small number of raptors and Galliformes. When these were removed, the remaining species (including high altitude specialists such as Alpine Chough 
   <span class="italic">Pyrrhocorax graculus</span> and Alpine Accentor 
   <span class="italic">Prunella collaris</span>) were considered not highly threatened. There were higher scores for species associated with mosaic habitats close to the treeline, such as Red-backed Shrike, Whinchat and Yellowhammer, reflecting perceived threats of land abandonment and grazing intensity (e.g., 
   <a rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-6">Brambilla, Rubolini &amp; Guidali, 2007</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The experts were requested to rank each species on the basis of likely future impacts using a simple 4-level ranking. Whilst other similar surveys have used far more detailed rankings (e.g., up to 10 levels—
   <a rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-16">Donlan et al., 2010</a>), we adopted a deliberately simple approach in the hope of maximising participation. Whilst the experts showed good levels of consistency in their interpretation of the different ranks, there remain two potential drawbacks with the approach. First, there was no scope for including an unknown category in the scoring system. We cannot therefore discount that a zero rank may have represented an unknown effect rather than no effect, but we still feel that the method identifies the species that are currently considered as priorities.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, the approach adopted focussed on perceived negative effects. However, some of the drivers identified may also have positive effects for some species. Both climate change and land abandonment may have positive effects for forest species due to forest expansion (e.g., 
   <a rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-12">Chamberlain et al., 2013</a>). Here, for the most part, forest species had low threat scores, so positive effects in these species do not affect the conclusions concerning the majority of threatened species identified (although it should be noted the 
   <span class="italic">Forestry</span> had relatively low concordance). Similarly, urbanization may benefit some generalist species, but again, these were species with low or zero threat scores and typically generalists more usually associated with lower altitudes. Increased hunting pressure, whilst disproportionately affecting grouse and raptors, may nevertheless have positive effects on some, particularly prey, species. In general, whilst we acknowledge that some positive effects may cancel out or exceed negative effects in some species, such effects are likely to be more relevant to generalist and/or lower altitude species (i.e., forest species)—the key species groups identified as being under threat are unlikely to show any compensatory positive effects from any of the threats considered.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, the perception of the level of threat identified in the survey was in accord with the conservation status of the species considered, in that species classified as of conservation concern by BirdLife International had higher 
   <span class="italic">T</span>
   <sub>mean</sub> (see 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4" href="#supp-4">Table S1</a> for SPEC classifications of the species considered). Therefore in general, the experts were identifying those species of most current concern as having higher levels of perceived threat. There may of course be some effect of prior knowledge of the experts, i.e., they may have been more likely to consider a species as threatened if they knew it was already classified as of conservation interest. Nevertheless, there were also 25 species with no SPEC listing that were identified as facing some threat (i.e., that appeared in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="table-2" href="#table-2">Table 2</a>). Of particular interest are those species that are not currently classified as SPECs, but which had relatively high threat scores (e.g., Buzzard, Peregrine Falcon, Ptarmigan, Whinchat and Yellowhammer). Whilst some of these species may not be of conservation concern at present, they may be species that should be considered as higher priorities for research and conservation actions before problems arise in the future.

 <sec class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Geographic distribution of perceived threat</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By combining threat scores for individual species with their distribution across the Alps, we were able to produce a map of geographical variation in overall threats to the bird community. This suggested that Alpine bird communities had more threatened species in the north and west of the area. Such an approach could be used as a basis for identifying areas that have bird communities that may be sensitive to the threats identified, and therefore may be candidate locations for species protection through active conservation management or restrictions on activities (leisure, agriculture, energy generation) that may threaten bird populations in those areas. The scale at which the threat map was produced was limited by the availability of the underlying bird distribution data, and therefore may be of use in guiding regional conservation strategies at a relatively large scale in that it identifies regions that are worthy of more detailed consideration (e.g., suitable locations for the creation of protected areas). However, we feel that the approach has great potential in developing risk assessments for environmental change which take a community-level approach, rather than focussing on individual species of conservation concern, and that it could be developed further given the availability of finer-scale data.</p>
