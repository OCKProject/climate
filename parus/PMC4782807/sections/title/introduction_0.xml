 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A large and increasing proportion of the world’s species are threatened with extinction, largely as a result of man’s activity (
  <a rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-8">Butchart et al., 2010</a>). Knowledge about the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that lead to population decline and ultimately species extinction can be used to help to direct management efforts and allocate limited resources to specific conservation interventions. It is necessary both to understand past and current threats that may have led to recent population declines or range contractions, but also to assess future risks for particular sets of species, their likely sensitivity to those risks, and ultimately to make provision for conservation action. This may be through designing and implementing management action, or simply designating potentially at-risk species for further research and monitoring.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ideally, detailed autecological knowledge and demographic studies over a long-term would be used to assess likely future threats and extinction risks (
  <a rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-45">Schurr et al., 2012</a>); however, such a situation is very much an ideal, and there are relatively few species globally for which adequate data are available. Indeed, there are key knowledge gaps on the status and trends of a large proportion of the world’s species, whether considered threatened or not (
  <a rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-40">Rands et al., 2010</a>). This may be due to a lack of financial resources to collect such data, or the logistical difficulties of carrying out biodiversity research in challenging and inaccessible environments—and often these two aspects are not independent. Instead of relying on actual data, knowledge gaps in terms of potential threats to species have often been addressed through expert opinion (e.g., 
  <a rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-31">Martin et al., 2005</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-47" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-47">Sutherland, 2006</a>), whereby the opinions of (usually several) experts in a given research field are elicited 
  <span class="italic">in lieu</span> of, or in addition to, existing data. In the field of conservation biology, such approaches are typically designed in a way to facilitate data analyses (as here) which are subsequently used as the basis to guide decision making (e.g. 
  <a rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-35">O’Neill et al., 2008</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-16">Donlan et al., 2010</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-14">Czembor et al., 2011</a>). Whilst there are a number of potential problems with such approaches, they can nonetheless provide useful information as long as they are analysed and interpreted correctly with suitable caveats (e.g., 
  <a rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-32">McBride, Fidler &amp; Burgman, 2012</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-19">French, 2012</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-48">Sutherland &amp; Burgman, 2015</a>), and indeed they may be the only option for making ecological predictions in the absence of other information (
  <a rid="ref-47" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-47">Sutherland, 2006</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Globally, high altitude habitats have a relatively high biodiversity value, but in some areas at least are also under considerable threat from a range of factors, including changes in agricultural practices (e.g., 
  <a rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-24">Laiolo et al., 2004</a>), increasing disturbance (e.g., 
  <a rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-42">Rolando et al., 2007</a>) and climate change (
  <a rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-15">Dirnböck, Essl &amp; Babitsch, 2011</a>). However, simply due to the logistical challenges of monitoring and research in mountain areas, there is a relative lack of data on distributions, population trends and even basic autoecology for species at high altitude. Birds are amongst the most well-studied taxa, and yet even in generally well-researched European countries, there is little information from the majority of species in high altitude habitats that could be useful in making predictions, e.g., detailed habitat requirements or factors determining variation in key demographic rates (
  <a rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-11">Chamberlain et al., 2012</a>). Furthermore, good long-term monitoring data for high altitude species is available in only a few countries (e.g., 
  <a rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-28">Maggini et al., 2011</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Much research into potential threats to populations of birds of the European Alps has focussed on effects of disturbance through winter sports (e.g., 
  <a rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-2">Arlettaz et al., 2007</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-42">Rolando et al., 2007</a>) and on the effects of land abandonment (
  <a rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-24">Laiolo et al., 2004</a>), and more recently, climate change (
  <a rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-12">Chamberlain et al., 2013</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-7">Braunisch et al., 2014</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-29">Maggini et al., 2014</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-5">Brambilla et al., 2015</a>). Elevational range changes, likely resulting from climate change and/or land abandonment, have been described in a number of studies (e.g., 
  <a rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-41">Reif &amp; Flousek, 2012</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-39">Pernollet, Korner-Nievergelt &amp; Jenni, 2015</a>), although, with some notable exceptions (e.g., 
  <a rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-28">Maggini et al., 2011</a>), such studies have been largely based on restricted study locations. There is a need to identify a wider range of potential threats for the whole Alpine bird community across a larger area. We see expert opinion as an important step in gaining insight into the likely sensitivities of Alpine birds to future environmental change, and thereby to identify future conservation and research priorities. The specific aim of this study is to quantify qualitatively perceived conservation threats for European Alpine birds. We ask the following questions: (i) what are perceived by Alpine ornithologists as the most important threats across species? (ii) how are species distributed along gradients of perceived threat? (iii) Are there any spatial patterns of perceived threat at the community level?
