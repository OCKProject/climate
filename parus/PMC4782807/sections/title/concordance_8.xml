  <span class="italic">W</span> for each individual threat, over all species and according to species groups, is shown in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="table-2" href="#table-2">Table 2</a>. There was a good level of concordance among experts for most threats for all of the different classifications, and most values of 
  <span class="italic">W</span> were significantly different from zero. Concordance for all individual species was generally lower than for species groups, notably for 
  <span class="italic">Mining</span> (which was not significantly different from zero), 
  <span class="italic">Fire</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Climate Change</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Urbanization</span> (
  <span class="italic">W</span> &lt; 0.40). However, some caution is needed in interpreting the latter results, given that there were many species, but only four possible threat scores, meaning that a large number of tied ranks were inevitable in the analysis. Nevertheless, we include these results for completeness. 
  <span class="italic">Mining</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Fire</span> (and to a lesser extent 
  <span class="italic">Forestry</span>) had consistently low concordance overall, which was often not significantly different from zero. Given the significant and often high levels of concordance among experts, in the following analyses we use statistics summarised across experts to analyse general trends in threat score, except for 
  <span class="italic">Mining</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Fire</span>, which were given a threat score for very few species by only a few experts, and this allocation was not consistent across experts (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="table-2" href="#table-2">Table 2</a>), therefore these are not considered further.
