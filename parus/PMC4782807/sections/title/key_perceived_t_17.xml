 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several threats that were perceived as most important were associated with land use changes in the Alps that have been ongoing for several decades. Land abandonment by human populations has been an ongoing process in many parts of the Alps over the course of the past century (
  <a rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-10">Cernusca, Tappeiner &amp; Bayfield, 1999</a>), and this has been accompanied by a decrease in farming activity resulting in encroachment of shrubs and subsequently forest in formerly open areas. Whilst this may mean a return to a more ‘natural’ state, there is nevertheless evidence that the loss of the cultural landscape mosaic of shrubs, trees and grassland in the Alps has had a negative overall impact on biodiversity (e.g., 
  <a rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-24">Laiolo et al., 2004</a>). At the same time, many areas have moved away from farming to leisure activities, in particular winter sports, which have several reported negative effects on biodiversity (e.g., 
  <a rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-2">Arlettaz et al., 2007</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-42">Rolando et al., 2007</a>). Whilst the urban working population of Alpine settlements declined over the course of the last century (
  <a rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-10">Cernusca, Tappeiner &amp; Bayfield, 1999</a>), urbanization was perceived as a continuing threat largely due to developments to accommodate the current main economic contributor, tourism.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change is undoubtedly considered one of the major potential threats to biodiversity globally (
  <a rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-36">Parmesan, 2006</a>), and also specifically to mountain biodiversity (
  <a rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-46">Sekercioglu et al., 2008</a>). However, climate change was rarely ranked as moderate or severe, and had relatively low concordance for individual species and for species groups defined according to SPEC status, despite that recent models have indicated potential negative effects of climate change on alpine birds in the future (
  <a rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-12">Chamberlain et al., 2013</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-7">Braunisch et al., 2014</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-29">Maggini et al., 2014</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-5">Brambilla et al., 2015</a>). This may reflect the fact that most models of climate change impacts on biodiversity are considered over a relatively longer term (
  <a rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-13">Chapman et al., 2014</a>) and are therefore perceived as being less relevant to current conservation problems. The results concur with the view that habitat degradation and loss are the key general threats to terrestrial biodiversity (e.g., 
  <a rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-43">Sala et al., 2000</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-23">Jetz, Wilcove &amp; Dobson, 2007</a>).
