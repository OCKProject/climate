 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Consistency in response between experts was assessed using Kendall’s coefficient of concordance (
  <span class="italic">W</span>). First, consistency in overall threat scores for the community was assessed by comparing the threat score across all species for each threat separately (i.e., calculation of 
  <span class="italic">W</span> was based on a matrix of experts by species, for each threat). Similar calculations were also carried out to assess consistency of mean threat scores calculated for species groups according to taxonomy, habitat and conservation status (see below). The level of significance was set at 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.00125 (i.e., 0.05/40, to account for the large number of repeated statistical tests in

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data were analysed at the individual species level, and by defining species into groups defined according to taxonomy, habitat and conservation status (see below). For the species-level analysis, a consensus matrix across respondents was derived by calculating the mode of the scores for each species/threat combination, where significant concordance was indicated for a given threat. There were cases where there was no single mode value, hence two matrices were derived, one using minimum mode values and one using maximum values. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was initially used to summarise the major patterns of variation in the two matrices of threat scores in order to assess consistency between minimum and maximum mode. We decided to use NMDS over other methods, such as PCA, as it can handle non-Euclidean distance matrices (
  <a rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-25">Legendre &amp; Legendre, 2012</a>). Because our input data consisted of categorical variables, the Gower general dissimilarity index (
  <a rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-20">Gower, 1975</a>) was used to construct a distance matrix. The basic objective of NMDS is to plot dissimilar objects that are far apart and similar objects close to one another in ordination space. NMDS makes no assumptions about normality or linearity of the underlying data. NMDS requires the user to specify a number of 
  <span class="italic">m</span> dimensions to which the dataset is reduced. The 
  <span class="italic">n</span> objects (here, species) are then placed and ranked in this pre-chosen space and an initial configuration of the objects in 
  <span class="italic">m</span>-dimensional ordination space is computed. This configuration process is that used for an iterative arrangement. We used one-hundred random starts to find a stable solution to avoid local minima. Stress values, i.e., the sum of squared differences between fitted and original distances, were used to assess how well the configuration of points in reduced ordination space described the original distance matrix. Stress values, which can vary between 0 and 1, were used to rank species scores in terms of their goodness of fit.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used Procrustes and PROTEST analyses (
  <a rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-38">Peres-Neto &amp; Jackson, 2001</a>) to address the issue of variability within different forced consensus matrices by comparing the two NMDS ordinations performed on our data matrices based on the two different modes. Procrustes analysis works by scaling, rotating, and dilating one ordination solution and then superimposing it on a second ordination, maximizing the fit between corresponding observations of the two ordination configurations. The most frequently used method for Procrustean fitting is based on the least-squares criterion that minimizes the sum of the squared residuals (
  <span class="italic">m</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span>) between the two configurations; the 
  <span class="italic">m</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> statistic is thus a measure of association (i.e., concordance) between the two configurations. This is the significance test for procrustes analysis to verify whether multivariate configurations match (
  <a rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-38">Peres-Neto &amp; Jackson, 2001</a>). PROTEST extends Procrustes analysis by providing a permutation procedure to assess the statistical significance of the Procrustean fit (
  <a rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-38">Peres-Neto &amp; Jackson, 2001</a>). PROTEST randomly permutes the original scores of the NMDS ordination so that scores can be assigned any of the values attributed to other species (
  <a rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-22">Jackson, 1995</a>). The 
  <span class="italic">m</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> statistic is then recalculated for each permutation, and the proportion of the statistics smaller than or equal to the observed value provides the significance level of the test.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To summarise the general patterns in perceived threats to species groups (defined according to taxonomy, habitat or threat status), we calculated the mean species threat score 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>mean</sub> for each group for each expert. The median 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>mean</sub> was compared between groups using the Friedman test (i.e., analysing the expert × group matrix), or for comparisons with only two groups (relevant to SPEC status), the Wilcoxon test.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess the extent to which threat scores were applied by experts independently of published research on the ecology of each species in mountain environments, we correlated overall 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>mean</sub> for each species, calculated across all threats and experts, with relevant citations for each species derived from a standardized search in Web of Science™. For each species individually, we searched for papers published since 1970 that contained both the species name and reference to the Alps or mountains, specifically ‘TS = (alps OR alpine OR mountain
  <span class="sup">∗</span>) AND TS = (“species English name” OR “species scientific name”)’. There are several cases where scientific names have changed over the past few decades (e.g., Willow Tit 
  <span class="italic">Poecile montanus</span> was until recently 
  <span class="italic">Parus montanus</span>). In such cases, searches were carried out including both old and new scientific names. Similarly, for species with alternative English names (such as Skylark 
  <span class="italic">Alauda arvensis</span> or Sky Lark), all versions of a name were included in the search. We inspected each resulting reference list for non-relevant references (which were removed) and for any known references which were not included (in practice these were references that considered a range of species, rather than being species-specific studies, e.g., 
  <a rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-24">Laiolo et al., 2004</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-9">Caprio et al., 2011</a>). The final total references were then correlated against 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>mean</sub> for each species using Spearman rank correlation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to explore spatial patterns of threat, we matched our threat scores to species distribution data for the Alpine region, derived from the European Atlas of Breeding Birds (
  <a rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-21">Hagemeijer &amp; Blair, 1997</a>). Although these distributional data have a rather coarse resolution (50 × 50 km), they are the best available data covering the whole Alpine region. An overall threat score was calculated for each 50 × 50 km square by taking the mean of the overall threat scores of all the species present in that square. We tested for the existence of any latitudinal or longitudinal gradients of threats using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients.
