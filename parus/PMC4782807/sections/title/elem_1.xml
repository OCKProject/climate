  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Species regularly breeding in the European Alps were considered at altitudes above 1,700 m asl. We did not adopt an 
   <span class="italic">a priori</span> definition of an ‘Alpine bird species.’ Rather, a complete species list was objectively derived from species recorded in two different data sets, both of which surveyed birds in a series of 10-minute point counts along altitudinal transects in the breeding season, from c. 1,700 m (the approximate altitude at which broadleaved forest does not occur) to c. 3,000 m, one in Piedmont and one in Trentino (full methods are given in 
   <a rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-12">Chamberlain et al., 2013</a>). This included a total of 69 species (see 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4" href="#supp-4">Table S1</a>) which we henceforth refer to as ‘Alpine birds.’ Species groups were defined based firstly on the predominant nesting habitat type used in the Alps at the altitudes considered, where ‘open’ indicates usually ground (or sometimes cliff)-nesting species occurring in Alpine grasslands, ‘treeline’ indicates species commonly occurring in mosaic habitats near to the treeline, ‘forest’ indicates species associated with mature forest, and ‘gen’ indicates generalist species occurring in a range of different habitats (often anthropogenic), and all other species which could not be classified on the basis of the former groups. Definitions were based on personal observations and experience, and also by the classifications used by the European Bird Census Council (
   <span xlink:href="http://www.ebcc.info" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.ebcc.info</span>). Species were also grouped according to taxonomy, namely Passeriformes (passerines), Accipitriformes (raptors), Galliformes, and other non-passerines (henceforth ‘non-passerines’), and according to conservation status based on SPEC category (
   <a rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-4">BirdLife International, 2004</a>). This classifies species on the basis of their conservation status in Europe, where SPEC1 indicates a species threatened in Europe and globally, SPEC2 indicates a species threatened in Europe, but not globally, and most of the global breeding population is within Europe, and SPEC 3 indicates a species which is threatened in Europe but not globally, and most of the global breeding population is outside of Europe.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To estimate perceived threats for our set of study species, we developed a questionnaire for evaluation by ornithologists with experience of working in the European Alps. Initial drafts of the questionnaire and instructions were sent to three experts in order to test the methodology and receive feedback. After this initial stage, the modified questionnaire was sent to 23 independent ornithologists (i.e., not including the authors) with experience of research and monitoring (i.e., on a wide range of species) in the Alpine region. The selection of experts was based on personal knowledge of ornithologists who had known experience of either scientific research or formal monitoring in the European Alps. The selection was therefore through personal contacts of the authors, rather than on objective criteria, the goal being to maximise the participation rate of the survey (see ‘Discussion’ for an assessment of advantages and disadvantages of this approach). A follow-up survey was carried out in order to collect further information on the level of experience of each expert, in terms of experience of research and/or monitoring Alpine birds, the number of years this experience covered, and whether they had carried out research into each of the ten categories.</p>

A threat is defined as a factor that could have a negative impact on the population size or the distribution of a particular species at or above 1,700 m in altitude in the European Alps over a time frame of 50 years. We used a simplified version of the threats described in a unified scheme proposed by 
   <a rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-44">Salafsky et al. (2008)</a>, which comprises three hierarchical classes of threats which increase in specificity with each class. A full description of the threats is provided in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="table-1" href="#table-1">Table 1</a>. Respondents were only asked to rank threats at the more detailed level (2nd level). The ranking regimes were statements that define the negative impact that a potential threat can have on the population of a particular species (3 = severe negative effect, 2 = moderate negative effect, 1 = minor negative effect, 0 = no negative effect). This ranking is henceforth referred to as the threat score. In cases where a respondent deemed that there could be positive and negative effects under a given heading, he/she was asked to consider the net effect of each threat considered (e.g., if two factors under a given threat cancel each other out, then the threat score should be 0). Similarly, if there were two factors under a given threat that may have differing threat levels, the respondent was allowed to judge whether the effect of one over-rides the effect of the other, or whether an intermediate threat level was more appropriate.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The analytical objective was simply to allow a relative ranking of threats, rather than to try and make firm predictions of, for example, probability of regional or national extinction of a species. However, the interpretation of the level of threats, and in particular how it may vary across experts, is of interest in interpreting the results. Therefore, as part of the follow-up survey (see above), experts were also asked how they interpreted the different categories in relation to effects on species’ populations.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data were analysed at the individual species level, and by defining species into groups defined according to taxonomy, habitat and conservation status (see below). For the species-level analysis, a consensus matrix across respondents was derived by calculating the mode of the scores for each species/threat combination, where significant concordance was indicated for a given threat. There were cases where there was no single mode value, hence two matrices were derived, one using minimum mode values and one using maximum values. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was initially used to summarise the major patterns of variation in the two matrices of threat scores in order to assess consistency between minimum and maximum mode. We decided to use NMDS over other methods, such as PCA, as it can handle non-Euclidean distance matrices (
   <a rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-25">Legendre &amp; Legendre, 2012</a>). Because our input data consisted of categorical variables, the Gower general dissimilarity index (
   <a rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-20">Gower, 1975</a>) was used to construct a distance matrix. The basic objective of NMDS is to plot dissimilar objects that are far apart and similar objects close to one another in ordination space. NMDS makes no assumptions about normality or linearity of the underlying data. NMDS requires the user to specify a number of 
   <span class="italic">m</span> dimensions to which the dataset is reduced. The 
   <span class="italic">n</span> objects (here, species) are then placed and ranked in this pre-chosen space and an initial configuration of the objects in 
   <span class="italic">m</span>-dimensional ordination space is computed. This configuration process is that used for an iterative arrangement. We used one-hundred random starts to find a stable solution to avoid local minima. Stress values, i.e., the sum of squared differences between fitted and original distances, were used to assess how well the configuration of points in reduced ordination space described the original distance matrix. Stress values, which can vary between 0 and 1, were used to rank species scores in terms of their goodness of fit.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used Procrustes and PROTEST analyses (
   <a rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-38">Peres-Neto &amp; Jackson, 2001</a>) to address the issue of variability within different forced consensus matrices by comparing the two NMDS ordinations performed on our data matrices based on the two different modes. Procrustes analysis works by scaling, rotating, and dilating one ordination solution and then superimposing it on a second ordination, maximizing the fit between corresponding observations of the two ordination configurations. The most frequently used method for Procrustean fitting is based on the least-squares criterion that minimizes the sum of the squared residuals (
   <span class="italic">m</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span>) between the two configurations; the 
   <span class="italic">m</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> statistic is thus a measure of association (i.e., concordance) between the two configurations. This is the significance test for procrustes analysis to verify whether multivariate configurations match (
   <a rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-38">Peres-Neto &amp; Jackson, 2001</a>). PROTEST extends Procrustes analysis by providing a permutation procedure to assess the statistical significance of the Procrustean fit (
   <a rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-38">Peres-Neto &amp; Jackson, 2001</a>). PROTEST randomly permutes the original scores of the NMDS ordination so that scores can be assigned any of the values attributed to other species (
   <a rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-22">Jackson, 1995</a>). The 
   <span class="italic">m</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> statistic is then recalculated for each permutation, and the proportion of the statistics smaller than or equal to the observed value provides the significance level of the test.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To summarise the general patterns in perceived threats to species groups (defined according to taxonomy, habitat or threat status), we calculated the mean species threat score 
   <span class="italic">T</span>
   <sub>mean</sub> for each group for each expert. The median 
   <span class="italic">T</span>
   <sub>mean</sub> was compared between groups using the Friedman test (i.e., analysing the expert × group matrix), or for comparisons with only two groups (relevant to SPEC status), the Wilcoxon test.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess the extent to which threat scores were applied by experts independently of published research on the ecology of each species in mountain environments, we correlated overall 
   <span class="italic">T</span>
   <sub>mean</sub> for each species, calculated across all threats and experts, with relevant citations for each species derived from a standardized search in Web of Science™. For each species individually, we searched for papers published since 1970 that contained both the species name and reference to the Alps or mountains, specifically ‘TS = (alps OR alpine OR mountain
   <span class="sup">∗</span>) AND TS = (“species English name” OR “species scientific name”)’. There are several cases where scientific names have changed over the past few decades (e.g., Willow Tit 
   <span class="italic">Poecile montanus</span> was until recently 
   <span class="italic">Parus montanus</span>). In such cases, searches were carried out including both old and new scientific names. Similarly, for species with alternative English names (such as Skylark 
   <span class="italic">Alauda arvensis</span> or Sky Lark), all versions of a name were included in the search. We inspected each resulting reference list for non-relevant references (which were removed) and for any known references which were not included (in practice these were references that considered a range of species, rather than being species-specific studies, e.g., 
   <a rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-24">Laiolo et al., 2004</a>; 
   <a rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-9">Caprio et al., 2011</a>). The final total references were then correlated against

   <sub>mean</sub> for each species using Spearman rank correlation.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to explore spatial patterns of threat, we matched our threat scores to species distribution data for the Alpine region, derived from the European Atlas of Breeding Birds (
   <a rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-21">Hagemeijer &amp; Blair, 1997</a>). Although these distributional data have a rather coarse resolution (50 × 50 km), they are the best available data covering the whole Alpine region. An overall threat score was calculated for each 50 × 50 km square by taking the mean of the overall threat scores of all the species present in that square. We tested for the existence of any latitudinal or longitudinal gradients of threats using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients.
