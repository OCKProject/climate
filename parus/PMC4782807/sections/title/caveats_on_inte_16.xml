 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Caution needs to be taken when interpreting expert knowledge surveys (
  <a rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-30">Martin et al., 2012</a>). A particular caveat for our study was that some threats may not be independent. For example, climate change may result in less snow in winter, which in turn may mean that ski pistes are constructed at higher altitudes, increasing disturbance in these areas (
  <a rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-17">Elsasser &amp; Messerli, 2001</a>). In this case, although the ultimate cause may be climate change, an expert may rank leisure as a greater threat. We were aware of this, but decided not to provide guidance to the experts to avoid influencing their scores. However, in such cases we feel that the experts identified the main proximate threats.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A second caveat is that sample size was not large (19 experts completed the questionnaire correctly), although it was comparable to many other (e.g., 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 20, 
  <a rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-31">Martin et al., 2005</a>; 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 10, 
  <a rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-35">O’Neill et al., 2008</a>; 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 8, 
  <a rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-14">Czembor et al., 2011</a>; 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 16, 
  <a rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-26">Lukey et al., 2011</a>), but by no means all (e.g., 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 244, 
  <a rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-16">Donlan et al., 2010</a>), published expert knowledge surveys. Rather than the small sample size 
  <span class="italic">per se</span>, the geographical distribution of experts and small sample sizes for certain regions may present more of a bias. Despite that we requested that experts judge threats for the whole Alpine region, and not just their own country or region, we cannot rule out that opinions were influenced by regional issues. Geographical variation may cause different experts to assign different threats depending on local, regional or national land use trends. For example, land abandonment is a major issue in the Western Italian Alps (e.g., 
  <a rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-33">Motta, Morales &amp; Nola, 2006</a>), whereas intensification of grassland management is occurring in some parts of Switzerland, at least towards the lower altitudinal limit considered here (e.g., 
  <a rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-1">Andrey et al., 2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There was no evidence overall that the experts’ ranking was associated with the extent of knowledge on the species, as measured by the number of citations. Furthermore, for the experts that responded to the follow-up survey, there was no correlation between the number of cases (i.e., all species across experts, as in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" href="#fig-1">Fig. 1</a>) classed as a non-zero threat and the number of experts claiming research experience for a given threat (Spearman correlation 
  <span class="italic">r</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">s</span>
  </sub> = 0.32, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 12, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.40), nor was there any correlation when considering only species classed as moderate or severely threatened (
  <span class="italic">r</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">s</span>
  </sub> = 0.52, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 12, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.12). However, it should be noted that the two threats with the lowest concordance, 
  <span class="italic">Fire</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Mining</span>, were also those for which the experts had hardly any experience. We cannot therefore completely discount that for some species, the experts were influenced by their own research experience, or by the published literature in assigning threats. It should also be pointed out, however, that a number of species were perceived as more threatened than average for which little research had been carried out in alpine environments (e.g., Quail, Wheatear 
  <span class="italic">Oenanthe oenanthe</span>, Whinchat, Red-backed Shrike, Yellowhammer all &lt;10 citations and 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>mean</sub> ≥ 0.57, the overall mean across species being 0.44). These species therefore may warrant further research in the future.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The respondents were selected based on the choice of the authors, often through previous professional collaborations, rather than being selected in any systematic way. This may have biased the outcomes. For example, most experts were Italian, male and middle-aged. However, there is likely to be a trade-off between the response rate and the degree to which experts are selected based on wholly objective criteria (as per 
  <a rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-14">Czembor et al., 2011</a>). Indeed, the response rate here was exceptionally high (83%, not including the incorrectly compiled questionnaire) compared to other similar studies (e.g., 17%, 
  <a rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-14">Czembor et al., 2011</a>; 32%, 
  <a rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-26">Lukey et al., 2011</a>). Even in these studies, it seems plausible to expect that those experts that responded would have been dominated by those known to the authors. Nevertheless, a more diverse panel in terms of nationality, age and gender would have been desirable, in keeping with the recommendations of 
  <a rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-48">Sutherland &amp; Burgman (2015)</a>. The extent to which such biases can affect the outcomes of expert knowledge surveys would need a large sample of both individually selected and objectively selected experts.
