  <div class="title">Results from the NMDS analysis of the species by threat matrix.</div>
  <p>Filled triangles are scores for each threat on the two NMDS axes. Open diamonds are scores for each species distributed along a threat gradient, codes identify species. For clarity, species with low scores on both axes (i.e., those clustered around the origin) are not identified to species. Species codes are: BGR, Black Grouse; BUZ, Buzzard; GEA, Golden Eagle; LAM, Lammergeier; PER, Peregrine Falcon; PTA, Ptarmigan; QUA, Quail; RBS, Red- Backed Shrike; RPA, Red-legged Partridge; WHI, Whinchat; YEL, Yellowhammer.</p>
