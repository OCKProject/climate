 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We received 20 completed questionnaires from researchers working in Italy (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 15), Austria (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 3), Switzerland (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 2) and Spain (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 1). One questionnaire was omitted from the analysis due to errors (the expert did not follow the recommended scoring system), leaving a sample of 19. The experts were from a range of professions, with seven from universities, five from research institutes (including museums), four freelance professionals and two working for national or regional parks. One expert specified joint employment for a university and a national government. The sample of experts was strongly male-biased with only a single female representative. For the follow-up questionnaire, there were twelve responses (i.e., 60% of the original respondents). Of this sub-sample, the average age was 48.5 years (range 36–63), and the average years of experience on Alpine research or monitoring was 20 years (range 6–45). Of this subsample, eight reported experience of research on 
  <span class="italic">Hunting</span>, seven each on 
  <span class="italic">Forestry</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Climate Change</span>, five on 
  <span class="italic">Abandonment</span>, four each on 
  <span class="italic">Grazing</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Leisure</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Urbanization</span>, three on 
  <span class="italic">Energy</span>, one on fire and none on mining. In terms of interpretation of threat levels, the experts were generally highly consistent in defining severe threats as leading to local extinction and reductions in distributions (10 out of 12). The moderate category had greater variation in definition, but for the most part was interpreted in terms of strong population declines (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 9), but also of changes in distribution (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 2), or simply the geographical extent over which the decline occurred (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 1). The minor category was generally defined as being detectable or statistically significant, but without leading to consequences for the population (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 10). (See 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2" href="#supp-2">Supplemental Information 2</a> for full responses.)
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A summary of the extent of perceived threat for each category was made by calculating the percentage of species that were ranked as at risk of minor, moderate or severe threat across all 19 experts for each threat category separately (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" href="#fig-1">Fig. 1</a>). Considering non-zero threats (i.e., disregarding whether minor, moderate or severe), 
  <span class="italic">Urbanization</span> was perceived as the most common threat across experts (c. 43% of responses were perceived as at least a minor threat across all experts), but 
  <span class="italic">Abandonment</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Forestry</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Leisure</span> were also commonly perceived as threats (&gt;30%). Other threat categories (
  <span class="italic">Fire</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Climate Change</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Grazing</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Hunting</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Energy</span>) were perceived as threats fairly commonly (22–28% of responses). 
  <span class="italic">Mining</span> was notably lower than the other threat categories (19%). The patterns were slightly different when considering only the higher threats (moderate or severe). 
  <span class="italic">Abandonment</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Urbanization</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Leisure</span> and to a lesser extent 
  <span class="italic">Forestry</span> were perceived as relatively moderate or severe. However, there were some threat categories that, whilst having a high percentage of non-zero threat scores, were less commonly considered moderate or severe, in particular 
  <span class="italic">Grazing</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Energy</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Fire</span> had fewer than 10% of responses classified as moderate or severe.

   <span class="italic">W</span> for each individual threat, over all species and according to species groups, is shown in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="table-2" href="#table-2">Table 2</a>. There was a good level of concordance among experts for most threats for all of the different classifications, and most values of 
   <span class="italic">W</span> were significantly different from zero. Concordance for all individual species was generally lower than for species groups, notably for 
   <span class="italic">Mining</span> (which was not significantly different from zero), 
   <span class="italic">Fire</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Climate Change</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Urbanization</span> (
   <span class="italic">W</span> &lt; 0.40). However, some caution is needed in interpreting the latter results, given that there were many species, but only four possible threat scores, meaning that a large number of tied ranks were inevitable in the analysis. Nevertheless, we include these results for completeness. 
   <span class="italic">Mining</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Fire</span> (and to a lesser extent 
   <span class="italic">Forestry</span>) had consistently low concordance overall, which was often not significantly different from zero. Given the significant and often high levels of concordance among experts, in the following analyses we use statistics summarised across experts to analyse general trends in threat score, except for 
   <span class="italic">Mining</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Fire</span>, which were given a threat score for very few species by only a few experts, and this allocation was not consistent across experts (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="table-2" href="#table-2">Table 2</a>), therefore these are not considered further.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The NMDS ordinations lead to satisfactory projections into two-dimensional space indicated by relatively low stress values (maximum mode values = 0.061, minimum mode values = 0.065). A comparison of the two NMDS ordinations (i.e., maximum or minimum mode) by means of a PROTEST analysis revealed that these were virtually identical (
   <span class="italic">m</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.94 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001), so we only report the results from the NMDS performed on the consensus matrix containing the maximum values of the mode.

   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-5" href="#supp-5">Table S2</a>). Axis 1 was associated with 
   <span class="italic">Urban</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Leisure</span> and

   <span class="italic">Abandonment</span> and

   <span class="italic">Energy</span>. The majority of species were characterized by low threat scores and hence were clustered around the origin, with no link to any particular threat (these are not shown on 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" href="#fig-2">Fig. 2</a>). Species associated with axis 1 were those with the highest perceived threats for 
   <span class="italic">Urbanization</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Leisure</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Hunting</span>, and to a lesser extent

   <span class="italic">Tetrao tetrix</span>, Ptarmigan 
   <span class="italic">Lagopus muta</span>, Rock Partridge 
   <span class="italic">Alectoris graeca</span>). In a similar manner, the major trend along axis 2 was a division of raptors (Golden Eagle, Lammergeier, Buzzard 
   <span class="italic">Buteo buteo</span>, Peregrine Falcon 
   <span class="italic">Falco peregrinus</span> in the lower half of the graph), suggesting 
   <span class="italic">Energy</span> as a major perceived threat, and species of open or transitional habitat (e.g., Black Grouse, Quail
