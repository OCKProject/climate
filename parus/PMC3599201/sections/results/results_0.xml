 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A significant correlation between environmental category and SNP allele frequency was detected in up to 55% of the tested loci, which is an exceptional success rate for these types of tests. In 
  <span class="italic">P. damicornis</span>, SNP allele frequencies of 
  <span class="italic">β-hexosaminidase</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Elongation factor 1-α</span> were significantly correlated to temperature in type α and to temperature and/or water clarity respectively in type β. Type α also showed a correlation between water clarity and SNP allele frequency in a gene of unknown function. In 
  <span class="italic">A. millepora</span>, allele frequencies at five (
  <span class="italic">β-gamma crystallin, Galaxin</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Ubiquitin, Ligand of Numb X2</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Thioredoxin</span>) SNP loci showed significant correlations.
