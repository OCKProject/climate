 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Current models of the Earth’s climate over the coming decades predict rapid changes in a range of parameters including temperature, rainfall, and ocean pH [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B1" href="#B1">1</a>]. Given the known and forecasted impacts of climate change on coral reef ecosystems [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B2" href="#B2">2</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B6" href="#B6">6</a>], a priority area in conservation initiatives should be the determination of the amount of adaptive genetic variation, i.e. variation at loci that have an effect on fitness [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B7" href="#B7">7</a>], in key habit forming organisms such as corals. Particularly, information on genetic markers that are correlated to stress tolerance will contribute to the accuracy of spatial mapping of reef vulnerability and can be incorporated into controlled restoration efforts.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are numerous approaches to detect adaptive genetic variation and signatures of local adaptation (reviewed in [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B8" href="#B8">8</a>]). In non-model species, population genomics has become the most commonly used approach for identifying genetic loci that are influenced by selection. Population genomics is a genome-wide application of population genetics, whereby a large number of loci are analysed in multiple populations, allowing for the discrimination between locus-specific (selection) and genome-wide (drift and migration) effects [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B9" href="#B9">9</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B10" href="#B10">10</a>] or for site specific adaptation in panmictic species [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B11" href="#B11">11</a>]. Some of the more commonly reported methods include the detection of non-random population divergence at specific loci (F
  <sub>ST</sub> outliers) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B12" href="#B12">12</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B14" href="#B14">14</a>], elucidating the genetic architecture of specific phenotypes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B15" href="#B15">15</a>], and associating the frequency distribution of alleles to one or more ecological variables (genetic-environment associations, GEAs) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B16" href="#B16">16</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B17" href="#B17">17</a>]. To date, evidence for genetic variation that is significantly associated to environmental heterogeneity, fitness and phenotype remains scarce [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B18" href="#B18">18</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B20" href="#B20">20</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adaptive genetic variation and its link to phenotypic traits has been widely studied in forestry (reviewed in [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B21" href="#B21">21</a>]. However, in many non-model organisms, the discovery of phenotype-linked genetic markers has often been serendipitous. For instance, a correlation between allozyme variation and variable thermal stress tolerance occurs in the fish 
  <span class="italic">Fundulus heteroclitus</span>, where the gene 
  <span class="italic">Lactate dehydrogenase-B</span> shows differences in allele frequencies between populations from distinct thermal environments [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B22" href="#B22">22</a>]. This variation is responsible for differences in physiological function and survival at high temperatures. Other examples of genotype to phenotype associations include the link between polymorphism in the 
  <span class="italic">Dopamine receptor D4</span> and personality in great tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B23" href="#B23">23</a>], and the correlation between melanism and variation in the 
  <span class="italic">Melancortin-1 receptor gene (Mc1r)</span> across several species, including moth, mice and humans [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B18" href="#B18">18</a>]. In the panmictic American eel, correlations between environmental variables and SNP allele frequencies have been attributed to post dispersal localised selection [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B11" href="#B11">11</a>]. The discovery of links such as those described above remains a challenge. However, the increased accessibility of genomic tools and data from non-model organisms make this a rapidly expanding research area.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is the largest coral reef ecosystem in the world. It spans over 2300 km along the East Coast of Australia and encompasses almost 3000 reefs [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B24" href="#B24">24</a>]. Like most of the world’s coral reefs, the GBR is under the influence of a range of direct and indirect anthropogenic stressors. Corals derive a large proportion of their energetic needs from the photosynthetic products of an endosymbiotic dinoflagellate (genus 
  <span class="italic">Symbiodinium</span>) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B25" href="#B25">25</a>] and thrive in clear, nutrient poor tropical waters, often near their upper thermal tolerance. Not surprisingly, current research shows that two of the main threats to the long term health of the GBR are climate change [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B5" href="#B5">5</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B26" href="#B26">26</a>] and declining water quality (in particular, water clarity) due to coastal development and catchment runoff [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B27" href="#B27">27</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B28" href="#B28">28</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most commonly reported thermal stress response in corals is coral bleaching, which is the dissociation between the 
  <span class="italic">Symbiodinium</span> and the coral host tissue [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B2" href="#B2">2</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B29" href="#B29">29</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B34" href="#B34">34</a>]. Variation in bleaching resistance within and among coral species can occur as a result of many factors associated with both the coral host and its 
  <span class="italic">Symbiodinium</span>. In the coral 
  <span class="italic">Acropora millepora,</span> thermal stress tolerance has been shown to be correlated with ambient water temperatures in three thermally distinct populations [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B35" href="#B35">35</a>]. While this is at least partly due to the 
  <span class="italic">Symbiodinium</span> type harboured [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B35" href="#B35">35</a>], patterns of genetic differentiation at coral host allozyme loci are correlated with latitudinal gradients of sea water temperature [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B36" href="#B36">36</a>], suggesting past adaptation of the host genome to local environments. Similarly, in the coral 
  <span class="italic">Pocillopora damicornis,</span> laboratory studies have shown a latitudinal difference in bleaching sensitivity that was not correlated to the type of 
  <span class="italic">Symbiodinium</span> harboured, indicative of localised adaptation of the coral host to varying thermal regimes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B37" href="#B37">37</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first studies of gene expression in corals emerged around the turn of the century [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B38" href="#B38">38</a>]. Since then, a large number of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) generated through the reverse transcription of gene transcripts (mRNA) expressed during stress, have been made publically available [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B39" href="#B39">39</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B44" href="#B44">44</a>]. An overlapping subset of stress response genes have been identified in multiple coral species, which allows the identification of key genes and proteins to target for studies of the coral stress response [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B45" href="#B45">45</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">Acropora millepora</span> has emerged as one of the model species for coral genetics and genomics. The species has been the target of multiple experiments on transcriptome effects of environmental stress [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B41" href="#B41">41</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B43" href="#B43">43</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B46" href="#B46">46</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B50" href="#B50">50</a>], thus providing comprehensive sequence information for a range of stress response genes. Also, an increasing amount of coral genome and transcriptome data is being made available in public databases [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B51" href="#B51">51</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B52" href="#B52">52</a>], including the recent release of the first complete coral genome sequences for 
  <span class="italic">Acropora digitifera</span>[
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B53" href="#B53">53</a>] and 
  <span class="italic">A. millepora</span> (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://coralbase.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://coralbase.org/</span>). However, the concept of identifying loci, which can be used as markers for relative stress tolerance, remains untested in corals.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This paper presents the first putative genetic markers for environmental stress tolerance in corals. The genetic markers were identified using two novel transcriptome-based strategies. Both strategies make use of next generation sequencing and large scale Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) genotyping across environmental gradients and build on the concept of identifying GEAs [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B16" href="#B16">16</a>]. These strategies increase the likelihood of finding GEAs compared to traditional methods through targeted, population level approaches of transcriptome sequencing and genotyping.
