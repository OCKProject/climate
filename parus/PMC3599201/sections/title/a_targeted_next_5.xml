 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recent research has shown that 
  <span class="italic">P. damicornis</span> comprises several mtDNA lineages [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B56" href="#B56">56</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B57" href="#B57">57</a>], and on the GBR two major distinct lineages (type α &amp; β) have been identified [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B58" href="#B58">58</a>]. Therefore, all samples were genotyped using genetic markers that have been developed to separate these two cryptic, sympatric lineages (Torda et al. un-published material). The results revealed that a majority of the colonies that were collected from Wallace Islet and Miall Island reefs were type α, while the Wilke and Pelorus Island reef samples comprised more colonies of type β. As a result, the collections were divided according to their specific lineage.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Messenger RNA was isolated using a modified protocol of the Invitrogen™ Dynabeads® Oligo(dT)
  <sub>25</sub>[
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B43" href="#B43">43</a>]. Two extractions were made from each colony, with a yield of approximately 20 ng/μL per extraction. RNA quality and quantity were verified using the mRNA Pico series kit on the Agilent© 2100 Bioanalyzer. To ensure good quality transcriptome sequences, only samples with low rRNA contamination (&lt;10%) and good quality mRNA were included in the study. As a result, five and six samples of 
  <span class="italic">P. damicornis</span> (type β) from Wilke and Pelorus Island reefs were used, respectively. These samples were pooled into two population specific samples. For 
  <span class="italic">P. damicornis</span> (type α), mRNA from three Wallace Islet and two Miall Island samples were pooled into a third sample and included in the 454 analysis. The final sequencing was done for three pooled mRNA samples using the 454® Genome Sequencer FLX Titanium Series reagents according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche Diagnostics Corporation) by the Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 947,623 resulting sequences and quality scores were analysed using PipeMeta, a menu based, desktop interface pipeline toolset for Windows [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B59" href="#B59">59</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B60" href="#B60">60</a>]. Sequences in Fasta format were screened for SMART primer (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clontech.com/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.clontech.com/</span>) using the SmartScreener script from within PipeMeta and then reads and quality scores were trimmed and quality filtered (min/max length: Avg. Length ± 2*SD; minimum avg. quality score: 20; maximum number of degenerate bases: 1). The remaining 653,814 reads and quality scores (73.6% of the original sequencing effort) were then tagged (i.e. α-numeric strings added to titles) by population to differentiate them after assembly. The sample containing the partial transcriptome of 
  <span class="italic">P. damicornis</span> (type α) was not included in the final assembly, which was done using the sequences from 
  <span class="italic">P. damicornis</span> (type β) only
  <span class="italic">.</span>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Assembly of the timed reads and quality scores (fasta files) was performed using commercially available assembly software (SeqMan NGen 2.1.0 build 13, DNAStar). To further assess the performance of the assembly, all resulting unigenes (Contigs and Singletons over 50 bp) were Blast aligned to a modified set of 
  <span class="italic">in silico</span> predicted proteins from the starlet sea anemone 
  <span class="italic">Nematostella vectensis</span>[
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B61" href="#B61">61</a>] and 
  <span class="italic">Acropora digitifera</span>[
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="B53" href="#B53">53</a>], the two closest related species to 
  <span class="italic">P. damicornis</span> (type β) with sequenced and publically available genomes. In order to better estimate transcriptome coverage of the sequencing effort, both sets of predicted genes were modified to remove shorter protein sequences with greater than 90% similarity to longer sequences in the set.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All 
  <span class="italic">P. damicornis</span> (type β) unigenes were Blast aligned to the Uniprot protein database (
