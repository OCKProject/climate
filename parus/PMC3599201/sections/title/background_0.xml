 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Knowledge of genetic markers that are correlated to stress tolerance may improve spatial mapping of reef vulnerability and can inform restoration efforts, including the choice of genotypes for breeding and reseeding. In this manuscript we present two methods for screening transcriptome data for candidate genetic markers in two reef building corals, 
  <span class="italic">Acropora millepora</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Pocillopora damicornis</span> (types α and β). In 
  <span class="italic">A. millepora,</span> Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) were pre-selected by targeting genes believed to be involved in the coral thermal stress responses. In 
  <span class="italic">P. damicornis</span> (type α and β), SNPs showing varying allele frequencies between two populations from distinct environments were pre-selected. Allele frequencies at nine, five and eight of the pre-selected SNP loci were correlated against gradients of water clarity and temperature in a large number of populations along the Great Barrier Reef.
