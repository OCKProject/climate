 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After preliminary machine quality filtering, 947,623 sequences were obtained. Additional primer screening and quality filtering through PipeMeta removed 27.4% of all sequenced nucleotides. The remaining 653,814 reads were used in the assembly. Roughly 67% of the trimmed, filtered reads (64% of the sequenced nucleotides) assembled to form 87,520 contigs with an average length of 584 (±296) base pairs (bp), with the 244,541 remaining singletons averaging 304 (±85) bp in length (Table

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To further assess the quality and coverage achieved by the assembly, the unigenes were BLAST aligned to two reference gene sets from closely related species with sequenced genomes (i.e. 
  <span class="italic">Nematostella vectensis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Acropora digitifera</span> modified 
  <span class="italic">in silico</span> predicted proteins). Out of these, 10,021 (23.4%) and 11,148 (52.4%) were unique hits to 
  <span class="italic">N. vectensis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">A. digitifera</span>, respectively. Using a conservative approach to estimate transcriptome coverage length, approximately 16.0% of 
  <span class="italic">N. vectensis</span> total amino acids and 25.3% of the 
  <span class="italic">A. digitifera</span> total amino acids were covered (i.e. had strong alignment) by 
  <span class="italic">P. damicornis</span> (type β) unigene sequence, with median coverage rates of 35.6% and 38.7% per predicted gene with a strong alignment for 
  <span class="italic">N. vectensis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">A. digitifera</span> proteins. Less than 6.8% (
  <span class="italic">N. vectensis</span>) or 10.2% (
  <span class="italic">A. digitifera</span>) of the above reference gene amino acid coverage was from more than one 
  <span class="italic">P. damicornis</span> (type β) unigene (i.e. duplicate or overlapping amino acid coverage by multiple unigenes).
