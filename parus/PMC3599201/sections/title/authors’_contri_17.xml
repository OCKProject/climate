 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The manuscript is the outcome of the postdoctoral research of PL, who conceptualised the idea and acquired funding in collaboration with MvO, collected field material, conducted a majority of the pre-transcription laboratory work, was involved in the bioinformatics and subsequent genotyping work and did the majority of the manuscript writing. In addition to the above conceptualisation and fund acquisition, MvO provided core funds and supervision. JCV did the majority of the bioinformatics on the transcriptomes, SM provided insights and support on the statistical analyses, wrote the scripts for the logistic regression analyses and interpreted the results and LP did a large part of the HRM analyses for the
