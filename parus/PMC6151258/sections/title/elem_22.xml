  <span class="sup">2</span>. The nature reserve covered 96.92% of the priority areas and 89.93% of important areas in all scenarios. The core zone of the nature reserve covered about 68.91% of the priority areas and 58.12% of the important areas in all scenarios, while the experimental zone covered about 27.06% of the priority areas and 23.15% of the important areas. Our results also highlight that one km around the outside of the nature reserveâ€™s perimeter seems to be important for maintaining biodiversity (priority area range from 1.97% to 3.97%, 3.08% on average; important area range from 7.62% to 13.82%, 10.07% on average) (
