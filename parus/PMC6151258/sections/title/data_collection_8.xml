 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our data were collected from September 2015 to June 2018 (with a research permission approved by Hebei Wulingshan National Nature Reserve) using infrared-triggered camera trapping, field surveys, interviews, and specimen records (historical records) in the protected area (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1" href="#supp-1">Appendix I</a> for details). Conflicting records (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 1,468) with unsubstantiated metadata, such as those lacking relevant or detailed descriptions, were excluded from the analysis, and effective records (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 2,142) were selected for modeling. We divided animals into three groups: resident (include mammals and resident birds), summer (summer residents), and winter (winter residents).
