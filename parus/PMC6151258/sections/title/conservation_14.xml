 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We investigated species distributions in four scenarios: all species, resident (mammals and resident birds), summer (mammals and summer birds), and winter (mammals and winter birds). We identified local biodiversity hotspots according to the degree of overlap of potential distributions. Then each layer was reclassified into three groups: “priority areas” (areas including the potential distributions of over 80% of species), “important areas” (those with 50% of species), and “normal areas” (all other areas). Then we identified conservation gaps on a local scale for each scenario. Spatial analyses were conducted in ArcGIS version 10.2 (ESRI Inc., Redlands, CA, USA) and SPSS for Windows version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).</p>
