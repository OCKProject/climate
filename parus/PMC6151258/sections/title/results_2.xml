 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We identified 101 species (14 orders, 38 families), 64 of which (2,142 effective records) were selected for environmental niche modeling. All results were reclassified into three groups: “priority areas” (areas including the potential distributions of over 80% of species), “important areas” (those with 50% of species), and “normal areas” (all other areas). Our results show that priority areas (1.31–1.82 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) and important areas (7.73–21.44 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) for conservation were mainly covered by the core and experimental zones of the reserve; additionally, a kilometer-wide margin around the outside of the nature reserve seems to be important to maintaining biodiversity.
