  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study area is located in Hebei Wulingshan Nature Reserve in Yanshan Mountains (117°17′E–117°35′E, 40°29′N–40°38′N, Hebei Province, China; 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" href="#fig-1">Fig. 1</a>). The reserve covers an area of 142.47 km
   <span class="sup">2</span>, of which the Core Zone is 37.95 km
   <span class="sup">2</span>, the Buffer Zone is 24.04 km
   <span class="sup">2</span>, and the Experimental Zone is 80.48 km
   <span class="sup">2</span>. Elevation ranges varies from approximately 375 to 2,118 m. The average annual temperature is 7.6 °C (3.8–11.4 °C), with the lowest temperatures reaching −15.6 °C in January and the highest temperatures reaching 17.6 °C in July. The average annual rainfall is about 763 mm (436–1,101 mm). The habitat changes along with the elevation: temperate broadleaf and subalpine coniferous forests are mainly present at low and mid-elevation; and subalpine scrub meadows at high elevation.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our data were collected from September 2015 to June 2018 (with a research permission approved by Hebei Wulingshan National Nature Reserve) using infrared-triggered camera trapping, field surveys, interviews, and specimen records (historical records) in the protected area (see 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1" href="#supp-1">Appendix I</a> for details). Conflicting records (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 1,468) with unsubstantiated metadata, such as those lacking relevant or detailed descriptions, were excluded from the analysis, and effective records (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 2,142) were selected for modeling. We divided animals into three groups: resident (include mammals and resident birds), summer (summer residents), and winter (winter residents).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Camera records (mainly focus on mammals)</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to previous research, Hebei Wulingshan Nature Reserve was divided into one km
   <span class="sup">2</span> blocks by ArcMap 10.2 (totally 142 blocks; cell size 1 × 1 km). Some blocks were excluded because of topography limitation for research. Only blocks in Core Zone and Buffer Zone were selected for research. Each block had one camera unit for at least 4 months. Finally, 56 sites were obtained (Fig. S1 in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1" href="#supp-1">Appendix I</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Camera units (SG-990V, 30; Digicool SG-680V, 20; Digicool SG-009, 20; Digicool, Beijing, China) were attached to trees 80–120 cm above the ground, and three to five m from a trail or point where animal movement might be expected. Moreover, the distance between each camera was far more than 400 m (mean: 558 m, range from 354 to 766 m). For each site, GPS location, elevation, slope, aspect, and habitat (e.g., vegetation cover, forest type, and human influence) were recorded. Three photos (1,200 PX) and a 15 s film (1,080 P) were taken for every trigger. Camera units were also set with a 2 min delay between each photograph and set for 24 h monitoring. At the end of each monitoring session, the units were tested to confirm that they were still operational and had unexposed frames; otherwise, the date on the last photograph was taken as the last operational date.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A monitoring network of infrared cameras has been created for Hebei Wulingshan Nature Reserve from September 2015 to December 2015; and from March 2016 to June 2018. A sampling effort of 22,379 camera-days across 56 sample sites was achieved (Fig. S1 in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1" href="#supp-1">Appendix I</a>). A total of 1,736 records for 15 species were obtained. We defined detection at a sample point as one individual photographed during a 30 min period. If more than one individual were identified on a single photograph, we considered this one detection. All detections were summed for each camera site (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bird survey was launched at four periods (April 2016; July 2016; October 2016; January 2017) due to time and access constraints. A total of 14 transects were designed for bird surveys covering important habitats (e.g., forestry, mesophorbium, farmland) and elevation range in Hebei Wulingshan Nature Reserve (Table S2; Fig. S2 in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1" href="#supp-1">Appendix I</a>). Length of transects ranged from 2.5 to 12.7 km.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interview</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Knowledge from local people has been proved to be an effective tool for animal survey. An interview was carried out between November 2016 and January 2017, covering our study area (Fig. S3 in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1" href="#supp-1">Appendix I</a>). We conducted semi-structured interviews without precise, pre-determined questions so that interesting lines of discussion could be pursued. Open questioning was employed wherever possible, to avoid leading the interviewee into only one answer. All the questions addressed on the distribution, historical range, and last records for animals in Hebei Wulingshan Nature Reserve. We used the photographies for identification. Each dialog was recorded by one of the interviewers and uncertainties were clarified immediately after the interview. Only records with detail location information (including the name of a specific place in Hebei Wulingshan Nature Reserve) were selected. Then, these records were crosschecked with records from camera sites and bird surveys. Some records were excluded if they were not recorded by our field investigation. Finally, 288 local people from 11 villages in our study area were interviewed. In order to reduce bias, interview records which were confirmed by the camera trap or bird survey were selected. A total of 112 records (including mammals and birds) were selected for research.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, we also collected specimen records from Hebei Wulingshan Nature Reserve (These museum specimens’ data was provided by Hebei Wulingshan Nature Reserve). A total of 33 records (13 mammals and 20 birds) were selected for research.</p>

   <a rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-35">Ponder et al., 2001</a>). Therefore, we obtained information about roads close to the Nature Reserve. Then we created 2,000 random points within a buffer area of two km wide around the considered road (only main roads that have existed for more than 30 years were selected).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Collinearity problems can lead to bias. Given the problems in predicting, it is necessary to assess collinearity both in training and in prediction data sets. Following the suggestions described in 
   <a rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-11">Dormann et al. (2013)</a>, we used a Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis in this research. This analysis was calculated in R and the threshold was set as 10 (only VIF values lower than 10 were selected). For each species, different variables were selected for modeling (

   <a rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-34">Phillips, Anderson &amp; Schapire, 2006</a>). All techniques were applied to presence data for each species and to the pseudo-absences for the models developed in BIOMOD2 (use default option). Model parameters (GLM, MARS, and RF) were tuned by BIOMOD2, except MAXENT, Phillips which was tuned by ENMeval package (

   <a rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-36">Radosavljevic, Anderson &amp; Araújo, 2014</a>). For each species, each ENM was evaluated measuring the true skill statistic (TSS) (
   <a rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-2">Allouche, Tsoar &amp; Kadmon, 2006</a>), with 10 evaluation runs. For the TSS, 50 modeling evaluation results were obtained, and the average of the TSS was set as the threshold for building the ensemble models. Then, the potential distribution was calculated from an ensemble set of models or predictions. To transform the models from environmental suitability into presence–absence distributions, we used the threshold (
   <span class="italic">P</span>, cut-off) calculated by BIOMOD2. From this, all outputs were divided into two groups; outputs above the threshold (&gt;
   <span class="italic">P</span>) were grouped as “present,” while all other values (&lt;

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We investigated species distributions in four scenarios: all species, resident (mammals and resident birds), summer (mammals and summer birds), and winter (mammals and winter birds). We identified local biodiversity hotspots according to the degree of overlap of potential distributions. Then each layer was reclassified into three groups: “priority areas” (areas including the potential distributions of over 80% of species), “important areas” (those with 50% of species), and “normal areas” (all other areas). Then we identified conservation gaps on a local scale for each scenario.
