 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Protected areas, particularly nature reserves, are a basic unit for maintaining the world’s biodiversity. Numerous studies have focused on biodiversity conservation on a regional or even global scale, while relatively few have investigated this issue on a local scale (

  <a rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-39">Scherrer et al., 2017</a>). In fact, research on biodiversity issues on a local scale may provide more useful information to the managers of nature reserves, like seasonal management. There is thus a gap between the biodiversity research currently being undertaken and the needs of those who apply the results of this research to the management of protected areas, especially in Southeast Asia and China.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Identifying conservation gap on a local scale can be helpful to management, which need research efforts. Biodiversity research on a local scale is generally hampered by insufficient data (e.g., a lack of effective records, camera sites, high-resolution environmental variables, and/or funding). In response to these problem and resources limitations for conservation, research efforts need to focus on with data shortage. Wildlife monitoring data from infrared-triggered camera trapping, field surveys, and interviews have been successfully applied in numerous conservation studies (

Combining data from multiple sources into a single dataset can ameliorate the data shortage that often limits local studies. In addition, primary data on a local scale is often incomplete and spatially biased, a problem that can be mitigated through the use of ecological niche modeling (

  <a rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-48">Zhang et al., 2016</a>). Such modeling has proven to be an effective tool for reducing the data limitations of traditional methods for measuring biodiversity (

  <a rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-43">Thuiller et al., 2009</a>). Combining multiple data sources on a local scale with ecological niche modeling offers a potential solution to such limitations.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies show that invertebrates in general are appropriate indicators of ecosystem integrity, because they are more strongly associated with environmental factors than biological factors, like predation and parasitism (
  <a rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-7">Carignan &amp; Villard, 2002</a>). Ecosystem integrity is one of the most important goals for environmental management on protected areas. However, conservation biology requires more specific information than a list of species to meet the increasing need in ecological management (e.g., seasonal management). To achieve this goal, we focused on mammal’s and bird’s biodiversity, and tried to obtain effective information for a protected area in a local scale. Therefore, we (1) collected and combined data from multiple sources and created species occurrence datasets; (2) constructed climate data to represent environmental variables at high-resolution; (3) estimated potential species distributions by ecological niche modeling (ENM, by BIOMOD2) and identified possible hotspots to support environmental management for a protected area on a local scale.
