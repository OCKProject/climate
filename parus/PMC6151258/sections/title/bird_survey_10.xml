 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bird survey was launched at four periods (April 2016; July 2016; October 2016; January 2017) due to time and access constraints. A total of 14 transects were designed for bird surveys covering important habitats (e.g., forestry, mesophorbium, farmland) and elevation range in Hebei Wulingshan Nature Reserve (Table S2; Fig. S2 in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1" href="#supp-1">Appendix I</a>). Length of transects ranged from 2.5 to 12.7 km.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Four man a day surveyed each transect starting survey at 8 am and finishing end at 18 pm. Data on bird species present were collected by direct observation and records of calling birds. Bird names and species-level taxonomy generally followed several books (

For each species, we considered one only effective record if the distance between two records was less than 30 m.
