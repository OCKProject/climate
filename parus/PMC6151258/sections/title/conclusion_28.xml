 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Research on a local scale may become an important part of conservation science in the near future, allowing conservation actions to focus on specific areas or time periods. Data gathered from such research will become a functional guide to conservation practitioners or management rather than mere theoretical support. An additional area for further research suggested by this study is the investigation of the relationship between nature reserves and the areas immediately surrounding them.</p>
