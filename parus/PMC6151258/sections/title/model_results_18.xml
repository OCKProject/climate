 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We created 64 pseudo-absence datasets for individual species. The number of records per species ranged from 10 (
  <span class="italic">Cuculus saturatus</span>) to 113 (
  <span class="italic">Parus songarus</span>), with an average of 33.5. On average, most internal evaluations provided fair or good results, with most TSS values being &gt;0.40 (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2" href="#supp-2">Appendix II</a> for details). The threshold ranged from 0.57 to 0.84. All fair and good results were selected for building the ensemble models. Finally, TSS for each species ranged from 0.68 to 0.94, providing good results.
