 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results generated by combining data from multiple sources with species distribution modeling to estimate hotspots on a local scale are still restricted by practical and conceptual barriers, particularly by the shortage of useable data. Our results provide evidence that combining multiple data sources can offer an opportunity to identify hotspots (conservation gap) on a local scale and to fill the gap between the results of research and the needs of practitioners.</p>
 <sec class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Limitations</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are several limitations in this study that should be clarified: (1) the relationship between frequency of occurrence (photograph rate at a given site) and animal density remains unclear (
   <a rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-6">Carbone et al., 2001</a>; 
   <a rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-24">Li et al., 2010</a>, 
   <a rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-25">2014</a>; 
   <a rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-26">Liu et al., 2013</a>); (2) the effectiveness of different survey methods can vary depending on species, particularly for small mammals and birds; (3) variation in microclimate on different time frames may cause spatial changes in potential distribution (e.g., we only created variables for annual or seasonal population changes) (
   <a rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-5">Broennimann et al., 2012</a>; 
   <a rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-40">Sedgeley, 2001</a>); (4) obtaining high-resolution environmental variables may create potential bias (
   <a rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-45">Wang et al., 2012</a>); (5) modeling limitations (e.g., part of a species’ fundamental niche may not correspond to any combination of environmental variables; species interactions may cause bias) (
   <a rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-10">Cruz-Cárdenas et al., 2014</a>; 
   <a rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-12">Elith &amp; Leathwick, 2009</a>; 
   <a rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-15">Guo et al., 2015</a>; 
   <a rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-29">Maiorano et al., 2013</a>); (6) human influence may be important but is difficult to quantify on a local scale.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, occurrence records from different resource already contain potential information on human influences and habitat information, which could reduce bias caused by variables representative of the model. In addition, conservation action mainly addresses on species richness which can also reduce risk from modeling performance and potential bias for single species.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results show that mammals in Hebei Wulingshan Nature Reserve tend to live at middle to higher elevation (about 1,200–1,600 m), while birds cover a larger range of elevation. Species richness also presents a pessimism situation: higher elevation area tends to be more important while ecotourism presented in higher elevation will increase human influence. This difference may be associated with varying habitat needs and sensitivity to human influence: (1) human influence from villages may force animal to move into higher elevations and lead to lower records and richness in lower elevation. (2) Ecotourism in high elevation from June to October every year may affect the potential distribution in study area in two ways. One way may be negative effects that reduce the species occurrence, especially for mammals or some sensitive birds. Another way may be the optimistic influence that humans may change habitat patches, reduce predator (most mammals present in mid-elevation) or provide food (
   <a rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-16">Hammitt, Cole &amp; Monz, 2015</a>). In fact, we tend to suggest that ecotourism provides a negative effect. Closing ecotourism in winter can reduce human influence significantly in higher elevation. Also, the animal potential distribution may be hampered by climate factors like low temperature, less food, and deep snow in winter in higher elevation. However, the mean elevation of occurrence points was higher in winter than in summer, which may imply that animals tend to go to the area with lower human influence and more food supply. Compared with priority and important conservation area, potential distribution in winter was larger than in summer.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Biodiversity hotspots are mainly located within the nature reserve, particularly in the core zone, which is under strict management. Species richness increasing along with elevation also needs more attention. However, high elevation area and biodiversity hotspots around the perimeter of the nature reserve need more attention.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have therefore identified 12 areas that should be a priority for future management (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-6" href="#fig-6">Fig. 6</a>) and suggest some immediate actions: 
   <div list-type="alpha-upper" class="list">
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>
      <span class="bold">Monitoring:</span> (1) Area 1: Establish a monitoring network with camera traps, because of the proximity of this area to a forestry farm; (2) Areas 9–12: Patrol and monitor network (including camera sites in this research) can be considerable contribute to management, because management for human influence, or any conservation action would need support from this monitor system. (3) Areas 2, 4, and 6: Co-operate with local people (two villages near these area) to monitor species richness changes in these areas (
      <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-6" href="#fig-6">Fig. 6</a>).
     </p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>
      <span class="bold">Law enforcement:</span> Areas 7–12 should be priority area in summer, because effective enforcement will reduce ecotourism negative impact.
     </p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>
      <span class="bold">Popular science:</span> (1) Areas 2–4, 6, 7: Popular science should address the relationship between agriculture and conservation and focus on local people. (2) Other areas: Establish natural education system, mainly focused on conservation.
     </p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>
      <span class="bold">Co-operate with local people:</span> Promote ecological tourism and conservation-related enterprises that increase income for local people. This can change the life-style of local people and reduce disturbance of animal habitat around mountain areas. In addition, community co-management can be important to enhance conservation.

    <p>Six areas for conservation action addressed in the nature reserve, with another six areas around the nature reserve. Detailed suggestions for conservation action can be found in

  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, managers should share these monitor data with scientists. Then, they should try to answer some questions, like (a) why richness is increasing in winter, and what is the impact in Areas 1 and 2; (b) Areas 4 and 6 were important area for all species. Do these areas (4 and 6) need seasonal enforcement or specific conservation actions? In addition, management should encourage research which addresses the relationship between humans and animals in this national nature reserve, especially in high elevation areas.</p>
