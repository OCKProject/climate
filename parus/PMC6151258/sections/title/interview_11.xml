 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Knowledge from local people has been proved to be an effective tool for animal survey. An interview was carried out between November 2016 and January 2017, covering our study area (Fig. S3 in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1" href="#supp-1">Appendix I</a>). We conducted semi-structured interviews without precise, pre-determined questions so that interesting lines of discussion could be pursued. Open questioning was employed wherever possible, to avoid leading the interviewee into only one answer. All the questions addressed on the distribution, historical range, and last records for animals in Hebei Wulingshan Nature Reserve. We used the photographies for identification. Each dialog was recorded by one of the interviewers and uncertainties were clarified immediately after the interview. Only records with detail location information (including the name of a specific place in Hebei Wulingshan Nature Reserve) were selected. Then, these records were crosschecked with records from camera sites and bird surveys. Some records were excluded if they were not recorded by our field investigation. Finally, 288 local people from 11 villages in our study area were interviewed. In order to reduce bias, interview records which were confirmed by the camera trap or bird survey were selected. A total of 112 records (including mammals and birds) were selected for research.
