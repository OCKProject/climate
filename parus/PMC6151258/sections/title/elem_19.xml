 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The potential distributions of individual species ranged from 7.64 to 63.42 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> (24.79 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> on average). The mean distribution of year-round residents, including both mammals and birds, was 26.80 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>; that of summer species was 20.71 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>, and that of winter species was 24.34 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>. The average distribution of all mammals was 45.40 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>, while that of birds was 20.04 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" href="#fig-3">Fig. 3</a>). The 
  <span class="italic">Garrulax davidi</span> had the largest potential distribution, while the 
  <span class="italic">Streptopelia chinensis</span> had the smallest. Elevation at which each species (including mammals and birds) was found ranged from 812 to 1,608 m. The 
  <span class="italic">Prunella collaris</span> was found at the highest elevation, while the 
  <span class="italic">Streptopelia chinensis</span> was found at the lowest. Mammals were found at elevations between 1,224.35 and 1,471.94 m (1,382.92 m on average), while the ranges of birds were 812–1,515.6 m (1,144.8 m), 913.2–1,608 m (1,213.16 m), and 1,278.34–1,425.51 m (1,371.59 m), for resident, summer, and winter species, respectively (see Table S1 in

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The species richness of each group increases with increasing elevation (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4" href="#fig-4">Fig. 4</a>). The relationship between the area of different elevation categories and the richness of species is weak (Pearson test, values range from −0.38 to −0.40). This trend means that environmental management should focus on the area in higher elevation.
