 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We identified 101 species from 14 orders and 38 families in Hebei Wulingshan Nature Reserve, including 13 mammals (from nine families in five orders) and 88 birds (resident: four orders, 12 families, 27 species; summer: four orders, nine families, 19 species; winter: two orders, four families, five species; other (stragglers and travelers): four orders, 13 families, 37 species). Of these species, two were listed as vulnerable (VU) in the IUCN red list, and three in CITES (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2" href="#supp-2">Appendix II</a>); eight were listed in Chinaâ€™s biodiversity red list (two VU; six NT). To reduce bias, we excluded stragglers and travelers from our analysis (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2" href="#supp-2">Appendix II</a> for details). Finally, 64 species were selected for modeling.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results show that elevation ranges of occurrence points for each species were similar to the elevation range of the study area, especially from 800 to 1,500 m. Our research (including camera records and interviews in villages) covered almost the entire elevation range of the study area. Human influence, including villages and ecotourism, mainly ranged from 700 to 850 m, and from 1,500 to 2,100 m, respectively. Occurrence points mainly covered a mid-elevation range, perhaps avoiding human influence (
