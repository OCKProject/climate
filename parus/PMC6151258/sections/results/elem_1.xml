  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We identified 101 species from 14 orders and 38 families in Hebei Wulingshan Nature Reserve, including 13 mammals (from nine families in five orders) and 88 birds (resident: four orders, 12 families, 27 species; summer: four orders, nine families, 19 species; winter: two orders, four families, five species; other (stragglers and travelers): four orders, 13 families, 37 species). Of these species, two were listed as vulnerable (VU) in the IUCN red list, and three in CITES (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2" href="#supp-2">Appendix II</a>); eight were listed in China’s biodiversity red list (two VU; six NT). To reduce bias, we excluded stragglers and travelers from our analysis (see 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2" href="#supp-2">Appendix II</a> for details). Finally, 64 species were selected for modeling.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results show that elevation ranges of occurrence points for each species were similar to the elevation range of the study area, especially from 800 to 1,500 m. Our research (including camera records and interviews in villages) covered almost the entire elevation range of the study area. Human influence, including villages and ecotourism, mainly ranged from 700 to 850 m, and from 1,500 to 2,100 m, respectively. Occurrence points mainly covered a mid-elevation range, perhaps avoiding human influence (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Model results</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We created 64 pseudo-absence datasets for individual species. The number of records per species ranged from 10 (
   <span class="italic">Cuculus saturatus</span>) to 113 (
   <span class="italic">Parus songarus</span>), with an average of 33.5. On average, most internal evaluations provided fair or good results, with most TSS values being &gt;0.40 (see 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2" href="#supp-2">Appendix II</a> for details). The threshold ranged from 0.57 to 0.84. All fair and good results were selected for building the ensemble models. Finally, TSS for each species ranged from 0.68 to 0.94, providing good results.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The potential distributions of individual species ranged from 7.64 to 63.42 km
   <span class="sup">2</span> (24.79 km
   <span class="sup">2</span> on average). The mean distribution of year-round residents, including both mammals and birds, was 26.80 km

   <span class="italic">Garrulax davidi</span> had the largest potential distribution, while the 
   <span class="italic">Streptopelia chinensis</span> had the smallest. Elevation at which each species (including mammals and birds) was found ranged from 812 to 1,608 m. The 
   <span class="italic">Prunella collaris</span> was found at the highest elevation, while the 
   <span class="italic">Streptopelia chinensis</span> was found at the lowest. Mammals were found at elevations between 1,224.35 and 1,471.94 m (1,382.92 m on average), while the ranges of birds were 812–1,515.6 m (1,144.8 m), 913.2–1,608 m (1,213.16 m), and 1,278.34–1,425.51 m (1,371.59 m), for resident, summer, and winter species, respectively (see Table S1 in

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The species richness of each group increases with increasing elevation (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4" href="#fig-4">Fig. 4</a>). The relationship between the area of different elevation categories and the richness of species is weak (Pearson test, values range from −0.38 to −0.40). This trend means that environmental management should focus on the area in higher elevation.

Our results also highlight that one km around the outside of the nature reserve’s perimeter seems to be important for maintaining biodiversity (priority area range from 1.97% to 3.97%, 3.08% on average; important area range from 7.62% to 13.82%, 10.07% on average) (
