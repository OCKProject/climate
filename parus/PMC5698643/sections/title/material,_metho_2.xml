 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The abundance and sex/age composition of capercaillie and black grouse were sampled each August by teams using trained pointing dogs; a method commonly used for censusing tetraonids [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C15" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C15">15</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C17" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C17">17</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C23" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C23">23</a>]. The study area was subdivided into 42 sampling blocks, within which observers with dogs searched for birds. Rarely was the whole block sampled thoroughly enough for converting the number of birds encountered to a density estimate. Instead, the number of different bird categories was expressed as numbers/10 h of sampling time. A random selection of blocks was sampled each year, covering at least 60% of the study area. During sampling, each man/dog team was equipped with a map of the block, and a form on which to record encountered birds and time of observation. On the map, the corresponding locations and flight directions were recorded; this was done in order to minimize double counts of birds within the same block or of birds flying into neighbouring blocks sampled the same day. Altogether, between 112 and 186 birds were recorded and classified each year, totalling nearly 6 000 observations over the 38-year period.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Capercaillie and black grouse are both polygynous, lekking species, with females visiting the leks during 5–10 days in late April and early May [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C13">13</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C24" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C24">24</a>]. In capercaillie, most females mate over the course of 3–4 days, whereas for black grouse leks, mating takes place over a longer period, peaking 4–7 days later than in capercaillie in our study area (unpublished material). Each year, we sampled 4–6 capercaillie leks and recorded the dates of female attendance and mating, from which we could estimate the peak of mating. From the known time of mating and hatching of 23 radio-collared females, we could then estimate the average number of days from mating until hatching in this species. Black grouse leks were not systematically monitored; although male counts were made on 3–4 leks each year, female attendance and mating were recorded only intermittently. For this species, the annual date of hatching was estimated from the monitoring of 12 radio-collared females and from observed differences in hatching dates in the two species in the same year [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C13">13</a>]. Based on these data, we have used 5 days later date of mating and 6 days later date of hatching in black grouse compared to capercaillie throughout the study period.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Breeding success is the outcome of mainly two life-history traits, the loss of eggs plus the loss of chicks. In addition, a variable but small number of females do not attempt breeding or desert their nests, and some eggs do not hatch; in capercaillie the proportion of non-breeders is thought to be higher than in black grouse, presumably because some yearling females do not breed. In August, brood frequency (i.e. the proportion of females with at least one chick) therefore largely reflects the rate of egg loss, whereas brood size (i.e. the number of chicks per brood) indicates closely the rate of chick loss after hatching. Hence, their relative proportions of the breeding success before and after hatching point to the causal factors in these two periods of the breeding season. We therefore examined these two components separately in the analyses.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Fennoscandia, predation on eggs and chicks varies with cyclic small rodents—the so-called alternative prey hypothesis [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C25" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C25">25</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C26" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C26">26</a>]. In years with high abundance of small rodents, predators—mainly red fox and pine marten—prey and subsist mainly on this food source, whereas in crash years they switch to other food, of which grouse eggs and chicks make up a large proportion. This temporal variation in predation pressure has been shown to be an important determinant of breeding success in forest grouse [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C27" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C27">27</a>–
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C29">29</a>]. Hence, we included information on changes in abundances of small rodents and red fox in the analyses. Rodents were sampled each year in the study area [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C17" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C17">17</a>], and indices of fox abundance were taken from regional harvest data, adjusted to our study area based on snow-tracking indices in winters with snow cover.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Weather variables included daily minimum, average and maximum temperatures, precipitation, and the amount of snow cover. Data were obtained from Kongsvinger meteorological station, located 25 km from the study area. With our study area situated at a slightly higher elevation, local differences were adjusted for by applying a lapse rate of 0.65-degree change per 100 m difference in elevation. We used two variables to indicate the phenological onset of spring: the date of snow-free ground and the date of frost-free nights. The first was defined as the earliest date that the meteorological station reported less than 20% snow cover (score 0 on a scale from 0–5). The latter was calculated as the date when the 7-day moving average of the daily minimum temperature crossed 0°C. To indicate the temporal onset of summer, we looked at the cumulative temperature sum. Growing degree days (GDD) is defined as the number of temperature degree days above a certain threshold base temperature. Here we used a base temperature of 5°C and defined the onset of summer as the date when GDD reached 200 degree days, which in our study area closely matched the date when the growth of the new shoots and leaves of bilberry is completed (P Wegge 2017, unpublished data).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From the daily spring and summer temperature series, we derived monthly means (April, May, and June) and means for 13 successive time periods throughout the breeding season. Long-term trends were compared using generalized least-squares (GLS) regressions with and without AR(1) and AR(2) correlation structure. Overall, autocorrelation was low and statistically non-significant with Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values similar or lower for models without autoregressive corrections. Throughout the results, we therefore report ordinary least square regression coefficients (
  <span class="italic">β</span>) with corresponding standard errors or correlation coefficients (
  <span class="italic">r</span>). When testing for relationships between breeding success and weather variables on an annual basis, autocorrelation was checked for using an exponential spatial correlation structure (corExp; nlme package of R; [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C30" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C30">30</a>]). As no significant autocorrelation was detected, we also here report statistics of ordinary least square regressions. We used multiple regression to separate the contributions of temperature and other influential variables (e.g. rodents, fox, precipitation etc.). Right-skewed variables (red fox and rodents) were transformed using log- or square-root values.
