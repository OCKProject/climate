 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A warmer climate is predicted to have pronounced impacts on local fauna and flora [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C1" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C1">1</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C2" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C2">2</a>], especially in northern latitudes [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C3" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C3">3</a>]. The breeding performance of many birds is likely to be adversely affected [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C4" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C4">4</a>–
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C7" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C7">7</a>]. More than a decade ago, Visser 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C8" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C8">8</a>] predicted that warmer springs should lead to earlier mating and a temporal mismatch with the optimal hatching time for the offspring. In a later study of the breeding phenology of an insectivorous passerine, the great tit (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>), they showed that the optimal synchrony between hatching time and irruption of caterpillar food supply was distorted in years with earlier and warmer springs [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C9" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C9">9</a>]. Later studies have largely confirmed this ‘mismatch’ hypothesis both for non-migratory [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C10" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C10">10</a>] and migratory birds [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C11" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C11">11</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Until recently, studies of the effects of climate change on non-migratory birds have mainly dealt with passerines. In the temperate zone, only four studies have reported on the larger tetraonids. In Finland, Ludwig 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C12" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C12">12</a>] modelled the temperature and timing of mating (and subsequent hatching) of black grouse, 
  <span class="italic">Tetrao tetrix,</span> from time-series data and showed that earlier mating in later years correlated with increasing temperatures during April and May. As temperature during hatching in June decreased slightly, they inferred that earlier hatching would increase the mortality of chicks because they would then be born in colder weather and with less food for the hatchlings. They concluded that the asymmetrical rise in temperature and mismatch in breeding phenology probably explained the ongoing decline in black grouse in the country. However, a later study of capercaillie, 
  <span class="italic">Tetrao urogallus,</span> in Norway reported that during a year of early breeding, more fledged chicks were produced although the staple chick food source (insect larvae) did not advance [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C13">13</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A different scenario of climate change leading to reduced breeding success (i.e. number of chicks reared per female) in forest grouse was launched by Selås 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C14" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C14">14</a>] from Norway: following peak seed years of bilberry, 
  <span class="italic">Vaccinium myrtillus</span>—a main food plant and host of caterpillar food for the chicks—breeding success should be enhanced due to reduced feeding deterrents in the plants. However, in years with particularly high summer temperatures, bilberry will be less exhausted and rebuild their chemical defence quickly, therefore leading to poorer breeding the following year. They examined weather records and time-series data on abundances of capercaillie and black grouse and reported an inverse relationship with high summer temperatures during 1 or 2 years before peak bilberry seed production. From this, they predicted that warmer summers would limit grouse reproduction.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A third study from Scotland [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C15" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C15">15</a>] reported that breeding success in capercaillie declined during 1975–1999 and found evidence that this might be related to a gradual delay in April warming due to a short cooling period in the middle of that month. They speculated that the sudden burst of nutritious new plant growth that had previously accompanied an abrupt increase in spring temperature became slower and more erratic. Slower-growing plant food is less nutritious and so the hens' diet became less nutritious, and their eggs and chicks less viable. Lastly, breeding performance of black grouse with climate change has been investigated by Barnagaud 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C16" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C16">16</a>] in the French Alps. During 1990–2007, no relationship was detected between breeding success and the winter and summer North Atlantic Oscillations.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a summary article from a long-term study of the population ecology of capercaillie and black grouse in our study area (Varaldskogen, southeast Norway), we reported that the breeding success of both capercaillie and black grouse increased gradually during a 30-year period from 1979 to 2009 [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C17" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C17">17</a>]. In view of the current focus on the possible negative effects of warmer springs, we here examine the relationship between spring and early summer temperatures and breeding success from this population study in more detail. The results related to the timing of breeding and chick food cited above [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C13">13</a>] were derived from the same study but based on data in only two contrasting years. Expanding the time series to 38 years, we now confirm that breeding success was higher—not lower—in warmer springs.
