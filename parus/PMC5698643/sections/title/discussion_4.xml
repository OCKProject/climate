 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the 38-year period, spring temperatures increased and so did the breeding success of both species. Closer analyses of annual variations showed a significant positive relationship between breeding success and temperatures during the whole breeding season (one month pre-laying to eight weeks post-hatching). No long-term trend was detected in the precipitation pattern in the breeding season, and no relationship was detected between breeding success and precipitation after hatching during a 30-year period [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C17" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C17">17</a>]. In both species, the peak of mating (in late April) advanced 4–5 days during the study period. April was also the period when the temperature rise was most pronounced. Hence, to some extent, the temporal mating skew supports the general notion that mating in birds is triggered by rising temperatures [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C31" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C31">31</a>] and advanced plant phenology [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C32">32</a>]. However, because the onset of spring has advanced almost three weeks, the rather short forward skew of mating time reflects that breeding in northern latitudes is more closely controlled by the photoperiod [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C33" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C33">33</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C34" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C34">34</a>]. As opposed to the pronounced rise in early spring temperatures, the temperature at hatching time in early June changed little. Hence, the small forward skew at hatching means that the chicks were exposed to about the same temperature as if the time of mating had remained constant.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From analysing the two demographic components that determine chick production separately, our results indicate that an increase in brood frequency may have contributed relatively more to the increasing breeding success than an increase in the size of broods in capercaillie. Brood frequency was the only trait that differed significantly between the two species, as it was strongly influenced by warmer springs during pre-hatching periods in capercaillie but not in black grouse. This again suggests that reduced egg loss—possibly combined with more yearlings breeding—rather than higher survival of hatched chicks has been most influential. We do not have information on nest predation in recent years, but during the first part of the study period, nest predation of capercaillie was quite high, averaging more than 50% annually during the 1980s [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C35" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C35">35</a>]. During that time, the main nest predators (red fox and pine marten) were quite abundant [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C17" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C17">17</a>]. The earlier ‘green-up’ due to the advancement of spring may have increased the availability of various food sources like small mammals, amphibians, and remains from winter kills for generalist predators, thereby lessening the pressure on grouse eggs. Simultaneously, the longer pre-hatching period with emerging new plant growth provided more cover and nutritive foods for females prior to mating and during incubation. For instance, the bog cottongrass, 
  <span class="italic">Eriophorum vaginatum</span>—an important ground food in April—sprouted 10–14 days earlier in later years compared to the early 1980s (unpublished material). Presumably, the earlier access to nutritious ground foods improved the physical condition of females, shortening their need for recesses and exposure to nest predators.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The difference between the two species is difficult to explain. Black grouse females are about half the size of capercaillie females. They nest a few days later, nests are better camouflaged, females sit tighter on the eggs during incubation, and nest loss is lower than in capercaillie [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C35" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C35">35</a>]. Thus, incubating black grouse may be less sensitive than capercaillie to changes in predation pressure. In addition, the tendency of higher survival of chicks in recent years might be related to better adult nutrition prior to hatching due to advanced plant phenology [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C15" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C15">15</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The predicted negative effect on breeding performance caused by asymmetrical temperature rise during the pre- and post-hatching periods [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C12" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C12">12</a>] was not supported by our results. Although there was a skew towards earlier mating in warmer springs in our study (in magnitude similar to the results reported in the Finnish study), this skew was small compared to the much earlier snow-free ground and associated effects on plant phenology. In a previous study, Wegge 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C13">13</a>] reported that an earlier spring had little impact on the timing of peak caterpillar abundance in early summer. As the peak of geometrid and sawfly larvae stretched over more than 10 days [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C13">13</a>], this ‘mismatch’ due to earlier hatching must have been negligible and not created any food shortage. Instead, the discrepancy between the results in our study and that reported from Finland is most probably due to different trends in the early summer temperatures: in the Finnish study—spanning an earlier time period than ours—post-hatching temperature decreased, leading to chicks hatching in slightly colder weather than ‘normal’, whereas in our study, summer temperatures changed very little.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Neither do our results support the prediction that forest grouse reproduction should decline after warm summers due to lower food quality mediated through changes in the chemical deterrents in the bilberry food plant [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C14" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C14">14</a>]. Our analyses showed no relationship between summer temperatures 1 or 2 years earlier in either of the two species, as was the basis for this prediction. If the nutritive quality of chick food indeed is reduced by preceding high summer temperatures, then such an effect must have been minimal and certainly has not overridden other determinants of breeding success. In our study, not only the breeding success of grouse but also the abundance of small rodents correlated positively with summer temperature the same year. Presumably, the predation rate on eggs and chicks was then relaxed, leading to better breeding success. Hence, a negative relationship between preceding summer temperatures and breeding success, as inferred by Selås 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C14" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C14">14</a>], might instead have been caused by changing predation rates related to the vole cycle.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Scottish study [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C15" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C15">15</a>], declining capercaillie breeding success during 1975–1999 correlated with a lower rise in temperature during the month of April due to a cooling period in the middle of the month. Poorer nutrition before incubation was offered as a plausible explanation. Contrasting the situation in Scotland—possibly due to different time periods—April temperatures rose markedly in our study, correlating with better breeding. However, in both studies, the effects on the physical condition of females prior to mating and incubation might have been a causal factor for the contrasting results. The study of black grouse in the French Alps [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C16" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C16">16</a>] found no long-term effects on breeding success from changing winter and summer climate measured by the North Atlantic Oscillations; only short-term effects of extreme weather were detected. Possible impacts of changing spring weather were not assessed, but no declining trend in productivity was detected during the 17-year study period.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effects of warmer springs—and climate change in general—probably affect the breeding performance of larger, mono-brooding species differently than the smaller, multi-brooding species. In the former, the total time from mating until brood independence is about four months, whereas passerine nestlings fledge 
  <span class="italic">ca</span> 1.5 months after mating. Although grouse may re-nest if the first nest is robbed [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C36" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C36">36</a>], these species have limited opportunities to repair a failed breeding attempt. Passerines, on the contrary, have multiple such attempts and also raise more than one brood during favourable conditions. Logically, therefore, a mismatch in the larger mono-brooding species like grouse is likely to influence the breeding success more negatively than among the smaller passerines.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Caterpillars are closely linked to their host plants, and hatching and irruption normally occur in synchrony with bud burst and sprouting of new leaves [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C37" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C37">37</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C38" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C38">38</a>]. For insectivorous birds, warmer springs may have adverse effects on their breeding due to phenological mismatches at one or two successive stages. Firstly, and as shown by Visser &amp; Holleman [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C39" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C39">39</a>], the caterpillars may erupt before the host plant/tree has started new leaf growth, leading to subsequent die-offs of larval food before the birds hatch. Secondly, even if the phenology of both host and caterpillars match, both may advance more than the time of bird mating [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C9" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C9">9</a>]. There is recent evidence that the first type of mismatch—the one between host plant and caterpillar hatching—may over time be ‘repaired’ by adaptation; in the winter moth 
  <span class="italic">Operopthera brumata</span>, hatching too early was reduced by site-specific selection of successful, late-hatching eggs [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C40" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C40">40</a>]. So far, adaptation among birds for earlier breeding to match the temporal advancement in food has mostly been dealt with on theoretical grounds [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C10" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C10">10</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C41" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C41">41</a>]. As breeding in birds, at least in mono-breeding species, is more strictly regulated by the photoperiod [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C34" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C34">34</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C42" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C42">42</a>], warmer springs are likely to advance the temporal occurrence of invertebrate foods more than the onset of bird breeding, at least in a short-time perspective.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a larger mono-brooding species with the time of breeding strongly regulated by the photoperiod, we would expect boreal forest grouse to be adversely affected by warmer springs. Our results do not support this prediction; instead we show that reproductive output was enhanced—not reduced—in earlier and warmer springs. Why this contradictory result? So far, the extent of temporal mismatching caused by warmer springs—asynchrony between hatching time and optimum food sources and/or weather conditions for chicks—has not been critically examined for boreal grouse. In our study, breeding success was highest when the birds hatched around the time when bilberry shoot growth was completed, indicated by a GDD
  <sub>5</sub> of 200. In the boreal forests, bilberry is the main host plant of the caterpillars needed by the newly hatched chicks [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C19" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C19">19</a>–
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C21" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C21">21</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C43" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C43">43</a>]. The preliminary study by Wegge 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C13">13</a>], the first to measure the phenology of caterpillars in bilberry-dominated vegetation, found little temporal difference in the timing of the combined geometrid and sawfly caterpillar peak between a warm spring with early grouse breeding and a colder spring with late breeding; in both years the caterpillar peak lasted nearly two weeks. In northern coniferous forests, snow covers the ground in early April, which might preclude rising temperatures in April from stimulating new growth in bilberry, thereby maintaining closer synchrony between the emergence of caterpillars and new growth of their host plant.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If the temporal relationships between caterpillar abundance and spring weather remain more or less unaltered in bilberry habitats, warmer springs may not adversely affect the availability of food for the chicks. Also, and in contrast with the study of black grouse breeding in Finland [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C12" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C12">12</a>], the temperature during hatching in early June is increasing, albeit much less than during the pre-hatching periods. From the influences of earlier and warmer springs on vegetation and breeding phenology—as reported in this study—we therefore predict that breeding success will not be adversely affected; warmer springs may even enhance the breeding performance of boreal forest grouse. However, because the caterpillar food source plays a crucial role in the breeding performance of these species, the temporal relationships between bilberry leafing and caterpillars—and how they vary with spring temperatures—need to be thoroughly examined.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Summing up, our study does not lend evidence to the general notion that warmer climate will adversely affect the reproduction of birds and animals in northern latitudes [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C6" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C6">6</a>]. Instead, we found that the reproductive output of two species of boreal forest grouse increased along with warmer and earlier springs. However, our study only assessed the impact on breeding performance. Through effects on environmental variables, a warmer climate may have adverse effects on other demographic processes, for instance on the survival of adult birds, thereby dampening or nullifying the positive effects on reproductive output. A recent study of the same populations [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C18">18</a>] showed that, in spite of increasing trends in breeding success, the population sizes of both species remained more or less constant. As pointed out by Stenseth &amp; Mysterud [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C44" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C44">44</a>] and Winkler 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a rid="RSPB20171528C45" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20171528C45">45</a>], climate change—with its impact on phenology—is likely to affect several life-history traits and therefore calls for an all-embracing examination in order to identify critical relationships.
