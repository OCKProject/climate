 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We tested the effect of leptin on the number of broods within a season and timing of reproduction by implanting female great tits with pellets, which slowly released leptin for a period of 14 days, at different stages of the breeding cycle. Leptin treated females were less likely to initiate a second brood compared to placebo treated females. However, neither leptin nor placebo treated birds differed in their likeliness to initiate a second brood compared to non-experimental females of similar laying dates. We showed that leptin had no effect on the timing of reproduction. Also, we showed that leptin treatment did not affect body mass, feeding frequency or basal metabolic rate in captive female great tits.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to our expectations, placebo treated females were more likely to initiate second breeding attempts within the same season compared to leptin treated females. Our data are directly opposite to the data of Lõhmus and Björklund 
  <a rid="pone.0034090-Lhmus1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Lhmus1">[7]</a> who showed that a higher proportion of leptin treated females initiated second broods. In fact, our experiment was an exact replica of their experiment using the same species, with leptin from the same origin, in the same dosage and with pellets made by the same company. Although the function of leptin is mammals is well understood 
  <a rid="pone.0034090-Henson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Henson1">[26]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0034090-Houseknecht1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Houseknecht1">[30]</a>, its function in birds is still poorly understood and a long lasting topic of debate 
  <a rid="pone.0034090-FriedmanEinat1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-FriedmanEinat1">[31]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0034090-Pitel2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Pitel2">[34]</a>. This study adds to the uncertainties of the role of leptin in birds.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fact that five out of six second broods were deserted in the incubation stage or directly after hatching suggests that the placebo females were tricked into initiation of a second breeding attempt while they had not intended to do so, while 7 out of 11 (64%) non-experimental females with a second brood were able to fledge nestlings. Therefore we explored the possibility that the leptin and placebo pellets were accidentally swapped. However, in a bioassay, leptin activity was found in the residues of the bag in which the leptin pellets were stored (2.5 pg/ml) and no leptin activity was found in the bag in which the placebo pellets were stored (pers. comm. A. Gertler). Thus there is no evidence that the pellets were swapped. Another possible explanation, also explaining why placebo treated females had a higher rate of double brooding than non-experimental females, is that capturing and implanting females may affect their estimation of predation pressure and hence they may shift to more reproductive output, unless when they are in good condition (as perceived by the leptin implanted birds).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although leptin treated females were less likely to produce second broods, this did not gain an advantage in terms of male and female return rate or increased recruitment of their first brood fledglings. This is in contrast to earlier experiments where Verhulst 
  <a rid="pone.0034090-Verhulst3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Verhulst3">[5]</a> showed that removing second broods lead to increased female, but not male, survival in years with low winter food availability. This could be due to our low sample size making it difficult to detect fitness effects if present. Alternatively, since all but one female deserted during or after incubation, females could have returned to help out after deserting, mitigating the negative fitness effects.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2010, a new batch of leptin and placebo pellets was used to test the effect of leptin on timing of reproduction. The window for timing of egg laying is set by photoperiod, which has a direct effect on gonadal development 
  <a rid="pone.0034090-Sharp1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Sharp1">[13]</a>. Besides photoperiod, secondary cues are used to fine tune timing of reproduction to annual variation in the optimal timing of reproduction 
  <a rid="pone.0034090-Wingfield2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Wingfield2">[44]</a>. Food availability in the period before egg laying is one of those secondary cues, as has been shown by supplementary feeding experiments 
  <a rid="pone.0034090-Robb1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Robb1">[22]</a>. There might be a direct effect of food availability on timing of reproduction, or an indirect effect via body condition. We found no effect of leptin on laying dates in great tits, which implies that perceived body condition in the weeks before egg laying does not play a major role in the timing of reproduction. Unfortunately, little is known about food availability in the period before egg laying. It is possible that earlier breeding is simply not possible energetically since early breeding means egg laying under colder conditions with increased energetic costs 
  <a rid="pone.0034090-teMarvelde2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-teMarvelde2">[20]</a>. If the costs of early egg laying are higher than the benefits of a better match with the food peak, being mismatched can be the optimal strategy 
  <a rid="pone.0034090-Visser4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Visser4">[21]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is possible that leptin caused an increase in energetic costs in great tits, as a lack of leptin in mammals results in decreased energy expenditure 
  <a rid="pone.0034090-Margetic1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Margetic1">[45]</a>. If leptin increased energy expenditure in great tits, this could potentially explain why none of the leptin treated females started a second brood or why we found no effect on laying dates. However, measurements of BMR of captive female great tits showed no evidence of an effect of leptin. To our knowledge, this is the first study measuring the effect of leptin on BMR in a wild bird species. Human studies on leptin suggest that leptin affects energy balance mainly through the regulation of food intake and not via a direct effect on energy expenditure 
  <a rid="pone.0034090-Hukshorn1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Hukshorn1">[46]</a>. In our study, leptin did not affect feeding rates although depressed food intake after leptin injection has been found in mammals 
  <a rid="pone.0034090-Barb1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Barb1">[47]</a>, in domesticated chicken 
  <a rid="pone.0034090-Denbow1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Denbow1">[48]</a> and wild great tits 
  <a rid="pone.0034090-Lhmus2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Lhmus2">[36]</a>, albeit higher concentrations of leptin were used compared to our study. Also, Lõhmus 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span>
  <a rid="pone.0034090-Lhmus2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Lhmus2">[36]</a> showed a decrease in feeding rates in the first 40 minutes after injection, after which it became equal to the control group. Slow release of leptin at a dosage of 2 µg per gram body mass per 24 h did not affect feeding rates in our study. Consequently, it also did not affect body weight and we therefore think the lack of second breeding attempts within the same season and the lack of effect of leptin on timing of reproduction were not caused by increased costs as a result of the leptin treatment itself.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Life history decisions often involve a trade-off between current reproductive investment and future reproductive investment. Therefore, research should focus on manipulations which do not affect the energetic costs of current reproduction (e.g. supplementary feeding) as this disrupts the balance between costs and benefits in current reproduction investments. Manipulations of timing of reproduction without changing the costs associated with early reproduction are particularly important in understanding the consequences of climate change, since climate change has already, and will continue, to advance the seasonal timing of arthropod food sources for forest living insectivorous animals. Without understanding the ultimate fitness costs of early reproduction, predicting evolutionary responses to climate change are difficult to make.</p>
