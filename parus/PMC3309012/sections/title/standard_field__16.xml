 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nest boxes were checked weekly from the beginning of April to monitor nest building, egg laying and incubation. Nests were visited daily from two days before the expected hatching date to ensure the exact hatching date (date at which at least one chick hatched ( = day 0)). When the nestlings were seven days of age, parents were caught using a spring loaded trap inside the nest box while feeding the nestlings. Parents were ringed with a uniquely numbered aluminium ring as well as with three colour rings coding a unique colour combination. Also, all nestlings were ringed with a uniquely numbered aluminum ring. Nest boxes were checked after fledging to record possible dead nestlings and unhatched eggs.</p>
