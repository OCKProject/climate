 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Twelve out of 19 leptin females and 15 out of 18 placebo females laid eggs in the study area. One leptin treated female incubated an empty nest and thus was excluded from the analysis. Mean laying date of leptin treated females (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 12, mean = 16.1 SD = 3.3) did not differ from mean laying dates of placebo treated females (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 15, mean = 13.4, SD = 3.9; Two sample Wilcox rank sum test: W = 121.5, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.13; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034090-g002" href="#pone-0034090-g002">Fig. 2</a>). We were therefore not able to estimate the effect of a better match with the food peak on nestling recruitment and the effect of the likely increase in energetic costs during egg laying and incubation on adult survival.
