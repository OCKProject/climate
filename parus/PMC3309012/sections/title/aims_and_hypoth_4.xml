 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The aims of this study were threefold. First, we studied whether elevated leptin levels during the end of the first brood affects the decision to start a second brood. We assessed the fitness consequences of having a second brood in terms of parental survival, number of fledglings produced and fledgling recruitment. We expected females with experimentally elevated leptin levels to be more likely to produce second broods as in 
  <a rid="pone.0034090-Lhmus1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Lhmus1">[7]</a>. We expected survival of nestlings of first broods to be lower for those females producing second broods 
  <a rid="pone.0034090-Verhulst1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Verhulst1">[2]</a>, because only the males will provide parental care after fledging. The extra workload (for males taking care of fledglings alone, for females the costs of producing eggs and incubation) could lead to reduced adult survival. Our second aim was to study whether elevated leptin in the period before egg laying affects the timing of egg laying and to assess whether there are fitness consequences of altered timing of reproduction. We expected early egg laying by leptin treated females as a result of the increased perceived body condition. Nestling recruitment would be higher for leptin treated females as they would then be timed better with the food peak, while adult survival is reduced because of the increased costs of early egg laying and incubation. The third aim of this study was to study the effect of elevated leptin levels on body mass, foraging activity and basal metabolic rate (BMR) in captive great tits, because an increase in energy expenditure or a decrease of food intake or body mass as a result of increasing leptin levels could potentially delay timing of breeding and thus affect the results for the previous aim. We expected leptin to decrease body mass as a consequence of decreased foraging activity (as has been shown in great tits) and to increase BMR (as has been found in mammals).
