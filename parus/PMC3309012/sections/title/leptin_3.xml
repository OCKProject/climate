 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most of our knowledge on the function of the hormone leptin comes from mammalian studies. In mammals, leptin is produced by fat cells and plays a major role in the energy balance and reproduction of mammals 
  <a rid="pone.0034090-Henson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Henson1">[26]</a>. Leptin is involved in a negative feedback loop that regulates food intake and body weight 
  <a rid="pone.0034090-Friedman1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Friedman1">[27]</a>. Leptin levels increase after food is consumed 
  <a rid="pone.0034090-Saladin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Saladin1">[28]</a>, and thus serves as a short term energy balance signal. Leptin is also a long term signal of body condition as leptin levels circulating in the plasma correlate with body fat content 
  <a rid="pone.0034090-Henson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Henson1">[26]</a>. In mammals, leptin binding to its receptor in the hypothalamus activates the sympathetic nervous system to increase energy expenditure 
  <a rid="pone.0034090-Haynes1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Haynes1">[29]</a>. Leptin also plays a major role in reproduction in mammals 
  <a rid="pone.0034090-Henson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Henson1">[26]</a>. It is thought that leptin might have a role in signaling the nutritional status to the hypothalamus, which controls the reproductive neuroendocrine function

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The function of leptin has been studied in other vertebrates, including birds. Leptin in birds is a topic of debate after the initial cloning of leptin from chicken DNA could not be replicated 
  <a rid="pone.0034090-FriedmanEinat1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-FriedmanEinat1">[31]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0034090-Pitel1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Pitel1">[32]</a> and its existence questioned 
  <a rid="pone.0034090-Sharp2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Sharp2">[33]</a>. Pitel 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span>
  <a rid="pone.0034090-Pitel2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Pitel2">[34]</a> suggested the possibility that the leptin gene got lost through evolution while the leptin receptor still exists. Many studies with sometimes contrasting results have added to the discussion. Increased levels of leptin can cause a decrease in food intake as shown in both domesticated and wild bird species 
  <a rid="pone.0034090-Kuo1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Kuo1">[35]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0034090-Lhmus3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Lhmus3">[37]</a>. Immunisation against leptin in chicken resulted in increased food intake and increased daily weight and fat gain 
  <a rid="pone.0034090-Shi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Shi1">[38]</a>. Leptin receptors have been found in ovaries and brain of laying hens 
  <a rid="pone.0034090-Ohkubo1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Ohkubo1">[39]</a>. Leptin advances puberty in chicken 
  <a rid="pone.0034090-PaczoskaEliasiewicz1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-PaczoskaEliasiewicz1">[40]</a>, can directly control basic chicken ovarian functions 
  <a rid="pone.0034090-Sirotkin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Sirotkin1">[41]</a> and is involved in follicle maturation 
  <a rid="pone.0034090-Henson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Henson1">[26]</a>. No leptin activity was found in Bar-tailed godwits (
  <span class="italic">Limosa lapponica</span>) and Adélie penguins (
  <span class="italic">Pygoscelis adeliae</span>) even though these two species undergo large changes in body fat in their annual cycle 
  <a rid="pone.0034090-Yosefi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Yosefi1">[42]</a>. Kordonowy 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span>
  <a rid="pone.0034090-Kordonowy1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Kordonowy1">[43]</a> showed that leptin in free living starlings (
  <span class="italic">Sturnus vulgaris</span>) followed a seasonal pattern, with highest leptin levels during egg laying declining towards chick rearing. Unfortunately, leptin concentration in the weeks before egg laying were not included in this study. Increasing leptin levels in the period before egg laying might thus increase a bird's perceived body condition and might therefore affect the timing of reproduction in populations with selection for early reproduction.
