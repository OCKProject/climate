 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2010, 15 captive female great tits originating from the Hoge Veluwe population were used to study the effect of leptin on body mass, foraging activity and BMR. These females were hand reared in 2009 from 10 days old. Since independence these females were housed indoors in controlled conditions. Females were already ringed with one uniquely numbered aluminum ring and were given a unique combination of two colour rings to make identification on the video possible to score foraging behaviour (see below). From the end of May, all females were housed at the previous location of the Netherlands Institute of Ecology (Heteren, The Netherlands; 51°57′20″N–5°44′34″E) in one large outdoor aviary under natural light and temperature conditions and 
  <span class="italic">ad libitum</span> food and water. Females were randomly assigned to the leptin or placebo treatment or not to be treated (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 5 for each group). Leptin and placebo pellets (from the 2010 batch) were implanted on June 14
  <span class="sup">th</span>.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We measured basal metabolic rate (BMR) in terms of oxygen consumption in an open-circuit respirometer. BMR was measured during three periods: before, during and after the treatment (July 7/6/8, July 18/19/20 and August 2/3/4 respectively; five females per night randomly spread over the treatments). Females were weighed to the nearest 0.1 g using an electronic balance (Sartorius PT 1500, USA) before going into the respirometer chamber. Birds were isolated in five sealed respirometer chambers (0.76 l) and placed in the darkness of a climate cabinet (Sanyo MIR-553, Sanyo E&amp;E Europe BV, Etten-Leur, The Netherlands) at 25°C (i.e. within their thermoneutral zone), always between 11PM and 1130PM. H
  <sub>2</sub>O and CO
  <sub>2</sub> were removed from the inlet air (blown into the respirometer chamber) respectively with Drierite® (6 mesh, Sigma-Aldrich Chemie BV, Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands) and Soda lime ® (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie BV, Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands). Air flow rate was set to 250 ml min
  <span class="sup">−1</span> with flowmeters (Brooks Instrument B.V., Ede, The Netherlands) previously calibrated using a soap bubble method (Bubble-O-Meter, LLC, Dublin, OH, USA). Oxygen content of outlet air was measured every 30 seconds with an oxygen analyser (Servomex 4100, Servomex BV, Zoetemeer, The Netherlands). Oxygen consumption (ml O
  <sub>2</sub> min
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) was calculated as the difference in oxygen concentration between air from the respirometer chambers and reference air from an empty chamber. As only one oxygen analyzer was used, measurements alternated between the five experimental and one reference chamber every 15 minutes. Measurements over the last 5 minutes of each 15 minute period were averaged and the period with the lowest averaged oxygen consumption was used to calculate BMR. The oxygen consumption was converted to metabolic rate (kJ 24 h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) by assuming an energetic equivalence of 20 kJ L

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Feeding rates were scored on the same captive female great tits by analyzing video recordings made of the feeding table before, during and after the leptin treatment (respectively July 11
  <span class="sup">th</span>, 16
  <span class="sup">th</span> and August 3
  <span class="sup">rd</span>). On each of the mornings, around 8.30AM, all left-over food of the previous day was removed. Fresh food was presented in a single tray and filmed with a digital video camera (JVC Everio, Germany). Females were identified based on their colour rings. Feeding frequencies for individual females were scored during the first hour after presenting the food. Only visits were food was taken were used in the analyses (541 of 579 visits (93.4%)).
