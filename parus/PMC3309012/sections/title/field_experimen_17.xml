 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the breeding season in 2009, 30 female great tits were caught while feeding nestlings (of 10 days old) using a spring trap inside the nest box (10 females per day on three consecutive days). Each day, five females were assigned to the placebo treatment and five to the leptin treatment. The leptin/placebo was administered in a custom made pellet (Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, Florida, USA; 3 mm in diameter; 16 mg) which continuously released chicken recombinant leptin (provided by A. Gertler, Protein Laboratories Rehovot Ltd., Rehovot, Israel) over a 14 day period. The leptin pellets were made of a matrix (mainly cholesterol) and 500 µg recombinant chicken leptin. As the matrix slowly dissolves leptin is released (about 2 µg per gram body mass per day). The placebo pellets were made of only the matrix and contained no leptin. Pellets (of the 2009 batch) were inserted subcutaneously in the field in the adult female when the nestlings of her first brood were 10 days old (fledging normally occurs at the age of 18 or 19 days).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After the implantation event the original box and surrounding nest boxes were checked twice times a week to monitor the initiation of second broods. Incubating females were identified based on their colour combination to ensure it had started a second brood. From then onwards, the protocol was the same as for the first broods.</p>
