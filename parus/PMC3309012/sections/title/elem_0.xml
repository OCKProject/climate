  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Multiple breeding attempts</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Multiple breeding attempts within the same breeding season is a common reproductive tactic in a variety of taxonomic groups, including birds 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Verhulst1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Verhulst1">[2]</a>. In great tits (
   <span class="italic">Parus major</span>), a facultative multiple breeding species, early breeding pairs are more likely to initiate a second clutch 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Verboven1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Verboven1">[3]</a>. Second clutches are mostly initiated just before or just after fledging of the first brood. Because the fledged nestlings receive about three weeks of parental care outside the nest box 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Verhulst2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Verhulst2">[4]</a>, parental care has to be divided between the first and second brood once a second brood is initiated. Reduced parental care could lead to reduced survival of the first brood fledglings, but total recruitment could increase if fledglings of the second brood recruit in the population. Indeed, experimental removal of second broods in great tits resulted in increased breeding success of recruits of the first brood chicks the year after fledging 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Verhulst1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Verhulst1">[2]</a>. Removal of second clutches also showed that female, but not male, survival increased, showing a cost to having multiple breeding attempts 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Verhulst3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Verhulst3">[5]</a>, and experimental brood enlargement of the first brood in blue tits (
   <span class="italic">Parus caeruleus</span>) resulted in a reduced probability of initiating a second brood 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Parejo1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Parejo1">[6]</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is unknown which cues are used in the decision to initiate a second brood. So far, one study was able to promote second brooding. Lõhmus and Björklund 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Lhmus1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Lhmus1">[7]</a> showed, using a leptin manipulation in great tits, that increased perceived body condition at the end of the first brood increased the proportion of second broods. Unfortunately, no fitness effects were recorded.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Timing of reproduction</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many bird species time their reproduction in a way that the period of maximum food requirements (feeding nestlings) coincides with the timing of maximum food availability (arthropod food peak). Breeding too late or too early has negative effects in terms of energy expenditure during chick feeding 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-teMarvelde1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-teMarvelde1">[8]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Thomas1">[9]</a> and fitness 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Visser1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Visser1">[10]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Nilsson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Nilsson1">[11]</a>. In order to match the timing of food availability and food requirements, egg laying has to be initiated weeks before the occurrence of the food peak. Multiple environmental cues are used in the timing of reproduction. Besides photoperiod as initial predictive cue, supplementary cues like temperature are used to time reproduction 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Wingfield1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Wingfield1">[12]</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Dawson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Dawson1">[14]</a>. In years with high spring temperatures, birds initiate timing of breeding earlier in the season. It could be that temperature in the period before egg laying itself is used as a cue. Alternatively, body condition before egg laying may be used as the cue 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Schaper1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Schaper1">[15]</a>. For example, female mallards (
   <span class="italic">Anas platyrhynchos</span>) in good body condition breed earlier compared to females in poor body condition 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Devries1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Devries1">[16]</a>. Since food availability and foraging success both increase as temperatures increase in spring 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Avery1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Avery1">[17]</a>, it is likely that an increase in body condition is confounded with the increase of temperature. Experimental manipulation of the body condition is needed to study the effects of body condition on timing of reproduction.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Studying the fitness costs of advanced reproduction is particularly interesting in the Hoge Veluwe study population of great tits, because climate change caused the seasonal timing of the phenology of the food peak to shift earlier in the season the last four decades. Great tits have advanced egg laying, but have not advanced adequately to match the shift of their food peak 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Visser1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Visser1">[10]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Visser2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Visser2">[18]</a>. We have two hypotheses for the lack of shift in timing of breeding. First, it is possible that great tits have not changed the way they use temperature as a cue (‘
   <span class="italic">cue hypothesis</span>’). Temperatures in early spring (the period when great tits have to decide to start laying eggs) have not increased as much as temperatures in late spring (the period which determines the timing of the caterpillar peak). Therefore, the correlation between temperatures in early and late spring have changed. If great tits still use the old rules to predict the timing of the caterpillar food peak using temperatures in early spring temperature, they will start egg laying too late. This hypothesis implies that egg laying could commence earlier, if the rules to predict timing of the food peak change. In this case, an advance of egg laying would lead to an increase in fitness due to the better match with the food peak. An alternative hypothesis as to why great tits lay their eggs too late is that early egg laying is constrained by food availability (‘
   <span class="italic">constraint hypothesis</span>’). Earlier egg laying would result in a higher workload, with likely negative effects of survival 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Visser3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Visser3">[19]</a>. In this case, the fitness benefits of a better synchrony between the food peak and the nestlings' nutritional needs do not outweigh the decrease in fitness costs of earlier egg laying. Therefore, if the constraint hypothesis is true, advancing egg laying would lead to a decrease in fitness. Only experimental advancement of timing of reproduction could reveal potential fitness costs of increased energetic costs of early egg laying 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-teMarvelde2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-teMarvelde2">[20]</a> and whether great tits in our study area are maladapted due to climate change 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Visser4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Visser4">[21]</a>. Providing supplementary food could increase body condition and affect timing of reproduction 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Robb1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Robb1">[22]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Nager1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Nager1">[23]</a>, but this is of limited use when the focus of the study is to measure fitness effects of early reproduction because supplementary food alters the energy balance of adults; birds do not have to work for their food and do not pay the costs of foraging 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Verhulst4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Verhulst4">[24]</a>. Relaxing foraging effort by providing supplementary food before and during egg laying could potentially mask fitness costs of early egg laying on parental survival or fledgling recruitment when carry over effects of increased work load in the early stages of the reproductive cycle exist 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Visser3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Visser3">[19]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Monaghan1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Monaghan1">[25]</a>. Instead, to measure fitness effects, the perception of body condition should be altered without influencing the food availability. This could be done by experimentally elevating leptin levels (see below).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Leptin</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most of our knowledge on the function of the hormone leptin comes from mammalian studies. In mammals, leptin is produced by fat cells and plays a major role in the energy balance and reproduction of mammals 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Henson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Henson1">[26]</a>. Leptin is involved in a negative feedback loop that regulates food intake and body weight 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Friedman1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Friedman1">[27]</a>. Leptin levels increase after food is consumed 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Saladin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Saladin1">[28]</a>, and thus serves as a short term energy balance signal. Leptin is also a long term signal of body condition as leptin levels circulating in the plasma correlate with body fat content 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Henson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Henson1">[26]</a>. In mammals, leptin binding to its receptor in the hypothalamus activates the sympathetic nervous system to increase energy expenditure 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Haynes1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Haynes1">[29]</a>. Leptin also plays a major role in reproduction in mammals 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Henson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Henson1">[26]</a>. It is thought that leptin might have a role in signaling the nutritional status to the hypothalamus, which controls the reproductive neuroendocrine function 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Houseknecht1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Houseknecht1">[30]</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The function of leptin has been studied in other vertebrates, including birds. Leptin in birds is a topic of debate after the initial cloning of leptin from chicken DNA could not be replicated 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-FriedmanEinat1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-FriedmanEinat1">[31]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Pitel1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Pitel1">[32]</a> and its existence questioned 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Sharp2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Sharp2">[33]</a>. Pitel 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Pitel2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Pitel2">[34]</a> suggested the possibility that the leptin gene got lost through evolution while the leptin receptor still exists. Many studies with sometimes contrasting results have added to the discussion. Increased levels of leptin can cause a decrease in food intake as shown in both domesticated and wild bird species 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Kuo1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Kuo1">[35]</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Lhmus3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Lhmus3">[37]</a>. Immunisation against leptin in chicken resulted in increased food intake and increased daily weight and fat gain 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Shi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Shi1">[38]</a>. Leptin receptors have been found in ovaries and brain of laying hens 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Ohkubo1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Ohkubo1">[39]</a>. Leptin advances puberty in chicken 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-PaczoskaEliasiewicz1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-PaczoskaEliasiewicz1">[40]</a>, can directly control basic chicken ovarian functions 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Sirotkin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Sirotkin1">[41]</a> and is involved in follicle maturation 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Henson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Henson1">[26]</a>. No leptin activity was found in Bar-tailed godwits (
   <span class="italic">Limosa lapponica</span>) and Adélie penguins (
   <span class="italic">Pygoscelis adeliae</span>) even though these two species undergo large changes in body fat in their annual cycle 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Yosefi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Yosefi1">[42]</a>. Kordonowy 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Kordonowy1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Kordonowy1">[43]</a> showed that leptin in free living starlings (
   <span class="italic">Sturnus vulgaris</span>) followed a seasonal pattern, with highest leptin levels during egg laying declining towards chick rearing. Unfortunately, leptin concentration in the weeks before egg laying were not included in this study. Increasing leptin levels in the period before egg laying might thus increase a bird's perceived body condition and might therefore affect the timing of reproduction in populations with selection for early reproduction.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Aims and hypothesis</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The aims of this study were threefold. First, we studied whether elevated leptin levels during the end of the first brood affects the decision to start a second brood. We assessed the fitness consequences of having a second brood in terms of parental survival, number of fledglings produced and fledgling recruitment. We expected females with experimentally elevated leptin levels to be more likely to produce second broods as in 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Lhmus1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Lhmus1">[7]</a>. We expected survival of nestlings of first broods to be lower for those females producing second broods 
   <a rid="pone.0034090-Verhulst1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0034090-Verhulst1">[2]</a>, because only the males will provide parental care after fledging. The extra workload (for males taking care of fledglings alone, for females the costs of producing eggs and incubation) could lead to reduced adult survival. Our second aim was to study whether elevated leptin in the period before egg laying affects the timing of egg laying and to assess whether there are fitness consequences of altered timing of reproduction. We expected early egg laying by leptin treated females as a result of the increased perceived body condition. Nestling recruitment would be higher for leptin treated females as they would then be timed better with the food peak, while adult survival is reduced because of the increased costs of early egg laying and incubation. The third aim of this study was to study the effect of elevated leptin levels on body mass, foraging activity and basal metabolic rate (BMR) in captive great tits, because an increase in energy expenditure or a decrease of food intake or body mass as a result of increasing leptin levels could potentially delay timing of breeding and thus affect the results for the previous aim. We expected leptin to decrease body mass as a consequence of decreased foraging activity (as has been shown in great tits) and to increase BMR (as has been found in mammals).
