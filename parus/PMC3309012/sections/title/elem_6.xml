 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Against our expectation, placebo treated females were more likely to initiate a second breeding attempt compared to leptin treated females (placebo: 6/15 (40%), leptin: 0/15 (0%); Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction; χ
  <span class="sup">2</span>

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034090-g001" href="#pone-0034090-g001">Fig. 1</a>). The proportion of second broods from placebo treated females was more than double that of non-experimental females with similar laying dates (7 out of 43; 16.3%). However, this difference is not significant (Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction; χ
  <span class="sup">2</span>
  <sub>1</sub> = 2.36, P = 0.12). Leptin treated females were not less likely to initiate second broods compared to females with similar laying dates (Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction; χ

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Clutch sizes of second broods of placebo treated females were smaller compared to the clutch size of their first broods (paired t-test: t = 9.71, df = 5, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.0002), but not different from other second broods of non-experimental great tits in 2009 (Two Sample Wilcoxon rank sum test W = 25.5, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.47). Only one of the six second broods fledged (two) chicks. One nest was deserted early in the incubation stage and one after ∼10 days of incubation (of which the embryos were almost fully developed). The other three nests were deserted from the moment the first egg hatched. Seven out of 11 (64%) non-experimental females with a second brood were able to fledge nestlings.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Females which produced a second brood were likely to have invested more energy in reproduction compared to females which did not produce a second brood. These extra costs could result in reduced survival. However, eight leptin females and eight placebo females (of which three produced a second brood) were recorded in 2010 as breeding adults, thus showing no difference in survival to the next breeding season between leptin and placebo treated females. Within the experimental females, survival of females that initiated a second brood was not different from females that did not initiate a second brood (3/6 vs. 13/24.; Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction χ
  <span class="sup">2</span>
  <sub>1</sub> = 0.08, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.78).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During incubation of the second clutch and possibly also during egg laying, females are not able to assist in caring for the first brood fledglings. Therefore, males may have worked harder to compensate for the female's absence, or alternatively compromise parental care at the costs of nestling survival. Five males of the control pairs and seven males of the leptin group (note that males in neither of the two groups were implanted a leptin pellet) returned as breeding males the next year (5/15 vs. 7/15; Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction; χ
  <span class="sup">2</span>
  <sub>1</sub> = 0.14, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.71). Males of which females started a second brood were not less likely to survive than males of females which did not start a second brood (2/6 vs. 10/24; χ
  <span class="sup">2</span>
  <sub>1</sub> = 0.009, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.93).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A possible reduction in female provisioning behaviour as a result of initiating a second brood could have negative consequences for the fledglings of the first brood. However, six fledglings from the control group and six fledglings of the leptin group returned in 2010 as first year breeders out of a total of 297 fledglings (leptin 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 143 and placebo 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 154). None of the recruits came from second broods. First broods of females which initiated a second brood were not less likely to recruit as a breeder the next year compared to fledglings of females which did not initiate a second brood (2/59 vs. 10/238; Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction; χ
  <span class="sup">2</span>
  <sub>1</sub> = 0.007, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.93).
