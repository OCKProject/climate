When looking at only the captive populations, there was a significant difference in CORT where females housed in the U.S. had significantly higher CORT (376.1 ± 106.2 ng/dL) than those housed in Madagascar (87.3 ± 37.2 ng/dL;

  <sub>2,14</sub> = 9.030, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.0032). Overall, females in the Madagascar captive population had lower E2 averages (25.7 ± 6.9 pg/mL) than those in either the wild (62.7 ± 7.4 pg/mL) or U.S. captive (68.6 ± 12.0 pg/mL) populations. All populations varied in the annual pattern of E2, but was highest overall in January and November (81.5–82.2 ± 9.7–11.1 pg/mL) and lowest in April (14.7 ± 15.8 pg/mL). Estradiol exhibited two peaks in the Madagascar populations, but to differing degrees (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182004.g006" href="#pone.0182004.g006">Fig 6</a>). The U.S. population did not exhibit any distinguishable peaks of E2. Among the two captive populations where nesting had been observed, those females which had been seen to nest within the sample time period (2012–2015) also exhibited higher overall mean E2 concentrations than those which were not to be known to nest (53.7 pg/mL vs. 28.7 pg/mL;

We found P averaged significantly lowest in Madagascar captives (0.44 ± 0.25 ng/mL), whereas wild and US captive females averaged similarly (1.84 ± 0.38 ng/mL and 1.44 ± 0.17 ng/mL, respectively). As seen in the E2 trends, P peaked twice (November and January) in both Madagascar populations, but again the degrees to which they occurred differed (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182004.g006" href="#pone.0182004.g006">Fig 6</a>). Again, no distinguishable peaks could be detected in the U.S. population. Within the two captive populations, those females which were known to have laid nests had higher average P concentrations overall throughout sampling (1.05 ng/mL vs 0.57 ng/mL;
