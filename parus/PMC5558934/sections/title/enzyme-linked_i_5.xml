 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To understand natural variation in stress and give us the ability to compare with captive populations, we quantified plasma corticosterone (CORT) using enzyme immunoassays (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA; kit #500655) as in [
  <a rid="pone.0182004.ref071" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref071">71</a>]. All samples were run in duplicate or triplicate and any pair with coefficient of variation (CV) greater than 15% were re-analyzed. Inter- and intra-assay CVs were 5% or less. The assay platform was validated for use in

  <span class="italic">P</span> &gt; 0.05). Accuracy was assessed using recovery of known standard additions to pooled plasma (
