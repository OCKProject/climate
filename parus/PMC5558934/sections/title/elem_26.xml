   <a rid="pone.0182004.ref073" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref073">73</a>]. In the present study, animals in the wild population exhibited BCSs nearest to zero, while both captive populations differed more widely. Captive adults generally had more positive BCSs than those in the wild; however, sub-adults showed the opposite trend. In captivity, animals are usually allowed free access to perpetual food and water resources, and adults are housed in less crowded enclosures, separated from sub-adults. It is possible that interspecific competition and boldness/shyness of individuals among the sub-adults in more crowded enclosures account for the lower BCSs and consistent stress within that group (e.g., [

   <a rid="pone.0182004.ref076" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref076">76</a>]. In the present study, an additional factor should be considered: sub-adults in the Madagascar captive population are generally fed native forage species; however, there are no studies on what sub-adults consume in the wild and how it may differ from adults and by season. In many chelonian species, sub-adults and adults not only inhabit differing habitats, but their diets are composed of different ratios or of entirely different species/items [

Although variability might still be harbored in the populations, captive sub-adults would not be exposed to such stressors and would be less likely to undergo such a response. These naiveties can be detrimental to survival [
   <a rid="pone.0182004.ref086" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref086">86</a>]. In a study on multiple parrot species, researchers found that most captive-bred birds, but only a small percentage of wild birds, were either recaptured or preyed on shortly after escape from enclosures [

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Elevated CORT is associated with predator avoidance behaviors and cautious animal personality types, and sub-adults in captivity generally do not exhibit a strong stress response or elevated basal CORT (as we found in the current study). In fact, individuals exhibiting aggressive behaviors or which are otherwise obviously stressed by captivity are generally bred out or avoided in captive breeding programs. This may be detrimental to individual survival because when the captive-bred animals are released into the wild they are unable to recognize threats and respond appropriately [
   <a rid="pone.0182004.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref001">1</a>,

   <a rid="pone.0182004.ref089" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref089">89</a>]. When those animals are encountered in the wild, they readily approach humans, do not turn away or attempt to retreat when handled, and extend their limbs and neck if stroked or scratched (ATFC and ARM, pers. obs.). Though bold individuals may be avoided or bred out in captivity, the genetic variation they represent may be important for the long-term survival of a species which needs to adapt to changing habitats, threats, and climate. Variability provides the population an opportunity to remain reproductively viable amid stochastic events and face novel situations. Maintaining variability will also help avoid inbreeding depression in other ways, such as in preserving healthy immune system functions. Understanding and mediating stressors are therefore an important part of conservation management.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Captivity has been shown to elicit a chronic stress response in many wild-caught animal species [
   <a rid="pone.0182004.ref075" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref075">75</a>,

   <a rid="pone.0182004.ref092" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref092">92</a>]). Therefore, as might be expected, adult CORT concentrations were generally higher in captive populations than the wild, yet were not consistent. Only the captive males housed within the native country were higher, while the single male in the U.S. was lowest. The opposite trend was found in females, but were within range of the wild animals. The distinct values found in the U.S. population were probably due to specific circumstances associated with those individuals and are described by sex separately below.

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Males</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The U.S. population’s adult male scored the highest positive BCSs, but males from both the Madagascar populations showed mean negative BCSs. Over time, both the Madagascar populations’ males exhibited similar BCS trends to one another, peaking mid-dry-season in July, which is likely associated with growth of testicular tissue (spermiogenesis and/or spermiation) as a surge in T occurs at that time. In many herpetofauna, reproductive timing in males is altogether or partially offset from mating season [
    <a rid="pone.0182004.ref093" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref093">93</a>, 
    <a rid="pone.0182004.ref094" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref094">94</a>], and this appears to be true in 
    <span class="italic">A</span>. 
    <span class="italic">yniphora</span> as well. Courtship and mating are seasonal in ploughshares, and generally occurs from October through December at the onset of the region’s wet season. Body condition scores dipped to the lowest values during the early wet season, when male-male competition for mates would be peaking. It has been suggested that males need to engage in combat in order to trigger their sexual interest in females [
    <a rid="pone.0182004.ref067" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref067">67</a>], and the combat itself will cause males to take in fewer food and water resources, altering BCSs. Males housed in the Madagascar captive population are regularly placed in shared enclosures, often specifically for these combat rituals, which may also help explain why they expressed BCSs and T concentrations more similar to wild individuals. Because the Madagascar captive population is generally fed native plant material, there may be a nutritional component to the similarity, as well as environmental, behavioral, and physiological components.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the wild population, males exhibit two CORT peaks which align with the time of ovulation in females, suggesting that competition for (and possibly defense of) mates is stressful for males. Monthly CORT in captive males was much more variable, and may be due to the changing of pairings and enclosures. However, we found that captive males which sired nests had overall higher basal CORT and T concentrations, suggesting that male-male competition is both stressful and requires aggression/dominance throughout the year. Similarly, in the eastern black rhinoceros (
    <span class="italic">Diceros bicornis michaeli</span>), dominant males exhibited significantly higher T and became sires by monopolizing more matings than non-sires [
    <a rid="pone.0182004.ref095" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref095">95</a>]. Although male sires in the current study had higher overall mean T, they exhibited significantly lower T during the months for which they sired. It logically follows that this strategy would be adaptive. For species which competition determines mating rights, aggressive males with higher T would generally be more successful in combat, but those T-linked aggressive behaviors could attenuate successful mating if directed at mates themselves. Dominant male 
    <span class="italic">A</span>. 
    <span class="italic">yniphora</span> may therefore undergo a reduction in T concentrations after combat to avoid misdirecting overly aggressive behaviors (e.g., causing harm or refusal by mates) and consequently, for courtship to take place.

His CORT concentrations remain low throughout the year while his T concentrations remain high throughout courtship, and aggression toward the females was noted. Although the females to which the U.S. male has access nested multiple times during this study, no fertilized eggs have been detected and sperm were not present in two eggs which were sacrificed to inspect them for the presence of sperm [

    <span class="italic">A</span>. 
    <span class="italic">yniphora</span> may need to reduce T concentrations (through increasing CORT or otherwise) to successfully reproduce. Yet, there is still debate on what the variation in T signals with regard to an individual’s biology, and investigations into the relative importance and extrinsic influences that contribute to variation need be conducted to better interpret variation in T [

Concordantly, mean BCSs in adult females from all three populations were found to be positive, and changes in BCS over time appear to reflect nesting events. Both captive populations exhibited higher BCSs in adult females than the wild; however, monthly trends were less evident than in wild females. It has been shown that captive female

    <a rid="pone.0182004.ref060" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref060">60</a>]. Therefore, the difference in captive females’ BCSs were probably not only due to restricted vagility alongside constant access to food and water resources, but probably also due to increased clutches per year. The idea that females may need to be paired with males for ovulation to occur suggests that: 1) this species may not have the capacity for sperm storage as is seen in many other chelonians and 2) the declining population density could directly affect reproductive output, exacerbating declines (as was seen in the passenger pigeon). For chelonian species where both vagility and density are low, the ability to store viable sperm from one season to the next is an incredible adaptation maintaining species survival. Unfortunately for the ploughshare, they may not have this ability yet, but it should be further investigated.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found that CORT was highest in females from the U.S. captive population, and consistently lowest in the Madagascar captive population. It is likely that these trends are directly related to their particular captive conditions. Females from the Madagascar captive population are separated from males in their group enclosures during all times except for matings. The two females in the U.S. population are relatively new imports to the facility and are offered little retreat from the males’ advances with which they are regularly housed. Those U.S. females’ E2 and P appear completely disrupted without clear peaks. Female reproductive cycles may become disrupted for a variety of reasons, and captivity may delay the onset on ovulation by months or years. Though some species have the capacity to attenuate reproduction in any given year, the underlying physiological regulation of this ability is not well understood [

Ploughshares reach sexual maturity at approximately 300 mm carapace length, and males can be distinguished from females using secondary sexual characteristics at about 350 mm carapace length [
   <a rid="pone.0182004.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref048">48</a>]. Size and age are generally correlated in chelonians, and those animals from 300–350 mm carapace length are estimated to be approximately 20–25 years old. If the sex of an animal is unknown for 15–25 years, as in this and many other chelonian species, a conservation strategy may be severely impaired or carried out without enough information to be successful. This has been an ongoing challenge for chelonian conservation management plans in general [

The trend of lower T than adult males is carried over among all the study populations. Plasma T concentrations were no different in sub-adults than females, but were significantly different than adult males. This suggests that sub-adult individuals exhibiting high T concentrations, especially during peak T months for adult males, could be assigned as male. In this species, it appears as though any T detection higher than 20 ng/mL from a sub-adult during the months October–November housed in Madagascar, or one housed in the U.S. during April–May, could be assigned as male relatively confidently; however, we caution that more directed investigations be done to hone the method. Additionally, if female hormones are to be investigated for this purpose, we suggest using E2 over P as the single male sample we ran for both hormones did exhibit detectable P, but not E2.</p>

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Environmental variables should be carefully considered when ectotherms are to be moved for assurance colonies and breeding. The hemispheric differences in climate we note between the U.S. and Madagascar captives has had a dramatic effect on the animals, and those that are housed in the U.S. are still not yet in successful reproductive condition. Though similar to the Madagascar populations where a seasonal dip and peak in BCS can be noted in the male housed in the U.S., the timing of the changes were temporally shifted by about five months forward (e.g., July instead of December). The U.S.-housed male’s reproductive hormones are most extreme and opposite of those in the Madagascar populations, while the U.S. females’ appear to be completely disrupted. Each of the adult animals in that population was transferred to the U.S. at a different month and year. The lack of reproductive success may be that the animals’ internal reproductive timing has not yet adjusted to the climate of southern California, which is in opposing seasonality with Madagascar and southern hemisphere. Those individuals housed in captivity in Madagascar are near their native range and did not undergo a significant delay before successful reproduction began. Using the hormone profiles presented in the current paper, it appears that the U.S. captives may be undergoing shifts in reproductive timing concordant with environmental cues. It is apparent that seasonal reproductive cycles are not easily or instantly acclimatized to large seasonal shifts. It may be several years before those translocated animals synchronize their reproductive cycles.</p>
