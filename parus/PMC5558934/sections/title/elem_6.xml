 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To gain a clear picture of reproductive cycles and potential in each population, we measured plasma concentrations of Testosterone (T), estradiol-17β (E2), and progesterone (P) using commercially available radioimmunoassay kits (Immuno-Biological Laboratories Inc., Minneapolis, MN. #KIR1709 [T], #KIP0629 [E2], and #KIP1458 [P]). Kits were validated using pooled plasma samples to perform serial dilutions compared against standard curves. Dilutions displayed parallelism to the standard curves, indicating that binding affinities were similar in samples and kit standards (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182004.g002" href="#pone.0182004.g002">Fig 2</a>). Recovery of added standards averaged 96.2 ± 2.3%, 102.3 ± 3.2%, 98.3± 3.1% for T, E2, &amp; P respectively. Each sample was run in duplicate and inter-assay variation averaged 1.8–5.1%. Assay sensitivities were 0.05 ng/mL (T), 2.7 pg/mL (E2), and 0.05 ng/mL (P).
