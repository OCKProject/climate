Negative values represent animals with body conditions below the line (fitted mean). To evaluate seasonal body condition, stress, and reproductive hormone concentrations, we grouped plasma hormone concentrations by population, sex, and/or month. We used linear mixed models (LMM) with animal ID as the repeated measure to test for differences within or between the groupings. When significant differences were present we performed post-hoc comparisons of groups using Tukey HSD. Model residuals were visually assessed for approximate normality and homoscedascity. All analyses were performed in JMP statistical software [
