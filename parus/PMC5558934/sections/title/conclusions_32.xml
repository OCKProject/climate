 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wild animal studies often feature a suite of challenges and complexity which may confound or limit the scope of interpretation. Yet, it is of great importance that longer-term, comparative studies take place and be published so that physiological details and correlated ecological consequences can be further understood, improving both 
  <span class="italic">in-situ</span> and 
  <span class="italic">ex-situ</span> species conservation management. This study was conducted at an extremely opportune time for this particular CR ectotherm as it was completed just prior to probable extirpation in the wild. Though we do not include complete captive husbandry protocols, the data presented here are intended for immediate application for improving captive conditions and species survival. We aimed to collect as much ecological, physiological, and behavioral data as possible from wild populations of a CR ectotherm to create a detailed picture of natural conditions, requirements, and baselines. With these combined data, we increase our power of inference, but also expose wide variation and plasticity. A limited view into this variation may narrow conclusions about the reproductive capacity of a population or the species. Individuals that are merely surviving but not thriving, (as appears to be the case in the U.S. captive population) will be the failure of breeding programs, reintroductions, and possibly species survival if not identified and rectified. Our results indicate that long-lived ectothermic species require certain social, behavioral, and environmental cues for successful reproduction. We show that detailed ecophysiological data should be used when creating and improving captive husbandry conditions for conservation breeding programs.
