 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over the three years of study, we collected 409 samples from 153 individuals that were usable for CORT analyses. Of those, 141 (61♂, 64♀, 16SA) were from wild 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">yniphora</span>, 212 (78♂, 87♀, 47SA) from the Madagascar captive population, and 56 (13♂, 27♀, 16SA) from the U.S. captive population. The median time to blood from first disturbance of the animals was 1.5 min (mean = 2.3 ± SE = 0. 27).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found no difference in overall CORT concentrations between the populations, months, or sexes (mean ♂ = 90.8 ± 55.4 ng/dL; ♀ = 144.6 ± 50.1 ng/dL; SA = 164.2 ± 48.1 ng/dL. We did note wide variation within the groups, however (

  <sub>2,9</sub> = 4.435, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.0457). Those same wild sub-adult values also had significantly higher CORT than either captive population of sub-adults in January (
