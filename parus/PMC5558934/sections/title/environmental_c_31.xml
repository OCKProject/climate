 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There were significant behavioral associations with every environmental variable we measured. Our findings suggest that animals seek out different conditions for varying activities and do so at differing times of the year. Most consistently, however, temperature, humidity, and cover appear to be the most important variables.</p>

In the present study, we found that wild females were able to find significantly warmer locations resting in vegetation in December than males (which were usually found resting in the open), and that correlated with a dip in CORT, E2, and P. Less difference was seen in the humidities females selected, and overall, the wild animals selected warmer temperatures than the captives. Parturition has been documented in this species both in the wild at one of our sample sites and in our Madagascar captive population from 1995–2000 [

Although our data from the wild population support those findings, the timing of nesting over the 15 years since that study appears to have shifted to earlier in the year, and during a time of year (November) when data is lacking completely in other studies [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Environmental variables should be carefully considered when ectotherms are to be moved for assurance colonies and breeding. The hemispheric differences in climate we note between the U.S. and Madagascar captives has had a dramatic effect on the animals, and those that are housed in the U.S. are still not yet in successful reproductive condition. Though similar to the Madagascar populations where a seasonal dip and peak in BCS can be noted in the male housed in the U.S., the timing of the changes were temporally shifted by about five months forward (e.g., July instead of December). The U.S.-housed male’s reproductive hormones are most extreme and opposite of those in the Madagascar populations, while the U.S. females’ appear to be completely disrupted. Each of the adult animals in that population was transferred to the U.S. at a different month and year. The lack of reproductive success may be that the animals’ internal reproductive timing has not yet adjusted to the climate of southern California, which is in opposing seasonality with Madagascar and southern hemisphere. Those individuals housed in captivity in Madagascar are near their native range and did not undergo a significant delay before successful reproduction began. Using the hormone profiles presented in the current paper, it appears that the U.S. captives may be undergoing shifts in reproductive timing concordant with environmental cues. It is apparent that seasonal reproductive cycles are not easily or instantly acclimatized to large seasonal shifts. It may be several years before those translocated animals synchronize their reproductive cycles.</p>
