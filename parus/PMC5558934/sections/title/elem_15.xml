 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Except where otherwise noted in the following analyses, we excluded the U.S. population because it includes only a single animal and associated risk of pseudoreplication. However, we include the U.S. population’s male in the figures for visual comparison and interpretation of trends.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found no significant difference in CORT concentrations among male populations (mean range = 74.6–169.0 ± 59.2–63.1 ng/dL) or overall across months (mean range = 80.0–194.9 ± 52.8–93.6ng/dL). However, we did find differences between the populations during December (

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182004.g005" href="#pone.0182004.g005">Fig 5</a>). This suggests that a few individuals from the Madagascar captive population account for the wide variation seen within that group. Further, captive males (for which matings were observed) which exhibited higher basal CORT levels were more often those which had sired nests than those males who were not attributed as sires.

The months that all males averaged the highest T were from September through November (802.6–985.1 ± 45.2–73.7ng/dL) while the lowest concentrations occurred in April and May (27.7–68.7 ± 60.4–94.8 ng/dL). When comparing just the two captive populations, we found that males housed in Madagascar had significantly lower T (86.5 ± 53.3 ng/dL) than the male in the U.S. population (884.2 ± 39.7 ng/dL;

The captive male of the U.S. population exhibited T concentrations which topped out the detection limit of the assay (1,200 ng/dL) in February and April through June. Six Madagascar captive male samples also topped out the T assay in September and November, while 22 wild male samples did in October, November, and into December. Among those Madagascar captive males for which matings were detected and sires of nests attributed, individuals which were seen to mate in a particular month had significantly lower T (9.1 ± 103.9 ng/dL) than the non-breeders (262.1 ± 45.7 ng/dL) at that time, yet had higher overall mean T during the sample years (186.8 ng/dL vs. 84.4 ng/dL;
