 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We collected 79 useable plasma samples from sub-adult 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">yniphora</span> within the various populations (16 wild, 47 Madagascar captive, and 16 U.S. captive representing eight, 42, and nine individuals, respectively) over the three years of sampling. Sub-adult 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">yniphora</span> were not targeted for analyses of female sex hormones in this study; therefore, we present limited E2 and P concentrations by month of collection for general reference only.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found no differences in hormone concentrations among the sub-adult 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">yniphora</span> in any of the three populations or between the months; therefore, we present the hormone concentrations in a single figure (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182004.g004" href="#pone.0182004.g004">Fig 4</a>). However, we did detect significant differences in both CORT and T between sub-adults and adult males from the wild population (
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>1,36</sub> = 5.466, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.0251 and 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>1,62</sub> = 4.070, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.0480, respectively). For all populations combined, the difference in T remained where adult males exhibited higher T (447.1 ng/dL, SE = 43.2) than sub-adults (
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>1,115</sub> = 23.509, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.0001). Plasma T in sub-adults averaged 2.8 ng/dL (SE = 1.3). Where there were enough adult female samples to compare (Madagascar captives), we found there to be no differences between adult female and sub-adult T, but there remained a difference between sub-adult and adult male T (
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>1,89</sub> = 6.913, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.0101). Twenty-two of the 34 sub-adult samples run for T had concentrations below the detection limit of the assay (&lt; 1.5 ng/dL). Sub-adult plasma CORT concentrations averaged 187.9 ng/dL (SE = 49.5). All samples run for E2 (n = 6) returned values below the detectable limit of the assay (&lt; 2.7 pg/mL), and the three samples run for P returned values of 0.00 ng/mL, 0.52 ng/mL, and 0.64 ng/mL.
