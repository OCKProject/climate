It is often a last resort when wild animal population numbers drop to below critical minimums for natural reproduction. However, critical ecophysiological information of wild counterparts may not be well documented or understood, leading to years of minimal breeding successes. We collected endocrine and associated ecological data on a critically endangered ectotherm concurrently in the wild and in captivity over several years. We tracked plasma concentrations of steroid stress and reproductive hormones, body condition, activity, and environmental parameters in three populations (one wild and two geographically distinct captive) of ploughshare tortoise (<italic>Astrochelys yniphora</italic>). Hormone profiles along with environmental and behavioral data are presented and compared. We show that animals have particular seasonal environmental requirements that can affect annual reproduction, captivity affects reproductive state, and sociality may be required at certain times of the year for breeding to be successful. Our data suggest that changes in climatic conditions experienced by individuals, either due to decades-long shifts or hemispheric differences when translocated from their native range, can stifle breeding success for several years while the animals physiologically acclimatize. We also found that captivity affects stress (plasma corticosterone) and body condition of adults and juveniles differently and seasonally. Our results indicate that phenotypic plasticity in reproduction and behavior is related to environmental cues in long-lived ectotherms, and detailed ecophysiological data should be used when establishing and improving captive husbandry conditions for conservation breeding programs. Further, considering the recent revelation of this tortoises&#x02019; possible extirpation from the wild, these data are critically opportune and may be key to the survival of this species.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Turtle Conservancy &#x00026; ASFF</institution></funding-source><award-id>64982</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1631-8964</contrib-id><name><surname>Currylow</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Turtle Conservation Fund &#x00026; Conservation International</institution></funding-source><award-id>62666, 0404, 0527, and 0570</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1631-8964</contrib-id><name><surname>Currylow</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000202</institution-id><institution>U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1631-8964</contrib-id><name><surname>Currylow</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004630</institution-id><institution>Mohammed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1631-8964</contrib-id><name><surname>Currylow</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution>Holohil Systems Ltd.</institution></funding-source><award-id>equipment donation</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1631-8964</contrib-id><name><surname>Currylow</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award006"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007142</institution-id><institution>Idea Wild</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>equipment donation</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1631-8964</contrib-id><name><surname>Currylow</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Turtle Conservancy and Andrew Sabin Family Foundation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.turtleconservancy.org/contact/sabin/">https://www.turtleconservancy.org/contact/sabin/</ext-link>; grant #64982), Turtle Conservation Fund and Conservation International (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.turtleconservationfund.org/grants/">http://www.turtleconservationfund.org/grants/</ext-link>; grant numbers 62666, 0404, 0527, 0570), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fws.gov/international/">https://www.fws.gov/international/</ext-link>; grant # EA-0205), Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.speciesconservation.org/grants/">http://www.speciesconservation.org/grants/</ext-link>), Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.durrell.org/wildlife/">https://www.durrell.org/wildlife/</ext-link>), and Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://madagascarpartnership.org/">https://madagascarpartnership.org/</ext-link>).

These risks are evaluated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which publishes conservation statuses in the IUCN Red List to highlight those species at higher risk (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/">http://www.iucnredlist.org</ext-link>). The IUCN Red List defines a taxon as Critically Endangered (CR) when data indicates that the species is facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild defined by a high percentage and recent population size reduction, a highly restricted geographic range, a very low adult population size estimate, or a high probability of extinction in the wild within 10 years. This designation is superseded by Extinct in the Wild (EW) if extensive surveys fail to record any animal of a species within its expected range or habitat. It may be only a few combined factors that cause a CR species to become EW; the risk of extinction increases and the recovery efforts become more challenging if we lack natural ecological information [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Conservation strategies for CR wildlife involves the captive breeding of wild-caught individuals for enhancing the captive gene pool and repatriation to native habitats, in what have come to be known as assurance colonies. As with all conservation management plans, the captive breeding approach is accompanied by a variety of challenges [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Successful relocation, including to captivity, is dependent upon knowledge of biological constraints (e.g., natural environmental and habitat requirements) as well as basic ecology and health parameters [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; information that is often unavailable in emergency recovery situations [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition, animals can become stressed in captivity, making reproduction physiologically impossible [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. There are successes, however; animal populations reduced to functionally extinct numbers have been taken from the wild into captivity and, over time, brought into reproductive condition such as the California condor and black-footed ferret. Those successes came through multiple studies on reproduction, mirroring wild conditions, social behavior, and more [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The captive breeding and eventual repatriation of these individuals and their offspring to native habitats was arguably the single most important step for the survival of the species [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Creating and maintaining captive husbandry conditions that promote natural behaviors, health, and reproductively viable individuals is challenging, particularly when little ecological information exists for rare/elusive taxa. These challenges are confounded by the protracted survival probability curve in long-lived species [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This is pertinent with CR species in particular, as effective captive breeding colonies may one day act as source populations for extirpated wild ones (i.e., assurance colonies). Understanding typical seasonal environmental and physiological patterns in natural populations (i.e., baseline) should be the standard to which we compare captive populations. We can use baseline variation of body conditions (natural seasonal fluctuation in size and weight) and temporal changes of hormone concentrations, activity, and environmental fluctuations recorded in wild populations to evaluate health of captive populations because these factors relate to aspects of stress and reproduction (e.g., immune function, energy budgets, behavior, etc.; [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Stress is a physiological response to a perceived threat. It can greatly affect an animal&#x02019;s ability to cope with changes in environment. Though adaptive in the short term, the stress response can disrupt normal, seasonal processes such as reproduction [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182004.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. When a perceived stressor occurs, the animal&#x02019;s hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is stimulated and begins to produce a cascade of hormones (catecholamines and glucocorticoids), triggering immediate behavioral and physiological responses intended to promote survival of the organism [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182004.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. When a stressor persists over longer periods of time (chronic stress), the HPA continues producing the glucocorticoid stress hormone, which can have far-reaching deleterious effects on diel and seasonal functions such as immune response and reproduction [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Though the primary glucocorticoid stress hormone (CORT) in most mammals and fish is cortisol, it is corticosterone in reptiles and birds [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The production of CORT can help the animal divert physiological resources from non-vital functions to those which will aid in short-term survival ([<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. An increase in the production of CORT elevates blood glucose concentrations and constrains the production on gonadal steroid secretions, growth, and immune system function as well as causes altered behaviors [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182004.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182004.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Continued production of CORT above baseline values (baseline = unstressed concentrations; [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] throughout a season and/or year(s) (i.e., chronic stress) may therefore prevent an animal from entering a reproductive state. For wild animals, particularly for those CR species under threat of extinction, the inability to reproduce in any given year might be the difference between population recovery and extirpation.</p><p>Animals may perceive various types of stressors depending on their surroundings and situation. In the wild, stressors may be in the form of environmental perturbations (e.g., extreme temperatures, drought, strong storms, etc.), human-wildlife conflict (e.g., encroaching agriculture, habitat harvesting, grazing, etc.), inter- and intraspecific interaction (e.g., invasive species or competition), or simply a lack of resources (e.g., cover, forage, mates, etc.). Altered activity patterns can be exhibited by stressed individuals, such as increased wandering behaviors in search of forage or mates, causing them to divert physiological resources from functions such as reproduction to survival [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In captivity, activity and physiology may be altered due to stressors such as insufficient space, inadequate nutrition, limited environmental enrichment, continual human perturbation, etc. [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Through the investigation of stress and reproductive hormones, we can determine the reproductive state of individuals and interpret seasonal hormone profiles to characterize populations.</p><p>Reproductive rates and patterns are used as indicators of biological fitness [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and can be tracked or monitored physically and hormonally. Stress and reproductive state are exhibited by an animal through physical signs such as altered body condition and/or activity patterns [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Clinically healthy and reproducing animals are generally described as being in better body condition (larger and heavier) and exhibiting normal activity (movement patterns and behaviors; [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]). Defining and measuring clear categories of these indicators as well as associated environmental parameters in wild animal populations helps define baseline physical and ecological data of a particular species. Comparisons of endocrine hormone profiles along with environmental and behavioral data from wild populations will provide baseline values on a suite of ecophysiological parameters required for successful management.</p><p>Of particular concern are CR reptiles because an ectotherm&#x02019;s behavior and physiology are obligatorily tied to environmental conditions; even relatively minor environmental perturbations could have ongoing effects [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. These perturbations may cause years of altered behavior and health, making husbandry particularly difficult with these taxa. Temperature has been shown to be the most important cue for reproduction in reptiles [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], so fluctuations in environmental temperatures can disrupt reproduction.

In the present study, animals in the wild population exhibited BCSs nearest to zero, while both captive populations differed more widely. Captive adults generally had more positive BCSs than those in the wild; however, sub-adults showed the opposite trend. In captivity, animals are usually allowed free access to perpetual food and water resources, and adults are housed in less crowded enclosures, separated from sub-adults. It is possible that interspecific competition and boldness/shyness of individuals among the sub-adults in more crowded enclosures account for the lower BCSs and consistent stress within that group (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182004.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]). In a study on great tits (<italic>Parus major</italic>), animals which exhibited shyness behaviors were also those same animals which exhibited higher basal CORT concentrations along with more extreme stress responses [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. A study on curve-billed thrashers (<italic>Toxostoma curvirostre</italic>) showed that animals exhibited an increase in basal CORT values when food-restricted in captivity [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. In the present study, an additional factor should be considered: sub-adults in the Madagascar captive population are generally fed native forage species; however, there are no studies on what sub-adults consume in the wild and how it may differ from adults and by season. In many chelonian species, sub-adults and adults not only inhabit differing habitats, but their diets are composed of different ratios or of entirely different species/items [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Therefore, the BCS differences we see could involve factors for which we have not investigated here, and further research should be done.</p><p>Though high CORT is often seen in wild-caught animals in captivity, captive-bred animals generally do better, exhibiting little to no chronic stress or attenuated stress responses [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182004.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182004.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Consistent with those studies, we found that the highest CORT concentrations were exhibited by wild sub-adults. In the wild, elevated CORT may be adaptive because it is associated with predator avoidance behaviors and cautious animal personality types in other species [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182004.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182004.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], including the most closely related sister taxa to <italic>A</italic>. <italic>yniphora</italic>, <italic>A</italic>. <italic>radiata</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Although variability might still be harbored in the populations, captive sub-adults would not be exposed to such stressors and would be less likely to undergo such a response. These naiveties can be detrimental to survival [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. In a study on multiple parrot species, researchers found that most captive-bred birds, but only a small percentage of wild birds, were either recaptured or preyed on shortly after escape from enclosures [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>].</p><p>Elevated CORT is associated with predator avoidance behaviors and cautious animal personality types, and sub-adults in captivity generally do not exhibit a strong stress response or elevated basal CORT (as we found in the current study). In fact, individuals exhibiting aggressive behaviors or which are otherwise obviously stressed by captivity are generally bred out or avoided in captive breeding programs. This may be detrimental to individual survival because when the captive-bred animals are released into the wild they are unable to recognize threats and respond appropriately [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182004.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182004.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. As a supporting anecdote, we visited captive-bred <italic>A</italic>. <italic>yniphora</italic> that were repatriated to a previously depleted site within the natural range [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182004.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. When those animals are encountered in the wild, they readily approach humans, do not turn away or attempt to retreat when handled, and extend their limbs and neck if stroked or scratched (ATFC and ARM, pers. obs.). Though bold individuals may be avoided or bred out in captivity, the genetic variation they represent may be important for the long-term survival of a species which needs to adapt to changing habitats, threats, and climate. Variability provides the population an opportunity to remain reproductively viable amid stochastic events and face novel situations. Maintaining variability will also help avoid inbreeding depression in other ways, such as in preserving healthy immune system functions. Understanding and mediating stressors are therefore an important part of conservation management.</p><p>Captivity has been shown to elicit a chronic stress response in many wild-caught animal species [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182004.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182004.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182004.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]; but see [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]). Therefore, as might be expected, adult CORT concentrations were generally higher in captive populations than the wild, yet were not consistent. Only the captive males housed within the native country were higher, while the single male in the U.S. was lowest. The opposite trend was found in females, but were within range of the wild animals. The distinct values found in the U.S. population were probably due to specific circumstances associated with those individuals and are described by sex separately below.</p><sec id="sec017"><title>Males</title><p>The U.S. population&#x02019;s adult male scored the highest positive BCSs, but males from both the Madagascar populations showed mean negative BCSs. Over time, both the Madagascar populations&#x02019; males exhibited similar BCS trends to one another, peaking mid-dry-season in July, which is likely associated with growth of testicular tissue (spermiogenesis and/or spermiation) as a surge in T occurs at that time. In many herpetofauna, reproductive timing in males is altogether or partially offset from mating season [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182004.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>], and this appears to be true in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>yniphora</italic> as well. Courtship and mating are seasonal in ploughshares, and generally occurs from October through December at the onset of the region&#x02019;s wet season. Body condition scores dipped to the lowest values during the early wet season, when male-male competition for mates would be peaking. It has been suggested that males need to engage in combat in order to trigger their sexual interest in females [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], and the combat itself will cause males to take in fewer food and water resources, altering BCSs. Males housed in the Madagascar captive population are regularly placed in shared enclosures, often specifically for these combat rituals, which may also help explain why they expressed BCSs and T concentrations more similar to wild individuals. Because the Madagascar captive population is generally fed native plant material, there may be a nutritional component to the similarity, as well as environmental, behavioral, and physiological components.</p><p>In the wild population, males exhibit two CORT peaks which align with the time of ovulation in females, suggesting that competition for (and possibly defense of) mates is stressful for males. Monthly CORT in captive males was much more variable, and may be due to the changing of pairings and enclosures. However, we found that captive males which sired nests had overall higher basal CORT and T concentrations, suggesting that male-male competition is both stressful and requires aggression/dominance throughout the year. Similarly, in the eastern black rhinoceros (<italic>Diceros bicornis michaeli</italic>), dominant males exhibited significantly higher T and became sires by monopolizing more matings than non-sires [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Although male sires in the current study had higher overall mean T, they exhibited significantly lower T during the months for which they sired. It logically follows that this strategy would be adaptive. For species which competition determines mating rights, aggressive males with higher T would generally be more successful in combat, but those T-linked aggressive behaviors could attenuate successful mating if directed at mates themselves. Dominant male <italic>A</italic>. <italic>yniphora</italic> may therefore undergo a reduction in T concentrations after combat to avoid misdirecting overly aggressive behaviors (e.g., causing harm or refusal by mates) and consequently, for courtship to take place.</p><p>Nearly half of all the T samples collected from the U.S. captive male <italic>A</italic>. <italic>yniphora</italic> were extremely high for much of the year (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182004.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The U.S. male is not housed with other adult males and without the need to compete for access to females. His CORT concentrations remain low throughout the year while his T concentrations remain high throughout courtship, and aggression toward the females was noted. Although the females to which the U.S. male has access nested multiple times during this study, no fertilized eggs have been detected and sperm were not present in two eggs which were sacrificed to inspect them for the presence of sperm [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. This single example is concordant with the data presented above, suggesting that male <italic>A</italic>. <italic>yniphora</italic> may need to reduce T concentrations (through increasing CORT or otherwise) to successfully reproduce. Yet, there is still debate on what the variation in T signals with regard to an individual&#x02019;s biology, and investigations into the relative importance and extrinsic influences that contribute to variation need be conducted to better interpret variation in T [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Females</title><p>Female ploughshares produce 2&#x02013;5 eggs per clutch, and have been seen to clutch multiply in both captivity and in the wild [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. They have been reported to produce an average of 1.5&#x02013;6.4 clutches depending on individual and location, but individuals in captivity produce both more clutches and more eggs per clutch than their wild counterparts as well as extend their nesting period into later months [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Increases in E2 are associated with vitellogenesis and ovulation, while P peaks post-ovulation [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. These peaks may be within days of each other, and our monthly sampling regime was not frequent enough to detect these changes in individuals. On the population-level, however, it is general practice to describe seasonal cycles as monthly trends in reproductive hormones, usually only over the months known for reproductive activity [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182004.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182004.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182004.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. We were able to collect data for every month of the year (though, not for every population), and we do see distinct cycle trends among population in female BCS, CORT, E2, and P on an annual basis.</p><p>Female chelonians exhibit increased weights at the time when follicular development/vitellogenesis occurs. Concordantly, mean BCSs in adult females from all three populations were found to be positive, and changes in BCS over time appear to reflect nesting events. Both captive populations exhibited higher BCSs in adult females than the wild; however, monthly trends were less evident than in wild females. It has been shown that captive female <italic>A</italic>. <italic>yniphora</italic> housed in Madagascar lay more clutches than wild <italic>A</italic>. <italic>yniphora</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] which may be due to access to mates stimulating ovarian development [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Therefore, the difference in captive females&#x02019; BCSs were probably not only due to restricted vagility alongside constant access to food and water resources, but probably also due to increased clutches per year. The idea that females may need to be paired with males for ovulation to occur suggests that: 1) this species may not have the capacity for sperm storage as is seen in many other chelonians and 2) the declining population density could directly affect reproductive output, exacerbating declines (as was seen in the passenger pigeon). For chelonian species where both vagility and density are low, the ability to store viable sperm from one season to the next is an incredible adaptation maintaining species survival. Unfortunately for the ploughshare, they may not have this ability yet, but it should be further investigated.</p><p>In the current study, general monthly hormone trends of female <italic>A</italic>. <italic>yniphora</italic> displayed synchronous upticks in CORT, E2, and P which were followed by decreases in BCSs. For the captive populations, these trends often lined up with observations of nesting. Generally, females exhibited two peaks in E2 and P. For wild females, E2 and P exhibited one smaller peak two months prior to a larger peak, suggesting that two clutches may be produced annually in the wild which is concordant with the study on nesting behavior by [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The two hormone peaks we note in females align with the two CORT peaks in wild males, and we also see the strongest uptick in female CORT along with those second peaks. Higher basal CORT concentrations have been associated with mating other species; both the male and female degu (<italic>Octodon degus</italic>) exhibit higher CORT in captivity and in the wild [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. It begs the question as to whether <italic>A</italic>. <italic>yniphora</italic> are encountering or seeking out each other more often during those peak times. Further, female <italic>A</italic>. <italic>yniphora</italic> may not ovulate without having been paired with a male during the previous mating season, despite having preovulatory follicles [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p><p>We found that CORT was highest in females from the U.S. captive population, and consistently lowest in the Madagascar captive population. It is likely that these trends are directly related to their particular captive conditions. Females from the Madagascar captive population are separated from males in their group enclosures during all times except for matings. The two females in the U.S. population are relatively new imports to the facility and are offered little retreat from the males&#x02019; advances with which they are regularly housed. Those U.S. females&#x02019; E2 and P appear completely disrupted without clear peaks. Female reproductive cycles may become disrupted for a variety of reasons, and captivity may delay the onset on ovulation by months or years. Though some species have the capacity to attenuate reproduction in any given year, the underlying physiological regulation of this ability is not well understood [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. It is probable that the females&#x02019; cycles are affected by the transfer into the northern hemisphere and are not yet acclimatized to the change. Though there are possible acclimation and persistent courtship stressors, the females are well fed and undergoing periods of follicular development [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] and nesting events. We further discuss the acclimation issues in the Environmental Considerations section below.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Age-class challenges</title><p>One of the challenges of captive breeding long-lived, slowly maturing species with ambiguous phenotypic sex differences is planning effective releases which will offer optimal sex ratios. Ploughshares reach sexual maturity at approximately 300 mm carapace length, and males can be distinguished from females using secondary sexual characteristics at about 350 mm carapace length [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Size and age are generally correlated in chelonians, and those animals from 300&#x02013;350 mm carapace length are estimated to be approximately 20&#x02013;25 years old. If the sex of an animal is unknown for 15&#x02013;25 years, as in this and many other chelonian species, a conservation strategy may be severely impaired or carried out without enough information to be successful. This has been an ongoing challenge for chelonian conservation management plans in general [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182004.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. One option for premature sexing of chelonians is the investigation of circulating hormone concentrations. It has been suggested that T concentrations may be used a biomarker to distinguish between the sexes in sub-adult chelonians and has been used successfully in <italic>Caretta caretta</italic> (loggerhead sea turtles) and <italic>Gopherus agassizii</italic> (desert tortoises; [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]).</p><p>In the present study, wild sub-adults could be distinguished from wild males via higher CORT and lower T. The trend of lower T than adult males is carried over among all the study populations. Plasma T concentrations were no different in sub-adults than females, but were significantly different than adult males. This suggests that sub-adult individuals exhibiting high T concentrations, especially during peak T months for adult males, could be assigned as male. In this species, it appears as though any T detection higher than 20 ng/mL from a sub-adult during the months October&#x02013;November housed in Madagascar, or one housed in the U.S. during April&#x02013;May, could be assigned as male relatively confidently; however, we caution that more directed investigations be done to hone the method. Additionally, if female hormones are to be investigated for this purpose, we suggest using E2 over P as the single male sample we ran for both hormones did exhibit detectable P, but not E2.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Environmental considerations</title><p>There were significant behavioral associations with every environmental variable we measured. Our findings suggest that animals seek out different conditions for varying activities and do so at differing times of the year. Most consistently, however, temperature, humidity, and cover appear to be the most important variables.</p><p>Temperature appears to regulate the production on estrogens in chelonians [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182004.ref106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182004.ref107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. In the present study, we found that wild females were able to find significantly warmer locations resting in vegetation in December than males (which were usually found resting in the open), and that correlated with a dip in CORT, E2, and P. Less difference was seen in the humidities females selected, and overall, the wild animals selected warmer temperatures than the captives. Parturition has been documented in this species both in the wild at one of our sample sites and in our Madagascar captive population from 1995&#x02013;2000 [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. According to [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] found <italic>A</italic>. <italic>yniphora</italic> nested multiply, averaging 2.1 clutches per animal per year in the wild and 5.4 clutches per animal per year in captivity. Although our data from the wild population support those findings, the timing of nesting over the 15 years since that study appears to have shifted to earlier in the year, and during a time of year (November) when data is lacking completely in other studies [<xref rid="pone.0182004.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182004.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182004.ref108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. If reproduction in this species is indeed tied to environmental cues, this apparent shift in reproductive timing of this species could be attributed to climate change.</p><p>Environmental variables should be carefully considered when ectotherms are to be moved for assurance colonies and breeding. The hemispheric differences in climate we note between the U.S. and Madagascar captives has had a dramatic effect on the animals, and those that are housed in the U.S. are still not yet in successful reproductive condition. Though similar to the Madagascar populations where a seasonal dip and peak in BCS can be noted in the male housed in the U.S., the timing of the changes were temporally shifted by about five months forward (e.g., July instead of December). The U.S.-housed male&#x02019;s reproductive hormones are most extreme and opposite of those in the Madagascar populations, while the U.S. females&#x02019; appear to be completely disrupted. Each of the adult animals in that population was transferred to the U.S. at a different month and year. The lack of reproductive success may be that the animals&#x02019; internal reproductive timing has not yet adjusted to the climate of southern California, which is in opposing seasonality with Madagascar and southern hemisphere. Those individuals housed in captivity in Madagascar are near their native range and did not undergo a significant delay before successful reproduction began. Using the hormone profiles presented in the current paper, it appears that the U.S. captives may be undergoing shifts in reproductive timing concordant with environmental cues. It is apparent that seasonal reproductive cycles are not easily or instantly acclimatized to large seasonal shifts. It may be several years before those translocated animals synchronize their reproductive cycles.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec021"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Wild animal studies often feature a suite of challenges and complexity which may confound or limit the scope of interpretation. Yet, it is of great importance that longer-term, comparative studies take place and be published so that physiological details and correlated ecological consequences can be further understood, improving both <italic>in-situ</italic> and <italic>ex-situ</italic> species conservation management. This study was conducted at an extremely opportune time for this particular CR ectotherm as it was completed just prior to probable extirpation in the wild. Though we do not include complete captive husbandry protocols, the data presented here are intended for immediate application for improving captive conditions and species survival. We aimed to collect as much ecological, physiological, and behavioral data as possible from wild populations of a CR ectotherm to create a detailed picture of natural conditions, requirements, and baselines. With these combined data, we increase our power of inference, but also expose wide variation and plasticity. A limited view into this variation may narrow conclusions about the reproductive capacity of a population or the species. Individuals that are merely surviving but not thriving, (as appears to be the case in the U.S. captive population) will be the failure of breeding programs, reintroductions, and possibly species survival if not identified and rectified. Our results indicate that long-lived ectothermic species require certain social, behavioral, and environmental cues for successful reproduction. We show that detailed ecophysiological data should be used when creating and improving captive husbandry conditions for conservation breeding programs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0182004.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Raw dataset.</title><p>All data underlying the findings described in this manuscript.
