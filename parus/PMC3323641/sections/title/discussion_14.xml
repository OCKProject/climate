  <span class="italic">Clock</span> genes and the molecular and genetic functioning of circadian oscillators, there are relatively few studies of the phenotypic consequences of variation at genes associated with circadian clocks in the wild, both in terms of phenology and viability

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present study contributes to filling this gap of knowledge, and shows that in a barn swallow population 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene diversity is correlated to detectable variation in breeding phenology of females. This statistically significant evidence emerged despite small frequency of the phenologically deviant, late breeding genotype and the fact that considerable environmental variation is generated in bird breeding dates by meteorological and climatic conditions 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-McCleery1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-McCleery1">[50]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Saino5" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Saino5">[52]</a>. A major implication of this finding is that negative fecundity selection operates via reduced number of clutches per breeding season. This effect is additive to the negative consequences of hatching date on offspring longevity (see below).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Diversity at the 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> poly Q region has been hypothesized to result from balancing selection caused by spatio-temporal ecological heterogeneity 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Johnsen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Johnsen1">[31]</a>. Clinal variation in poly Q allele length may be stabilized by adaptation to local patterns of circannual variation in photoperiod, whereby different alleles allow to adaptively ‘interpret’ and accommodate rates of change in photoperiod, which depend on latitude 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Johnsen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Johnsen1">[31]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Liedvogel1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Liedvogel1">[32]</a>. Length of poly Q alleles has been shown to increase with latitude in the blue tit and also in the Chinook salmon 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-OMalley2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-OMalley2">[30]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Johnsen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Johnsen1">[31]</a>, and this cline is possibly maintained by selection for locally optimal timing of breeding or spawning. Reciprocally, different 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> genotypes may produce different phenology when exposed to the same local photoperiod, owing to a different interpretation of the same light-dark cycle. The core finding of our study, that Q
  <sub>7</sub>/Q
  <sub>8</sub> females heterozygous for the longer alleles delayed breeding relative to Q
  <sub>7</sub>/Q
  <sub>7</sub> homozygotes, is thus consistent with the hypothesis of a direct involvement of 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> in breeding phenological variation. Three pieces of evidence specifically corroborate this interpretation. First, the association between allele length and breeding date is in the same direction as reported for blue tits 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Liedvogel1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Liedvogel1">[32]</a>. Second, the sign of the association is consistent with the observed latitudinal increase in 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> allele length in other species 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Johnsen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Johnsen1">[31]</a>, whose migration/breeding dates also increase with latitude 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Cramp1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Cramp1">[42]</a>. Finally, the association was observed among females but not males, consistent with the expectation that any genetic control of breeding date should be more easily uncovered in females 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Caro1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Caro1">[53]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The previous studies of bird breeding phenology in relation to 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> diversity concerned two resident populations of blue or great tits 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Liedvogel1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Liedvogel1">[32]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Liedvogel2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Liedvogel2">[33]</a> and five species of swallows of the genus 
  <span class="italic">Tachycineta</span>
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Dor2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Dor2">[35]</a> with diverse migratory habits, and provided contrasting results over the association between breeding date and 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span>. A covariation was detected in resident blue tits 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Liedvogel1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Liedvogel1">[32]</a> but not e.g. in an analysis of migratory 
  <span class="italic">Tachycineta bicolor</span> swallows where the effects of age on breeding date could be controlled for 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Dor2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Dor2">[35]</a>. All European barn swallow breeding populations are migratory 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Mller3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Mller3">[41]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Cramp1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Cramp1">[42]</a>. Breeding date in our study population as well as in other European populations may be constrained by arrival date, as there is a very strong, positive association between these variables within age-classes, and some individuals arrive after early breeding ones have already started laying. In a sample of yearlings for which arrival date could be estimated accurately, the correlation coefficient was as high as 0.60 (n  =  128, P &lt; 0.0001; regression coefficient  =  0.460 (0.054 s.e.)) 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Mller3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Mller3">[41]</a>. Hence, our results are compatible with the interpretation that 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> controls the photoperiodic responses that govern the course of spring migration from Africa, thereby affecting breeding phenology. A potential role of 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> in controlling migration has been advocated for Pacific salmon and also suggested to produce latitudinal variation in migratoriness of tit populations 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-OMalley2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-OMalley2">[30]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Johnsen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Johnsen1">[31]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-OMalley3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-OMalley3">[54]</a>. We have no accurate information on arrival dates of most of the swallows in our breeding population because obtaining estimates of arrival date is extremely time-consuming. However, the regression coefficient of breeding on arrival date, which was smaller than 1 (see above), indicates that the spread in arrival dates across genotypes may be even larger than that of breeding dates 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Teplitsky1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Teplitsky1">[55]</a>. Admittedly, this argument is indirect and not conclusive, as it is possible that Q
  <sub>7</sub>/Q
  <sub>8</sub> females arrived at the same time as Q
  <sub>7</sub>/Q
  <sub>7</sub> ones, and then postponed breeding.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The difference in breeding phenology between Q
  <sub>7</sub>/Q
  <sub>7</sub> and Q
  <sub>7</sub>/Q
  <sub>8</sub> yearling females was found despite the small number of Q
  <sub>7</sub>/Q
  <sub>8</sub> heterozygotes that emerged from an otherwise large sample. On the other hand, the test comparing mean breeding dates of Q
  <sub>6</sub>/Q
  <sub>7</sub> and Q
  <sub>7</sub>/Q
  <sub>7</sub> was also based on a small sample of Q
  <sub>6</sub>/Q
  <sub>7</sub> females. We therefore refrain from drawing conclusions from the non-significant result of the latter test. Even more vulnerable to type II statistical error was the comparison between breeding dates of Q
  <sub>6</sub>/Q
  <sub>7</sub> and Q
  <sub>7</sub>/Q
  <sub>8</sub> yearling females, that was based on 6 data points per genotype. In addition, extreme rarity of Q
  <sub>7</sub>/Q
  <sub>8</sub> older females ( =  1 out of 163 for which breeding date was known) prevented any analysis of the effect of this genotype on breeding date among older females, which breed earlier than yearlings. It should also be noted that genotype-by-environment interactions could have resulted in differential patterns of variation in the effect of 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> genotype on breeding date between years (and thus cohorts) due to, for example, inter-annual variation in ecological conditions at the breeding grounds. Such potential effects could not be tested here explicitly because of low levels of polymorphism at 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Indeed, a striking feature of the population we studied is its small genetic diversity at 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span>. The most frequent allele (Q
  <sub>7</sub>) accounted for 96.6% of the total allelic diversity, only 4 different alleles were observed, and heterozygosity was consequently very low. These findings are consistent with those recently reported in a study of barn swallows from five distant geographical populations 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Dor1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Dor1">[34]</a>. In that study, Q
  <sub>7</sub> was found to account for 93.9% or more of the alleles in all populations. Contrary to the present study, no Q
  <sub>5</sub> was detected, although this could be due to either differences in sampling effort, to geographic variation in allele frequencies, or both. The other reports of 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> genetic diversity published to date for wild bird populations have disclosed a bewildering difference even among closely related species or cospecific populations 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Johnsen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Johnsen1">[31]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Liedvogel2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Liedvogel2">[33]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Dor2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Dor2">[35]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Mller2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Mller2">[36]</a>. For example, even syntopic blue and great tits hugely differed in allele diversity and heterozygosity, with blue tits showing larger diversity 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Johnsen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Johnsen1">[31]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Liedvogel2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Liedvogel2">[33]</a>. The genetic profile of the population we studied resembles that of a great tit population, which was dominated by a single allele with a frequency of 95.7% 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Liedvogel2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Liedvogel2">[33]</a>. Moreover, 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> polymorphism was found to considerably vary among five species of swallows of the genus 
  <span class="italic">Tachycineta</span>, although there was no hint that genetic diversity was related to latitude 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Dor2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Dor2">[35]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Important functional roles of 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> have been advocated for diverse organisms and are also suggested by its high level of phylogenetic conservation 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Darlington1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Darlington1">[14]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Hall1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Hall1">[17]</a>. Because breeding date has been consistently shown to be under selection in birds 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Sheldon1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Sheldon1">[39]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Mller3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Mller3">[41]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Charmantier1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Charmantier1">[56]</a>, reduced allelic diversity and the evidence of breeding delay associated with one of the rare alleles argue for a role of selection. Indeed, we gathered both direct and indirect evidence suggestive of selection against Q
  <sub>7</sub>/Q
  <sub>8</sub>. First, genotype frequencies varied between age classes, with a marked decrease in the frequency of Q
  <sub>7</sub>/Q
  <sub>8</sub> among two- or more years old individuals compared to yearlings, suggesting that the 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> genotype that is associated with late breeding in females, also caused reduced viability. Second, by delaying breeding by ca. 13 days ( =  
  <span class="italic">a</span>), Q
  <sub>7</sub>/Q
  <sub>8</sub> females suffer reduced seasonal breeding success. In our study population, yearling females may lay one or two clutches per season. However, the frequency of second clutches declines with date of laying of the first clutch, by ca. 0.012 ( =  
  <span class="italic">b</span>) per day. Combining the information on frequency of second clutches among yearling females (
  <span class="italic">c</span>  =  0.45–0.56), mean fecundity in first (
  <span class="italic">d</span>  =  4.5 eggs) or second (
  <span class="italic">e</span>  =  3.7) clutches, and assuming negligible change in clutch size over a 13 days period, constancy of inter-clutch interval, and neglecting rare third clutches, Q
  <sub>7</sub>/Q
  <sub>8</sub> females are expected to suffer a 4–5% ( =  {(
  <span class="italic">d</span> + (
  <span class="italic">c</span> * 
  <span class="italic">e</span>) – (
  <span class="italic">a</span> * 
  <span class="italic">b</span> * c *
  <span class="italic">e</span>))/(
  <span class="italic">d</span> + (
  <span class="italic">c</span> * 
  <span class="italic">e</span>))} * 100) reduction in annual fecundity. However, variation of breeding date associated with age was larger than that among yearling females’ 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> genotypes (see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035140-g001" href="#pone-0035140-g001">Fig. 1</a>), implying that variance in breeding success due to age effects largely exceeds that due to 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> genotype effects. Moreover, in our study population there is a strong negative effect of hatching date on longevity after sexual maturity (i.e. after 1 year of age) 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Saino6" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Saino6">[57]</a>, such that an increase in breeding date by 13 days causes reduction in longevity by ca. 0.2 years. Hence, delayed breeding results in a fitness cost mediated by offspring longevity in addition to that via seasonal fecundity.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An open question remains as to which mechanisms generate a reduction in the frequency of Q
  <sub>7</sub>/Q
  <sub>8</sub> with age. As far as females are concerned, it can be speculated that delayed breeding may entail a survival cost, if reproductive investment is larger for individuals that breed late, when ecological conditions are less favourable 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Ambrosini2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Ambrosini2">[58]</a>. Moreover, females that breed earlier have longer inter-clutch interval and enjoy higher survival 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Mller4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Mller4">[59]</a>. If Q
  <sub>7</sub>/Q
  <sub>8</sub> also dictates different migration schedules, an additional possibility is that survival costs arise during migration. At present, the causes of any larger mortality of Q
  <sub>7</sub>/Q
  <sub>8</sub> males are obscure. However, the patterns of reduction in frequency of Q
  <sub>7</sub>/Q
  <sub>8</sub> with age were similar in either sex.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An additional question is what maintains allele polymorphism and particularly Q
  <sub>8</sub> alleles in the population, even in the face of apparently negative viability and fecundity selection against Q
  <sub>7</sub>/Q
  <sub>8</sub>. The possibility that temporal variation in selection may balance gene frequencies cannot be ruled out. In particular years, severely adverse weather conditions at the time when first clutches are normally laid by yearling females may set a selective advantage for late breeding birds. Alternatively, gene flow may maintain Q
  <sub>8</sub>, though at low frequency. While breeding dispersal of barn swallows is very small, mean natal dispersal is in the order of kilometers 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Turner1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Turner1">[43]</a>. However, variance is large, with some yearlings being recruited hundreds of kilometers away from their natal site 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Turner1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Turner1">[43]</a>. In addition, natal dispersal may be under-estimated because of spatial heterogeneity in sampling effort. If latitudinal variation in optimal timing of breeding maintains 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> polymorphism across European populations, low frequencies of Q
  <sub>8</sub> may be caused by immigration of yearlings from populations breeding at higher latitudes, although lack of among-populations variation in 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> polymorphism at coarse inter-continental scale may argue against this hypothesis 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Dor1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Dor1">[34]</a>. Finally, Q
  <sub>8</sub> alleles could be maintained at low frequency in the population through mutation of the most common allele.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Selection on 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> and low levels of polymorphisms have a bearing for the interpretation of the mechanisms that mediate dramatic negative population trends in this species and also to predict its evolutionary fate. The barn swallow is among the farmland birds that have suffered the largest recent decline, which in our study area has been of 8.4% per year over 10 years 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-BirdLife1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-BirdLife1">[60]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Ambrosini3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Ambrosini3">[61]</a>. The decline of barn swallows may partly be attributed to changes in agricultural/farming practices in their breeding quarters or in ecological changes in staging and wintering areas, although conclusive evidence is still missing 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Ambrosini3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Ambrosini3">[61]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Ambrosini4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Ambrosini4">[63]</a>. However, the decline of bird breeding populations can also be attributed to their inability to keep track of the consequences of climate change on timing of spring phenological events by advancing their breeding dates 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Mller1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Mller1">[6]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Mller6" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Mller6">[64]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Saino7" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Saino7">[65]</a>. Low genetic polymorphism at 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> may thus entail small potential for adaptive evolutionary response by locally adapted breeding populations under climate change. On the other hand, it is also entirely possible that low polymorphism at 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> genes itself is the product of adaptation of the barn swallow population we studied to current climate change.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, this is the second study providing evidence for an association between 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> genotype and timing of breeding in any wild bird population, and the first concerning a long-distance migrant. Because breeding date is strongly positively correlated with date of arrival from migration, the link between 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> and breeding phenology may be mediated by an effect of 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> on migration. The increase in breeding date with the number of poly Q repeats is consistent with previous observations of a latitudinal increase in frequency of long alleles in two other vertebrate species, because breeding date increases with latitude. Low levels of polymorphism in 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span>, combined with age-related variation in frequency of 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> genotypes and with the negative effect of late breeding on annual fecundity and progeny longevity suggest ongoing selection on 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> in the population we studied.
