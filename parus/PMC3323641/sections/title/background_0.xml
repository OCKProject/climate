 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In diverse taxa, photoperiodic responses that cause seasonal physiological and behavioural shifts are controlled by genes, including the vertebrate 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> orthologues, that encode for circadian oscillator mechanisms. While the genetic network behind circadian rhythms is well described, relatively few reports exist of the phenological consequences of and selection on 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> genes in the wild. Here, we investigated variation in breeding phenology in relation to 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> genetic diversity in a long-distance migratory bird, the barn swallow (
  <span class="italic">Hirundo rustica</span>).
