 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a sample of 922 adult barn swallows from a single population breeding in Italy we found one very common (Q
  <sub>7</sub>) and three rare (Q
  <sub>5</sub>, Q
  <sub>6</sub>, Q
  <sub>8</sub>) length variants of a functionally significant polyglutamine repeat. Rare (2.9%) Q
  <sub>7</sub>/Q
  <sub>8</sub> heterozygous females, but not males, bred significantly later than common (91.5%) Q
  <sub>7</sub>/Q
  <sub>7</sub> females, consistent with the expectation that ‘long’ alleles cause late breeding, as observed in a resident population of another bird species. Because breeding date depends on arrival date from migration, present results suggest that the association between breeding date and 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> might be mediated by migration phenology. In addition, fecundity selection appears to be operating against Q
  <sub>7</sub>/Q
  <sub>8</sub> because late migrating/breeding swallows have fewer clutches per season, and late breeding has additional negative selection effects via reduced offspring longevity. Genotype frequencies varied marginally non-significantly with age, as Q
  <sub>7</sub>/Q
  <sub>8</sub> frequency showed a 4-fold reduction in old individuals. This result suggests negative viability selection against Q
  <sub>7</sub>/Q
  <sub>8</sub>, possibly mediated by costs of late breeding.
