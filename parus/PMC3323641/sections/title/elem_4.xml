  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The barn swallow is a semi-colonial, socially monogamous passerine bird with biparental care of the progeny. Barn swallows breeding in Europe overwinter in sub-Saharan Africa and reach their breeding quarters in March-May. Yearlings arrive from migration and breed later than older individuals. Most females (91.2% in our study population) lay 4–6 eggs per clutch. Yearling females may lay one or two clutches per breeding season while older females normally lay two, seldom three clutches. Fledging success is very high, as 80–90% of the eggs produce a fledgling. Barn swallows are short-lived, with a life-expectancy at first breeding of ca. 1.3 years. In Europe, the large majority of barn swallows breeds synantropically in rural buildings or small villages, typically in farms with livestock

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Field Procedures</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During four breeding seasons (2002: n  =  173 individuals from 6 different farms; 2005: n  =  74, 7 farms; 2009: n  =  89, 4 farms, 2011: n  =  586, 19 farms) we studied barn swallows breeding at a total of 29 farms in an intensively cultivated farmland area near Milano (N Italy). We chose to consider birds from different, non-consecutive years in order to reduce the odds of stochastic extremeness both in breeding dates and gene frequencies, and to reduce any effect of temporal autocorrelation in the data. Owing to low levels of genetic diversity at 
   <span class="italic">Clock</span>, in the analyses we pooled the data from different years. In the analyses, however, we also appropriately controlled for any effect of inter-annual variation in mean breeding dates due to e.g. meteorological conditions by including year as a random effect in linear mixed models (see 
   <span class="italic">Statistical analyses</span>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We regularly visited the colonies to record breeding events and capture breeding adults. Because adults normally spend the night inside the buildings where they breed, they were efficiently captured by placing mist nets at all entrances before dawn. All individuals were subjected to a number of standard measurements and a blood sample was collected by puncturing the brachial vein. Before being released, all individuals were marked with a unique combination of colour rings and patches on breast and belly feathers. Sex of adults was identified by inspection for a brood patch (indicating female, as males do not incubate in European populations) and for a prominent cloacal protuberance (indicating male), and by direct observation of sexual and social behaviour at the nest. In case of any doubt, sexing was confirmed molecularly 
   <a rid="pone.0035140-Saino2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Saino2">[44]</a>. For the purpose of the present study, we recorded Julian date of laying of the first egg in the first clutch for females or social mate of individual males. This variable was used as the core phenological indicator of timing of breeding throughout the study.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To obtain information on age of the breeding adults we took advantage of the extremely high breeding philopatry of barn swallows in our study area as well as in other parts of their European range, which implies that individuals that have bred in a particular farm in one year return to breed in the same farm in the following year(s) 
   <a rid="pone.0035140-Mller3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Mller3">[41]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0035140-Saino3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Saino3">[45]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0035140-Saino4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Saino4">[46]</a> (C. Scandolara pers. comm.). The farms for which information on age of breeding adults was available were those where we managed to capture the vast majority of the breeding adults in the year (
   <span class="italic">i</span>-1) preceding that (year 
   <span class="italic">i</span>) to which individual phenological data refer. High breeding philopatry in combination with effectiveness of our effort to capture the vast majority of the breeding adults imply that adults that had not already been captured as adults during year 
   <span class="italic">i</span>-1 in year 
   <span class="italic">i</span> could be assumed to be yearlings hatched in year 
   <span class="italic">i</span>-1. Conversely, individuals that had already been captured as adults in year 
   <span class="italic">i</span>-1 were considered as two- or more years old. Thus, for the purpose of this study we classified swallows as yearlings (1-year old) or older (≥ 2 years old) birds 
   <a rid="pone.0035140-Mller3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Mller3">[41]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0035140-Saino3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Saino3">[45]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0035140-Saino4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Saino4">[46]</a>. The core sample of the present study consists of 632 adults for which both age and breeding date were known (see 
   <span class="italic">
    <a ref-type="sec" rid="s3" href="#s3">Results</a>
   </span> for age by sex sample sizes). Because breeding dates are strongly affected by age (see above) and the frequency of particular genotypes among older birds was very low (see below), the analyses were run on either age class separately. However, an additional 290 genotyped individuals of unknown age/breeding date were included in the statistics of allele frequencies and heterozygosity, and in the tests on deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most nestlings were ringed every year in the study farms, and we could thus confirm that no pairs of the very few siblings (see also below) that are recruited in their original colony were included in the sample. Indeed, barn swallows have very low natal philopatry, as only less than 5% of offspring were recruited locally on average. Hence, given: 1) the very low natal philopatry and large natal dispersal of barn swallows 
   <a rid="pone.0035140-Mller3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Mller3">[41]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0035140-Turner1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Turner1">[43]</a>; 2) the very large size of the population of swallows breeding at a distance from the study colonies within the natal dispersal of barn swallows 
   <a rid="pone.0035140-Ambrosini1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Ambrosini1">[47]</a>; 3) that siblings seem not to disperse together (our unpublished data); and 4) that less than 40% of the swallows breeding in any given colony were included in the study, the chances that siblings that could not be recognized as such (because they had not been ringed as nestlings) were included in the analyses are likely to be very small. Moreover, due to large natal dispersal and point 4 above, the chances that parent-offspring pairs were included also appear to be very small and in no case this occurred for local recruits whose parents could be identified by direct observation at the nest.

  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Total genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples collected from the brachial vein in heparinized capillary tubes. Blood was stored in a cool bag while in the field and subsequently at -20°C in the lab, until used. DNA extraction was performed by alkaline lysis using 6 µL of blood in 100 µL of a 50 mM NaOH at 100°C for 20 minutes. Extracted DNA was quantified using a spectrophotometer and diluted to a final concentration of 50–100 ng/µL 
   <a rid="pone.0035140-Saino2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Saino2">[44]</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to design species-specific primer for genotyping purposes, we initially used the primers published by 
   <a rid="pone.0035140-Johnsen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Johnsen1">[31]</a> on barn swallow DNA samples. The amplified PCR fragments were then sequenced (BMR genomics, Padua, Italy) and a new set of primers designed on barn swallow genomic sequence. Genomic DNA samples were screened for length polymorphism in the 
   <span class="italic">Clk</span>polyQcds by PCR amplification followed by resolution and detection on a conventional DNA sequencing machine using a commercial GeneScan service for genotyping (Macrogen Inc., Seoul, Korea). We used PCR forward primer (5′-labelled with 6-FAM dye) 5′-(6FAM)GGGACAGGTGGTGACAGCTTATC-3′ and reverse primer 
   <div content-type="gene" class="named-content">5′- CTGCTGATGGTCCTGCTGACT-3′</div> (Sigma-Aldrich). Amplification reactions were as follows: 2 µL of extracted DNA (100–200 ng), 1.5 mM of Mg
   <span class="sup">2+</span>; Taq DNA polymerase 1.35 U (Genespin, Milano, Italy); 0.4 µL of each primer (stock 10 µM); 2 µL of dNTPs (stock 2mM), in a final volume of 20 µL. PCR amplification profile was as follows: 95°C/2 min, followed by 5 cycles at 95°C/30s, 65°C/30s 72°C/30s, decreasing 1°C each cycle (touchdown PCR), then by 30 cycles at 95°C/30 s, 60°C/30 s, 72°C/45 s. A final extension step was included at 72°C for 7 min. Samples were kept at 7°C until analyzed. Two internal size standards were used: the conventional molecular size standard HD400 ROX (Applied Biosystems) and a molecular weight standard generated ‘in-house’ by using a previously characterized swallow DNA sample, homozygous for the most common (Q
   <sub>7</sub>; see below) allele using the same forward primer, this time labeled with HEX. The PCR amplification with 6-FAM and HEX labeled primers were carried out separately and then 2 µL of the HEX-labeled PCR amplification reaction were added to each sample.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reliability of molecular data were confirmed by randomly picking 80 samples and repeating the GeneScan analysis independently. Moreover each heterozygous genotype was double checked by repeating the PCR amplification reaction and sequencing. The most common allele was sequenced and its PCR amplification fragment proved to be 112bp long, coding for a CLOCK protein containing a stretch of 7 glutamine residues. In accordance with 
   <a rid="pone.0035140-Johnsen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Johnsen1">[31]</a>, the allele was named Q
   <sub>7</sub> (or 
   <span class="italic">Clk</span>polyQ
   <sub>7</sub>). Recently, the 
   <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene sequence of the barn swallow has been published in GenBank 
   <a rid="pone.0035140-Dor1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Dor1">[34]</a>. Our sequences perfectly match those published (acc. no. JN642465-JN642524) The screening of 922 barn swallow individuals led to the identification of a total of 4 alleles, each differing by multiple of 3 base pairs. The alleles were named according to the number of glutamine residues predicted in the mature protein, as Q
   <sub>5</sub>-Q
   <sub>8</sub>
   <a rid="pone.0035140-Dor1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Dor1">[34]</a> Statistical tests were conducted using genotype classes.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We relied on linear mixed models to test for the effect of genotype on breeding date. Genotype was included in the analyses as a fixed factor. To control for any interannual variation in mean breeding dates and in their variances, we ran linear mixed models while including year as a random factor. The assumption of homogeneity of variances in breeding dates among genotypes within sex by age groups was always met (Levene test: P &gt; 0.224). To check for stability of the results that were significant at these analyses of variance we applied non parametric (Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Withney U) tests. Variation in genotype frequencies between age classes was tested by 
   <span class="italic">G</span>-test while applying William’s conservative correction procedure 
   <a rid="pone.0035140-Williams1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Williams1">[48]</a>. These analyses were run with SAS 9.2 package (SAS Institute Inc, Boca Raton). Tests for deviation from HWE were performed using GenePop 4.0 package 
   <a rid="pone.0035140-Raymond1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Raymond1">[49]</a> while applying the following parameters in Markov chain analyses: dememorization: 10,000, batches: 10,000, interactions per batch: 10,000.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ethics Statement</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Upon capture, barn swallows were kept in cloth bags in a safe position, as is standard practice in bird ringing studies. Blood samples were collected by puncturing the brachial vein. The puncturing site was accurately disinfected. All individuals were released as soon as possible, usually within 1 hour of capture. After being released, swallows behaved normally and observations at the nest on dozens of individuals confirmed that they resumed their normal breeding activities. The study was carried out under permission of the local authority (Regione Lombardia #M1.2002.0001646) responsible for authorizing animal studies in the wild. The farmers gave permission to enter their properties (list of farmers available from the authors upon request). No approval from an ethical committee was required for this study.</p>
