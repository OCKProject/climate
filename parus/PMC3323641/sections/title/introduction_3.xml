 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ability to appropriately match the timing of critical life-history stages to temporal variation in ecological conditions is often under positive selection

  <a rid="pone.0035140-Verboven1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Verboven1">[2]</a> (see also 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Nussey1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Nussey1">[3]</a>). In environments where biotic factors and abiotic conditions oscillate periodically, organisms can greatly benefit from anticipating the advent of the best extrinsic conditions for key life history events such as emergence from immature developmental stages, migration and breeding. This is predicted to be especially the case when the pace of the shift in physiological and behavioural traits that precede such activities is slower than that of temporal changes in ecological conditions, or when spatio-temporal environmental heterogeneity produces abrupt changes in ecological conditions to which organisms are exposed. For example, migratory birds that breed in temperate or high latitude biomes with marked seasonal cycles in temperature and productivity need to schedule the onset of migration so as to arrive to the breeding grounds and exploit narrow peaks in food abundance weeks/months later, without the possibility to directly assess conditions at destination

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because seasonal variation in ecological conditions is determined by the astronomical position of the Earth relative to the Sun, which also causes circannual variation in the relative duration of day and night (photoperiod) at any given place on the Earth in a highly consistent way over millennia, photoperiod provides an accurate cue to optimally set the timing of annual life-history events. Indeed, photoperiod is the main cue that birds, for example, use in timing their migration and breeding

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Perception of variation in day length is in fact a major proximate mechanism beating the time of seasonal, periodic changes in physiology and behaviour of several organisms

  <a rid="pone.0035140-Bradshaw1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Bradshaw1">[13]</a>. The ‘circadian clock’ senses temporal variation in light/dark cycles and produces a cascade of physiological processes that can ultimately cause adaptive behavioural shifts, such as flowering in plants, and preparing to and undertaking migration or breeding in birds

  <a rid="pone.0035140-Kyriacou1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Kyriacou1">[15]</a>. A large body of studies has led to the identification of several genes that are in control of the circadian clock and to the dissection of the molecular bases of circadian oscillations 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Kyriacou1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Kyriacou1">[15]</a>. 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene networks have been characterized in organisms from fungi and plants to birds and mammals, and their functioning in producing biochemical circadian fluctuations shares similarities among phylogenetically distant taxa

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> genes encode elements of an auto-regulated transcriptional–translational feedback loop termed the ‘core circadian oscillator’ (CCO)

  <a rid="pone.0035140-Bailey1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Bailey1">[23]</a>. Within CCO, 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Bmal1</span> gene products heterodimerize to produce a transcription factor which constitutes both a positive driver of the molecular oscillations themselves and an ‘output’ signal from the circadian oscillator 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Fidler1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Fidler1">[24]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Lowrey1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Lowrey1">[26]</a>. Studies of mice have demonstrated that an important role is played by the carboxyl-terminal polyglutamine repeat (poly Q) domain, observing that changes in the number of poly Q repeats affect circadian rhythms

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Empirical evidence for a link between poly Q and phenology of migration and reproduction has partly originated from analyses of latitudinal variation in the poly Q repeat length 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Costa1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Costa1">[29]</a>. In salmon species (
  <span class="italic">Oncorhynchus</span> spp.), timing of migration is under photoperiodic control and shows considerable geographical variation, as an adaptation to climate and river water flow regimes 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-OMalley1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-OMalley1">[28]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-OMalley2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-OMalley2">[30]</a>. Extensive population studies have demonstrated clinal variation in poly Q length as would be predicted by involvement of 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> in controlling the expression of migration according to ecological conditions. In the Chinook salmon 
  <span class="italic">O. tshawytscha</span>, for example, 
  <span class="italic">OtsClock1b</span> alleles increase in length with latitude across North American rivers 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-OMalley2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-OMalley2">[30]</a>. In a partially migratory avian species, the blue tit (
  <span class="italic">Cyanistes caeruleus</span>), length of 
  <span class="italic">Clk</span>polyQcds increases with latitude among 14 populations 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Johnsen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Johnsen1">[31]</a>. However, a study of migratory bluethroats (
  <span class="italic">Luscinia svecica</span>) yielded no evidence of clinal variation in allele length 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Johnsen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Johnsen1">[31]</a>. An analysis of resident populations of blue tits and great tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) provided contrasting results over the role of 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> polymorphism in generating breeding phenological variation 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Liedvogel1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Liedvogel1">[32]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Liedvogel2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Liedvogel2">[33]</a>. Blue tit females, but not males, with fewer poly Q repeats bred earlier. However, in the closely related, syntopic great tit, there was considerably smaller genetic variation at 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> and absence of covariation with breeding phenology. A recent study of five distant barn swallow (
  <span class="italic">Hirundo rustica</span>) populations disclosed very low polymorphism at the 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> poly Q region 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Dor1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Dor1">[34]</a>. Finally, a comparison among five 
  <span class="italic">Tachycineta</span> swallow species found considerable variation in polymorphism at 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> poly Q but no evidence of latitudinal variation across species 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Dor2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Dor2">[35]</a>. In addition, no evidence was found for an association between laying date and 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> genotype at the within-species level 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Dor2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Dor2">[35]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite long-standing interest of chronobiological studies in circadian oscillators, those mentioned above are the only, mostly very recent studies that have been published on the consequences of 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> gene polymorphism for the breeding phenology or migratoriness of birds 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Mller2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Mller2">[36]</a>. On the other hand, there is evidence for genetically based variation and selection on both timing of migration and breeding in birds 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Knudsen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Knudsen1">[7]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Price1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Price1">[37]</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Sheldon1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Sheldon1">[39]</a>, making the investigation of the genetic machinery controlling such phenological variation of utmost importance, particularly in a period when climate change is challenging the ability of populations to adapt to rapidly changing conditions 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Mller1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Mller1">[6]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Knudsen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Knudsen1">[7]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because of the paucity of studies on birds and the contrasting evidence on the involvement of 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> in generating phenological variation, we analyzed breeding dates of barn swallows in relation to 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> genotype. Based on the evidence for blue tits 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Liedvogel1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Liedvogel1">[32]</a> (but see 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Dor2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Dor2">[35]</a>), we expected individuals with longer 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> alleles to breed relatively late. However, we expected this effect to be manifest only among females, as breeding dates are believed to be constrained by female physiological disposition to egg laying 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Liedvogel1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Liedvogel1">[32]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0035140-Ball1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0035140-Ball1">[40]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, we expected the frequency of 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> genotypes that dictate late breeding to be smaller among older individuals. This was predicted because selection mediated by the cost of reproduction may increase late in the season, as a result of worsening of conditions for breeding as the season progresses. We therefore compared the genotype frequencies between yearlings and older individuals.
