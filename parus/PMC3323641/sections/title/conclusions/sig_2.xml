 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This is the first study of migratory birds showing an association between breeding phenology and 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> genotype and suggesting that negative selection occurs on a phenologically deviant genotype. Low polymorphism at 
  <span class="italic">Clock</span> may constrain microevolutionary phenological response to changing climate, and may thus contribute to the decline of barn swallow populations.
