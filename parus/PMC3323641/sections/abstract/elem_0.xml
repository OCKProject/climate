  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In diverse taxa, photoperiodic responses that cause seasonal physiological and behavioural shifts are controlled by genes, including the vertebrate 
   <span class="italic">Clock</span> orthologues, that encode for circadian oscillator mechanisms. While the genetic network behind circadian rhythms is well described, relatively few reports exist of the phenological consequences of and selection on 
   <span class="italic">Clock</span> genes in the wild. Here, we investigated variation in breeding phenology in relation to 
   <span class="italic">Clock</span> genetic diversity in a long-distance migratory bird, the barn swallow (
   <span class="italic">Hirundo rustica</span>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a sample of 922 adult barn swallows from a single population breeding in Italy we found one very common (Q
   <sub>7</sub>) and three rare (Q
   <sub>5</sub>, Q
   <sub>6</sub>, Q
   <sub>8</sub>) length variants of a functionally significant polyglutamine repeat. Rare (2.9%) Q
   <sub>7</sub>/Q
   <sub>8</sub> heterozygous females, but not males, bred significantly later than common (91.5%) Q
   <sub>7</sub>/Q
   <sub>7</sub> females, consistent with the expectation that ‘long’ alleles cause late breeding, as observed in a resident population of another bird species. Because breeding date depends on arrival date from migration, present results suggest that the association between breeding date and 
   <span class="italic">Clock</span> might be mediated by migration phenology. In addition, fecundity selection appears to be operating against Q
   <sub>7</sub>/Q
   <sub>8</sub> because late migrating/breeding swallows have fewer clutches per season, and late breeding has additional negative selection effects via reduced offspring longevity. Genotype frequencies varied marginally non-significantly with age, as Q
   <sub>7</sub>/Q
   <sub>8</sub> frequency showed a 4-fold reduction in old individuals. This result suggests negative viability selection against Q
   <sub>7</sub>/Q
   <sub>8</sub>, possibly mediated by costs of late breeding.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conclusions/Significance</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This is the first study of migratory birds showing an association between breeding phenology and 
   <span class="italic">Clock</span> genotype and suggesting that negative selection occurs on a phenologically deviant genotype. Low polymorphism at 
   <span class="italic">Clock</span> may constrain microevolutionary phenological response to changing climate, and may thus contribute to the decline of barn swallow populations.
