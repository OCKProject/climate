 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We observed an increase in body mass daily from morning to afternoon in 27 individuals that were weighed twice in the same day (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" href="#fig-1">Fig. 1</a>). The average increase was 0.205 ± 0.117 g/h, with no significant differences between the three social classes (
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>2,24</sub> = 2.035, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.15). The mass increase during the examined central hours of the day was best explained by a linear increase (
  <span class="italic">t</span> = 1.691, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05), while the addition of a quadratic term was not significant (
  <span class="italic">t</span> = 0.354, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.35).
