 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Day-to-day mass fluctuation explained 8% of the variation in mass on the third consecutive day. Female breeders, male breeders and helpers exhibited similar short-term mass regulation, with the effect strongest in female breeders (13% of variation explained). Small mass fluctuations over two days, combined with the ability to compensate for these fluctuations on the third day, indicate that during the breeding season scrub-jays are able to regulate their body mass on a short-term basis. A number of studies have found differences in mass regulation strategies between dominant and subordinate birds (

  <a rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-39">Ratikainen &amp; Wright, 2013</a>) as insurance against poor foraging conditions, during which dominants would exercise their priority access to food. Some studies have found that the body mass of subordinates varies less than that of dominants, likely because smaller adjustments are needed to subordinatesâ€™ already larger reserves (in Willow Tits

In contrast, in Florida scrub-jays, although helpers are subordinate to male breeders, they exhibited similar day-to-day mass fluctuations, amplitude of fluctuations and short-term mass regulation. These previous studies were performed on dominance-structured winter flocks of genetically unrelated individuals in which dominants were able to monopolize food resources, leading to different strategies. In Florida scrub-jays, dominant and subordinate birds within groups are closely related. Jays tend to forage individually primarily on insects and, to a lesser extent, small reptiles, amphibians, and mammals all well hidden in the vegetation. This reduces the chance for dominant birds to monopolize food. In fall and winter, each jay feeds primarily on acorns, cached during the later summer. Each jay scatter-hoards 6-7000 individual acorns (
  <a rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-10">DeGange et al., 1989</a>). When caching, jays adopt behaviors that appear to minimize kelptoparsitism by dominant jays, suggesting that it may happen but is minimized within groups (
  <a rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-48">Toomey, Bowman &amp; Woolfenden, 2007</a>). Thus year-round feeding patterns do not favor despotic control of food. Since breeder and helper jays both contribute to rearing young, it is not surprising that in this species, mass regulation strategies did not differ by social status.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because the jays rarely experience severe climate or food shortages in spring (
  <a rid="ref-57" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-57">Woolfenden &amp; Fitzpatrick, 1996</a>), a strategy of fattening may be more of a disadvantage (
  <a rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-25">Lima, 1986</a>) than an advantage. Instead, for this species, the appropriate strategy seems to be maintain a stable body mass that effectively balance the need to maintain some energy reserves against the need for efficient flight and foraging, as required during reproduction.
