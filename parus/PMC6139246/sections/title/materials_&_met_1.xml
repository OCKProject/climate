 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study was conducted at Archbold Biological Station in south-central Florida (27°10′N 81°21′W) as part of the long-term study of the Florida scrub-jay (
  <a rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-33">Mumme et al., 2015</a>; Fitzpatrick &amp; Bowman; data collected under SFWS permit TE824723-9 issued to R. Bowman). Each jay in the population is uniquely marked with metal and plastic colour rings (
  <a rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-53">Woolfenden, 1975</a>), and all individuals are easily identifiable in the field. All birds are sexed genetically at only 11 days post-hatch, but later confirmed behaviourally; only females incubate and brood and give a characteristic “hiccup” vocalization (
  <a rid="ref-56" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-56">Woolfenden &amp; Fitzpatrick, 1984</a>). Prebreeding helpers, which remain in their natal territories for one or more years and help the breeders raise young, were distinguished from breeders by their histories and by behaviour, especially dominance-subordinance relationships (
  <a rid="ref-55" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-55">Woolfenden &amp; Fitzpatrick, 1977</a>). Data were collected during the breeding season of 1996, during which nesting began in mid-March, and almost all pairs had eggs by mid-April.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We collected mass measurements daily from 2 April to 9 June 1996. We placed electronic balances (accuracy 0.1 g) on the ground several tens of meters from the nest in numerous territories. The jays, which are remarkably tame to humans and accustomed to receiving peanut bits from us, were induced to perch on the balance by placing a few bits on the plate. The mass of peanuts provided daily to individual birds was less than 0.2 g, or about 0.3% of the mass of an adult jay (77 g; 
  <a rid="ref-57" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-57">Woolfenden &amp; Fitzpatrick, 1996</a>). We used two methods for obtaining mass measurements. When a stable mass value was visible on the scale display, we read the scale directly. Otherwise, we inspected a series of mass values (approximately three per second) collected by a computer attached to the scale to find a stable mass value, defined as at least three consecutive identical values. All data were collected by the same observer (MC). We recorded only a single mass value for each visit of a bird to the scale. We obtained 438 mass values by reading the scale directly and another 494 from the attached computer for a total of 932 measurements (31 individuals: seven female breeders, 15 male breeders, and nine prebreeding helpers, sexes combined; mean = 30.1 ± 2.6 measurements per bird). For all visits, the observer recorded the identity of the bird and the time the mass value was obtained.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We divided date into five fortnight intervals (15 days) from 1 April through 15 June. We divided the breeding cycle into four stages: nest building and egg laying (hereafter referred to as building), incubation, nestlings, and dependent fledglings. Mass measurements obtained from birds after the failure of their last nest were excluded. We utilized mixed-effect models to compare mass values between the fortnight periods, or between the breeding stages. In the models, fortnight or breeding stage was inserted as fixed factor, and jay identity was inserted as a random effect to account for repeated measures (

  <a rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-38">R Development Core Team, 2017</a>). Post-hoc comparisons with Tukey correction were computed by the package 
  <span class="italic">multcomp</span>, and group means for fixed factors with confidence intervals were obtained by the package 
  <span class="italic">lmerTest</span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We define day-to-day mass fluctuation as the difference in mass between two consecutive days. We define the amplitude of mass fluctuation as the absolute value of the day-to-day mass fluctuation. We examined day-to-day mass fluctuation relative to date and breeding stage separately for three social classes, e.g., female and male breeders and prebreeding helpers. Of the 932 mass values, 595 represented paired measurements of the same individuals on successive days. Because mass values taken over a sequence of days are potentially more correlated than masses that are further away in time (
  <a rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-13">Ekstrom, 2012</a>), we modelled the relationship between mass variation and elapsed days using mixed models with serial correlation in the 
  <span class="italic">nlme</span> package (
  <a rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-36">Pinheiro et al., 2018</a>). In the models, the jay identity was inserted as a random term, while social class and breeding stage were inserted as fixed terms. We modelled both linear and quadratic effects.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We examined the influence of weather on day-to-day fluctuation in body mass using air temperature and rainfall: (1) maximum temperature on the day of weighing, (2) mean maximum temperature on the day of weighing plus the previous day, (3) minimum temperature on the day of weighing, (4) mean minimum temperature on the day of weighing plus the previous day, (5) amount of rainfall on the day of weighing, and (6) amount of rainfall on the day of weighing plus the previous day. Temperature and rainfall values were collected 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> and obtained from Archbold meteorological archives. Relationship between mass fluctuation and weather variables was tested both individually for each variable and in a multiple regression analysis, followed by stepwise backward and forward selection. Multivariate models were compared using Akaike information criterium’s values computed by the 
  <span class="italic">nlme</span> package.
