 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Day-to-day fluctuations in mass might be stochastic variation or might reflect difficulty in maintaining body mass, such as during unfavorable foraging conditions, cold weather, or a period of elevated energy expenditure. Consistent with the relative stability of Florida scrub-jays’ average mass during this study, most day-to-day fluctuations in mass were small, and overall did not vary between male breeders, female breeders and helpers despite their different breeding-season activities. Mass fluctuations varied significantly relative to season only for male breeders, and only between two fortnights, but these differences were small (−0.58 g during the first fortnight compared to 0.60 g during the last fortnight) and were not reflected by differences in average mass of males between fortnights. Also, the amplitude of mass fluctuations did not vary by fortnight.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Florida scrub-jays, female breeders perform all incubating and brooding, but feed nestlings at a relatively low rate compared to the male breeder. Male breeders feed the female during incubation and brooding, and feed nestlings at a high rate. Both males and females feed fledglings at an increasing rate that peaks about two weeks post-fledging (

We found that despite the different reproductive activities of Florida scrub-jays, day-to-day mass fluctuations did not differ among social classes in different stages of the breeding cycle. The amplitude of these fluctuations also did not differ between classes. However, the amplitude of mass fluctuations was higher for female and male breeders during the building stage than during any other stage. The building stage encompassed the prelaying period, so the large amplitude of mass fluctuations for females likely reflects mass gain during the building stage. The average amplitude and fluctuation are equal for this stage, indicating that all fluctuation measurements were positive. The larger amplitude for males during the building stage is more difficult to explain. The average fluctuation for this stage was smaller than the average amplitude, though it was still positive, indicating that day-to-day mass gains were partly offset by losses. No differences in amplitude existed for helpers.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Weather variables explained less than 2% of the total variation in day-to-day mass fluctuation. The lack of effect of daily minimum temperature on mass fluctuation suggests that during the study period the nocturnal energy expenditure of jays was not influenced by nighttime temperature. It is not surprising that Florida scrub-jays in the subtropical climate of south-central Florida, particularly in the spring months of April, May and June, would not exhibit fat storage patterns observed in birds that experience colder temperatures (e.g.,
