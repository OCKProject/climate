   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>]. DNA from six individuals of the three species was quantified and quality checked with Invitrogen’s PicoGreen®assay kit (fluorometry). Genomic sequencing in ABISOLiD™ 5500 XL was performed at Omics Solution, a Next Generation Sequencing facility. DNA was desalted then concentrated using standard EtOH/sodium acetate precipitation at 20 °C for 2 h, followed by two 70% EtOH washes. Then the pooled DNA was re-dissolved in low TE as per standard protocol for ABI SOLiD sequencing of genomic DNA fragment libraries. DNA samples were sheared in Covaris™S220 System, which fragments the input DNA, by sonication, into small fragments with a mean size of 160 bp.
  </p>
  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fragmented DNA was then purified with SOLiD Library Column Purification Kit, and libraries were prepared according to standard SOLiD protocols. Fragment libraries for the twelve penguins were prepared separately, P1 and P2 adapters were ligated, and each sample was tagged with a different barcode (a known sequence of ten bp in adapters). Prepared libraries were quantified by real-time PCR on a Light Cycler®Nano (Roche) using Invitrogen’s Quantification Kit for SOLiD. The double stranded library was added at a concentration of 0.2 pg/μL to the emulsion with 2400 million beads, according to manufacturers’ instructions. Thirty percent of the beads were P2 positive (contained amplified library fragments) before enrichment and 90% of the beads were P2 positive after enrichment, yielding 790 million beads deposited on the Flow Chip. Library beads were sequenced on a SOLiD™ 5500 XL using standard chemistry for paired-end fragment libraries and 75–35-bp read lengths.</p>

ASiD (Assembly Assistant for SOLiD) was used to fill gaps between contigs that formed scaffolds and to perform a color-space to base-space translation for the final assembly.

We also calculated the pairwise distance between all 15 penguins studied here (10 species) for all 13 concatenated genes of the mtDNA genomes using the Maximun Likelihood model (Additional file

We combined each of the 13 protein-coding genes from the mtDNA genome from the studied penguin species into a concatenated data set of 11,409 bp. The phylogeny was also estimated excluding the 
   <span class="italic">ND6</span> gene (a total of 10,886 bp), which is encoded by the light-strand [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>] and has a significantly different base composition from the heavy-chain [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">65</a>]. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred using Bayesian inference methods (BA) with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling as implemented in MrBayes v. 3.1.2 [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">66</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>]. The evolutionary model selected GTR + I + G, using jModelTest v. 0.1.1 [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">68</a>] and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The Mr. Bayes analyses were run for one million generations while sampling every 100 generations. At this point the standard deviation of split frequencies was &lt;0.01, indicating that both runs had converged. Phylogenetic reconstructions were visualized using Figtree v. 1.2.2 [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">69</a>]. Although positive selection is frequently inferred by genetic data analysis as Ka/Ks &gt; 1 (and purifying selection by Ka/Ks &lt; 1) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" href="#CR70">70</a>], a gene with Ka/Ks lower than 1 may show signature of positive selection at codon level. Evidence for signatures of selection at codon sites was evaluated for each gene with the concatenated data set using the BA phylogeny and the selected model of evolution without outgroups with the three algorithms available in HyPhy software [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">71</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">73</a>]. For comparison, we used the Single Likelihood Ancestral Counting (SLAC), Fixed-Effects Likelihood (FEL) and the Random Effects Likelihood (REL) methods using the best fit nucleotide model [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">71</a>]. The single likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC) method is based on weighting across all possible ancestral reconstructions, or employs sampling from ancestral reconstructions. The fixed effects likelihood (FEL) method estimates nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates at each site. Random effects likelihood (REL) models variation in nonsynonymous and synonymous rates across sites based on a predefined distribution, where a Bayesian approach are used to infer selection pressure at an individual site [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">71</a>]. We also performed the branch Site REL [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">72</a>] analysis in HyPhy software to estimate branch-specific episodes of positive selection along the phylogeny.
