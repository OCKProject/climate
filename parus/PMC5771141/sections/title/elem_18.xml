  <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In metazoans, mitogenome complexes I through V are physically positioned relative to each other in accordance with their function, with the complex II genes residing in the nucleus [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" href="#CR85">85</a>]. A positively selected codon was detected by SLAC model on the mitogenome of penguins in the Complex I or 
   <span class="italic">NADH</span> dehydrogenase gene (
   <span class="italic">ND4</span>). Complex I through IV generate the proton gradient in the intermembrane space of mitochondria. Complex I is the main entrance point of electrons and the largest complex of the respiratory chain. It catalyzes the transfer of two electrons from NADH to ubiquinone and translocates four protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>]. Complex I consists of different protein subunits, with fourteen homologous subunits present in all organisms, and which constitute the enzyme.

  <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ND1 and ND2 are situated at the connection between the peripheral and the membrane arm, whereas ND4 and ND5 are at the distal end [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" href="#CR86">86</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" href="#CR87">87</a>]. If ND2, ND4 and ND5 are the actual proton pumping devices [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" href="#CR86">86</a>], mutations in these genes may alter the efficiency of the proton-pumping process. The concentration of codons under positive selection in specific domains of the mitogenome are very likely to be related to protein function [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" href="#CR88">88</a>] and a meta-analysis of 237 vertebrates showed that most of the genes under positive selection were located in Complex I [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" href="#CR89">89</a>]. 
   <span class="italic">NADH</span> dehydrogenase genes have also shown signatures of positive selection at a population level in birds (
   <span class="italic">Parus</span> spp.) in the 
   <span class="italic">ND2</span> gene [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" href="#CR90">90</a>], in lineages of an Australian bird (
   <span class="italic">Eopsaltria australis</span>) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>] in 
   <span class="italic">ND4</span> and 
   <span class="italic">ND4L</span>. Similarly the Chinese snub-nosed monkey (
   <span class="italic">Rinopithecus</span> ssp.) showed evidence of adaptive variation related with physiological hypoxia and cold stress in altitude in 
   <span class="italic">ND2</span> and 
   <span class="italic">ND6</span> [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" href="#CR91">91</a>]. Few studies have assessed if selection on mtDNA genes is correlated with environmental variables [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" href="#CR92">92</a>]. In the Atlantic herring (
   <span class="italic">Clupea harengus</span>), significant positive selection was observed in 
   <span class="italic">ND2</span>, 
   <span class="italic">ND4</span> and 
   <span class="italic">ND5</span>. Correlations between genetic diversity and variation of environmental factors (temperature, salinity and latitude) were generally weak, although the authors addressed some correlation between temperature and genetic distances with 
   <span class="italic">ND3</span> and 
   <span class="italic">ND4L</span> [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ATP synthase</div>
  <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our study, the Ka/Ks ratio for 
   <span class="italic">ATP8</span> was lower than 1, suggesting negative selection for the gene, although it was higher than any other value for mtDNA genes in penguins. However, one codon of 
   <span class="italic">ATP8</span> (Complex V) showed evidence of positive selection (under model FEL). Complex V (or ATP synthase) is the final enzyme in the OXPHOS pathway and is ubiquitous throughout all forms of life and biological functions. The enzyme uses the energy stored in a proton gradient across a membrane to drive the synthesis of ATP from ADP and phosphate. Complex V uses the proton gradient resulting from the activity of the respiratory chain enzymes complexes I, III and IV for ATP synthesis, generating 95% of cellular ATP. Complex V is a multi-subunit complex with two functional domains, F1 and F0, for which 
   <span class="italic">ATP8</span> encodes a core subunit of the F0 component. Across mammalian evolution, 
   <span class="italic">ATP6</span> is more conserved, in contrast to the 
   <span class="italic">ATP8</span> subunit which has some highly variable sites with extreme amino acid changes of properties, suggesting that there are differences in its regulatory function among species [

   <span class="italic">COXI,</span> complex IV, showed purifying selection in penguins, as has been observed across all Aves [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>]. We estimated Ka/Ks ratios close to zero for all comparison among species and genera, and similar results were obtained using both the SLAC and FEL methods. These genes from complex IV represent the terminal complex of the respiratory chain. It catalyzes electron transfer from cytochrome c to molecular oxygen, reducing the latter to water. It has been postulated that Complex IV of the OXPHOS, in which 
   <span class="italic">COX1</span> is one of the two catalytic subunits, has the property of intrinsic uncoupling [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93" href="#CR93">93</a>], through which it regulates and increases the coupling efficiency to produce ATP or heat. This mechanism is consistent with the negative selection observed for this gene, as adaptations can occur by changing the configuration of the protein, a mechanism that does not occur in complexes I and V.

  <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Further studies are required to completely understand the factors constraining the evolutionary rate of mitogenomes in penguins. Evolution of protein sequences depends on functional constraints including differential gene expression, protein folding and connectivity, functional importance, and expression breadth among tissues [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94" href="#CR94">94</a>]. Here, we discussed the implications of functionality of different mtDNA genes on the evolutionary rate of a protein. Alternatively, Zang and Yang [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94" href="#CR94">94</a>], suggest that this rate may be predominantly influenced by its expression level rather than functional importance.
