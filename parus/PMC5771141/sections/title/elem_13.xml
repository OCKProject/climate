  <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nucleotide diversity (π) was not significantly correlated with environmental data at different spatial distances in any of 13 mtDNA genes for Mantel test (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM4">4</a> Table S4). The Ka/Ks ratio was related with environmental data at different spatial scales for four genes supported by the significant values of Mantel test and GLM (
   <span class="italic">ND4, ND3, ND5</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Cytb</span>; Table 
   <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a>) and three other genes only for GLM (ND1, COX1 and ATP8). A significant positive correlation between an environmental variable and Ka/Ks ratio for a specific mtDNA gene may suggest that species inhabiting similar environments undergo adaptation processes for the same gene (similar protein reflected by Ka/Ks) and when inhabiting different environments undergo different gene adaptation processes (different protein reflected by Ka/Ks). The highest significant correlation was between SST and Ka/Ks ratio for 
   <span class="italic">ND4</span> (Mantel, 
   <span class="italic">p</span>-value: 0.0001; GLM, 
   <span class="italic">p</span>-value: 0.00001) for all distances. Although, chlorophyll concentration was significantly correlated with Ka/Ks ratio of 
   <span class="italic">ND1, COX1, ND5</span> for GLM, only 
   <span class="italic">COX1</span> showed signature of selection and low 
   <span class="italic">p</span>-value for Mantel (
   <span class="italic">p</span>-value: 0.063) at short distances. The combined environmental data (COM) were correlated with the Ka/Ks ratio for three genes supported by significant Mantel test and GLM:

   <span class="italic">p</span>-value: 0.0064; GLM 
   <span class="italic">p</span>-value: 0.0112). All significant 
   <span class="italic">p</span>-values for the Mantel test were also significant for GLM (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM4">4</a> Table S4). Although we detected few significant correlations between Ka/Ks ratio and environmental variables, we cannot reject the possibility that these results are influenced by other variables not evaluated here.

  <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nucleotide diversity among penguin species was not correlated with the environmental variables (no significant value for Mantel test), nevertheless Ka/Ks ratios were significantly correlated. This supports the premise that broadly, genetic diversity of mtDNA genes are conserved, but that specific signals of selection related to environmental variables could be identified by comparative estimation of Ka/Ks ratios among genes.</p>

Percentage of codons under negative selection is shown for each gene and numbers in blue highlight the relatively low percentage for ATP8. Each star represents codons under significant positive selection as determined by FEL (yellow star) and REL (orange star) in ATP8 and ND4 genes. Ka/Ks ratio for ND4 is correlated with superficial surface temperature and COX1 for chlorophyll levels. The four graphics around the genome indicate with red arrows the highest and lowest for Ka/Ks ratio comparison between species from different genus for each of the four genes under selection. COX1 and ND4 highest Ka/Ks values are associated with pairwise ratio between species from different climates, and lowest among those from similar climates. With ATP8, highest Ka/Ks values were associated with pairwise ratios between species from similar climates and lowest among those from from distinct climates. Scale for graphic of ND3 and ATP8 genes are Ka/Ks from 0 to 1, and for COX1 and ND4 are from 0 to 0.1. By Juan Pablo Bravo
