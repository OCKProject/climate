 <p id="Par48" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we identify mtDNA candidate genes under selection which could be involved in broad-scale adaptations of penguins to their environment. Our results suggest a strong negative selection for 
  <span class="italic">COX1,</span> and a positive selection at codon sites on 
  <span class="italic">ATP8</span> and 
  <span class="italic">ND4</span>. We also found a high correlation between 
  <span class="italic">ND4</span> and sea surface temperature. Further studies on these genes at the intraspecific level are required to completely understand penguin adaptation across different environmental conditions. This is a novel study that illustrates the applicability of large-scale remote sensing as a useful approach to comprehend adaptation to the environment occurring at a molecular level. Integration of these different data provide insights into how penguins sepcies have adapted to their enviornments and therefore how they may respond to future, human-induced changes to their environment.
