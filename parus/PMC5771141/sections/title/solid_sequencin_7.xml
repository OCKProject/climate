  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>]. DNA from six individuals of the three species was quantified and quality checked with Invitrogen’s PicoGreen®assay kit (fluorometry). Genomic sequencing in ABISOLiD™ 5500 XL was performed at Omics Solution, a Next Generation Sequencing facility. DNA was desalted then concentrated using standard EtOH/sodium acetate precipitation at 20 °C for 2 h, followed by two 70% EtOH washes. Then the pooled DNA was re-dissolved in low TE as per standard protocol for ABI SOLiD sequencing of genomic DNA fragment libraries. DNA samples were sheared in Covaris™S220 System, which fragments the input DNA, by sonication, into small fragments with a mean size of 160 bp.

Fragment libraries for the twelve penguins were prepared separately, P1 and P2 adapters were ligated, and each sample was tagged with a different barcode (a known sequence of ten bp in adapters). Prepared libraries were quantified by real-time PCR on a Light Cycler®Nano (Roche) using Invitrogen’s Quantification Kit for SOLiD. The double stranded library was added at a concentration of 0.2 pg/μL to the emulsion with 2400 million beads, according to manufacturers’ instructions. Thirty percent of the beads were P2 positive (contained amplified library fragments) before enrichment and 90% of the beads were P2 positive after enrichment, yielding 790 million beads deposited on the Flow Chip. Library beads were sequenced on a SOLiD™ 5500 XL using standard chemistry for paired-end fragment libraries and 75–35-bp read lengths.</p>
