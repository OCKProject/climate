 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analyses revealed strong and contrasting signals and selection patterns in the coding mtDNA genes of closely related penguin species, some of which correlated with patterns of sea surface water temperatures and chlorophyll concentrations. We identified a widespread signature of purifying selection (Ka/Ks &lt; 1) across the mitochondrial genome, consistent with expected patterns if purifying selection were constraining the mitogenome evolution to maintain the OXPHOS proteins and functionality [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" href="#CR70">70</a>]. These patterns included a signature of purifying selection in 
  <span class="italic">COX</span> genes, especially 
  <span class="italic">COX1</span>, which had Ka/Ks ratios close to zero for all comparison among species and genera. In contrast, one codon under positive selection was evidenced for 
  <span class="italic">ND4</span> and one for 
  <span class="italic">ATP8</span> (SLAC and FEL analysis respectively). Sea surface temperature (SST) was strongly correlated with the Ka/Ks ratio of 
  <span class="italic">ND4</span> and chlorophyll concentration was correlated with Ka/Ks ratios of 
  <span class="italic">COX1</span>. The Ka/Ks ratio patterns for 
  <span class="italic">ATP8</span> varied widely among genera and there was only weak or no evidence of a correlation between genetic diversity of 
  <span class="italic">ATP8</span> and measured environmental factors. These results identify mtDNA candidate genes under selection which could be involved in broad-scale adaptations of penguins to their environment.

   <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In metazoans, mitogenome complexes I through V are physically positioned relative to each other in accordance with their function, with the complex II genes residing in the nucleus [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" href="#CR85">85</a>]. A positively selected codon was detected by SLAC model on the mitogenome of penguins in the Complex I or 
    <span class="italic">NADH</span> dehydrogenase gene (
    <span class="italic">ND4</span>). Complex I through IV generate the proton gradient in the intermembrane space of mitochondria. Complex I is the main entrance point of electrons and the largest complex of the respiratory chain. It catalyzes the transfer of two electrons from NADH to ubiquinone and translocates four protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>]. Complex I consists of different protein subunits, with fourteen homologous subunits present in all organisms, and which constitute the enzyme.
   </p>
   <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ND1 and ND2 are situated at the connection between the peripheral and the membrane arm, whereas ND4 and ND5 are at the distal end [

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" href="#CR87">87</a>]. If ND2, ND4 and ND5 are the actual proton pumping devices [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" href="#CR86">86</a>], mutations in these genes may alter the efficiency of the proton-pumping process. The concentration of codons under positive selection in specific domains of the mitogenome are very likely to be related to protein function [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>, 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" href="#CR88">88</a>] and a meta-analysis of 237 vertebrates showed that most of the genes under positive selection were located in Complex I [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" href="#CR89">89</a>]. 
    <span class="italic">NADH</span> dehydrogenase genes have also shown signatures of positive selection at a population level in birds (

    <span class="italic">ND4</span> and 
    <span class="italic">ND4L</span>. Similarly the Chinese snub-nosed monkey (
    <span class="italic">Rinopithecus</span> ssp.) showed evidence of adaptive variation related with physiological hypoxia and cold stress in altitude in

    <span class="italic">ND6</span> [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" href="#CR91">91</a>]. Few studies have assessed if selection on mtDNA genes is correlated with environmental variables [

    <span class="italic">ND4</span> and

   <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our study, the Ka/Ks ratio for 
    <span class="italic">ATP8</span> was lower than 1, suggesting negative selection for the gene, although it was higher than any other value for mtDNA genes in penguins. However, one codon of 
    <span class="italic">ATP8</span> (Complex V) showed evidence of positive selection (under model FEL). Complex V (or ATP synthase) is the final enzyme in the OXPHOS pathway and is ubiquitous throughout all forms of life and biological functions. The enzyme uses the energy stored in a proton gradient across a membrane to drive the synthesis of ATP from ADP and phosphate. Complex V uses the proton gradient resulting from the activity of the respiratory chain enzymes complexes I, III and IV for ATP synthesis, generating 95% of cellular ATP. Complex V is a multi-subunit complex with two functional domains, F1 and F0, for which 
    <span class="italic">ATP8</span> encodes a core subunit of the F0 component. Across mammalian evolution, 
    <span class="italic">ATP6</span> is more conserved, in contrast to the 
    <span class="italic">ATP8</span> subunit which has some highly variable sites with extreme amino acid changes of properties, suggesting that there are differences in its regulatory function among species [

    <span class="italic">COXI,</span> complex IV, showed purifying selection in penguins, as has been observed across all Aves [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>]. We estimated Ka/Ks ratios close to zero for all comparison among species and genera, and similar results were obtained using both the SLAC and FEL methods. These genes from complex IV represent the terminal complex of the respiratory chain. It catalyzes electron transfer from cytochrome c to molecular oxygen, reducing the latter to water. It has been postulated that Complex IV of the OXPHOS, in which 
    <span class="italic">COX1</span> is one of the two catalytic subunits, has the property of intrinsic uncoupling [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93" href="#CR93">93</a>], through which it regulates and increases the coupling efficiency to produce ATP or heat. This mechanism is consistent with the negative selection observed for this gene, as adaptations can occur by changing the configuration of the protein, a mechanism that does not occur in complexes I and V.
   </p>
   <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Further studies are required to completely understand the factors constraining the evolutionary rate of mitogenomes in penguins. Evolution of protein sequences depends on functional constraints including differential gene expression, protein folding and connectivity, functional importance, and expression breadth among tissues [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94" href="#CR94">94</a>]. Here, we discussed the implications of functionality of different mtDNA genes on the evolutionary rate of a protein. Alternatively, Zang and Yang [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94" href="#CR94">94</a>], suggest that this rate may be predominantly influenced by its expression level rather than functional importance.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mitogenomics and ecological-evolutionary hypotheses to explain selection</div>
  <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are two hypotheses generally offered to explain patterns of mitochondrial genome evolution. The first is that temperature is a primary driver of selection and the evolution of mtDNA genes. For penguins, speciation and adaptation are seemingly strongly correlated with temperature differences of ocean water between the Antarctic and the tropics [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>]. The mitochondrial OXPHOS generates both energy and heat, with the balance of each depending on the coupling efficiency of the electron transport chain to the 
   <span class="italic">ATP</span> synthase activity [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. Less efficient energy production and more heat production would be beneficial for survival in cold environmental conditions [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>]. A reduced proton leak would lead to incremental cold sensitivity that effectively constrains the biogeographic distribution of species with this pattern of mtDNA variation [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>]. Selection on mtDNA variation influencing mitochondrial bioenergetics would thus be plausible drivers of adaptation and speciation [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>], and indeed we detected correlation between Ka/Ks from ND4 and sea suface water temperature which should be further investigated.
  </p>
  <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A second hypothesis is that the risk of starvation associated with restricted food availability (less abundant or less reliable food source) drives mtDNA gene evolution, since starvation can generate more efficient coupling of energy production by the OXPHOS pathway [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>]. Three mechanisms have been suggested for the evolution of starvation resistance and each may be influenced by mitochondrial diversity: (a) greater energy reserves (lipid stores); (b) reduced rate at which reserves are utilized; (c) and lowering of the minimal resources required for survival [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. Reducing energy requirements may occur by reducing ROS and heat production and thus increasing OXPHOS efficiency [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. Chl can be considered to be a measure or correlate of primary productivity and therefore resource availability in the Antarctic marine food web. Penguins as top predators, are dependent on the productivity of lower trophic levels. Therefore, the high variation in productivity of the habitats throughout the 
   <span class="italic">Spheniscus</span> species distributional ranges may have led to the evolution of more efficient coupling in those species, compared to the stable environments of Emperor and Adélie penguins. For example, high variability in levels of Chl is observed within the range of 
   <span class="italic">S. humboldti</span>, and becomes further exacerbated during El Niño events, leading to a higher probability of mortality due to starvation. In this circumstance, selection may favor OXPHOS efficiency rather than heat production. During El Niño events, the upwelling of nutrients is interrupted, reducing food availability and increasing water temperature in Chilean-Peruvian waters [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95" href="#CR95">95</a>]. This affects fish abundance, causing increased Galapagos and Humboldt penguin mortality, nest desertion and large-scale movements [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" href="#CR96">96</a>]. Although Chl could be an important variable for mtDNA evolution, only a weak correlation between Ka/Ks ratio of 
   <span class="italic">COXI</span> and Chl across small geographic scales was detected here. Therefore, our results should be further investigated in penguins not only at a species level, but also in populations of each penguin species across a gradient of sea surface temperatures (e.g. across latitudes) and chlorophyll levels.
  </p>
  <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although 
   <span class="italic">ATP8</span> was not correlated to SST and Chl here, the Ka/Ks ratio values were higher than in any other gene compared. Moreover, it showed a remarkable pattern for all comparisons among species distributed in extremely different environments (tropical and hot temperate climate versus polar climate). We found contrasting results for 
   <span class="italic">ATP8</span>. 
   <span class="italic">A. forsteri</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Spheniscus</span> had the lowest values for 
   <span class="italic">ATP8</span> genes in pairwise comparisons among all genera. This may be indicative of different mechanisms of adaptation among genes and species depending on their individual habitat requirements. However, we cannot discount the possibility that this gene is associated with other selective variables, which in turn are correlated with climatic and productive variations observed in the distributional ranges of penguins. Indeed, it was recently suggested that evolution of mitochondrial genes might be linked with pathogen variability [

  <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An increasing number of studies have implicated mitochondria with innate immune responses, including the control of apoptotic signaling, sterile inflammation, and antibacterial and antiviral response [

Antarctica and the tropics differ considerably in virulence, ensemble, abundance, development and diversity of pathogens. Just recently, the influenza virus was detected in penguins in Antarctica [

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106" href="#CR106">106</a>] has caused not only direct mortality. Increased mortality has also been attributed to compromised immune systems, since adequate nutrition is fundamental to maintaining a functioning immune system [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107" href="#CR107">107</a>]. The expanding human activities in Antarctica also increase the risk of introduction of infectious diseases into this naïve wildlife community [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108" href="#CR108">108</a>]. Therefore, selective pressures on mtDNA genes by environmental factors such as temperature, food availability and novel pathogens could intensify significantly with climate change.
