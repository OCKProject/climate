 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mitochondrial genomes were assembled with the Denovo2 pipeline developed by Life Technologies using Velvet assembler version 1.2.09 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>] in color-space mode. ASiD (Assembly Assistant for SOLiD) was used to fill gaps between contigs that formed scaffolds and to perform a color-space to base-space translation for the final assembly. Individual genes were selected from each of the penguins’ contigs using Sequencher software 5.1 (Gene Codes Corp., MI) and annotated by homology with genes of mitogenomes of the penguins previously published [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>]. Due to the low number of reads from one individual of 
  <span class="italic">P. papua</span> (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>), this individual was not included in the data analyses. All 11 mitogenome were submitted to GenBank (accession numbers KM891593; KU361803-KU361806; KU356673-KU356677).
