 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our study, the Ka/Ks ratio for 
  <span class="italic">ATP8</span> was lower than 1, suggesting negative selection for the gene, although it was higher than any other value for mtDNA genes in penguins. However, one codon of 
  <span class="italic">ATP8</span> (Complex V) showed evidence of positive selection (under model FEL). Complex V (or ATP synthase) is the final enzyme in the OXPHOS pathway and is ubiquitous throughout all forms of life and biological functions. The enzyme uses the energy stored in a proton gradient across a membrane to drive the synthesis of ATP from ADP and phosphate. Complex V uses the proton gradient resulting from the activity of the respiratory chain enzymes complexes I, III and IV for ATP synthesis, generating 95% of cellular ATP. Complex V is a multi-subunit complex with two functional domains, F1 and F0, for which 
  <span class="italic">ATP8</span> encodes a core subunit of the F0 component. Across mammalian evolution, 
  <span class="italic">ATP6</span> is more conserved, in contrast to the 
  <span class="italic">ATP8</span> subunit which has some highly variable sites with extreme amino acid changes of properties, suggesting that there are differences in its regulatory function among species [
