 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The general pattern of Ka/Ks ratios for the different genes was similar between pairwise species at inter-genera comparisons (
  <span class="italic">Spheniscus, Pygoscelis, Eudyptula, Eudyptes, Aptenodytes;</span> Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>; see Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a> Table S1). The Ka/Ks ratios were all &lt;1 (values under 1 suggest negative selection and over 1 positive selection using this method). 
  <span class="italic">ATP8</span> had the highest values and variability of Ka/Ks ratio among all species comparison between genera (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>) with values between 0.1 and 0.4. 
  <span class="italic">ATP8</span> Ka/Ks ratios were lower between 
  <span class="italic">Pygoscelis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Spheniscus</span> (0.09 to 0.15), and between 
  <span class="italic">A. forsteri</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Spheniscus</span> (0.14 to 0.16). High 
  <span class="italic">ATP8</span> Ka/Ks ratios were observed between

 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Markedly low values of Ka/Ks ratios were found for within and between pairwise genera comparisons and were observed for 
  <span class="italic">COX1</span>, followed by 
  <span class="italic">COX2, COX3</span> and 
  <span class="italic">ND1</span>, suggesting negative selection (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). In the intragenus comparisons, the Ka/Ks ratios were zero for 
  <span class="italic">COX1</span>, 
  <span class="italic">ND3</span> and 
  <span class="italic">ND4L</span> among all 
  <span class="italic">Spheniscus</span> species and were also low for 
  <span class="italic">COX2</span>, 
  <span class="italic">ND1</span> and 
  <span class="italic">COX3</span>. Similarly, within 
  <span class="italic">Pygoscelis</span> comparisons, Ka/Ks ratios were lowest for 
  <span class="italic">COX1</span>, followed by 
  <span class="italic">COX3, COX2, ND1</span> and 
  <span class="italic">ATP6</span>. Therefore, 
  <span class="italic">COX1</span> had a signature of purifying selection for amino acid sequence conservation for all pairwise comparisons among penguin genera and species.

 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similar results were detected using the SLAC, REL and FEL algorithms. Overall, significant levels of positive selection were detected for 69 different codon sites in four genes (
  <span class="italic">COX1</span>, 
  <span class="italic">ATP8</span>, 
  <span class="italic">ND4L, ND4</span>). Only one codon was under positive selection for 
  <span class="italic">ND4</span> using SLAC (codon 187) and one codon for 
  <span class="italic">ATP8</span> (codon 36) using FEL. We detected a large number of codons under positive selection for 
  <span class="italic">COX1</span> (a total of 39 codons) and 28 codons for 
  <span class="italic">ND4L</span> using REL. Although REL methods have higher power and are more computationally intensive than SLAC methods of detecting selection, they have higher rates of false positives with small data sets [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">71</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" href="#CR84">84</a>]. FEL approaches appear to be more robust with fewer sequences than REL and SLAC that may underestimate the substitution rate [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">71</a>]. Indeed, no codon had positive and significant values by SLAC for 
  <span class="italic">ATP8</span>. The largest number of codons with positive, but not significant signatures were identified for this gene using this method (18% of codons), in contrast with patterns observed in other genes (1.4% in 
  <span class="italic">COX1</span> to 11% in 
  <span class="italic">ND2, ND5</span> and 
  <span class="italic">ND6</span>, Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>, 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). Low values of negative selection were obtained for 
  <span class="italic">ATP8</span> and 
  <span class="italic">ND4L</span> using SLAC and FEL, and the most significant values were obtained for 
  <span class="italic">COX1</span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). We identified 375 codons with significant negative selection using SLAC algorithms and 1787 codons using FEL algorithms. All of the codons identified by SLAC overlapped with those identified using FEL algorithms. We did not detect lineages under positive selection using a Branch REL analysis based on the phylogeny.
