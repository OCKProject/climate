 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sequences were aligned and polymorphic sites were confirmed by visual review of the chromatograms using Sequencher v. 5.1. (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and multiple alignments were done using ClustalX v. 2.1 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>]. For interspecific data analysis we compared the eleven mtDNA genomes with four other penguins genomes: 
  <span class="italic">S. demersus</span> obtained from KwaZulu-Natal Province of South Africa (African penguin) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>], 
  <span class="italic">E. minor</span> obtained from Nelson in New Zealand (Little blue penguin) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>], 
  <span class="italic">E. chrysocome</span> (Rockhopper penguin) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>] and 
  <span class="italic">A. forsteri</span> (Emperor penguin) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>].

 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The number of indels, polymorphic sites (S), nucleotide diversity (π), synonymous mutation rates (Ks), nonsynonymous mutation rates (Ka) and the Ka/Ks (or ω) ratio using the DNAsp v. 5 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>] were estimated for all 13 protein-coding genes from the complete mtDNA. For analyses of the reading frame of the genes, such as Ka/Ks, only the 
  <span class="italic">ND3</span> gene was considered a different reading frame as described by Mindell et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>]. All Ka and Ks estimates and corresponding ratios were obtained between pairwise species within 
  <span class="italic">Spheniscus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Pygoscelis</span> genera, as well as between all five genera (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a> Table S1). Since we sequenced several species of 
  <span class="italic">Spheniscus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Pygoscelis</span> genera, the values between genera were averages of the pairwise species Ka and Ks values for the genera comparison. We also calculated the pairwise distance between all 15 penguins studied here (10 species) for all 13 concatenated genes of the mtDNA genomes using the Maximun Likelihood model (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">2</a> Table S2) with Mega v. 6.06 software [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>] and Arlequin software in R package [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>]. All positions containing gaps were eliminated, remaining a total of 10,874 positions in the final dataset.

 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phylogenetic reconstruction was used to evaluate selection on each codon, gene and phylogenetic branch. We combined each of the 13 protein-coding genes from the mtDNA genome from the studied penguin species into a concatenated data set of 11,409 bp. The phylogeny was also estimated excluding the 
  <span class="italic">ND6</span> gene (a total of 10,886 bp), which is encoded by the light-strand [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>] and has a significantly different base composition from the heavy-chain [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">65</a>]. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred using Bayesian inference methods (BA) with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling as implemented in MrBayes v. 3.1.2 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">66</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>]. The evolutionary model selected GTR + I + G, using jModelTest v. 0.1.1 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">68</a>] and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The Mr. Bayes analyses were run for one million generations while sampling every 100 generations. At this point the standard deviation of split frequencies was &lt;0.01, indicating that both runs had converged. Phylogenetic reconstructions were visualized using Figtree v. 1.2.2 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">69</a>]. Although positive selection is frequently inferred by genetic data analysis as Ka/Ks &gt; 1 (and purifying selection by Ka/Ks &lt; 1) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" href="#CR70">70</a>], a gene with Ka/Ks lower than 1 may show signature of positive selection at codon level. Evidence for signatures of selection at codon sites was evaluated for each gene with the concatenated data set using the BA phylogeny and the selected model of evolution without outgroups with the three algorithms available in HyPhy software [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">71</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">73</a>]. For comparison, we used the Single Likelihood Ancestral Counting (SLAC), Fixed-Effects Likelihood (FEL) and the Random Effects Likelihood (REL) methods using the best fit nucleotide model [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">71</a>]. The single likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC) method is based on weighting across all possible ancestral reconstructions, or employs sampling from ancestral reconstructions. The fixed effects likelihood (FEL) method estimates nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates at each site. Random effects likelihood (REL) models variation in nonsynonymous and synonymous rates across sites based on a predefined distribution, where a Bayesian approach are used to infer selection pressure at an individual site [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">71</a>]. We also performed the branch Site REL [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">72</a>] analysis in HyPhy software to estimate branch-specific episodes of positive selection along the phylogeny.
