 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) is under continuous selection since the 13 protein-coding genes produce polypeptide products that work in association with nuclear-encoded subunits of protein complexes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]. Three types of hypotheses have been proposed to explain mitogenome evolution: 1) mitochondrial OXPHOS generates both energy and heat, and environmental temperature imposes a selective trade off between ATP production and heat [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>]; 2) risk of starvation is associated with restricted food availability, since starvation can generate more efficient coupling of energy production by OXPHOS pathway [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]; 3) a more recent and debated hypothesis of immune response to pathogens [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>]. Therefore, chlorophyll (Chl), as a measurement of primary productivity [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>], and sea surface temperature (SST), are important environmental variables for marine organisms that are directly related to the efficiency of the OXPHOS and relevant to understanding mtDNA gene selection patterns. As OXPHOS is the terminal stage of cellular respiration, disruption of this process will be lethal for individual cells and if it occurs widely in an individual, it will adversely impact its fitness [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. Consequently, the mitochondrial genome on one hand evolves under continuous purifying selection (or negative selection) that removes deleterious variation from populations [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>], while on the other hand, beneficial variation in extreme temperature environments may be under positive selection, increasing in frequency in a population or species. It is possible that selection may operate similarly among species in similar environments or it may drive adaptations in different genes.
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Patterns of adaptation in the mtDNA of organisms have been evaluated mostly at the population level by associating each population or lineage with local climatic conditions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>]; however, only relatively few have incorporated environmental data in the genetic analyses and generally only using nuclear genes or whole-genome data [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>]. Environmental temperature is the main variable that has been linked to selection in mtDNA genes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>], along with altitude [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>] and oxygen availability [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>]. Although most studies on the role of selection on mtDNA genome evolution in vertebrate species have focused on mammals at the intraspecific level [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>], recently there has been an increased focus on birds [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>]. Here, we provide one of the first species-level analyses in birds linking patterns of mtDNA selection with environmental variables (temperature, chlorophyll) which are associated with the evolution of this genome. Chlorophyll (Chl) is an excellent indirect measurement of food availability because primary productivity is associated with species distributions at trophic levels, including krill and penguins [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Penguins inhabit a broad latitudinal distribution in the Southern Hemisphere from the tropics to the extreme cold of the Antarctic. While all penguin species can live and forage at sea in cold, nutrient-rich water (including those breeding on the Galapagos Islands), they breed on land under varying climatic conditions. The northernmost species is the Galapagos penguin (
  <span class="italic">Spheniscus mendiculus</span>), while the southernmost distributed species, the Adélie penguin (
  <span class="italic">P. adeliae</span>) and Emperor penguin (
  <span class="italic">Aptenodytes forsteri</span>)
  <span class="italic">,</span> breed in the Antarctic, south of the Antarctic Convergence (Polar Front). Emperor penguins breed on stable fast ice during the Antarctic winter when temperatures drop regularly to −50 °C. As the evolution, speciation and extinction of penguins are closely related to historical climatic changes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>], the broad distribution of penguins, which includes different and extreme climatic conditions, provides a unique opportunity to identify molecular genetic patterns associated with these climatic conditions.
 </p>
 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used Next Generation Sequencing approaches to study patterns of selection in the mitochondrial genome of penguins from two genera (
  <span class="italic">Spheniscus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Pygoscelis</span>) and correlated the results with remote sensing spatial data for each species from throughout their distribution (sea surface temperature, chlorophyll levels, and both variables combined). The four 
  <span class="italic">Spheniscus</span> penguin species are distributed along the coast of southern Africa (African penguin 
  <span class="italic">S. demersus</span>) and along the South America coast from Galapagos Islands in the tropics (Galapagos penguin 
  <span class="italic">S. mendiculus</span>) to southern Patagonia (Humboldt 
  <span class="italic">S. humbodti</span> and Magellanic penguin 
  <span class="italic">S. magellanicus</span>) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Galapagos and Humboldt penguin populations have experienced high mortality rates [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>] and decreased breeding success [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>] from increased water temperatures during El Niño Southern Oscillations (ENSO) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>]. The three 
  <span class="italic">Pygoscelis</span> penguins breed on sub-Antarctic islands and the coast of Antarctica and they have sympatric distributions in the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). The Gentoo penguin (
  <span class="italic">P. papua</span>) has the northernmost range in the genus, with a distribution along sub-Antarctic Islands and the Antarctic Peninsula. The Chinstrap penguin (
  <span class="italic">P. antarcticus</span>) has a more southern distribution, almost exclusively around the Antarctic peninsula. The Adélie penguin is the most southern and pagophilic species, with a circumpolar distribution [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>]. Over the last decades climate change has impacted the WAP, increasing sea surface temperatures (SST) and changing patterns of penguin food availability (e.g. krill) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>]. Concurrently, Adélie and Chinstrap penguin populations have been decreasing, while Gentoo penguin populations have increased in numbers and distributions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>].

 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Historical climate changes have been linked with penguin species diversification. Severe declines in Antarctic temperature that began approximately 12 mya coincide with the divergence of the four major penguin groups, around 11–16 mya [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>]. This penguin phylogeny is well characterized, making it possible to assess evidence of selection and adaptive evolution of the mtDNA and to explore possible links with environmental changes, including genes involved in penguin thermal adaptation. Sequences of entire mitochondrial genomes are available for five of the 18 extant species of penguins [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>], including the Adélie, Chinstrap, African, Little
  <span class="italic">,</span> and Southern Rockhopper (
  <span class="italic">E. chrysocome</span>) penguins and more recently the entire genome became available for the Adélie and Emperor penguin [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>]
  <span class="italic">.</span> The mtDNA genome of 
  <span class="italic">P. antarcticus</span> consists of 15,972 bp and has 94% identity with its sister species 
  <span class="italic">P. adeliae</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>]. Subramanian et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>] compared the mitochondrial genomes of modern and ancient (up to 44,000 years old) 
  <span class="italic">P. adeliae</span>, documenting higher evolutionary rates than described earlier by phylogenetic studies. However, those studies evaluated the genome without a broader comparative approach to understand the evolution of the group and assess the evidence of signatures of selection on the mitochondrial genome.
 </p>
 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We hypothesize that selection operates differentially on the mtDNA coding genes of penguin species in response to environmental variables. We evaluated variation in mitochondrial genomes at different taxonomic levels in seven species of penguins from South America and Africa (all four 
  <span class="italic">Spheniscus</span> species) and Antarctica (all three 
  <span class="italic">Pygoscelis</span> species). We then compared our results with two penguin species from temperate and sub-Antarctic regions (
  <span class="italic">E. minor and E. chrysocome</span>) and with 
  <span class="italic">A. forsteri</span>, which survives and breeds during the most-extreme cold conditions of the Antarctic winter. We evaluated evolutionary rates and signatures of natural selection for all 13 mtDNA protein-coding genes and across the mtDNA genome phylogeny for the penguin species. Lastly, we assessed the genetic data for each gene against the spatial environmental data (sea surface temperature, chlorophyll and both variables combined) from remote sensing and GIS databases for each species along its distributional range.
