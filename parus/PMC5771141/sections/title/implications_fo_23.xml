 <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ongoing human-induced climatic changes are predicted to have large impacts on the world biota, including penguin species [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" href="#CR100">100</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">Pygoscelis</span> species appear to be changing their distributions. 
  <span class="italic">P. papua</span> populations have been increasing along the Antarctic Peninsula in association with an abrupt increase of water temperatures, while populations of 
  <span class="italic">P. adeliae</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. antarcticus</span> have been decreasing [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>]. The decline and disappearance of an 
  <span class="italic">A. forsteri</span> colony was associated with the rise in local mean annual air temperature and decline in seasonal sea ice duration [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101" href="#CR101">101</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">S. magellanicus</span> populations have experienced increasing reproductive failure, measured in chicks’ mortality associated with starvation, rain, heat, and predation, which has been associated with climate change and an increase in frequency and intensity of storms [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102" href="#CR102">102</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">S. humboldti</span> and 
  <span class="italic">S. mendiculus</span> have been historically affected by strong El Niño events causing high mortality, nesting delay, nest flooding and breeding failure [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" href="#CR96">96</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103" href="#CR103">103</a>]. El Niño events are becoming more intense and frequent due to global climate change [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104" href="#CR104">104</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105" href="#CR105">105</a>]. The decreasing food availability for penguins in South America during El Niño events [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95" href="#CR95">95</a>], and for penguins in Antarctica during the past 50 years [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106" href="#CR106">106</a>] has caused not only direct mortality. Increased mortality has also been attributed to compromised immune systems, since adequate nutrition is fundamental to maintaining a functioning immune system [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107" href="#CR107">107</a>]. The expanding human activities in Antarctica also increase the risk of introduction of infectious diseases into this naïve wildlife community [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108" href="#CR108">108</a>]. Therefore, selective pressures on mtDNA genes by environmental factors such as temperature, food availability and novel pathogens could intensify significantly with climate change.

 <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effect of climate change on gene evolution does not have to be direct. As penguins are top marine predators, changes at all trophic levels will affect penguin population demography [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109" href="#CR109">109</a>]. However, understanding the genes involved in adaptation to climate by penguin species may permit us to predict how the species are physiologically limited and how they may be able to respond to environmental changes such as climate warming.
