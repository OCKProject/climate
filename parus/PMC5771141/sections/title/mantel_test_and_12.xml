 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mantel tests and GLM models (Generalized Linear Model) were implemented to explore the relationships between distance matrices of genetic parameters (
  <span class="italic">π</span> and 
  <span class="italic">ka/ks</span>) and environmental parameters (Chl, SST and COM) as explanatory variables [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">81</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" href="#CR82">82</a>]. To study the relationship between genetic patterns and the environmental parameters (the distances across Chl, SST and COM dimension), the Mantel matrix distances were divided into three sub-matrices (Example in Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM3">3</a> Table S3), each describing the patterns between pairs of species within a bounded interval of Chl, SST and COM distances [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">81</a>]. These bounded intervals consisted of a) short pairwise distances corresponding with the minimum to 33% of the data distance, b) middle distances corresponding with pairwise distances between 33% and 66% of the data distance, c) large distances consisting of the largest 33% of the pairwise distances and d) all pairwise data. For Mantel tests, 
  <span class="italic">p-values</span> were obtained based on 10,000 simulations. Normality of the data (Ka/Ks and π) was tested applying the Shapiro-Wilk test. The GLMs 
  <span class="italic">p-values</span> and AICs were calculated considering a Gaussian error structure for all data under normal distribution and gamma error structure for data without normal distribution. All statistical analyses were implemented using R packages [
