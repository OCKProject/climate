 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The color-space reads (di-base encoded) were aligned with LifeScopeâ„¢ (Applied Biosystems) using the genome assembly of 
  <span class="italic">P. adeliae</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>] as a reference. The reference was translated into color-space with the aim of mapping the reads. The color-space reads helped to improve the quality of each base call, since each base was read twice during the sequencing step.

 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The consensus sequence was built from the binary alignment map (BAM) files obtained in the previous step. We used SAMtools [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>] to obtain all bases mapped to each position, BCF tools to get the most probable genotype per position, and VCF utils to build the consensus sequence in FASTQ format. The FASTQ file was then converted to FASTA using SEQTK.
