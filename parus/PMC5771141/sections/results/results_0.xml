 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We identified the complete mtDNA genomes of several penguin species, including 
  <span class="italic">ND6</span> and 8 tRNAs on the light strand and 12 protein coding genes, 14 tRNAs and two rRNAs positioned on the heavy strand. The highest diversity was found in NADH dehydrogenase genes and the lowest in 
  <span class="italic">COX</span> genes. The lowest evolutionary divergence among species was between Humboldt (
  <span class="italic">Spheniscus humboldti</span>) and Galapagos (
  <span class="italic">S. mendiculus</span>) penguins (0.004)
  <span class="italic">,</span> while the highest was observed between little penguin (
  <span class="italic">Eudyptula minor</span>) and Adélie penguin (
  <span class="italic">Pygoscelis adeliae</span>) (0.097). We identified a signature of purifying selection (Ka/Ks &lt; 1) across the mitochondrial genome, which is consistent with the hypothesis that purifying selection is constraining mitogenome evolution to maintain Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) proteins and functionality. Pairwise species maximum-likelihood analyses of selection at codon sites suggest positive selection has occurred on 
  <span class="italic">ATP8</span> (Fixed-Effects Likelihood, FEL) and 
  <span class="italic">ND4</span> (Single Likelihood Ancestral Counting, SLAC) in all penguins. In contrast, 
  <span class="italic">COX1</span> had a signature of strong negative selection. 
  <span class="italic">ND4</span> Ka/Ks ratios were highly correlated with SST (Mantel, 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-value: 0.0001; GLM, 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-value: 0.00001) and thus may be related to climate adaptation throughout penguin speciation.
