  <p>Results of signature of selection in the penguin mtDNA genome. Ribosomal RNAs (blue), Transfer RNAs (green and purple lines), Protein-coding genes with the oxidative phosphorylation system complex are represented by different colors. 
   <span class="italic">ND6*</span> is transcribed from the light strand. Percentage of codons under negative selection is shown for each gene and numbers in blue highlight the relatively low percentage for ATP8. Each star represents codons under significant positive selection as determined by FEL (yellow star) and REL (orange star) in ATP8 and ND4 genes. Ka/Ks ratio for ND4 is correlated with superficial surface temperature and COX1 for chlorophyll levels. The four graphics around the genome indicate with red arrows the highest and lowest for Ka/Ks ratio comparison between species from different genus for each of the four genes under selection. COX1 and ND4 highest Ka/Ks values are associated with pairwise ratio between species from different climates, and lowest among those from similar climates. With ATP8, highest Ka/Ks values were associated with pairwise ratios between species from similar climates and lowest among those from from distinct climates. Scale for graphic of ND3 and ATP8 genes are Ka/Ks from 0 to 1, and for COX1 and ND4 are from 0 to 0.1. By Juan Pablo Bravo
