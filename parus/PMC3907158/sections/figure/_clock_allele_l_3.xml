  <p>Within each subspecies group for which we have multiple sampling locations, there is a trend for populations that migrate a longer distance to have longer 
   <span class="italic">CLOCK</span> alleles. Figure shows mean and standard error for Oregon juncos listed by breeding grounds (panel A; ANOVA, p = 0.056) and slate-colored juncos listed by wintering grounds (panel B; ANOVA, p = 0.18; see text for details). Population migration scores are shown in parentheses with higher numbers indicating populations that migrate longer distances (see 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">Table 1</a> for more details).
