 <p>Plot shows individual migratory restlessness score for Oregon juncos against the mean length of the 
  <span class="italic">CLOCK</span> alleles from the migratory population at Laguna Mountain, CA, USA (solid circles) and the sedentary population in San Diego, CA, USA (open circles). Points are slightly jittered for each population to improve visualization. There is no significant relationship between 
  <span class="italic">CLOCK</span> length and migratory restlessness.
