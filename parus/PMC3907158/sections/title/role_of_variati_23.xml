 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Migratory behavior is a complex phenotype consisting of changes to movement, orientation, feeding, fattening, and sleep patterns 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-53">53</a>
  </span>, and therefore may be modulated by many genes. The fact that 
  <span class="italic">CLOCK</span> and 
  <span class="italic">ADCYAP1</span> are related to migration in several systems suggests that they may be some of the key regulators. However, the large component of migratory behavior that is not explained by these genes may be related to other genes in related pathways. Changes in these other, related genes may thus reduce or modify the effect of 
  <span class="italic">CLOCK</span> and 
  <span class="italic">ADCYAP1</span> on migratory behavior, and explain the pattern of relationships identified in both previous studies

  </span> (described above) and this work. Similar patterns have been found for other complex traits such as response to stress, including in experimental evolution of yeast 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-63" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-63">63</a>
  </span>. Despite similar repeated phenotypes, independently evolved lineages did not duplicate the same transcriptional (and therefore genetic) responses to a novel stressor 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-63" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-63">63</a>
  </span>. This suggests that divergent 
  <span class="italic">Junco</span> populations may have utilized unique genetic mechanisms to achieve the same phenotypic end, thus masking the role of any single candidate gene across the genus.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Differences in genetic background may explain the lack of genus-wide patterns of relationship between migratory phenotype and 
  <span class="italic">CLOCK</span> or 
  <span class="italic">ADCYAP1</span> and the pattern of relationship found in previous studies. If other, as yet unidentified, genes also contribute to divergence in migratory and breeding behavior, then the relationships identified between phenotype and genotype would be limited to the groups or species in which 
  <span class="italic">CLOCK</span> or 
  <span class="italic">ADCYAP1</span> are responsible for the divergence. In contrast, those species and populations that do not demonstrate a relationship between migratory phenotype and 
  <span class="italic">CLOCK</span> or 
  <span class="italic">ADCYAP1</span> may have diverged due to changes in other genes. These genes might be involved in the circadian pathway, such as 
  <span class="italic">BMAL1</span> or 
  <span class="italic">Period 2</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-64" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-64">64</a>
  </span>; the sensing of photoperiod changes, such as thyroid hormone deiodinases 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-65" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-65">65</a>
  </span> or vertebrate ancient opsin 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-66" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-66">66</a>
  </span>; or transcriptional regulation of these systems 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-67" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-67">67</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Differences in genetic background may also explain the details of the relationships found between migratory phenotype and 
  <span class="italic">CLOCK</span> or 
  <span class="italic">ADCYAP1</span>. The Oregon and slate-colored subspecies groups both demonstrate a positive relationship between 
  <span class="italic">CLOCK</span> allele length and migratory behavior. Importantly, the population mean 
  <span class="italic">CLOCK</span> allele lengths are not different between the subspecies groups, and all of the slate-colored juncos migrate longer distances than the Oregon juncos. Similarly, allele length of 
  <span class="italic">ADCYAP1</span> predicts migratory restlessness in the altitudinal migrant Laguna Mountain population, but not in the sedentary San Diego population despite the fact that both populations exhibit variation at the locus and in migratory restlessness. While sedentary populations are known to exhibit seasonal migratory restlessness 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-68" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-68">68</a>
  </span>, it is possible that changes in other genes inhibit migration in this sedentary population sufficiently to overwhelm the variation in restlessness contributed by 
  <span class="italic">ADCYAP1</span>. Together, these results suggest that variation in other genes across the genus account for some of the shifts in migratory phenotype, but that 
  <span class="italic">CLOCK</span> and 
  <span class="italic">ADCYAP1</span> may still play important roles in further modification of migratory behavior.
