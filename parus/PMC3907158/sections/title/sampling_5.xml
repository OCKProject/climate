 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analysis of population differences in genotype was conducted using DNA collected between 1996–2010 from adult juncos that were captured from breeding or wintering populations as a part of other studies. Less than 100 μL of whole blood was collected via capilary tube from a small puncture in the alar vein for future extraction. Both males and females were included, and in all populations in which sexes were known, the sexes did not differ in allele length for either locus (t-test, all p &gt; 0.1). Birds sampled in their winter range were captured from December through February, after juncos are thought to have arrived at their wintering grounds and before they have departed in the spring

  </span>. All individuals from breeding locations were captured as adults during the breeding season of that population. No known siblings were included in these analyses.
