 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found no evidence for a predictable relationship between migratory behavior and the lengths of 
  <span class="italic">CLOCK</span> or 
  <span class="italic">ADCYAP1</span> alleles across the genus 
  <span class="italic">Junco</span>. However, we found some support for a role of 
  <span class="italic">CLOCK</span> allele length within subspecies groups, and 
  <span class="italic">ADCYAP1</span> allele length within a population, in modifying migratory behavior. The lack of consistent detectable associations between allelic variation and behavioral variation among populations and individuals as reported in our study, adds an important layer in further understanding the potential roles of candidate genes in complex ecological and evolutionary processes. To explore this layer further, future sequencing projects may wish to similarly consider both between-group and within-group variability in genotype-phenotype relationships when conducting analyses of other candidate genes.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Focusing on variation in a small number of genes with predicted functional significance holds the potential to identify major functional hubs in complex phenotypes across the animal kingdom. The redundancy of the genome and complexity of functional genetic, regulatory, and signaling networks, however, means that over evolutionary time scales, candidate loci may gain or lose functional significance in the presence of an alternative environment, linkage, or genetic background. Our results highlight the fact that different mechanisms may contribute to variation in complex phenotypes when examining populations or species. This does not mean that candidate gene approaches should be abandoned altogether. Rather, with the increasing availability of next-generation sequencing, it may become more efficient to expand the scope of candidate gene sequencing projects to include other genes in the same pathway, as this breadth may provide insight into other, as yet unidentified, genetic mechanisms.</p>
