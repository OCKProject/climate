 <p>
  <span class="italic">ADCYAP1</span> allele length did not differ between populations within the sub-species for which we have multiple sampling locations. Shown are means and standard errors for Oregon juncos listed by breeding grounds (panel A) and slate-colored juncos listed by wintering grounds (panel B). Population migration scores are shown in parentheses with higher numbers indicating populations that migrate longer distances (see
