  <span class="italic">CLOCK</span> alleles differ by multiples of three base pairs ( 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T4" href="#T4">Table 4</a>), consistent with previous results in other avian species (e.g., Johnsen 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-18">18</a>
  </span>, Steinmeyer 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-43">43</a>
  </span>) and with the location of the repeat within the coding region of 
  <span class="italic">CLOCK</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-43">43</a>
  </span>. It has previously been suggested that presence in the coding region might make these polymorphisms functional 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-18">18</a>
  </span>, particularly because the repeat is responsible for a polyglutamine tract expansion in a region known to control the rate at which the 
  <span class="italic">CLOCK</span> protein activates the downstream circadian pathway 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-60" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-60">60</a>
  </span>. Polyglutamine expansions control the activity of many genes (e.g., Chamberlain 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-61" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-61">61</a>
  </span>). Thus, variation in allele length could play a direct role in modifying migratory behavior by altering the threshold day length signal to activate or suspend migratory behavior, or by modifying its downstream effects.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 
  <span class="italic">ADCYAP1</span> alleles varied primarily by 2 base pairs ( 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T3" href="#T3">Table 3</a>), consistent with previous results and the fact that this microsatellite polymorphism falls within the 3´ untranslated region (UTR) of the 
  <span class="italic">ADCYAP1</span> gene 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-24">24</a>, 
   <a rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-43">43</a>
  </span>. The mechanism by which this variation may relate to behavioral differences remains unknown. Di-nucleotide repeats in the regulatory regions of genes, such as 3´ UTR, can modify the expression of a gene 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-62" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-62">62</a>
  </span>. This polymorphism may simply be linked with another causative mutation in the coding region 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-24">24</a>
  </span>. The amino acid code of 
  <span class="italic">ADCYAP1</span>, however, is 97% conserved from humans to chickens 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-28">28</a>
  </span>, making 3´ UTR based variation in expression far more likely than a polymorphic variation in protein sequence. Studies of 
  <span class="italic">in vivo</span> expression of various alleles in multiple tissues would be necessary to confirm a role for this mutation in modifying the expression of 
  <span class="italic">ADCYAP1</span> in living animals.
