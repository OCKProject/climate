 <p>Plot shows mean allele length of 
  <span class="italic">ADCYAP1</span> against individual migratory restlessness score for Oregon juncos from the migratory population at Laguna Mountain, CA, USA (solid circles, solid line) and the sedentary population in San Diego, CA, USA (open circles, dashed line). Mean allele length marginally predicts migratory behavior in the Laguna Mountain, but not San Diego, populations.
