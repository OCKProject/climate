 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the metafor package [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">73</a>] in R 3.0.2 to perform the meta-analyses and estimate a pooled effect size for each reproductive parameter and explanatory variable. In all meta-analyses, we controlled for repeated observations on the same species from the same study area by including Study ID as a random variable in the models. We also controlled for correlated structures due to shared phylogenetic history by specifying a phylogenetic correlation matrix of the species included in the meta-analysis and including Species as a random variable in our models (see Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM4">4</a> for the phylogenetic bird trees used and their characteristics). Variation in response magnitudes among bird types was confirmed by the heterogeneity statistics 
  <span class="italic">Q</span> computed on the laying date, clutch size and breeding success datasets (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">2</a>). The following additional procedures also helped minimising the risk of pseudo-replication in the datasets: (i) each type of reproductive parameter was analysed separately, thereby avoiding the inclusion of several parameters taken from the same species or study area in the same dataset, (ii) in cases where the same reproductive parameters were measured on the same species over several years, an average effect size was calculated over all study years, (iii) in cases where a study tested different food qualities or supplementation timings on the same species, we selected the experiment with the highest effect size. In all meta-analyses, effect sizes were weighted by the inverse of their within-variance. Mean effect sizes showed significant effects of food addition when their 95% confidence intervals did not overlap zero. Model convergence was checked by inspecting the profile of the maximum restricted log-likelihood of the full models.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, we estimated the overall effects of food supplementation on seven reproductive parameters, namely laying date (n = 41 experiments), clutch size (n = 46), egg size (n = 26), hatching success (n = 18), brood size (n = 5), chick body mass (n = 21) and breeding success (n = 38), by performing weighted random-effect meta-analyses without fixed explanatory variables (i.e., null random models). Second, we tested the effect of several explanatory variables on laying date, clutch size and breeding success (i.e., parameters for which 
  <span class="italic">N</span> ≥ 30), separately. For laying date, we tested the effect of migratory status, broodedness, diet, accessibility to the feed, latitude and elevation. Meta-analyses for clutch size tested the effect of caching behaviour, maximal clutch size, body mass, accessibility to the feed, diet and latitude. Explanatory variables for breeding success included caching behaviour, accessibility to the feed, timing of food addition, diet and body mass. For each analysis, we constructed a set of models that included all possible combinations of explanatory variables. We used conditional Akaike’s Information Criterion, corrected for small sample size (AICc), to compare the goodness of fit among models. Models were ranked in relation to each other using ∆AICc values. AICc weights (
  <span class="italic">w</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">i</span>
  </sub>) were calculated to assess the relative likelihood of each model considered. Finally, we used multi-model inference to quantify the relative explanatory importance of variables over the set of candidate models. Variable weights were calculated as the sum of AICc weights of all the models including a given variable.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The background level of resources can affect the magnitude of the bird response to food supplementation (e.g., [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>]; see also 
  <a rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec2">Results</a>) but only 18 studies (out of 82) monitored or commented on the natural resource levels in their study area for the whole study period. For the 41 studies conducted over several years, we remained conservative in our approach and calculated an average effect size over the whole study period. Studies that were performed within one year and did not report the background level of resources (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 38) were assumed to be conducted under average environmental conditions. Three studies reported experiments only at a persistently and distinctly lower [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">74</a>] (poor quality habitat with low prey densities) or higher [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" href="#CR75">75</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" href="#CR76">76</a>] (peak of main prey abundance in rodent specialised predators) background level of resources than average and were discarded to avoid biasing the analyses. Therefore, we made sure that the effect sizes used in all the above-mentioned meta-analyses matched averaged environmental conditions. The final sample size for the analyses described above was 195 experiments from 79 studies (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM3">3</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Third, we explored the effect of varying background levels of food resources (lower/higher than average, as stated in the original publications) on the success of food supplementation in a separate meta-analysis. Reproductive parameter (laying date, clutch size, breeding success) was included as a fixed covariate in the meta-analysis since responses to food supplementation varied across reproductive parameters (see 
  <a rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec2">Results</a>). This dataset consisted of 51 experiments from 18 studies (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM3">3</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, we examined the possibility of publication bias in our datasets by generating funnel and normal quantile plots (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM5">5</a>).
