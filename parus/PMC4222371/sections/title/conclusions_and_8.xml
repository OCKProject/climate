 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results confirm that food supply plays a crucial role in avian ecology and evolution, through its effects on individual behaviours and life-history traits. They also imply that the extent of food limitation varies across the multiple stages of bird reproductive cycle, but also across bird taxa and environmental conditions. Latitude appears to modulate the effect of food supplementation on bird reproduction: birds living at low latitudes may be more plastic in advancing their timing of breeding, as compared to birds breeding at higher latitudes where factors other than food may constrain life-history parameters. On the other hand, it has been suggested (in line with the “slow pace of life in the tropics” syndrome [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>]) that tropical resident birds should invest extra energy into self-maintenance rather than in immediate reproductive costs [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>], and the rare manipulative experiments to address the question of resource allocation trade-offs in the tropics have produced contrasting results (e.g., [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>]). Certainly, more food supplementation studies in tropical and equatorial environments are needed to be able to conclude on that matter. Comparative studies of closely-related bird species breeding in different environments will also help understanding how resource allocation changes along a latitudinal gradient.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our findings further revealed that the results of food supplementation experiments could be affected by inadequate experimental designs. This is directly relevant to situations where food supplementation is applied as a conservation tool to boost the breeding performance of endangered birds. For example, if the objective of a supplementary feeding program is to enhance the overall productivity of a bird population, we do not recommend delivering the food during the pre-laying or egg-laying period only as it can create a bottle-neck for the parents later in the breeding season, if the abundance of resources in the environment does not match the energy needs of the parents for rearing more chicks. Instead, we encourage conservation managers to extend the food delivery until the hatching or chick-rearing period. Furthermore, because food supplementation can alter the interactions between individuals and species, it is crucial to ensure that the risk of competition for the supplemented feed is limited. In species where males tend to monopolise the feeders, this issue can be mitigated either by using large numbers of feeders (e.g., 
  <span class="bold">
   <span class="italic">&gt;</span>
  </span>3 per territory) so that females can have unrestricted access to supplemental food, or by delivering the feed to the females directly. Moreover, delivering the food over large treatment areas (with small perimeter-area ratios) instead of small clumped areas, can reduce the flow of intruders and hence the relative effect of immigration (e.g., [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>]). Preventing non-target species or conspecifics from monopolising the supplemented food can be achieved by using feeders designed to supplement the feed to experimental animals only (e.g., automated feeders, [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>]). Given that the feed is often delivered 
  <span class="italic">ad libitum</span> over the entire experimental area, it can be difficult to identify which animals are utilising it and, hence, assess the effect of food on life-history parameters, such as reproduction, growth, condition, at the individual level. Recently, Robb 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>] have pointed out the potential for stable isotopes to trace the use of food supplements in animals and measure the variation in food use between recipient individuals. Alternatively, the use of radio frequency identification systems (RFID) can be useful in quantifying bird visits to feeders [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>]. Further research is also needed to test how the spatial dispersion of supplementary food (e.g., patchy vs. scattered; [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>]) affects intra- and inter-specific competition and, hence, the outcome of the food supplementation experiment. Supplementing endangered populations should, however, always be applied with caution as some recent studies have warned against potential adverse consequences of food supplementation on nestling health [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>] and sex-ratio [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>], breeding success [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>], and the carry-over effects of winter food provision on the investment in egg production [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another major issue related to the experimental design is the nutritional quality of the feed, which unfortunately could not be addressed in this review due to the lack of data provided by the studies included, but should be cautiously considered in future studies. Growing evidence suggests that the ecological impacts of food supplementation can depend on the specific nutritional profile of provisioned foods [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>] and that the energetic content of the food (in joules or calories) does not necessarily constitute an indicator of food quality [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>]. For example, the availability of essential amino acids [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">65</a>] and vitamins or antioxidants [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>] may constrain egg production in birds. The geometric framework for nutrition (see, e.g., [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">66</a>]) explores how animals simultaneously regulate the intake of multiple nutrients, and has recently been applied in birds [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>]. This modelling approach contributes further understanding of the relationships between the nutritional ratios of natural food and supplementary feeding, and reproduction in birds, and hence can assist with devising effective supplementary food to endangered species [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the large body of scientific literature on the impacts of food supply in bird life-history traits and reproductive strategies, some groups of birds and types of environments remain severely under-studied. Large-scale supplementation experiments, testing the effect of food addition on several populations or species of the same groups of birds in variable climates or environmental conditions, would be highly desirable. Finally, despite the accumulation of food supplementation studies over the past thirty years, most of this research has focused on immediate reproductive investments during the current breeding season; very little is known about the carry-over effects of food on offspring and parental survival when supplementation is finished, and about how food limitation may constrain future reproduction (but see [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">68</a>]).
