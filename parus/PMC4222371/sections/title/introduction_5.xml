 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Resource availability is an important determinant of the demography and distribution of many species, and it also affects energy allocation strategies in individuals. The energy involved to obtain food and process it is tightly related to the physiology and behaviour of animals, and the proportion of total energy and nutrients that is allocated to reproduction (i.e., reproductive effort) causes variation in life histories across individuals [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]. The importance of food limitation in nature continues to puzzle ecologists, as it can vary in time and across species, breeding stages and environments. Food limitation is likely less important in systems where predation or critical resources other than food keeps populations below their carrying capacity (e.g., [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>]). Conversely, food limitation can be inferred when a shortage of food or any critical nutrients results in lower reproductive performance and/or reduced survival [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>], that ultimately leads to a decline in growth rate of the focal population. Food limitation can have short (e.g., reproductive effort) and long-term (e.g., adult survival and future reproduction) life-history consequences. Variation in food availability in space and time is therefore an important cue for animals to adjust their reproductive decisions: it can provide information on where and when to breed, with whom to breed, and how much to invest in offspring (e.g., [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>]).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Birds have proven to be useful models in exploring the ecological and biological factors influencing the level of reproductive investment. Some evidence for the effects of food supply on the reproduction of bird populations comes from correlations where natural spatial or temporal variations in food availability have been linked to observed changes in population growth. For instance, the breeding success of specialised avian predators is closely correlated with the marked population fluctuations of their main prey, i.e., small rodents (e.g., [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>]). Moreover, heavy rainfalls in arid systems positively correlate with increases in bird fecundity, presumably via enhanced food supply (e.g., [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]). Other examples of resource pulse events (i.e., sudden large increases in food supply) that have triggered a reproductive response in birds include insect outbreaks [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>] and seed mast events [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While such correlations provide apparent evidence about the extent of food limitation in bird reproduction, they do not show causality. In addition, they are, in a sense, special cases as resource pulse events and prey population cycles generate highly contrasted levels of resource abundance, as opposed to more subtle differences in food availability that may be more difficult to identify. On the other hand, supplementary feeding of birds, which involves provisioning with types of foods in quantities that would not be available naturally, has proven to be a useful alternative method to quantitatively assess the importance of food supply in the reproductive decisions of wild bird populations, by taking into account potential confounding factors. In cases where food abundance in nature is used by birds as a cue for food conditions, manipulating food supply can experimentally address how environmental variation (in food supply) shapes life history [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effects of food supplementation on various components of bird reproduction have been experimentally studied in a variety of taxa and environments, and on various components of reproduction. However, the results have been somewhat equivocal: while most studies have reported advancements of laying dates, increases in chick growth rate and breeding success [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>], others have found no clear fitness benefits, e.g. no obvious effect on clutch size [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>], or have even described negative effects on clutch size and breeding success [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>]. The reasons for inconsistent results are not well known but may relate to the life-history traits of the species, the environmental conditions or the experimental design. The level of intra- and inter-specific competition for food, which can depend on the efficiency of the food delivery and the capacity of the recipient species to defend the food, might also explain the variable responses of birds to supplemented food [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reports on the effects of supplemental food on bird reproduction have primarily been qualitative or based on vote-counting [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>], thus general predictions about the effects of food supply on different components of reproduction across bird taxa and environments have not been tested quantitatively (but see [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>]). In addition, recent quantitative analyses on the relative effects of latitude, broodedness and migratory status on the advancement of laying date in response to food supplementation have revealed contrasting results, leading to some debate [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>]. In this paper we present a meta-analysis that synthesises the outcomes of food supplementation experiments on several bird reproductive parameters across 48 species. We specifically aim to (i) quantify the extent to which supplementary feeding induces an advancement of egg-laying and an increase in other components of the bird breeding cycle, i.e. clutch size, egg size, hatching success, brood size, chick body mass and breeding success (i.e., number of fledglings produced), and (ii) identify the key factors (including life-history traits, behavioural factors, environmental factors, experimental design) that can induce variation in laying date, clutch size and breeding success in response to food supplementation. These results will provide key-elements for a better understanding of the impact of food limitation on wild bird populations, and they can have important implications for the conservation of endangered populations whose long-term persistence might require food provisioning by practitioners.
