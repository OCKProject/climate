 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We searched for studies that tested the effects of experimental food supplementation on reproduction of birds by conducting a literature search on the Web of Science and Google Scholar using combinations of the following keywords: “experiment*”, “manipulat*”, “food”, “supplement*”, “feeding”, “addition”, “bird”, “reproduction” and “population”. We also screened the reference lists of all retrieved articles and previous reviews (e.g., [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>]) for other relevant publications. Searching ended in June 2013.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We restricted our search to food manipulations that provided sufficient data to calculate an effect size. When the means, error measurements or sample sizes were not provided in the publication, the authors were contacted. We discarded studies that reported the reproductive parameters of animals feeding in refuse dumps or of animals studied in habitats of different quality (with no food addition), as well as studies admitting that the supplemented food was not sufficient in either quality or quantity to adequately test for the effects of food supplementation. Out of 337 records identified, a total of 82 independent studies met our criteria (including 201 experiments). Data obtained directly from the authors of the reviewed publications amounted to 8% (16 experiments) of the whole dataset. Three of the authors (LR, EKoivisto, PS) extracted all data from the text, tables and figures (using DigitizeIt software) of the original publications. The process of record collection and study exclusion for the qualitative synthesis and quantitative meta-analyses is detailed in a PRISMA-type flow chart (Figure

Several articles can be considered as a single independent study if they share the same experimental design and were conducted in the same study area.
