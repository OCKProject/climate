  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We searched for studies that tested the effects of experimental food supplementation on reproduction of birds by conducting a literature search on the Web of Science and Google Scholar using combinations of the following keywords: “experiment*”, “manipulat*”, “food”, “supplement*”, “feeding”, “addition”, “bird”, “reproduction” and “population”. We also screened the reference lists of all retrieved articles and previous reviews (e.g., [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>]) for other relevant publications. Searching ended in June 2013.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We restricted our search to food manipulations that provided sufficient data to calculate an effect size. When the means, error measurements or sample sizes were not provided in the publication, the authors were contacted. We discarded studies that reported the reproductive parameters of animals feeding in refuse dumps or of animals studied in habitats of different quality (with no food addition), as well as studies admitting that the supplemented food was not sufficient in either quality or quantity to adequately test for the effects of food supplementation. Out of 337 records identified, a total of 82 independent studies met our criteria (including 201 experiments). Data obtained directly from the authors of the reviewed publications amounted to 8% (16 experiments) of the whole dataset. Three of the authors (LR, EKoivisto, PS) extracted all data from the text, tables and figures (using DigitizeIt software) of the original publications. The process of record collection and study exclusion for the qualitative synthesis and quantitative meta-analyses is detailed in a PRISMA-type flow chart (Figure 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Variables and effect sizes</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The experiments were scored for variables that related to the behaviour and life-history traits of each study species by collating data from original publications or other literature (i.e., bird handbooks, internet; see Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM3">3</a> for more details). Each species was assigned to one of the six established bird types (corvids, passerines other than corvids, birds of prey, seabirds, wetland birds, others; see Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM3">3</a> for details on the categories). Behavioural variables included migratory status (migratory/year-round resident), food caching (caching/non-caching) and propensity to accept a new type of food (generalist diet/specialist diet), while life-history traits measured maximal clutch size, broodedness (one/more than one clutch per year) and body mass. All experiments were also scored for variables related to the experimental setup, such as timing of food supplementation (before and/or during egg-laying only/other timings, i.e., from hatching to fledging or throughout the breeding season), the level of accessibility to the feed for the target species (low/intermediate/high), environmental conditions, such as latitude and elevation (m a.s.l.) of the study site, and the relative background level of food resources (higher/lower than average) (see Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM3">3</a>). The background level of resources was assigned for all studies that estimated the abundance of the most common food item or prey for the target species or reported clear differences in environmental quality (i.e., due to drastic changes in weather conditions) between study years. Food accessibility was considered low when food was substantially exploited by dominants, immigrants and/or non-target species. Accessibility was deemed high when supplemented food was delivered to the nest or nest box, or to the adults directly, and when direct observations indicated that most or all of the food was consumed by the target species. Accessibility was considered intermediate when food was only occasionally exploited by dominants, immigrants and/or non-target species, and not provided directly to the nest or nest box, or to the adults.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reproductive responses considered in our analyses included laying date, clutch size, egg size, hatching success, brood size, chick body mass and breeding success. Hatching success was defined as the number of hatchlings divided by the total number of eggs laid. Several estimates of breeding success were used, i.e. the number of fledglings per nest, the number of fledglings divided by the total number of hatchlings or by the number of pairs that initiated reproduction or successfully fledged young, if the number of hatchlings was not reported.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Frequently, ecologists are interested in the actual difference in mean performance or the proportional change in performance in response to a treatment. This is why Hedges’
   <span class="italic">d</span> and the log response ratio (ln 
   <span class="italic">R</span>) have been so commonly used as effect sizes in ecological meta-analyses. Since this study is interested in the factors causing variation in life-history traits of bird species, we need to incorporate a measure of variance in the calculation of the effect size, so that a change in any reproductive parameter can be interpreted as the fitness benefit to that species. For example, clutch size might be very constrained in one species and thus a 10% change in response to food supplementation (e.g., change from 1 ± 0.5 SD to 1.1 ± 0.5 SD) is to be valued more than a 10% change when clutch size is less constrained (e.g., change from 1 ± 1 SD to 1.1 ± 1 SD).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the unbiased standardized mean difference Hedges’
   <span class="italic">d</span> (hereafter 
   <span class="italic">d</span>) as a measure of effect size in our meta-analyses. This effect size can be interpreted as the difference between the reproductive responses of supplemented birds versus non-supplemented birds, measured in units of standard deviations. Thus, large differences and low variability generate the largest effect sizes [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">69</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" href="#CR70">70</a>]. Positive 
   <span class="italic">d</span> values indicate that food supplementation has a positive effect on the reproduction of a study species, while negative values indicate greater values in controls compared to the experimental group. By convention, a large effect is indicated by |
   <span class="italic">d|</span> &gt; 0.8, a moderate effect by |
   <span class="italic">d|</span> = 0.2-0.8, and a small effect by |

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analyses</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the metafor package [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">73</a>] in R 3.0.2 to perform the meta-analyses and estimate a pooled effect size for each reproductive parameter and explanatory variable. In all meta-analyses, we controlled for repeated observations on the same species from the same study area by including Study ID as a random variable in the models. We also controlled for correlated structures due to shared phylogenetic history by specifying a phylogenetic correlation matrix of the species included in the meta-analysis and including Species as a random variable in our models (see Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM4">4</a> for the phylogenetic bird trees used and their characteristics). Variation in response magnitudes among bird types was confirmed by the heterogeneity statistics 
   <span class="italic">Q</span> computed on the laying date, clutch size and breeding success datasets (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">2</a>). The following additional procedures also helped minimising the risk of pseudo-replication in the datasets: (i) each type of reproductive parameter was analysed separately, thereby avoiding the inclusion of several parameters taken from the same species or study area in the same dataset, (ii) in cases where the same reproductive parameters were measured on the same species over several years, an average effect size was calculated over all study years, (iii) in cases where a study tested different food qualities or supplementation timings on the same species, we selected the experiment with the highest effect size. In all meta-analyses, effect sizes were weighted by the inverse of their within-variance. Mean effect sizes showed significant effects of food addition when their 95% confidence intervals did not overlap zero. Model convergence was checked by inspecting the profile of the maximum restricted log-likelihood of the full models.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, we estimated the overall effects of food supplementation on seven reproductive parameters, namely laying date (n = 41 experiments), clutch size (n = 46), egg size (n = 26), hatching success (n = 18), brood size (n = 5), chick body mass (n = 21) and breeding success (n = 38), by performing weighted random-effect meta-analyses without fixed explanatory variables (i.e., null random models). Second, we tested the effect of several explanatory variables on laying date, clutch size and breeding success (i.e., parameters for which 
   <span class="italic">N</span> ≥ 30), separately. For laying date, we tested the effect of migratory status, broodedness, diet, accessibility to the feed, latitude and elevation. Meta-analyses for clutch size tested the effect of caching behaviour, maximal clutch size, body mass, accessibility to the feed, diet and latitude. Explanatory variables for breeding success included caching behaviour, accessibility to the feed, timing of food addition, diet and body mass. For each analysis, we constructed a set of models that included all possible combinations of explanatory variables. We used conditional Akaike’s Information Criterion, corrected for small sample size (AICc), to compare the goodness of fit among models. Models were ranked in relation to each other using ∆AICc values. AICc weights (
   <span class="italic">w</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">i</span>
   </sub>) were calculated to assess the relative likelihood of each model considered. Finally, we used multi-model inference to quantify the relative explanatory importance of variables over the set of candidate models. Variable weights were calculated as the sum of AICc weights of all the models including a given variable.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The background level of resources can affect the magnitude of the bird response to food supplementation (e.g., [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>]; see also 
   <a rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec2">Results</a>) but only 18 studies (out of 82) monitored or commented on the natural resource levels in their study area for the whole study period. For the 41 studies conducted over several years, we remained conservative in our approach and calculated an average effect size over the whole study period. Studies that were performed within one year and did not report the background level of resources (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 38) were assumed to be conducted under average environmental conditions. Three studies reported experiments only at a persistently and distinctly lower [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">74</a>] (poor quality habitat with low prey densities) or higher [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" href="#CR75">75</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" href="#CR76">76</a>] (peak of main prey abundance in rodent specialised predators) background level of resources than average and were discarded to avoid biasing the analyses. Therefore, we made sure that the effect sizes used in all the above-mentioned meta-analyses matched averaged environmental conditions. The final sample size for the analyses described above was 195 experiments from 79 studies (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM3">3</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Third, we explored the effect of varying background levels of food resources (lower/higher than average, as stated in the original publications) on the success of food supplementation in a separate meta-analysis. Reproductive parameter (laying date, clutch size, breeding success) was included as a fixed covariate in the meta-analysis since responses to food supplementation varied across reproductive parameters (see 
   <a rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec2">Results</a>). This dataset consisted of 51 experiments from 18 studies (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM3">3</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, we examined the possibility of publication bias in our datasets by generating funnel and normal quantile plots (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM5">5</a>).
