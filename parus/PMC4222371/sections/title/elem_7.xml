 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We aimed to synthesise the outcomes of food supplementation experiments in several bird reproductive parameters by using quantitative meta-analyses. We found mostly positive effects of food supplementation experiments on bird reproduction, indicating that within the pool of bird species and environments reviewed, extra food is often allocated to immediate reproduction. The effects of supplementary food were still variable across reproductive parameters; this is consistent with the idea that varying energetic costs are associated with different stages of the breeding cycle, and it also shows that bird species have evolved different life-history strategies to cope with environmental variability in food supply. The average increase in bird breeding success (response ratio:

  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>] found for the reproductive response of small mammals following food addition (response ratio = 1.19), probably because of the use of different types of reproductive responses (i.e., number of breeding individuals used in Prevedello 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>] vs. number of offspring in this study). Overall, these positive responses support the idea that both bird and mammal populations can be constrained by food during the energy-demanding period of reproduction. Our analyses revealed that the effects of food supplementation were modulated by (i) environmental factors, such as the background level of food abundance and factors that vary with latitude, (ii) behavioural traits in birds, such as food caching, and (iii) some components of the experimental design, such as the timing of food addition and the level of accessibility to the feed.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results showed an overall advancement of laying date in response to food addition across bird taxa, which is in accordance with the results of previous reviews [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>]. Breeding earlier generally increases current and future reproductive outputs. For example, it can allow larger clutches [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>], better chick survival [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>], more re-nesting attempts [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>] and more time for the parents to moult and prepare for the winter after breeding [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>]. An advancement of egg-laying has also been documented in Europe in relation to increasing average spring temperatures [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>] that lead to earlier plant growing seasons and forage availability.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found some support for a latitudinal effect on the advancement of laying dates in response to food supplementation experiments. In accordance with the results of Schoech &amp; Hahn [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>], we documented a smaller advancement in egg-laying at higher latitudes. Most birds breeding in northern environments reproduce during a single favourable seasonal window when food is abundant, and they most likely show lower flexibility in life-history stages, such as initiation of egg-laying, than resident birds at lower latitudes. Hence, as suggested by Schoech &amp; Hahn [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>], species that rely on endogenous rhythms or environmental stimuli unrelated to food abundance, such as day length at high latitudes, may be limited in their ability to advance their reproduction as an adaptive response to untimely food abundance peaks. However, further research is urgently needed to corroborate these findings since the data currently available are biased against tropical environments. Despite Boutin’s [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>] recommendations, to our knowledge only two studies [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>] have since tested the effect of food addition on the timing of egg-laying in birds below 20°N or 20°S.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our meta-analyses did not reveal any obvious differences in the effect of food on laying date between migratory and resident species, or between single- and multi-brooded species. There has been an extensive debate over the relative roles of latitude, migratory status and broodedness in modulating the advancement of egg-laying in birds. While the findings of Schoech &amp; Hahn [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>] (see also [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>]) support the latitudinal gradient hypothesis, Dhondt [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>] found no conclusive evidence that latitude influences the response, but identified broodedness as an important factor shaping the response of reproductive timing to food supplementation (see also [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>]). These varying results and conclusions among studies probably arise both from the misassignment of some species as multi-brooded in Dhondt [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>], and the statistical methods used to analyse the data, especially the failure to reduce pseudo-replication and incorporate within-study variances in the calculation of the food supplementation effect. In this paper, we dealt with the statistical issues by (i) controlling for shared phylogeny and study design, (ii) running multi-factor meta-analyses to account for the potential effects of other predictors, (iii) incorporating the within-study variation (SD) into the calculation of the effect sizes, and (iv) weighting the meta-analyses by the inverse of the within-study variance. Although we did not observe any apparent effect of broodedness, the magnitude of food supplementation effects on egg-laying advancement has been shown to differ between single- and multi-brooded species due to their contrasting breeding timing constrains and strategies [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>]. As only eight experiments on multi-brooded species were available for our meta-analysis, additional experiments are needed to elucidate how broodedness modulates the reproductive response of birds to varying resource abundances in nature.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effect of food supplementation on the number of eggs laid per clutch showed a moderate positive response. The observed increase in clutch size indicates either that the number of eggs a female can produce in a season is limited by nutrient or energy availability, or that food abundance during egg-laying is a fairly good predictor of resource availability later in the breeding season. In any case, clutch size is believed to be adaptive in many species and should correspond to a trade-off between the physiological constraints of producing more eggs and the energy demands during chick rearing [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>]. Indeed, parental survival and future reproductive performance can be reduced due to the increased parental effort needed to rear more chicks to independence [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>], as has been shown for great tits 
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>] and jackdaws 
  <span class="italic">Corvus monedula</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>]. Our analyses revealed that food-caching birds, such as magpies, scrub-jays, shrikes, kestrels and some species of tits, increased clutch size in response to food supplementation, while non-caching species did not. Similarly, groups of acorn woodpeckers (
  <span class="italic">Melanerpes formicivorus</span>) with acorn stores lay significantly larger clutches than groups that lack stores during the breeding season [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>]. Supplemented food can be gathered as soon as it is available and stored for periods when energy demand is higher. Food-caching may enable birds to predict the food conditions later in the season with more accuracy, and as a result stored food may initiate the production of larger clutches. However, it is still unclear whether larger food stores correlate with better overall productivity [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>] and the results of our meta-analyses did not allow a conclusion on that matter (see Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mechanisms driving clutch size variation among individuals, populations and species are complex, as they involve interactions between environmental, behavioural, physiological and genetic determinants. The absence of response of food supplementation in some species (e.g., small passerines, see Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">2</a>) may be explained by the inability of the female to use food abundance during egg-laying as a breeding cue. Instead, the female may determine clutch size based on male quality (e.g., [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>]), the presence of competitors (e.g., [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>]), or by relying on habitat cues that predict environmental conditions and food availability later in the season [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>]. Moreover, since the number of eggs produced per clutch is often tightly related to the date of egg-laying (i.e., smaller clutches are usually produced later in the season), the response of birds to food supplementation may also differ between early and late breeders in the same population. Unfortunately, we could not test this prediction since average laying dates were in most cases (93%) only provided for the entire breeding season. Finally, there is strong evidence that clutch size has a heritable component in wild populations of several bird species [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>] and the use of “animal models” has proven to be valuable to address evolutionary-related questions (e.g., [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>]).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Studies that delivered supplemental food merely during the pre-laying and/or egg-laying periods showed, on average, no detectable increase in breeding success (i.e., number of fledglings produced), whereas studies where food was added from hatching to fledging or throughout the breeding season documented net increases in breeding success. Supplementing food during pre-laying or egg-laying may actually create a bottle-neck for the birds since the advancement of egg-laying could create a mismatch between the nestling period and the maximal availability of nestling-suitable foods [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>], which in turn increases the cost for the parents during chick rearing. However, as shown by von Brömssen &amp; Jansson [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>], the supplementation of food during pre-laying can also improve bird fitness in a different way, i.e. food-supplemented parents do not increase the absolute number of offspring produced but are able to produce individual offspring that are in better condition than young of non-supplemented parents.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Boutin [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>] argued that food supplementation experiments should account for the possibility that the observed population responses, or the lack thereof, can merely be the result of competition and/or ineffective food delivery. Here, we documented the absence of a detectable effect of food supplementation on the clutch size and breeding success of birds when the target species did not have full access to the food provided, due to interactions at the feeding stations with con- or hetero-specifics. Manipulating food supply can attract a variety of species, both birds and mammals, from outside of the focal experimental area. When food is limiting, competition is likely to increase and can prevent subordinate individuals or species from utilising the feed. Based on our results, the risk of competition for the supplementary food tended to be low in those bird species that show strong territoriality or aggressive behaviour towards intruders, and in cavity-nesting species, to which food can be delivered inside nest boxes. We found that corvids were more likely to increase their breeding success in response to food supplementation than other bird groups (see Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">2</a>), probably because corvids often exclude other birds from their territories and thereby from established feeders [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>], but also because they can use novel food sources exhaustively due to their strong cognitive abilities and opportunist foraging behaviour.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Food supplementation increased bird reproductive responses when the background level of resources was lower than average, while supplementation had no detectable effect when food was unusually abundant in nature. The threshold hypothesis predicts that only individuals experiencing background levels of food availability below a saturation point will respond to supplementary feeding [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>]. The relationship between food availability and reproductive traits may thus be non-linear and other factors, such as predation or competition for territories, become limiting when the background level of food is high [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>]. The reproductive decisions of individuals in a given population may vary between years due to changing environmental conditions. This highlights the importance of measuring natural food abundance during any supplementation experiment as well as the value of conducting experiments over multiple years in varying environmental conditions.
 </p>
 <sec id="Sec4" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conclusions and future prospects</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results confirm that food supply plays a crucial role in avian ecology and evolution, through its effects on individual behaviours and life-history traits. They also imply that the extent of food limitation varies across the multiple stages of bird reproductive cycle, but also across bird taxa and environmental conditions. Latitude appears to modulate the effect of food supplementation on bird reproduction: birds living at low latitudes may be more plastic in advancing their timing of breeding, as compared to birds breeding at higher latitudes where factors other than food may constrain life-history parameters. On the other hand, it has been suggested (in line with the “slow pace of life in the tropics” syndrome [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>]) that tropical resident birds should invest extra energy into self-maintenance rather than in immediate reproductive costs [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>], and the rare manipulative experiments to address the question of resource allocation trade-offs in the tropics have produced contrasting results (e.g., [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>]). Certainly, more food supplementation studies in tropical and equatorial environments are needed to be able to conclude on that matter. Comparative studies of closely-related bird species breeding in different environments will also help understanding how resource allocation changes along a latitudinal gradient.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our findings further revealed that the results of food supplementation experiments could be affected by inadequate experimental designs. This is directly relevant to situations where food supplementation is applied as a conservation tool to boost the breeding performance of endangered birds. For example, if the objective of a supplementary feeding program is to enhance the overall productivity of a bird population, we do not recommend delivering the food during the pre-laying or egg-laying period only as it can create a bottle-neck for the parents later in the breeding season, if the abundance of resources in the environment does not match the energy needs of the parents for rearing more chicks. Instead, we encourage conservation managers to extend the food delivery until the hatching or chick-rearing period. Furthermore, because food supplementation can alter the interactions between individuals and species, it is crucial to ensure that the risk of competition for the supplemented feed is limited. In species where males tend to monopolise the feeders, this issue can be mitigated either by using large numbers of feeders (e.g., 
   <span class="bold">
    <span class="italic">&gt;</span>
   </span>3 per territory) so that females can have unrestricted access to supplemental food, or by delivering the feed to the females directly. Moreover, delivering the food over large treatment areas (with small perimeter-area ratios) instead of small clumped areas, can reduce the flow of intruders and hence the relative effect of immigration (e.g., [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>]). Preventing non-target species or conspecifics from monopolising the supplemented food can be achieved by using feeders designed to supplement the feed to experimental animals only (e.g., automated feeders, [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>]). Given that the feed is often delivered 
   <span class="italic">ad libitum</span> over the entire experimental area, it can be difficult to identify which animals are utilising it and, hence, assess the effect of food on life-history parameters, such as reproduction, growth, condition, at the individual level. Recently, Robb 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>] have pointed out the potential for stable isotopes to trace the use of food supplements in animals and measure the variation in food use between recipient individuals. Alternatively, the use of radio frequency identification systems (RFID) can be useful in quantifying bird visits to feeders [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>]. Further research is also needed to test how the spatial dispersion of supplementary food (e.g., patchy vs. scattered; [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>]) affects intra- and inter-specific competition and, hence, the outcome of the food supplementation experiment. Supplementing endangered populations should, however, always be applied with caution as some recent studies have warned against potential adverse consequences of food supplementation on nestling health [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>] and sex-ratio [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>], breeding success [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>], and the carry-over effects of winter food provision on the investment in egg production [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another major issue related to the experimental design is the nutritional quality of the feed, which unfortunately could not be addressed in this review due to the lack of data provided by the studies included, but should be cautiously considered in future studies. Growing evidence suggests that the ecological impacts of food supplementation can depend on the specific nutritional profile of provisioned foods [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>-
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>] and that the energetic content of the food (in joules or calories) does not necessarily constitute an indicator of food quality [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>]. For example, the availability of essential amino acids [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">65</a>] and vitamins or antioxidants [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>] may constrain egg production in birds. The geometric framework for nutrition (see, e.g., [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">66</a>]) explores how animals simultaneously regulate the intake of multiple nutrients, and has recently been applied in birds [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>]. This modelling approach contributes further understanding of the relationships between the nutritional ratios of natural food and supplementary feeding, and reproduction in birds, and hence can assist with devising effective supplementary food to endangered species [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the large body of scientific literature on the impacts of food supply in bird life-history traits and reproductive strategies, some groups of birds and types of environments remain severely under-studied. Large-scale supplementation experiments, testing the effect of food addition on several populations or species of the same groups of birds in variable climates or environmental conditions, would be highly desirable. Finally, despite the accumulation of food supplementation studies over the past thirty years, most of this research has focused on immediate reproductive investments during the current breeding season; very little is known about the carry-over effects of food on offspring and parental survival when supplementation is finished, and about how food limitation may constrain future reproduction (but see [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">68</a>]).
