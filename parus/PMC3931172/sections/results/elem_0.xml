  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Initial assignment of markers into linkage groups</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the NL population (
   <span class="italic">N</span>=393 birds), 6877 markers (mean informative meiosis±s.d.=224.6±94.4) were grouped into 32 putative great tit chromosomes based on the alignment of markers with the zebra finch genome. In the UK population (
   <span class="italic">N</span>=1656 birds), 6094 markers (mean informative meiosis±s.d.=408.0±124.2) were grouped into the same 32 putative great tit chromosomes, using AUTOGROUP on the set of autosomal SNPs. The grouping of markers by the AUTOGROUP option in CriMap demonstrated a remarkable conservation of synteny between the great tit and zebra finch genomes. Based on the very high proportion of markers within each group that aligned to a single zebra finch chromosome (range 91–100% mean=99.7), chromosome identities could be assigned unambiguously to each linkage group from homology with the zebra finch genome. We will, therefore, refer to the homologous chromosome number when referring to the linkage groups throughout the paper. This follows the convention of 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52" href="#bib52">Stapley 
    <span class="italic">et al.,</span> (2008)
   </a>, who assigned zebra finch linkage group names based on homology with the chicken assembly. Thus, great tit, zebra finch and chicken chromosome names are consistent. This method is in contrast to the historic approach of naming chromosomes in order of decreasing physical size. For example, from fluorescence 
   <span class="italic">in situ</span> hybridization paints in great tits, PMA2 is known to be larger than PMA1 (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Linkage map characteristics</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The NL and UK framework maps (LOD⩾3) contained 1766 and 1674 markers, respectively. Of these, 898 markers were present on both maps. When comparing the two maps, 37 out of these 898 markers had a position on both maps that could not be predicted from the position from the other map (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Supplementary Figures 1 and 2</a>). The mean interval between the position of these markers on the NL map and the position based on the UK map was 1.91 cM (range 0.02–5.40 cM).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The NL and UK framework maps spanned 1869 cM and 1893 cM, respectively, across 32 linkage groups, homologous to TGU1 to TGU15, TGU17 to TGU28, TGUZ and the zebra finch linkage group LGE22 (
   <a rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>). These linkage groups are homologous to GGA1 to GGA15, GGA17 to GGA28, GGAZ and two chicken linkage groups, LG2 and LGE22C19W28_E50C23. Markers that aligned with chicken chromosomes GGA1, GGA4 and GGA25 were assembled into two distinct linkage groups (PMA1 and PMA1A, PMA4 and PMA4A, and PMA25A and PMA25B) in both great tit populations. Merging the paired linkage groups into one resulted in a distance larger than 50 cM between the two groups of markers. For PMA25A/PMA25B, the two markers that were positioned closest together on the zebra finch genome, but were assigned to different linkage groups (PMA25A and PMA25B) were only 150k base pairs apart on the zebra finch genome. One pair of markers, M3554 from PMA25A and M6440 from PMA25B did have a twopoint LOD score of 2.2 in the NL population, but there was no evidence for linkage between this marker pair in the UK population. Furthermore, no other markers pointed to a possible linkage between PMA25A and PMA25B, suggesting that the two linkage groups may represent two different chromosomes.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The comprehensive maps contained 2853 markers spanning 1867 cM and 3162 markers spanning 1889 cM for the NL and UK populations, respectively. For the parsimonious map, a total of 5855 SNPs were placed on the NL map spanning 2010 cM (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Supplementary Figure 1</a>), whereas the UK map consisted of 4878 SNPs spanning 1917 cM (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Supplementary Figure 2</a>). This corresponds to an increase in size of 7.7% (NL) and 1.5% (UK) compared with the framework maps. In total 6554 unique SNP markers were present on either the NL map or the UK map. Of these, 4189 were present on both the NL and the UK map, whereas 1666 SNPs were unique to the NL map and 699 markers were present on the UK map and not on the NL map. The MAF for the 1666 markers present on the NL map, but not on the UK map (NL specific: mean±s.e.m.; 0.339±0.003), was significantly lower (
   <span class="italic">t</span>
   <sub>5140</sub>=4.16, 
   <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;0.001) compared with the MAF of markers present on both maps (present on both: mean±s.e.m.; 0.352±0.001). The MAF for the markers that were present on the UK map, but not on NL map did not have significantly lower MAF (UK specific: mean±s.e.m.; 0.345±0.003) than those on both maps. The number of SNPs per linkage group ranged from 5 (PMALGE22) to 664 (PMA2) for the NL population and from 3 (PMALGE22) to 624 (PMA2) for the UK population. There were no marker inconsistencies at linkage group level (that is, no marker was present on a specific linkage group on one map and present on another linkage group on the other map). Within the linkage groups, we found high consistency between the marker orders in the two populations (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Supplementary Figure 3</a>), the only rearrangements being apparent were local inversions involving a small number of markers (see discussion). Recombination rates (measured as cM/Mbp) tended to be greater at the ends of macrochromosomes than in the central parts, although unlike the situation in captive zebra finch populations, recombination ‘deserts' were not observed in the middle of macrochromosomes (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Supplementary Figure 4</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Linkage group sizes ranged from 4.58 cM to 138.15 cM in the NL population and from 3.68 cM to 139.88 cM in the UK population (
   <a rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>), and these sizes were highly correlated between the populations (

   <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;0.001), indicating that the recombination rates were not population dependent, and did not differ systematically between the wild and recently-founded captive populations studied here. Based on the alignment of the flanking sequences of the most distal SNPs in great tit linkage map to the zebra finch genome, the total genome coverage was 97.1% (range 77.7–99.8 for individual linkage groups) for the NL map and 98.3% (range 28.4–99.8) for the UK map (
   <a rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>). Assuming that our linkage map covers 32 of the expected 40 chromosomes (that is, taking PMA25A, PMA25B and LGE22 as a separate great tit chromosome), and that these three and the eight missing microchromosomes have at least one obligate recombination event during meiosis, implying a map size of at least 50 cM per chromosome, the total predicted map sizes are ∼2700 cM for the NL and ∼2600 cM for the UK populations.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Genome wide, there was no evidence for large sex differences in map length. We found no significant levels of heterochiasmy (SDI in the NL or the UK population (

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>). An outlier analysis showed that the sex-specific linkage maps of three linkage groups in the NL population significantly differed from each other: males in PMA2, PMA3 and PMA13 had longer map lengths compared with females in the NL population. Although not significant, these three linkage groups also had the lowest SDI values (that is, greater recombination rates in males) in the UK population.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because replicated maps from independent populations were constructed, it was possible to examine whether subtle, more localised differences in heterochiasmy were conserved. Most revealingly, the plots (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>) and analyses of SDI_local revealed fine-scale heterochiasmy that was remarkably conserved between the two populations. Cross-correlations, in SDI_local, between the two populations were positive at all 22 chromosomes considered (range in 
   <span class="italic">r</span>=0.05–0.999; median 
   <span class="italic">r</span>=0.668; 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Supplementary Table 1</a>). A sign test on all 22 correlations being positive is highly significant (
   <span class="italic">P</span>=4.8 × 10
   <span class="sup">−7</span>, assuming a null expectation of a correlation being equally likely to be positive or negative). At 17 of the 22 chromosomes the cross-correlation would be regarded as significantly positive, if each window was regarded as an independent data point. Importantly, the overall pattern of local heterochiasmy being highly conserved across the two populations was not dependent on window size or the interval from one marker to the next (See 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Supplementary Figures 5a–c</a>, for SDI_local plots using alternative window sizes).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparative mapping</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For 5396 of the 5855 SNPs that mapped on both the NL and the UK parsimonious linkage map, we found homology to the zebra finch genome; 1231 of the SNPs could be assigned locations on the chicken genome and 169 were aligned to the green anole lizard genome.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, gene order was conserved within syntenic blocks when comparing the map positions on the great tit parsimonious map with the physical position on the zebra finch (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Supplementary Figure 6</a>) and the chicken genome (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Supplementary Figure 7</a>). Two linkage groups (PMA8 and PMA19) did not show any intrachromosomal rearrangements within either the zebra finch–great tit or the chicken–great tit comparison, that is, marker order was exactly the same in great tit, zebra finch and chicken (see example in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" href="#fig4">Figure 4a</a>). For four linkage groups (PMA5, PMA9, PMA12 and PMA14) chromosomal rearrangements were similar whether comparing great tit to zebra finch or to chicken (see 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" href="#fig4">Figure 4b</a>). These cases represent rearrangements that have occurred in the great tit lineage since great tits and zebra finches diverged. In four cases, rearrangements were only visible for the TGU-PMA comparison (PMA2, PMA10, PMA17 and PMA18) but not the GGA-PMA comparison (see 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" href="#fig4">Figure 4c</a>). These represent rearrangements in the lineage leading to zebra finches after the great tit-zebra finch divergence. In five linkage groups (PMA4, PMA6, PMA13, PMA15 and PMA20) rearrangements were present only in the GGA-PMA comparison (see 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" href="#fig4">Figure 4d</a>), and represent rearrangements that occurred after galliformes and passerines diverged, but before the divergence of great tits and zebra finches. The remaining linkage groups have undergone inversions in the great tit compared with either chicken or zebra finch, but more complex rearrangements were also observable. For example, in PMA1, represented by TGU1 and the distal part of GGA1, two inversions and a third inversion within the second inversion were present in the TGU-PMA comparison, although a rearrangement of ∼30 Mb is also present in the GGA-PMA comparison (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" href="#fig4">Figure 4e</a>). In another example, PMA7, an inversion of ∼8 Mb is present in the GGA-PMA comparison, although in the TGU-PMA comparison a large inversion of ∼25 Mb is also present in the central region of the chromosome (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" href="#fig4">Figure 4f</a>). Inference of ancestral states is more complicated for these cases, even when high-density maps from multiple passerine species are available.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Out of the 32 great tit linkage groups, 22 contained at least one SNP that could be assigned a location on the green anole lizard genome. Thirteen of these linkage groups had shared syntenic segments, with at least two SNP markers linked on both a green anole lizard chromosome and a great tit linkage group (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>). PMA1 and PMA1A aligned to different green anole lizard chromosomes, suggesting that a single chromosome 1/1A in chickens is a derived state.
