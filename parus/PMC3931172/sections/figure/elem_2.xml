  <p>Size Dimorphism Index (SDI) calculated for windows of 20 SNP markers on the NL (orange) and UK (blue) framework maps. Subsequent windows were chosen by sliding the window five SNP markers along the linkage group. Positive SDI indicates that female recombination rates within the 20 SNP window was higher; negative values indicate greater recombination rates in males. Only linkage groups with at least three windows are plotted.</p>
