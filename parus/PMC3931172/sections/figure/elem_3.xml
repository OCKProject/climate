  <p>Comparative maps for six example great tit linkage groups, with the great tit linkage map positions plotted against the predicted physical position on the zebra finch (TGU; left panels) and chicken (GGA; right panels) genomes. (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) PMA19 is highly conserved across avian lineages; no rearrangements relative to TGU or GGA, (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) PMA14 is an example of a rearrangement specific to the great tit lineage; an inversion relative to marker order in both TGU and GGA, (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) PMA10 is an example of a TGU-specific rearrangement; an inversion between PMA and TGU, (
   <span class="bold">d</span>) PMA6 is an example of a difference between passerines and galliformes; rearrangement relative to GGA but not TGU, (
   <span class="bold">e</span>) and (
   <span class="bold">f</span>) are chromosomes that are generally evolutionarily less stable across avian genomes, where (
   <span class="bold">e</span>) PMA1; inversions compared with TGU, and both inversions and rearrangements compared with GGA, and (
   <span class="bold">f</span>) PMA7; distinct inversions when PMA is compared with TGU and GGA.
