  <p>Comparison of levels of heterochiasmy per linkage group for the NL and the UK populations. Heterochiasmy is indicated as the size dimorphism index (SDI). Negative SDI values indicate larger male linkage groups compared with female linkage groups. The solid line represents the 
   <span class="italic">y</span>=
   <span class="italic">x</span> line, the dotted line the outcome of the reduced major axis regression (
   <span class="italic">y</span>=0.72
   <span class="italic">x</span>+0.04). Only linkage groups larger than 10â€‰cM are plotted. Linkage groups that deviate significantly from 1:1 are indicated with *.
