A total of 8340 SNPs were successfully genotyped in both the NL and the UK population, but only 7215 and 7203 of these SNPs were polymorphic in the NL and UK population, respectively. After excluding markers with very low minor allele frequency (MAF&lt;0.01), 6897 and 7032 SNPs were used for map construction in the NL and UK populations, respectively. Detailed descriptions of SNP identification, SNP selection and genotyping results are given elsewhere (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the construction of the linkage maps, we used 398 great tits originating from a captive population at the NIOO-KNAW, Wageningen, NL and 1656 individuals from a pedigreed long-term natural population (Wytham Woods) near Oxford, UK. The genotyped individuals in the NL population were selected from 480 genotyped individuals of the fourth generation of artificial selection on fast and slow early exploratory behaviour (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15" href="#bib15">Drent 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2003
   </a>) and the F1 and F2 intercrosses between the fast and slow lines (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58" href="#bib58">van Oers 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2004
   </a>). The final mapping pedigree (
   <span class="italic">N</span>=398) included all F2 intercross individuals (
   <span class="italic">N</span>=251), their F1 parents, the siblings of these F1 parents and all full-sib selection line families with their parents. These individuals were manually split into 35 subfamilies, with mean family size 15.0 (range 5–35). Sex and parentage of all individuals was confirmed from the genotypes. Owing to a small number of parent-offspring genotype mismatches, we removed five individuals from the data set, leaving 393 individuals for analysis (

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A subset of 1656 Wytham individuals with confirmed first degree pedigree links (genotyped parents and/or sibs and/or offspring) and confirmed sex were chosen for constructing the UK great tit linkage map (see 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Supplementary Methods</a> for more details). For the UK population, complex pedigrees were first split into 61 subfamilies (of up to approximately 50 individuals and three generations) using the CRIGEN command (options: -size 50 and -gen 3) in Crimap (see below). Parent-offspring genotype mismatches were removed from the data set.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To identify and understand rearrangements in avian genomes, it is necessary to compare the positions of the homologues of typed markers on different species' genomes. Recently, the genome of the green anole lizard 
   <span class="italic">A. carolinensis</span> was sequenced and assembled (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2" href="#bib2">Alfoldi 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2011
   </a>). Here we examined chromosomal rearrangements between great tit, zebra finch, chicken and the green anole; the latter provides a useful out-group to the avian species. The position of the great tit SNPs on the zebra finch, chicken and green anole lizard genomes was predicted based on the alignment of 23 to 150 bases of flanking sequence to the respective genome sequence using the default parameters in blastn (with setting a minimum expectation value (
   <span class="italic">e</span>-value) of 10
   <span class="sup">−5</span>). The three genome sequences used for comparative mapping were downloaded from the Ensembl Genome Browser; zebra finch: version Taeniopygia_guttata.taeGut3.2.4.61, 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org/Taeniopygia_guttata/Info/Index" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.ensembl.org/Taeniopygia_guttata/Info/Index</span>; chicken: version Gallus_gallus.WASHUC2.56,

Predicted physical map locations are the midpoints between the start and end of the mapping alignment and are, therefore, expected to be within 100 bases of the actual SNP position. Linkage groups and putative chromosomes were orientated according to the orientation of the chicken chromosomes.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For linkage mapping we used a modified version (2.503) of the CriMap software (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21" href="#bib21">Green 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 1990
   </a>). We chose to present maps with three different marker densities in this manuscript: (i) framework maps, incorporating markers that could be assigned a most likely order with LOD&gt;3, that is, the best order is 10
   <span class="sup">3</span>=1000 times more likely than the next best alternative order (ii) comprehensive maps, where ‘non-framework' markers were added by lowering levels of stringency (LOD&gt;0.1) and (iii) parsimonious maps, adding as many markers as possible to the comprehensive map with LOD&lt;0.1 (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Supplementary Methods</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We applied two different initial strategies for linkage group construction. For the NL map, we assigned 6877 SNPs to putative great tit chromosomes based on sequence homology between SNP flanking sequences and the zebra finch genome sequence. For the UK map, we used the TWOPOINT output of CriMap to create linkage groups with the AUTOGROUP command (see 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Supplementary Methods</a> for more details). In both mapping populations, the second allele of SNPs on the sex chromosome (Z), was assigned a dummy value (6) in females, to account for the hemizygosity of the female Z chromosome.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Heterochiasmy</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Heterochiasmy was examined on three different scales, using the sex-specific maps option in CriMap (see section Map Construction). First, the genome-wide male and female total map lengths were compared. Second, male and female map lengths were estimated for each chromosome. Third, local levels of heterochiasmy were estimated using sex-specific map lengths in a window size of 20 markers and then sliding the window in five marker increments. For this analysis, markers common to comprehensive maps in both populations were used: Parus major (PMA) linkage groups PMA1, 1A, 2–4, 4A, 5–15, 17–21, 23, 24 and 26 contained enough shared comprehensive map markers to estimate local heterochiasmy. Following 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41" href="#bib41">Poissant 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span> (2010)
   </a>, heterochiasmy was measured using the size dimorphism index (SDI) developed by 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35" href="#bib35">Lovich and Gibbons (1992)</a>. This index is considered the best estimator of sexual size dimorphism because, in contrast to ratios, it does not suffer from the fact that heterochiasmy is bound at zero in one sex and unbounded in the other sex. The SDI was obtained with the following formula:

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41" href="#bib41">Poissant 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2010
   </a>), estimates were then made positive when the female value was largest and negative when the male value was largest. To distinguish between whole-chromosome/whole-genome heterochiasmy and local heterochiasmy, we use the notation SDI and SDI_local, respectively.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistical analysis</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used Pearson's correlations to compare chromosome sizes between populations. We tested for the presence of genome-wide sexual dimorphism using sign tests, with the SDI of each chromosome being one data point, and tested the relationship in SDI between populations using reduced major axis regression (NLRA in PASW Statistics for Mac Version 18.0.3, SPPS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). To calculate whether linkage group and interval SDI values fell outside the distribution, we conducted an outlier analysis. The critical values to treat a data point as an outlier were calculated by multiplying the difference between the 25% (Q1) and the 75% (Q3) quartiles by 2.2 and adding this to Q3 or subtracting it from Q1 (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29" href="#bib29">Hoaglin 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 1986
   </a>). Data points were classified as outliers, when they were either larger than the Q3 or small than the Q1 critical value. To analyse whether local heterochiasmy was conserved between the two populations the auto- and cross-correlation functions implemented in R version 2.13 (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54" href="#bib54">R Development Core Team, 2011</a>) were used. All other statistical analyses were conducted using PASW Statistics for Mac version 18.0.3 (SPSS Inc.).
