 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the NL population (
  <span class="italic">N</span>=393 birds), 6877 markers (mean informative meiosis±s.d.=224.6±94.4) were grouped into 32 putative great tit chromosomes based on the alignment of markers with the zebra finch genome. In the UK population (
  <span class="italic">N</span>=1656 birds), 6094 markers (mean informative meiosis±s.d.=408.0±124.2) were grouped into the same 32 putative great tit chromosomes, using AUTOGROUP on the set of autosomal SNPs. The grouping of markers by the AUTOGROUP option in CriMap demonstrated a remarkable conservation of synteny between the great tit and zebra finch genomes. Based on the very high proportion of markers within each group that aligned to a single zebra finch chromosome (range 91–100% mean=99.7), chromosome identities could be assigned unambiguously to each linkage group from homology with the zebra finch genome. We will, therefore, refer to the homologous chromosome number when referring to the linkage groups throughout the paper. This follows the convention of

   <span class="italic">et al.,</span> (2008)
  </a>, who assigned zebra finch linkage group names based on homology with the chicken assembly. Thus, great tit, zebra finch and chicken chromosome names are consistent. This method is in contrast to the historic approach of naming chromosomes in order of decreasing physical size. For example, from fluorescence
