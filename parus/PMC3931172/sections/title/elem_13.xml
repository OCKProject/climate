 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper we show that genetic maps are highly conserved between two great tit populations, using the same genetic markers, but different types of mapping population and different map-building methods. Owing to the construction of replicated independent genetic maps we were able to detect differences in recombination rate between sexes at a scale that has not previously been described in any bird species. Independent linkage maps also meant that genuine chromosomal rearrangements between species could be distinguished from alternative marker orders with similar likelihoods.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Heterochiasmy</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to the Haldane–Huxley rule, the recombination rate should be reduced in the heterogametic sex, that is, female maps are expected to be shorter than male maps in birds (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25" href="#bib25">Haldane, 1922</a>; 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31" href="#bib31">Huxley, 1928</a>). Our results add to a number of birds where whole-genome map sizes between males and females do not differ, at least not dramatically (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52" href="#bib52">Stapley 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2008
   </a>; 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24" href="#bib24">Groenen 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2009
   </a>). However, despite the relatively little genome-wide difference in male and female recombination rates, our results show that heterochiasmy is present at a more subtle, yet consistent scale both between and, especially, within chromosomes. Importantly, these findings are repeatable across populations, indicating that they are real features of the great tit genome rather than sex-biased random sampling of where recombination events were observed in the genome.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is possible that the relative position of the centromere is important with respect to local heterochiasmy. Unfortunately, we do not have information on centromere positions, and can, therefore, only speculate on this. Several studies have shown that recombination rates in birds are lowest around the centromeres, and that they increase towards the telomeres (see for example, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7" href="#bib7">Backström 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2010
   </a>), though these patterns have not previously been shown to differ between the two sexes. One intriguing possibility that requires further exploration is that local variation in heterochiasmy is related to the location of sexually antagonistic loci. It is well known that directional selection on any trait can result in an increase in recombination rate (see 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40" href="#bib40">Otto and Lenormand, 2002</a>). Therefore, conserved heterochiasmy on a local scale could indicate regions of the genome where selection is stronger in one sex than the other. For example, loci that explain variation in male fitness might be expected to be in regions of male-biased recombination rate and vice-versa. Measuring the fitness consequences of individual loci in wild populations remains notoriously difficult, but is perhaps possible in populations with extensive life history data and rapidly developing genomics resources, such as the great tit. The discovery of subtle, yet real, sex differences in recombination rates illustrates the advantages of replicating mapping studies in two independent mapping populations.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Population differences</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, our results show that the linkage maps of the two populations are very similar. We found no evidence that positions of groups of consecutive markers differed between the two populations, indicating no gene order differences between the populations. We did find order differences between single markers in 10 linkage groups, which are most likely due to power issues in assigning correct orders on a small scale rather than true rearrangements between the populations. Slightly different marker orders typically produce very similar likelihoods and total map lengths when there are insufficient recombination events to identify the true order. In domestic chicken, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24" href="#bib24">Groenen 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span> (2009)
   </a> compared maps between three mapping populations typed with the same SNP set. Though small differences were found, the authors explained this by differences in the data structure between the populations, causing variation in information content of the different markers, rather than assuming real population differences in gene order.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used two different methods of assigning SNPs to chromosomes. AUTOGROUP and 
   <span class="italic">in silico</span> mapping by BLASTing to the zebra finch genome produced near-identical linkage maps for the two populations, indicating that for avian species both these methods are robust, given a reasonably closely related genome for comparative mapping. Studies that cannot rely on reference genomes will, therefore, not be hampered by a lack of 
   <span class="italic">a priori</span> information on linkage information when building maps and will most likely perform better when using the AUTOGROUP method. A disadvantage of using a reference genome for assigning markers to expected chromosomes is that blast errors may complicate the building process. Moreover, markers with low information content are unlikely to be included when assigning markers to linkage groups using AUTOGROUP, increasing build speed and accuracy. Overall, we were able to incorporate marginally more markers in the NL map (using BLAST) compared with the UK map (using AUTOGROUP).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The extrapolated complete genetic map sizes of 2600 and 2700 cM, are similar to map lengths of other passerines like the zebra finch (

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33" href="#bib33">Jaari 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2009
   </a>), but they are smaller than those of chicken or turkey (∼3200 cM; 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24" href="#bib24">Groenen 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2009
   </a>; 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4" href="#bib4">Aslam 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2010
   </a>) and larger than map sizes of the great reed warbler (∼2000 cM; 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1" href="#bib1">Åkesson 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2007
   </a>), though this map was of lower density, probably underestimating total map length. This further demonstrates that passerines have a reduced recombination relative to domesticated galliformes (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52" href="#bib52">Stapley 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2008
   </a>), as genome sizes of passerines are in general comparable with chicken, at around 1.1–1.2 Gbp (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5" href="#bib5">Bachmann 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 1972
   </a>; 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3" href="#bib3">Andrews 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2009
   </a>). Recombination is often not evenly distributed within chromosomes and in birds is often more pronounced near the telomeres. Therefore, map sizes could be underestimated when marker density is low and distal parts of chromosomes are poorly covered. The large number of markers used here (relative to other passerine maps), means that differences in map length between passerines and chickens cannot be attributed to differences in genome coverage. One possible explanation for differences in map length is that artificial selection during domestication has led to an increased recombination rate in chickens (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40" href="#bib40">Otto and Lenormand, 2002</a>; 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24" href="#bib24">Groenen 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2009
   </a>). We found slightly larger map lengths in our captive F2-cross NL population compared with the wild UK population; these differences were, however, small compared with the between species differences, and were possibly due to the higher number of markers in the NL map, leading to inclusion of lower quality markers rather than an effect of the few generations of selection. Previous studies have demonstrated that adding error-prone markers tends to increase overall genetic map lengths (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23" href="#bib23">Groenen 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2000

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9" href="#bib9">Ball 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2010
   </a>). Without maps of wild galliformes being constructed, it remains unknown whether the passerine-galliform difference is a result of domestication of chickens and turkeys or an ancestral difference between passerines and galliformes that predates domestication.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interchromosomal rearrangements</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found only one putative interchromosomal rearrangement when comparing our map with other whole-genome high-density avian linkage maps. No previous evidence exists to expect that PMA25A and PMA25B represent two separate great tit chromosomes. A lack of power due to a lower number of markers on these linkage groups in combination with higher recombination rates in microchromosomes may, therefore, be the cause for not detecting linkage between these groups of markers. This observation is consistent with an earlier mapping study in zebra finch, where the homologues of several chicken microchromosomes were found to be split among more than one zebra finch linkage group (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52" href="#bib52">Stapley 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2008
   </a>), despite chromosome painting results, indicating that these linkage groups are physically on the same chromosome (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32" href="#bib32">Itoh and Arnold, 2005</a>; 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37" href="#bib37">Nanda 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2011
   </a>). However, when markers from PMA25A and PMA25B were mapped together in a single linkage group, there was relatively weak evidence of linkage between markers on these linkage groups in the NL data set and no evidence in the UK data set. At this stage it is unclear whether these linkage groups represent one or two chromosomes. Comparative mapping of the macrochromosomes gave identical results to a recent mapping study of the zebra finch, where markers aligning to GGA1 were found on three linkage groups (TGU1, TGU1A and TGU1B) and GGA4 was found to be homologous to two macrochromosomes (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52" href="#bib52">Stapley 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2008
   </a>). When more markers were added, TGU1 and TGU1B were merged (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7" href="#bib7">Backström 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2010
   </a>), which was confirmed in our study. This also confirms the results from chromosome painting studies for great tit, zebra finch and several other passerines (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The large blocks of synteny apparent by comparing the green anole lizard and the passerine great tit genome are, in general, consistent with an earlier comparison of green anole lizard and chicken (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2" href="#bib2">Alfoldi 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2011
   </a>). However, by comparing SNP locations in the great tit with their locations in the zebra finch, chicken and green anole lizard genomes, it was possible to infer the ancestral state of some of the largest differences between galliform and passerine karyotypes. Our results strongly suggest that chromosomes 1 and 1A were separate in a common avian ancestor, but became fused in the lineage that led to chickens. Similarly, PMA4 aligned to only one single 
   <span class="italic">Anolis carolinensis</span> chromosome (
   <span class="italic">A. carolinensis</span> 5), whereas none of the 115 SNPs that were present on PMA4A aligned to a position on the 
   <span class="italic">A. carolinensis</span> genome. Although this is not direct proof that PMA4 and PMA4A originate from two distinct ancestral chromosomes, it is consistent with the idea that these chromosomes also underwent a fusion in the chicken ancestor (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22" href="#bib22">Griffin 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2008

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Intrachromosomal rearrangements</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the highly conserved synteny between chickens and passerines, we found numerous intrachromosomal rearrangements. The two replicated maps were very consistent in support for the rearrangements, allowing us to conclude that they are true species-level rearrangements. Inversions and other changes in gene order are considered to be an important factor in speciation processes as they can promote reproductive isolation (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38" href="#bib38">Noor 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2001
   </a>). A comparison of multiple galliform and passerine species is needed to shed further light on this aspect of avian chromosome evolution; this is an exciting area for further research, as we anticipate increasingly dense avian linkage maps to become available (see for example, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53" href="#bib53">Stapley 
    <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2010
   </a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, we have constructed high-density linkage maps of two independent great tit populations. The maps will be valuable resources to aid with quantitative trait loci mapping, genome-wide association studies and chromosome partitioning of quantitative genetic variation (

More fundamentally, we show that replicated maps constructed using the same SNPs reveal new insight into bird karyotype evolution; in particular a hitherto undetected degree of fine scale heterochiasmy that opens up an exciting new opportunity to study the evolution and fitness consequences of heterochiasmy.
