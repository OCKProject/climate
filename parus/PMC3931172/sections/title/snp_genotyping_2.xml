  </a>). Genotyping results were analysed using Genome Studio software (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). A total of 8340 SNPs were successfully genotyped in both the NL and the UK population, but only 7215 and 7203 of these SNPs were polymorphic in the NL and UK population, respectively. After excluding markers with very low minor allele frequency (MAF&lt;0.01), 6897 and 7032 SNPs were used for map construction in the NL and UK populations, respectively. Detailed descriptions of SNP identification, SNP selection and genotyping results are given elsewhere (
