  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1" href="#bib1">Åkesson 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2007
  </a>), though this map was of lower density, probably underestimating total map length. This further demonstrates that passerines have a reduced recombination relative to domesticated galliformes (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52" href="#bib52">Stapley 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2008
  </a>), as genome sizes of passerines are in general comparable with chicken, at around 1.1–1.2 Gbp (

  </a>; 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3" href="#bib3">Andrews 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2009
  </a>). Recombination is often not evenly distributed within chromosomes and in birds is often more pronounced near the telomeres. Therefore, map sizes could be underestimated when marker density is low and distal parts of chromosomes are poorly covered. The large number of markers used here (relative to other passerine maps), means that differences in map length between passerines and chickens cannot be attributed to differences in genome coverage. One possible explanation for differences in map length is that artificial selection during domestication has led to an increased recombination rate in chickens (

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24" href="#bib24">Groenen 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2009
  </a>). We found slightly larger map lengths in our captive F2-cross NL population compared with the wild UK population; these differences were, however, small compared with the between species differences, and were possibly due to the higher number of markers in the NL map, leading to inclusion of lower quality markers rather than an effect of the few generations of selection. Previous studies have demonstrated that adding error-prone markers tends to increase overall genetic map lengths (

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9" href="#bib9">Ball 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2010
  </a>). Without maps of wild galliformes being constructed, it remains unknown whether the passerine-galliform difference is a result of domestication of chickens and turkeys or an ancestral difference between passerines and galliformes that predates domestication.
