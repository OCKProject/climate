 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used Pearson's correlations to compare chromosome sizes between populations. We tested for the presence of genome-wide sexual dimorphism using sign tests, with the SDI of each chromosome being one data point, and tested the relationship in SDI between populations using reduced major axis regression (NLRA in PASW Statistics for Mac Version 18.0.3, SPPS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). To calculate whether linkage group and interval SDI values fell outside the distribution, we conducted an outlier analysis. The critical values to treat a data point as an outlier were calculated by multiplying the difference between the 25% (Q1) and the 75% (Q3) quartiles by 2.2 and adding this to Q3 or subtracting it from Q1 (
