 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For 5396 of the 5855 SNPs that mapped on both the NL and the UK parsimonious linkage map, we found homology to the zebra finch genome; 1231 of the SNPs could be assigned locations on the chicken genome and 169 were aligned to the green anole lizard genome.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, gene order was conserved within syntenic blocks when comparing the map positions on the great tit parsimonious map with the physical position on the zebra finch (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Supplementary Figure 6</a>) and the chicken genome (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Supplementary Figure 7</a>). Two linkage groups (PMA8 and PMA19) did not show any intrachromosomal rearrangements within either the zebra finch–great tit or the chicken–great tit comparison, that is, marker order was exactly the same in great tit, zebra finch and chicken (see example in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" href="#fig4">Figure 4a</a>). For four linkage groups (PMA5, PMA9, PMA12 and PMA14) chromosomal rearrangements were similar whether comparing great tit to zebra finch or to chicken (see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" href="#fig4">Figure 4b</a>). These cases represent rearrangements that have occurred in the great tit lineage since great tits and zebra finches diverged. In four cases, rearrangements were only visible for the TGU-PMA comparison (PMA2, PMA10, PMA17 and PMA18) but not the GGA-PMA comparison (see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" href="#fig4">Figure 4c</a>). These represent rearrangements in the lineage leading to zebra finches after the great tit-zebra finch divergence. In five linkage groups (PMA4, PMA6, PMA13, PMA15 and PMA20) rearrangements were present only in the GGA-PMA comparison (see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" href="#fig4">Figure 4d</a>), and represent rearrangements that occurred after galliformes and passerines diverged, but before the divergence of great tits and zebra finches. The remaining linkage groups have undergone inversions in the great tit compared with either chicken or zebra finch, but more complex rearrangements were also observable. For example, in PMA1, represented by TGU1 and the distal part of GGA1, two inversions and a third inversion within the second inversion were present in the TGU-PMA comparison, although a rearrangement of ∼30 Mb is also present in the GGA-PMA comparison (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" href="#fig4">Figure 4e</a>). In another example, PMA7, an inversion of ∼8 Mb is present in the GGA-PMA comparison, although in the TGU-PMA comparison a large inversion of ∼25 Mb is also present in the central region of the chromosome (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" href="#fig4">Figure 4f</a>). Inference of ancestral states is more complicated for these cases, even when high-density maps from multiple passerine species are available.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Out of the 32 great tit linkage groups, 22 contained at least one SNP that could be assigned a location on the green anole lizard genome. Thirteen of these linkage groups had shared syntenic segments, with at least two SNP markers linked on both a green anole lizard chromosome and a great tit linkage group (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>). PMA1 and PMA1A aligned to different green anole lizard chromosomes, suggesting that a single chromosome 1/1A in chickens is a derived state.
