 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the highly conserved synteny between chickens and passerines, we found numerous intrachromosomal rearrangements. The two replicated maps were very consistent in support for the rearrangements, allowing us to conclude that they are true species-level rearrangements. Inversions and other changes in gene order are considered to be an important factor in speciation processes as they can promote reproductive isolation (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, we have constructed high-density linkage maps of two independent great tit populations. The maps will be valuable resources to aid with quantitative trait loci mapping, genome-wide association studies and chromosome partitioning of quantitative genetic variation (

  </a>). More fundamentally, we show that replicated maps constructed using the same SNPs reveal new insight into bird karyotype evolution; in particular a hitherto undetected degree of fine scale heterochiasmy that opens up an exciting new opportunity to study the evolution and fitness consequences of heterochiasmy.
