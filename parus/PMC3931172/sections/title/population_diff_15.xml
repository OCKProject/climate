 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, our results show that the linkage maps of the two populations are very similar. We found no evidence that positions of groups of consecutive markers differed between the two populations, indicating no gene order differences between the populations. We did find order differences between single markers in 10 linkage groups, which are most likely due to power issues in assigning correct orders on a small scale rather than true rearrangements between the populations. Slightly different marker orders typically produce very similar likelihoods and total map lengths when there are insufficient recombination events to identify the true order. In domestic chicken, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24" href="#bib24">Groenen 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span> (2009)
  </a> compared maps between three mapping populations typed with the same SNP set. Though small differences were found, the authors explained this by differences in the data structure between the populations, causing variation in information content of the different markers, rather than assuming real population differences in gene order.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used two different methods of assigning SNPs to chromosomes. AUTOGROUP and 
  <span class="italic">in silico</span> mapping by BLASTing to the zebra finch genome produced near-identical linkage maps for the two populations, indicating that for avian species both these methods are robust, given a reasonably closely related genome for comparative mapping. Studies that cannot rely on reference genomes will, therefore, not be hampered by a lack of 
  <span class="italic">a priori</span> information on linkage information when building maps and will most likely perform better when using the AUTOGROUP method. A disadvantage of using a reference genome for assigning markers to expected chromosomes is that blast errors may complicate the building process. Moreover, markers with low information content are unlikely to be included when assigning markers to linkage groups using AUTOGROUP, increasing build speed and accuracy. Overall, we were able to incorporate marginally more markers in the NL map (using BLAST) compared with the UK map (using AUTOGROUP).
