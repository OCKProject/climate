 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For linkage mapping we used a modified version (2.503) of the CriMap software (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21" href="#bib21">Green 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 1990
  </a>). We chose to present maps with three different marker densities in this manuscript: (i) framework maps, incorporating markers that could be assigned a most likely order with LOD&gt;3, that is, the best order is 10
  <span class="sup">3</span>=1000 times more likely than the next best alternative order (ii) comprehensive maps, where â€˜non-framework' markers were added by lowering levels of stringency (LOD&gt;0.1) and (iii) parsimonious maps, adding as many markers as possible to the comprehensive map with LOD&lt;0.1 (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We applied two different initial strategies for linkage group construction. For the NL map, we assigned 6877 SNPs to putative great tit chromosomes based on sequence homology between SNP flanking sequences and the zebra finch genome sequence. For the UK map, we used the TWOPOINT output of CriMap to create linkage groups with the AUTOGROUP command (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Supplementary Methods</a> for more details). In both mapping populations, the second allele of SNPs on the sex chromosome (Z), was assigned a dummy value (6) in females, to account for the hemizygosity of the female Z chromosome.
