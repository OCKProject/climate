 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Genome wide, there was no evidence for large sex differences in map length. We found no significant levels of heterochiasmy (SDI in the NL or the UK population (

An outlier analysis showed that the sex-specific linkage maps of three linkage groups in the NL population significantly differed from each other: males in PMA2, PMA3 and PMA13 had longer map lengths compared with females in the NL population. Although not significant, these three linkage groups also had the lowest SDI values (that is, greater recombination rates in males) in the UK population.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because replicated maps from independent populations were constructed, it was possible to examine whether subtle, more localised differences in heterochiasmy were conserved. Most revealingly, the plots (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>) and analyses of SDI_local revealed fine-scale heterochiasmy that was remarkably conserved between the two populations. Cross-correlations, in SDI_local, between the two populations were positive at all 22 chromosomes considered (range in 
  <span class="italic">r</span>=0.05–0.999; median 
  <span class="italic">r</span>=0.668; 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Supplementary Table 1</a>). A sign test on all 22 correlations being positive is highly significant (
  <span class="italic">P</span>=4.8 × 10
  <span class="sup">−7</span>, assuming a null expectation of a correlation being equally likely to be positive or negative). At 17 of the 22 chromosomes the cross-correlation would be regarded as significantly positive, if each window was regarded as an independent data point. Importantly, the overall pattern of local heterochiasmy being highly conserved across the two populations was not dependent on window size or the interval from one marker to the next (See 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Supplementary Figures 5a–c</a>, for SDI_local plots using alternative window sizes).
