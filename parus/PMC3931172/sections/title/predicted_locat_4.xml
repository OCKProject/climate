 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To identify and understand rearrangements in avian genomes, it is necessary to compare the positions of the homologues of typed markers on different species' genomes. Recently, the genome of the green anole lizard 
  <span class="italic">A. carolinensis</span> was sequenced and assembled (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2" href="#bib2">Alfoldi 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2011
  </a>). Here we examined chromosomal rearrangements between great tit, zebra finch, chicken and the green anole; the latter provides a useful out-group to the avian species. The position of the great tit SNPs on the zebra finch, chicken and green anole lizard genomes was predicted based on the alignment of 23 to 150 bases of flanking sequence to the respective genome sequence using the default parameters in blastn (with setting a minimum expectation value (
  <span class="italic">e</span>-value) of 10
  <span class="sup">âˆ’5</span>). The three genome sequences used for comparative mapping were downloaded from the Ensembl Genome Browser; zebra finch: version Taeniopygia_guttata.taeGut3.2.4.61,

  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org/Anolis_carolinensis/Info/Index" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.ensembl.org/Anolis_carolinensis/Info/Index</span>. Predicted physical map locations are the midpoints between the start and end of the mapping alignment and are, therefore, expected to be within 100 bases of the actual SNP position. Linkage groups and putative chromosomes were orientated according to the orientation of the chicken chromosomes.
