 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The NL and UK framework maps (LOD⩾3) contained 1766 and 1674 markers, respectively. Of these, 898 markers were present on both maps. When comparing the two maps, 37 out of these 898 markers had a position on both maps that could not be predicted from the position from the other map (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Supplementary Figures 1 and 2</a>). The mean interval between the position of these markers on the NL map and the position based on the UK map was 1.91 cM (range 0.02–5.40 cM).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The NL and UK framework maps spanned 1869 cM and 1893 cM, respectively, across 32 linkage groups, homologous to TGU1 to TGU15, TGU17 to TGU28, TGUZ and the zebra finch linkage group LGE22 (
  <a rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>). These linkage groups are homologous to GGA1 to GGA15, GGA17 to GGA28, GGAZ and two chicken linkage groups, LG2 and LGE22C19W28_E50C23. Markers that aligned with chicken chromosomes GGA1, GGA4 and GGA25 were assembled into two distinct linkage groups (PMA1 and PMA1A, PMA4 and PMA4A, and PMA25A and PMA25B) in both great tit populations. Merging the paired linkage groups into one resulted in a distance larger than 50 cM between the two groups of markers. For PMA25A/PMA25B, the two markers that were positioned closest together on the zebra finch genome, but were assigned to different linkage groups (PMA25A and PMA25B) were only 150k base pairs apart on the zebra finch genome. One pair of markers, M3554 from PMA25A and M6440 from PMA25B did have a twopoint LOD score of 2.2 in the NL population, but there was no evidence for linkage between this marker pair in the UK population. Furthermore, no other markers pointed to a possible linkage between PMA25A and PMA25B, suggesting that the two linkage groups may represent two different chromosomes.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The comprehensive maps contained 2853 markers spanning 1867 cM and 3162 markers spanning 1889 cM for the NL and UK populations, respectively. For the parsimonious map, a total of 5855 SNPs were placed on the NL map spanning 2010 cM (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Supplementary Figure 1</a>), whereas the UK map consisted of 4878 SNPs spanning 1917 cM (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Supplementary Figure 2</a>). This corresponds to an increase in size of 7.7% (NL) and 1.5% (UK) compared with the framework maps. In total 6554 unique SNP markers were present on either the NL map or the UK map. Of these, 4189 were present on both the NL and the UK map, whereas 1666 SNPs were unique to the NL map and 699 markers were present on the UK map and not on the NL map. The MAF for the 1666 markers present on the NL map, but not on the UK map (NL specific: mean±s.e.m.; 0.339±0.003), was significantly lower (

  <sub>5140</sub>=4.16, 
  <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;0.001) compared with the MAF of markers present on both maps (present on both: mean±s.e.m.; 0.352±0.001). The MAF for the markers that were present on the UK map, but not on NL map did not have significantly lower MAF (UK specific: mean±s.e.m.; 0.345±0.003) than those on both maps. The number of SNPs per linkage group ranged from 5 (PMALGE22) to 664 (PMA2) for the NL population and from 3 (PMALGE22) to 624 (PMA2) for the UK population. There were no marker inconsistencies at linkage group level (that is, no marker was present on a specific linkage group on one map and present on another linkage group on the other map). Within the linkage groups, we found high consistency between the marker orders in the two populations (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Supplementary Figure 3</a>), the only rearrangements being apparent were local inversions involving a small number of markers (see discussion). Recombination rates (measured as cM/Mbp) tended to be greater at the ends of macrochromosomes than in the central parts, although unlike the situation in captive zebra finch populations, recombination ‘deserts' were not observed in the middle of macrochromosomes (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Supplementary Figure 4</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Linkage group sizes ranged from 4.58 cM to 138.15 cM in the NL population and from 3.68 cM to 139.88 cM in the UK population (
  <a rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>), and these sizes were highly correlated between the populations (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>;

  <span class="italic">n</span>=32; 
  <span class="italic">P</span>&lt;0.001), indicating that the recombination rates were not population dependent, and did not differ systematically between the wild and recently-founded captive populations studied here. Based on the alignment of the flanking sequences of the most distal SNPs in great tit linkage map to the zebra finch genome, the total genome coverage was 97.1% (range 77.7–99.8 for individual linkage groups) for the NL map and 98.3% (range 28.4–99.8) for the UK map (
  <a rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>). Assuming that our linkage map covers 32 of the expected 40 chromosomes (that is, taking PMA25A, PMA25B and LGE22 as a separate great tit chromosome), and that these three and the eight missing microchromosomes have at least one obligate recombination event during meiosis, implying a map size of at least 50 cM per chromosome, the total predicted map sizes are ∼2700 cM for the NL and ∼2600 cM for the UK populations.
