 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The weight of birds before the experiment did not differ between treatments (F
  <sub>1,26</sub> = 0.17, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.69), but differed between sexes (ANOVA, F
  <sub>1,26</sub> = 5.37, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.03), and the interaction between treatment and sex was not significant (F
  <sub>1,26</sub> = 1.34, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.26).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to analyse the differences between treatments and sexes in the weight lost by birds. We used two-way Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) to examine the differences in the Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) and in the mean body temperature in relation to the treatment and the sex, including the mean weight (the mean between the initial and final body weight) as a covariate. We included the interaction between treatment and sex in all the models. Differences between treatments (between subject factor) in the oxygen consumption and in the body temperature of birds before (odourless condition) and during the scent exposition (time, within subject factor) were analysed separately for the first and second periods of scent exposition by using repeated measure ANOVA. We included the interaction between treatment and time during exposition to test whether there were differences between treatments in the response of birds before (odourless condition) and during each scent exposition.</p>
