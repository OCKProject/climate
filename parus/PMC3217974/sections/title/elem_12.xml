 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Birds were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups: an experimental group exposed to the odour of a potential mammal predator (fresh ferret urine), and a control group exposed to the odour of an herbivorous mammal (fresh rabbit urine). We added an absorbent paper soiled with the correspondent odour to a box situated ahead of each respirometry chambers (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027576-g003" href="#pone-0027576-g003">Fig. 3</a>). Each test day, we used new papers and cleaned the respirometry chambers.

   <p>Schematic representation of the respirometer used in the experiment. From left to right: carbon dioxide and humidity are removed from inlet air thanks to a column containing one layer of Ascarite (A) surrounded by two layers of Drierite (D). Pumps force the air in three different circuits: i) a reference circuit (top) containing an empty chamber used to calculate the amount of oxygen used by the birds in the other chambers, ii) a second circuit (middle) leading to the three chambers containing the birds exposed to predator (ferret) odour, and iii) a third circuit (bottom) leading to the three chambers containing birds exposed to the control (rabbit) odour. In each of these two last circuits, a first valve lead the inlet air either in a compartment containing the urine-damped filter paper, or a compartment containing a dry, odourless, filter paper. A flowmeter setting the flow rate to 250 ml min
    <span class="sup">âˆ’1</span> precedes each animal chamber. A second set of valves, installed after each animal chamber, controls from which chamber the oxygen concentration is measured.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We obtained predator odour by placing clean absorbent papers under the cages of five male ferrets (
  <span class="italic">Mustela furo</span> L.). We used ferrets because, even though ferrets are not natural predators of great tits, the scent (especially the one produced by anal sac secretion that they use to mark the territory) is very similar to those of other mustelids, such as 
  <span class="italic">M. erminea</span> and 
  <span class="italic">M. putorius</span>
  <a rid="pone.0027576-Brinck1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0027576-Brinck1">[37]</a> that include birds in their diets. Ferret scent has been used in several vertebrates that are not depredated by this mustelid, including great tits, and it induced avoidance-associated behaviours (e.g. 
  <a rid="pone.0027576-Amo1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0027576-Amo1">[28]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0027576-Amo2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0027576-Amo2">[29]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0027576-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0027576-Zhang1">[38]</a>). We chose papers soiled with fresh urine and gland secretions associated to scent-marking behaviour, whereas papers containing faeces were discarded. We placed papers under the ferret cages three days before the experiment, to ensure odour collection. When collecting papers daily for the experiment, we selected wet papers containing recent cues. This method of odour collection has proven successful in previous studies with hole breeding passerines

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The control treatment was obtained by using the same methodology to collect rabbit (
  <span class="italic">Oryctolagus cuniculus</span> L.) urine. We used this odorant control because rabbits are herbivorous and therefore, their chemical cues should not be associated with a predation risk for the birds.
