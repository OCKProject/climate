 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results suggest that sleeping birds are not able to detect the chemical cues of predators, as they did not exhibit any response to the predator treatment in the physiological variables that we measured here. Birds exposed to predators' scent did not exhibit higher metabolic rates, higher temperatures or a greater loss of body weight compared to birds exposed to the scent of a non-predatory mammal. Birds in our experiment decreased their body temperature by 3.5°C, meaning that they only had a moderate degree of nocturnal hypothermia. They did not enter into torpor, which can be defined as a drastic decrease of body temperature reaching values of more than 12°C 
  <a rid="pone.0027576-Reinertsen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0027576-Reinertsen1">[23]</a>. However, despite this low decrease in temperature they did not react to the chemical cues of predators. An alternative explanation could be that birds responded in a similar way to the scent of a non-predatory mammal than to a predatory mammal. However, awake birds are known to exhibit behavioural responses to predator scent but not to other scents (including rabbit scent 
  <a rid="pone.0027576-Roth1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0027576-Roth1">[30]</a>) or odourless controls 
  <a rid="pone.0027576-Amo1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0027576-Amo1">[28]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0027576-Roth1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0027576-Roth1">[30]</a>. Thus, if great tits are physiologically able to discriminate between a predator scent and other scents while they are awake 
  <a rid="pone.0027576-Amo2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0027576-Amo2">[29]</a>, we would also expect them to discriminate between such scents while asleep. Although a differential discrimination capacity while awake or asleep might seem unlikely, we would have needed a third group of birds that would not have been exposed to any organic scent to formally exclude this possibility. This would have allowed us to know whether the physiological profiles observed early in the night reflect the normal nocturnal variation in oxygen consumption and body temperature or a general, non-specific, response to odors. Further research is needed to examine whether the ability to discriminate scents changes during the sleeping period. Another explanation could be that the lack of difference between treatments is a methodological artefact due to the stress of manipulation that may have caused birds to remain alert during the night. However, since birds decreased their body temperature during the first minutes of the experiment (see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027576-g002" href="#pone-0027576-g002">Fig. 2b</a>), this explanation seems unlikely. Therefore, our results suggest that birds are not able to detect chemical cues of predators while they are sleeping, or at least they do not respond to them. Despite the fact that chemical cues may provide a first warning of the presence of a predator, they often persist after the predator has left the area 
  <a rid="pone.0027576-Kats1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0027576-Kats1">[27]</a>. Therefore, other cues, such as auditory or vibratory cues may reveal the current presence of the predator more accurately than chemical ones. So, such cues may probably be more meaningful stimuli for eliciting an arousal response.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To compensate for their susceptibility to the risk of predation while sleeping, birds may exhibit antipredatory strategies prior to sleep. One of the main strategies is to select safe places where to sleep. It has been shown that birds actively select for cavities before dusk 
  <a rid="pone.0027576-Vek1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0027576-Vek1">[31]</a>, and that they avoid cavities containing signals of predators as well as predation. For example, great tits avoid roosting in cavities containing traces of predator presence, i.e. mammal fur and mangled feathers 
  <a rid="pone.0027576-Ekner1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0027576-Ekner1">[32]</a>. Results of a previous study have also shown that when great tits were offered two nest-boxes for roosting, with one of them containing the scent of a predator, significantly more birds slept outside of any nest-box compared to situations where one of the nest-boxes contained control scent 
  <a rid="pone.0027576-Amo2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0027576-Amo2">[29]</a>. Therefore, the use of chemical cues of predators seems to have an important role in selecting safe roosting places. Furthermore, predation risk may also have influenced population differences in the use of roosting places for sleeping. For example, blue tits from populations where mustelid predation is high do not roost in nest-boxes, while blue tits from populations where owl predation is prevalent do

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, our results demonstrated that birds do not detect predator chemical cues while sleeping, or at least, that they lose their capacity to discriminate between chemical cues emitted by predators and other scents. Therefore, previous antipredatory strategies, such as roosting sites inspection, may be crucial in determining their night survival. Further studies examining in detail sleep composition (e.g. percentages of time in REM or SWS sleep) as well as type of sleep (bi- or unihemispheric sleep) are needed to study the ability of birds to detect chemical cues during the sleep period in more detail. Such techniques may reveal encephalic responses 
  <a rid="pone.0027576-Lesku1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0027576-Lesku1">[34]</a> to scents that may not affect the physiological measurements considered in our study, as previous evidence suggests that sleeping animals can detect scents 
  <a rid="pone.0027576-Cattarelli1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0027576-Cattarelli1">[35]</a> even if they do not always respond to them, i.e., they do not wake up
