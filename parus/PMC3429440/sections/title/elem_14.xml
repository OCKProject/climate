  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Significance of Nesting Mortality on Breeding Time</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here we showed that in red-backed shrikes, a species that readily establishes replacement clutches, higher seasonal mean nesting mortality would shift the overall distribution of hatching dates in a season towards later calendar dates. This effect was apparent also after accounting for the ambient temperatures prevailing during the onset of breeding, and for breeding density (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043944-g002" href="#pone-0043944-g002">Fig. 2</a>). Hence, a general increase in nesting mortality after the early 1980ties (see 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043944-g001" href="#pone-0043944-g001">Fig. 1</a> in 
   <a rid="pone.0043944-Huek3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Huek3">[49]</a>) may have been counteracting the effect of a general increase in spring temperatures, and a higher breeding density on annual variation in breeding times.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Admittingly, the demonstrated effect of the seasonal mean nesting mortality on the overall seasonal distribution of red-backed shrike breeding dates was rather weaker, i.e. with a shallower slope, than the effects of spring temperature and breeding density (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043944-g002" href="#pone-0043944-g002">Fig. 2</a>). The annual variation in mean breeding time of the local populations amounted to three weeks (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043944.s005" href="#pone.0043944.s005">Table S2</a>), whereas even high rates of nesting mortality only seemed to cause a delay of a few (up to 3–4, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043944-g002" href="#pone-0043944-g002">Fig. 2</a>) days in annual mean hatching dates of all successful nests. Generally, the nesting mortality did not account well for the effect of year on mean hatching date while spring temperature did. Yet, the effect of nesting mortality appeared to be strong enough to enhance or even counteract the effects of other factors, particularly increasing spring temperatures, on the inter-annual variation in breeding dates. Breeding late within the season is generally assumed to be costly as it may reduce current and future survival prospects of both parents and offspring

   <a rid="pone.0043944-Smith1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Smith1">[67]</a>, e.g. because of temporal mismatch between breeding time and the time of peak food availability 
   <a rid="pone.0043944-vanNoordwijk1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-vanNoordwijk1">[2]</a>,

   <a rid="pone.0043944-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Thomas1">[14]</a>. Considering the effects of nesting mortality is therefore of particular importance in climate change studies in species that suffer high nesting mortality and that are readily capable of renesting. Many phenological studies focus exclusively on the distribution of first clutches. Our results show that the seasonal distribution of the total reproductive output may be affected by the proportion of replacement clutches.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The likelihood of renesting after having produced a successful brood is affected by food availability and the seasonal timing of nesting mortality 
   <a rid="pone.0043944-Nagy1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Nagy1">[68]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0043944-Verboven1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Verboven1">[69]</a>. Similar factors probably affect renesting occurrence in many species where a replacement clutch is laid only if the first attempt fails 
   <a rid="pone.0043944-Antczak1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Antczak1">[43]</a>. On the contrary, exclusively single-brooded species, which are often long-lived, might postpone reproduction to the following year if the costs associated with renesting are too high

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although, no inference can be reached on effect of nesting mortality on the timing of first clutches, it is clear that the seasonal shift in distribution of all breeding dates (first and replacement clutches pooled) also depends on the seasonality in nesting mortality. Similarly, based on life history modelling, Varpe et al. 
   <a rid="pone.0043944-Varpe1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Varpe1">[3]</a> have suggested that seasonality in predation (and resource abundance) affects reproductive prospects in a copepod 
   <span class="italic">Calanoides acutus</span> by incurring seasonality in egg fitness. We built upon these finding by showing that distribution of reproductive output modelled as a difference between mean hatching date and mean hatching date weighted by the brood size shifted according to the seasonal pattern in daily mortality rate, spring progress and breeding density (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043944-g003" href="#pone-0043944-g003">Fig. 3</a>). When the daily mortality rate was modelled as a linear function of the seasonal date, we showed that an increasing seasonal trend in nesting mortality was associated with larger broods occurring earlier in the season (negative standardized differentials for hatching dates), while a decreasing seasonal trend in nesting mortality was associated with larger broods occurring later in the season (positive standardized differentials, see 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043944-g003" href="#pone-0043944-g003">Fig. 3b</a>). In many years, there was no clear seasonal linear trend in daily mortality rate at all sites (see clump of data around value 0, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043944-g003" href="#pone-0043944-g003">Fig. 3b</a>). Variability in estimates of seasonality in daily mortality rate in such cases increased considerably. As a result, some estimates appeared as outliers though those were biologically the most important ones. When only significant seasonal trends in daily mortality rate were analyzed, the pattern turned more apparent (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043944.s003" href="#pone.0043944.s003">Fig. S3b</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effect caused by the seasonality in nesting mortality on the distribution of reproductive output (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043944-g003" href="#pone-0043944-g003">Fig. 3b</a>) is comparable in strength to the one caused by the speed of the advancement of spring (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043944-g003" href="#pone-0043944-g003">Fig. 3a</a>). The predicted standardized differentials for hatching dates for minimal and maximal values of the seasonality in nesting mortality at mean values of remaining covariates (−0.002 and −0.129) were similar to the predicted standardized differentials for minimal and maximal values of the spring progress (−0.037 and −0.121).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Non-mutually exclusive explanations exist to account for this observation because the distribution of the reproductive output on the population level may either mirror partial offspring mortality, seasonally plastic reproductive investment of individuals, or seasonal variability in timing of breeding of higher quality individuals rearing larger broods. The former might result from partial predation, selective predation on larger broods or partial mortality caused by deteriorated climate, food shortage or stronger competition. Whether or not birds adjust their seasonal reproductive effort in terms of timing of breeding, or clutch size, to seasonal patterns in nest predation, as determined by e.g. perceived predator density and activity, remains a major question

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recently, Decker et al. 2012 
   <a rid="pone.0043944-Decker1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Decker1">[74]</a> did not find any support for the effect of seasonally decreasing nesting mortality rate on clutch size variation in red-faced warblers (
   <span class="italic">Cardellina rubrifrons</span>). In our study system, the association of larger broods occurring early in the season with seasonally increasing nesting mortality might simply be caused by decreased proportion of smaller replacement clutches in the population. This can not, however, explain the association of larger broods occurring later in the season with seasonally decreasing nesting mortality as larger replacement clutches are unlikely in red-backed shrikes 
   <a rid="pone.0043944-Antczak1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Antczak1">[43]</a>. Given a minor role of starvation and partial predation, our data rather suggest at least partial flexibility in brood size and/or seasonal variability in timing of breeding of higher quality birds according to seasonality in nesting mortality.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Czech subpopulation of the red-backed shrike, there is a trend over the years for spring to be more progressed at the time of hatching (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043944-g001" href="#pone-0043944-g001">Fig. 1c</a>). Yet, there does not seem to be any comparable inter-annual trend in the seasonality of the nesting mortality (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043944-g001" href="#pone-0043944-g001">Fig. 1d</a>), which might have possibly constrained any systematic shift in the annual distribution of the reproductive output (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043944-g001" href="#pone-0043944-g001">Fig. 1b</a>). Inter-annually consistent patterns in seasonality in nesting mortality, e.g. caused by predator activity, seem to be rather rare and might often be counfounded by more random climatic effects. In general, juvenile mortality might be caused by abiotic 
   <a rid="pone.0043944-Landa1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Landa1">[1]</a> or biotic 
   <a rid="pone.0043944-Einum1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Einum1">[5]</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0043944-NaefDaenzer1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-NaefDaenzer1">[31]</a> factors but predation is frequently identified to be one of the major factors causing nesting mortality in birds

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We did only consider mean annual estimates of breeding density in our study, though the fine tuning seasonality aspect might also be present, e.g. when caused by skewed distribution or arrival dates. Breeding density determines seasonal fitness primarily through competition for resources and altering of social interactions

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Limitations of Studies on Nesting Mortality</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the studies of nesting mortality on timing of breeding, the main limititation is a demand for large annual sample sizes of nest failure data over many years because lower sample sizes cause less precise estimates of the seasonality trends. However, despite such limitations, we are confident in the main finding of our study, because the results obtained by including reciprocal variance of mortality estimates as weights in the model did not change qualitatively, though appeared a little weaker (or stronger) in some cases. Even if the effects were weak or formally not significant in the red-backed shrike population, they might be of major importance in other species suffering increased (or decreased) nesting mortality over the years in a rapidly changing world. Also, estimates of linear seasonal trend in DMR should rather be handled with caution because generally, data from the beginning of the season (egg laying, incubation) were scarce in our dataset (see 
   <a rid="pone.0043944-Huek3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Huek3">[49]</a>). We are however confident with the main qualitative conclusions reached in our study because (1) we excluded years with largely uneven seasonal searching effort, and (2) the seasonality in DMR estimated primarily from hatching dates should still be of biological relevance for the hatching dates themselves.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, we provide the first correlative study to demonstrate the relationship between variation in nesting mortality and the inter-annual seasonal distribution of timing of breeding on the population level in birds with implication for climate change studies. Moreover, we show that the seasonal patterns in nesting mortality affect the seasonal distribution of the reproductive output of the whole population.</p>
