 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the studies of nesting mortality on timing of breeding, the main limititation is a demand for large annual sample sizes of nest failure data over many years because lower sample sizes cause less precise estimates of the seasonality trends. However, despite such limitations, we are confident in the main finding of our study, because the results obtained by including reciprocal variance of mortality estimates as weights in the model did not change qualitatively, though appeared a little weaker (or stronger) in some cases. Even if the effects were weak or formally not significant in the red-backed shrike population, they might be of major importance in other species suffering increased (or decreased) nesting mortality over the years in a rapidly changing world. Also, estimates of linear seasonal trend in DMR should rather be handled with caution because generally, data from the beginning of the season (egg laying, incubation) were scarce in our dataset (see 
  <a rid="pone.0043944-Huek3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Huek3">[49]</a>). We are however confident with the main qualitative conclusions reached in our study because (1) we excluded years with largely uneven seasonal searching effort, and (2) the seasonality in DMR estimated primarily from hatching dates should still be of biological relevance for the hatching dates themselves.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, we provide the first correlative study to demonstrate the relationship between variation in nesting mortality and the inter-annual seasonal distribution of timing of breeding on the population level in birds with implication for climate change studies. Moreover, we show that the seasonal patterns in nesting mortality affect the seasonal distribution of the reproductive output of the whole population.</p>
