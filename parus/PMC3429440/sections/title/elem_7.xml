 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At each study site there was a large inter-annual variation in timing of breeding with a maximum range of 21 days for mean hatching date, and 22 days for first hatching date, respectively, particularly so at site C (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043944.s005" href="#pone.0043944.s005">Table S2</a>). Estimated DMR also varied considerably among years, from 0.010 to 0.042 (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Across all sites, there was significant linear trend for earlier mean hatching date (LMMs with site as a random effect, fixed effects of year: b

  <sub>year</sub> = 0.01±0.005, t = 1.99, p = 0.05). There was no trend in either the standardized differentials for hatching dates (SD

   <p>Data across four sites in the Czech Republic during the period 1965–2006 were modelled by generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) including year as a fixed continuous explanatory variable and the site as a random effect. The fitted smooth functions (“
    <span class="italic">s(covariate, edf)</span>” in the title of y axis) of the effect of year indicate its effect size with its 95% confidence intervals. Smoothing terms for the effect of year on a) mean hatching date: edf = 1, t = −3.12, p = 0.0033; b) standardized differential for hatching date (SD
    <sub>HD</sub>): edf = 1, t = 0.16, p = 0.87; c) mean cumulated total of degree days at hatching date with temperature threshold 0°C (mean CDD
    <sub>HD</sub>): edf = 1, t = 2.22, p = 0.032, similarly mean May temperature (T
    <sub>MAY</sub>) which is not shown; and d) standardized seasonal linear trend in daily mortality rate (trendDMR): edf = 1, t = 0.16, p = 0.87). Points are the partial residuals of the response (i.e. Pearson residuals added to the smooth term). The coincidence of the line of the estimated effect and its confidence intervals at the point where the line passes through zero for smooth terms with one degree of freedom is the result of the identifiability constraint applied for the smooth term (see 
    <a rid="pone.0043944-Arnold1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Arnold1">[62]</a> for details). Site A: full circles, site B: full triangles, site C: empty circles and site D: empty triangles. See
