 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Estimates of breeding density (number of breeding pairs per km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) for the respective study sites were available only for the period 1994–2006 from reports by red-backed shrike ringers and observers of the Czech Shrike Working Group 
  <a rid="pone.0043944-Mikk1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Mikk1">[51]</a>. The ln-transformed estimates were however strongly correlated with the respective ln-transformed numbers of ringed broods per km
  <span class="sup">2</span> from our data (r = 0.81, p&lt;0.001, n = 22). Therefore we used the ln-transformed number of ringed broods per km
  <span class="sup">2</span> available for all years as a proxy for annual conspecific density (“ln(density)” hereafter).
