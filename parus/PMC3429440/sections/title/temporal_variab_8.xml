 <p>Data across four sites in the Czech Republic during the period 1965–2006 were modelled by generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) including year as a fixed continuous explanatory variable and the site as a random effect. The fitted smooth functions (“
  <span class="italic">s(covariate, edf)</span>” in the title of y axis) of the effect of year indicate its effect size with its 95% confidence intervals. Smoothing terms for the effect of year on a) mean hatching date: edf = 1, t = −3.12, p = 0.0033; b) standardized differential for hatching date (SD
  <sub>HD</sub>): edf = 1, t = 0.16, p = 0.87; c) mean cumulated total of degree days at hatching date with temperature threshold 0°C (mean CDD
  <sub>HD</sub>): edf = 1, t = 2.22, p = 0.032, similarly mean May temperature (T
  <sub>MAY</sub>) which is not shown; and d) standardized seasonal linear trend in daily mortality rate (trendDMR): edf = 1, t = 0.16, p = 0.87). Points are the partial residuals of the response (i.e. Pearson residuals added to the smooth term). The coincidence of the line of the estimated effect and its confidence intervals at the point where the line passes through zero for smooth terms with one degree of freedom is the result of the identifiability constraint applied for the smooth term (see 
  <a rid="pone.0043944-Arnold1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Arnold1">[62]</a> for details). Site A: full circles, site B: full triangles, site C: empty circles and site D: empty triangles. See
