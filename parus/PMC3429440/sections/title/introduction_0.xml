 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Optimal timing of reproduction is important from both the life-time and the seasonal perspective. In seasonal environments, animals may often benefit from an early time of breeding

  <a rid="pone.0043944-Verhulst1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Verhulst1">[7]</a>. In a wider geographical comparison, a main proximate driver is the seasonal prolongation of the photoperiod affecting timing of reproduction on the annual basis, especially at higher latitudes

  <a rid="pone.0043944-Hahn1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Hahn1">[9]</a>. On a more local basis, and at a finer scale, other seasonal factors are involved, in particular climate

  <a rid="pone.0043944-Visser1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Visser1">[11]</a>. Ultimately, reproductive success is maximized when the emergence of progeny coincides with periods of favourable food abundances

  <a rid="pone.0043944-Nilsson2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Nilsson2">[22]</a>. Among these, food abundance has been recognized to play a primary role, while other factors have received less attention, though they may also affect breeding recruitment of progeny to the subsequent population

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recently, many organisms, and particularly birds, seem to start reproduction earlier in the season as a result of higher spring temperatures 
  <a rid="pone.0043944-Mller1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Mller1">[24]</a>. However, some bird species do not seem to advance breeding fast enough to synchronize with the advancement of the peak in prey availability 
  <a rid="pone.0043944-Both1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Both1">[25]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0043944-Stenseth1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Stenseth1">[26]</a>. Different hypotheses have been proposed for this mis-match, e.g. genetic constraints on commencing earlier breeding 
  <a rid="pone.0043944-Winkler1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Winkler1">[27]</a>, a difference between the cues used by birds for the onset of breeding and the cues used by their prey for growth 
  <a rid="pone.0043944-Both2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Both2">[28]</a>, and opposing selection on breeding dates from matching lower and higher trophic levels 
  <a rid="pone.0043944-Both1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Both1">[25]</a>. Indeed, the importance of any ultimate factor on the timing of breeding depends on the degree of its seasonality (i.e. seasonal variability). In environments where seasonality in resource abundance is less pronounced, other factors might become of major importance, such as conspecifics density and nesting mortality.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lack 
  <a rid="pone.0043944-Lack1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Lack1">[12]</a> suggested a rather minor role of juvenile mortality for the timing of breeding in birds but some contradictory evidence comes from the cavity nesting great tits 
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span> and coal tits 
  <span class="italic">P. ater</span>. Seasonal increase in post-fledging predation by European sparrowhawks

  <a rid="pone.0043944-Gtmark1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Gtmark1">[30]</a> seems to generate directional selection on early breeding in these birds, the selection being particularly strong soon after the nestlings have left the nest 
  <a rid="pone.0043944-NaefDaenzer1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-NaefDaenzer1">[31]</a>. Yet, open nesting species suffer from high predation pressure already during the nesting period 
  <a rid="pone.0043944-Ricklefs1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Ricklefs1">[32]</a>. Mixed evidence exists for the effect of nest predation on seasonal timing of reproduction, with some studies supporting Lackâ€™s view

  <a rid="pone.0043944-Mnkknen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Mnkknen1">[38]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0043944-Morosinotto1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Morosinotto1">[39]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0043944-Morton1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Morton1">[40]</a>,

  <a rid="pone.0043944-Scheuerlein1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Scheuerlein1">[42]</a>. Morton 
  <a rid="pone.0043944-Morton1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Morton1">[40]</a> suggested that higher nest predation later in the season is the main factor causing tropical clay colored robins 
  <span class="italic">Turdus grayi</span> to breed early, while Pienkowski 
  <a rid="pone.0043944-Pienkowski1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Pienkowski1">[41]</a> showed that ringed plovers 
  <span class="italic">Charadrius hiaticula</span> may start egg laying relatively late apparently to avoid high nest predation early in the season. Seasonal increase, or decrease, in nesting mortality may thus select for earlier, or later, breeding, respectively. More recently, some studies have provided evidence that birds may delay egg-laying when the perceived predation risk is high 
  <a rid="pone.0043944-Morosinotto1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Morosinotto1">[39]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0043944-Scheuerlein1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Scheuerlein1">[42]</a>, although others have shown an opposite pattern even in the same species 
  <a rid="pone.0043944-Mnkknen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Mnkknen1">[38]</a>. After a breeding failure, birds are also faced with the decision of whether or not to produce a replacement clutch 
  <a rid="pone.0043944-Antczak1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Antczak1">[43]</a>. This is because renesting often occurs after a nest failure, particularly early in the season, in order to secure reproductive output. All else being equal, the higher the general level of nesting mortality, the more breeding pairs will establish a replacement clutch. As a result, the overall seasonal distribution of breeding dates of a population will be shifted towards later dates.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In many species, inter-annual trends exist in mean seasonal nesting mortality 
  <a rid="pone.0043944-Siriwardena1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Siriwardena1">[44]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0043944-Wright1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Wright1">[45]</a>. If breeding failures are common, and many individuals are able to renest quickly, this will strongly influence the apparent breeding phenology of the whole population. Hence, insights in nesting mortality/renesting dynamics are crucial to single out effects of other factors, such as global change of climate (increasing temperature, and phenological advancement of the food supply).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Central Europe, an open-nesting passerine bird, the red-backed shrike 
  <span class="italic">Lanius collurio</span>, L., recently tends to arrive earlier to the breeding grounds in Poland and Hungary 
  <a rid="pone.0043944-Tryjanowski1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Tryjanowski1">[46]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0043944-Vgvri1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Vgvri1">[47]</a> and to start breeding earlier in the Czech Republic 
  <a rid="pone.0043944-Huek2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Huek2">[48]</a>. This seems to be related to increasing spring temperatures and/or breeding densities 
  <a rid="pone.0043944-Huek1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Huek1">[16]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0043944-Huek2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Huek2">[48]</a>. However, in this species great variation and long-term changes have also occurred in nesting mortality 
  <a rid="pone.0043944-Huek3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0043944-Huek3">[49]</a>. Here we study long-term breeding data of this species, first (prediction #1) asking how the relationship between nesting mortality/renesting may have influenced the breeding phenology of the species over the years, controling for the effects of spring temperatures, and breeding density. Second (prediction #2), we test the hypothesis that a seasonal decrease in nesting mortality will shift the distribution of the reproductive output to larger broods occurring later in the season, whereas a seasonal increase in nesting mortality will give an opposite result. Hence, we study the interplay of three ultimate factors, namely seasonalities in general spring progress, nesting mortality, and breeding density, in determining the seasonality in the reproductive output of the red-backed shrike.
