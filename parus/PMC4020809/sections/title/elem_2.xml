 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The NIPS 2013 database is composed of 1687 field-recordings each containing vocalisations of 0–6 different species. A subset of 687 recordings is offered as a training set accompanied with known annotation from bioacoustics experts and we seek the species existing in the other 1000 recordings. The hardware used to collect the data was a number of ARUs placed at different locations of the French Provence and provided by the BIOTOPE society (see

All recordings are monophonic, sampled at 44100 Hz with variable duration from 0.25 up to 5.75 secs. We did not downsample the original recordings as there were insect species singing up to 20 kHz and night birds calling as low as at 500 Hz.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The training set matches the test set conditions. The list of animals can be found in 
  <a rid="pone.0096936-Glotin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0096936-Glotin1">[14]</a> and contains the most encountered species in central Europe. Another unique aspect of the NIPS dataset is the distinction between calls and songs of the same species that are treated as distinct categories that the algorithms should resolve. The recordings are selected in such a way that different kinds of difficulties are encountered in almost every recording, namely:

  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Different bird species can and often do overlap in the same time-frame. Vocalizations can also overlap in frequency but, do not generally overlap both in time and frequency simultaneously. This can be attributed to the sparsity of the time-frequency domain but also to the observed fact that co-existing species make use of different bandwidths in order to communicate efficiently.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Different gains of signals due to distance: as many vocalizing animals can be at any distance from the microphone, often weak calls are picked up along with a dominating vocalization (see 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096936-g001" href="#pone-0096936-g001">Fig. 1</a>).
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Anthropogenic noises such as airplanes, sirens, footsteps, human speech in biotopes near urban territories can lead any classifier to error, because they either obscure the target signal causing a miss or become themselves classified as the target signal (false alarm).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Abiotic sounds due to heavy wind, rain, and recording device failures can substantially reduce the quality of recordings. The sound of rain-drops and recording device failures produce sound events that are short-time with broadband spectral characteristics and can be misled with insect stridulations (see 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096936-g002" href="#pone-0096936-g002">Fig. 2</a>).
