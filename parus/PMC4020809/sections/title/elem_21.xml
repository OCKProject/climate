 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A useful by-product of building a classifier of multiple species is to make a binary classifier that decides whether there is any animal sound in a recording. The binary classifier uses the same features as for species classification (i.e. 
  <span class="bold">S</span>
  <span class="sup">687×16988</span>) but employs only the first column of the labels (i.e. if there is animal vocalization in the recording or not represented by the matrix 
  <span class="bold">Y</span>
  <span class="sup">687×1</span>). This detector can be used to derive statistics concerning activity patterns of animal vocalisations vs abiotic or anthropogenic noise sources in general. This is useful as a statistical measure of the healthiness of a habitat (which is associated to species’ vocalisation activity) and also as a means to screen out recordings that do not include animal sounds. Recordings void of any animal vocalisation are common in long-term continuous acoustical monitoring of habitats and discarding empty recordings helps to reduce the time of further processing of events as well as the storage capacity required. The test set of 1000 recordings was inspected manually and categorized into 209 recordings void of biotic sounds and 791 with at least one call per animal. The machine learning technique we used after a small set of comparisons with randomized trees and random forests was a large Gradient Boosting Classifier
