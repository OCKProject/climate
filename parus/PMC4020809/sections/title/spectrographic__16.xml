  <span class="bold">S
   <sub>3</sub>
  </span> is the most powerful one and has originally appeared in 
  <a rid="pone.0096936-Fodor1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0096936-Fodor1">[19]</a>. The key idea is to span the acoustic space of all recordings with respect to the swarm of extracted ROIs. That is, the swarm of the ROIs extracted from the training set scans the recordings and the highest normalized cross-correlation achieved from each ROI serves as a feature.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Normalized 2D Cross-correlation of ROIs is calculated as follows:

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This feature set alone surpasses all others combined. We attribute its success to the following facts:</p>
 <div list-type="alpha-lower" class="list" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Each ROI scans each spectrogram of the test set in the bandwidth limits of the ROI (enlargedÂ±4 pixels across frequency to account for variability among individuals of the same species). Frequency constrained scanning is important since many species can have similar shapes of calls and what makes them different is their exact location in frequency.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Lets take the case of a targeted call that must be detected in a highly degraded environment (say the Bush Cricket in 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096936-g001" href="#pone-0096936-g001">Fig. 1</a>). If this degradation does not take place exactly on the time-frequency patch of the targeted call (this is indeed the case of airplane noise in 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096936-g001" href="#pone-0096936-g001">Fig. 1</a>) this approach will locate this call even if the background noise is orders of magnitude higher. They will locate the target call because ROIs can move in a 2D search space while seeking similar patches and they can ignore everything else (including all sorts of interferences) since the path they search is constrained by the permissible frequency bounds of each ROI.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Spectral segments are treated as wholes and do not face the problem of frame-wise processing of audio signals as GMMs/HMMs typically do.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>The set holding all ROIs derived from the training set hold different manifestations of the same call either because it is a repetition or because it comes from another individual or is a call/song from a different distance and location. Therefore, a target call/song can be tracked even if the bird has a complex repertoire (in such case the ROIs will be from different parts of the spectrum) or its call shows variations due to distance and reflections.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since the extraction of ROIs is automatic and unsupervised spectral patches corresponding to noise will be included in the swarm of ROIs (see segments 2 and 16 in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096936-g004" href="#pone-0096936-g004">Fig. 4</a>). In fact there will be a large number of them. The way to deal with them is to apply a selection of features during building the trees of the random forest. By monitoring the out-of-bag (oob) error and rejecting these features whose replacement does not contribute to this error we discard almost the 2/3 of the total ROIs that are really valuable for classification. The reason why most of the noise ROIs are automatically discarded is that noise patches appear spuriously and therefore do not have descriptive capability. Noise types that are not spurious such as a siren or rain are pooled in the noise class that is the 0 class in our 87 class problem and discarded during recognition as the 0 class is deleted.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One should note that detection results based on a simple cross-correlation search of a template or even multiple templates on the spectrogram return poor classification results when applied to wildlife recordings. The present approach is successful because it models the way in which the total set of ROIs fits an unknown recording and therefore integrates votes coming from all available ROIs.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A strong similarity is to be observed between our work and 
  <a rid="pone.0096936-Lasseck1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0096936-Lasseck1">[20]</a>, a work developed simultaneously to but independently from ours. The difference in 
  <a rid="pone.0096936-Lasseck1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0096936-Lasseck1">[20]</a> and the proposed work is that the author presents the idea of median clipping per frequency band and time frame that removes most of the background noise. The spectrum is enhanced which results into deriving a much lower number of ROIs. Moreover he does not apply a one vs. all multi-label framework but rather isolates the ROIs that belong to each species as in 
  <a rid="pone.0096936-Fodor1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0096936-Fodor1">[19]</a>.
