 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many pre- and postcopulatory reproductive traits can be affected by both natural and sexual selection [
  <a rid="B120-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B120-biology-01-00411">120</a>]. This may include morphological, physiological, behavioral or immunological traits, which are used, for example, for mate choice or competition. There is, therefore, considerable potential for positive or negative interactions between natural and sexual selection with consequences for reproduction [
  <a rid="B121-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B121-biology-01-00411">121</a>]. Individuals might fail to produce offspring if they are unable to compete in pre- or postcopulatory sexual selection, despite possessing optimal traits for survival in a current or changing environment. In that sense, sexual selection could oppose the direction of natural selection [
  <a rid="B121-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B121-biology-01-00411">121</a>]. In contrast, as good genes models of sexual selection predict, if sexually selected traits are honestly linked with fitness, sexual selection might also reinforce natural selection [
  <a rid="B121-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B121-biology-01-00411">121</a>]. In general, it is conceivable that such effects might translate from the individual to the population level, thereby affecting population productivity and hence viability.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With regard to climate change, natural selection can advance adaptation to novel conditions and this crucially determines persistence of local populations [
  <a rid="B31-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-biology-01-00411">31</a>]. So far, factors such as genetic diversity, heritability or phenotypic plasticity have been argued to contribute to population adaptability [
  <a rid="B30-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-biology-01-00411">30</a>,
  <a rid="B31-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-biology-01-00411">31</a>,
  <a rid="B122-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B122-biology-01-00411">122</a>]. However, beyond a few experimental evolution studies investigating the interplay of natural and sexual selection [
  <a rid="B123-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B123-biology-01-00411">123</a>,
  <a rid="B124-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B124-biology-01-00411">124</a>,
  <a rid="B125-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B125-biology-01-00411">125</a>], there is a clear lack of knowledge about the role of sexual selection for adaptation in climate change research. In particular, evolutionary studies generally have not implemented variable environments, but instead employed common garden conditions. In future studies, it would be important to incorporate fluctuating and temporally changing environments to attain greater environmental reality and investigate sexual selection and adaptation in response to more realistic scenarios. Furthermore, as a next step, lab-based findings could be replicated in more natural settings, in order to verify how robust the results are, with respect to the environmental context.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on natural and sexual selection pressures, climate change may result in different evolutionary outcomes. Beside adaptation for persistence 
  <span class="italic">per se</span>, which is reviewed elsewhere, for example, in Candolin and Heuschele [
  <a rid="B121-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B121-biology-01-00411">121</a>], we will briefly discuss reproductive isolation and extinction, focusing on the potential role of sexual selection.

 <sec class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4.1. Reproductive Isolation</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Biodiversity depends on the coexistence of species, which are reproductively isolated. However, the degree of isolation varies along a continuum. In nature, therefore, species boundaries can become stronger or weaker via natural and sexual selection. In this context, climate change could have an important role. For example, climate change creates fluctuating conditions in space and time and can generate variability among individuals in a population. This might increase the potential for adaptive divergence and divergent sexual selection. Similarly, among different populations, adaptation following climate change could progress along different routes and isolation may be facilitated by sexual selection. Thereby, assortative mating and mate discrimination against incoming migrants or hybrids could act as diverging agents. In general, famous examples of fish and insect radiations suggest that sexual selection might play a role for reproductive isolation to arise [
   <a rid="B126-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B126-biology-01-00411">126</a>]. Nevertheless, there is a clear lack of targeted experiments investigating under which exact circumstances sexual selection contributes to reproductive isolation.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast, climate change may reduce the size of local populations, such that the density of individuals becomes lower than that favored by sexual selection. In particular, promiscuous species may not get access to enough mates. Presumably, species boundaries could weaken if heterotypic crosses become more frequent, for example, if isolation is mainly behavioral. Future studies could investigate this and similar hypotheses, which may provide important insights regarding impacts of climate change on mating systems and hence biodiversity.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4.2. Extinction</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over time, reproductive traits are shaped by natural and sexual selection within the environmental context in order to achieve high fitness. Theoretically, a population may reside on a peak in the fitness landscape. However, climate change can progress very rapidly, not only changing long term means, but also the frequency and strength of extreme weather events [
   <a rid="B127-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B127-biology-01-00411">127</a>]. Therefore, environmental conditions may increasingly change dramatically within a few generations. With regard to sexually selected traits, which are not only optimized in terms of the environment, but also across the sexes, this may have unexpected consequences. Tanaka [
   <a rid="B128-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B128-biology-01-00411">128</a>] formulated a model addressing this problem, which specifically investigated a system with a preference in one sex and a correlated costly ornament in the other sex in a system subjected to rapid environmental change. Results are formulated in terms of total selection load, which is the sum of all costs for maintaining the preference and the ornament. Most importantly, he shows that after the rapid change, there is a burst of selection load, because the expression of the costly ornament is not adapted. Additionally, the preference is initially mismatched and can only track the novel optimum of the ornament slowly. Ultimately, this burst of selection load may increase extinction risk.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tanakaâ€™s model [
   <a rid="B128-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B128-biology-01-00411">128</a>] has very clear implications for biodiversity research, because the investigated mechanism potentially holds true for many genetically correlated traits, which collectively contribute to the selection load in a population. In particular, traits involved in sexual conflict, which have been shown to cause very high costs in both sexes, could fatally exacerbate extinction risk.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding current species at risk, there is controversial evidence from comparative studies indicating a potential negative effect of sexual selection, for example, in birds [
   <a rid="B129-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B129-biology-01-00411">129</a>,
   <a rid="B130-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B130-biology-01-00411">130</a>,
   <a rid="B131-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B131-biology-01-00411">131</a>] but not in mammals [
   <a rid="B132-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B132-biology-01-00411">132</a>]. In contrast, lab experiments suggest that sexual selection might also act beneficially against extinction, such as by selecting against selfish genetic elements [
   <a rid="B133-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B133-biology-01-00411">133</a>] or ameliorating inbreeding depression [
   <a rid="B134-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B134-biology-01-00411">134</a>,
   <a rid="B135-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B135-biology-01-00411">135</a>]. Clearly, more research efforts are urgently needed to get a better understanding of the circumstances and precise mechanisms of sexual selection, leading to increased or decreased extinction risk.
