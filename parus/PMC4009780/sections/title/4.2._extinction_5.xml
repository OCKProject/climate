 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over time, reproductive traits are shaped by natural and sexual selection within the environmental context in order to achieve high fitness. Theoretically, a population may reside on a peak in the fitness landscape. However, climate change can progress very rapidly, not only changing long term means, but also the frequency and strength of extreme weather events [
  <a rid="B127-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B127-biology-01-00411">127</a>]. Therefore, environmental conditions may increasingly change dramatically within a few generations. With regard to sexually selected traits, which are not only optimized in terms of the environment, but also across the sexes, this may have unexpected consequences. Tanaka [
  <a rid="B128-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B128-biology-01-00411">128</a>] formulated a model addressing this problem, which specifically investigated a system with a preference in one sex and a correlated costly ornament in the other sex in a system subjected to rapid environmental change. Results are formulated in terms of total selection load, which is the sum of all costs for maintaining the preference and the ornament. Most importantly, he shows that after the rapid change, there is a burst of selection load, because the expression of the costly ornament is not adapted. Additionally, the preference is initially mismatched and can only track the novel optimum of the ornament slowly. Ultimately, this burst of selection load may increase extinction risk.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tanakaâ€™s model [
  <a rid="B128-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B128-biology-01-00411">128</a>] has very clear implications for biodiversity research, because the investigated mechanism potentially holds true for many genetically correlated traits, which collectively contribute to the selection load in a population. In particular, traits involved in sexual conflict, which have been shown to cause very high costs in both sexes, could fatally exacerbate extinction risk.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding current species at risk, there is controversial evidence from comparative studies indicating a potential negative effect of sexual selection, for example, in birds [

  <a rid="B131-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B131-biology-01-00411">131</a>] but not in mammals [
  <a rid="B132-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B132-biology-01-00411">132</a>]. In contrast, lab experiments suggest that sexual selection might also act beneficially against extinction, such as by selecting against selfish genetic elements [
  <a rid="B133-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B133-biology-01-00411">133</a>] or ameliorating inbreeding depression [
  <a rid="B134-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B134-biology-01-00411">134</a>,
  <a rid="B135-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B135-biology-01-00411">135</a>]. Clearly, more research efforts are urgently needed to get a better understanding of the circumstances and precise mechanisms of sexual selection, leading to increased or decreased extinction risk.
