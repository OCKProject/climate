 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reproduction involves multiple traits, which may be measured to infer fitness of an individual. The most widely used fitness measure is probably fecundity, which is the number of eggs an individual produces. However, depending on the organism, fecundity is usually assessed in different ways. Specifically, animal studies have used, for example, total number of eggs, total number of clutches, number of clutches per breeding season (e.g., voltinism) or single clutch size (see examples in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="biology-01-00411-t002" href="#biology-01-00411-t002">Table 2</a>). Therefore, comparing fecundity among species and among studies is often difficult. Furthermore, fecundity in terms of eggs and brood sizes etc. potentially depends to a very large part on the female. In particular, a female’s available energy and general effects due to body size pose large constraints for fecundity. Without correcting for these effects, comparisons among individuals might be biased. Furthermore, different individuals may pursue different life-history strategies, such as via a trade-off between number and size of eggs [

  <a rid="B115-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B115-biology-01-00411">115</a>] and the outcome of this manipulation could be different for each male-female combination [
  <a rid="B116-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B116-biology-01-00411">116</a>,
  <a rid="B117-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B117-biology-01-00411">117</a>]. Therefore, in particular with promiscuous organisms, it might not be sufficient to only measure fecundity at a single time point and under (often unnatural) monogamous conditions.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because of these caveats and with regard to climate change research, it might be necessary to take a step away from individual fitness towards measuring population fitness. Alternatively, if focusing on the individual level, future studies should account for multiple traits that contribute to total reproduction, such as development time, egg hatching success, fertility, (re-)mating success or survival. Ideally, the use of a single fitness measure, which incorporates multiple traits, would allow improved comparisons across different studies and species. For this purpose, we propose using a single currency such as lifetime reproductive success, because it includes information about fecundity and survival of the mother and development and survival of the offspring. Ultimately, lifetime reproductive success could be used to estimate population growth, which is a key factor determining population resilience, for example, in population viability analysis [
  <a rid="B118-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B118-biology-01-00411">118</a>,
  <a rid="B119-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B119-biology-01-00411">119</a>]. In combination with estimates regarding population sizes, it might be possible to improve predictions of climate change impacts [
  <a rid="B119-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B119-biology-01-00411">119</a>]. Lab and manipulated field experiments could thereby provide standardized information concerning how lifetime reproductive success, and hence population growth, are affected by environmental change. How future studies could approach this experimentally is discussed in more detail in section 5.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Depending on the organism, however, it may simply not be possible to assess lifetime reproductive success. In this case, it may be crucial to measure a suite of reproductive traits and longevity if possible. Multiple measurements of reproductive success over time to estimate reproductive rate, in combination with information about average life span, could allow inferences concerning population growth. </p>
