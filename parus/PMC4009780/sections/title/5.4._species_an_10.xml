 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although single species studies are valuable, they do not capture the full picture, as interactions between species, such as competition, can affect evolutionary responses to changing environments [

  <a rid="B174-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B174-biology-01-00411">174</a>]. Thereby, it will be necessary to apply the method to non-model organisms and to investigate interacting and co-evolving pairs and groups of species. For studies on host-parasite co-evolution experimental evolution is already in use [

As the classic experimental evolution approach is restricted to organisms reproducing in a confined setting with short generation times, organisms such as arthropods, which fulfill these prerequisites, should be utilized much more widely. With regard to the enormous species richness and abundance, more different insects could be investigated, in particular, as they are expected to respond in disparate ways to climate change [
  <a rid="B8-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-biology-01-00411">8</a>]. In the future, however, experimental evolution should also be considered in novel areas, such as invasion biology (
  <span class="italic">i.e.</span> resident and incoming species interact in a disturbed environment). For example, by taking experimental evolution outdoors, this approach could be applied to many more organisms. In particular, many species, which are threatened by climate change, might be difficult to breed under lab conditions. Nevertheless, experimental evolution could be developed further in order to incorporate such organisms, which are more challenging to study in the lab. Depending on the organisms of interest, experimental evolution could be performed in multiple closed or open greenhouses, aviaries, cages, artificial or natural ponds 
  <span class="italic">et cetera</span>.
