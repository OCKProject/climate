  <a rid="B1-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-biology-01-00411">1</a>]. Many reviews on climate change have thus summarized the wide-ranging biological changes that can be observed in nature [

  <a rid="B9-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-biology-01-00411">9</a>]. For example, it is clear that global warming has begun to affect many species, changing fundamental characteristics, such as body size [

  <a rid="B11-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-biology-01-00411">11</a>,

The multiple consequences of climate change are still under intense scrutiny, especially as models estimating global biodiversity gains and losses could still be improved. Potential climate change impacts are being modeled with increasing realism as species distribution prediction techniques become more sophisticated [
  <a rid="B16-biology-01-00411" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-biology-01-00411">16</a>]. However, in order to achieve greater accuracy, such models will increasingly require high quality and biologically relevant input data. Compared to the rapid advances in climate change ecology and environmental sciences, which provide abiotic information about climate change, evolutionary biology, which could provide some of the necessary biotic information in this particular context, seems to be lagging behind. Therefore, we advocate for coordinated advances across both fields. On this note, after briefly reviewing some aspects of current evolutionary research on environmental change and identifying certain caveats, we will outline promising experimental avenues for future efforts.
