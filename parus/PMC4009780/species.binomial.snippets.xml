Similarly, studies with multicellular organisms such as " exact="Drosophila melanogaster" xpath="/html[1]/body[1]/div[2]/div[5]/div[6]/p[1]" match="Drosophila melanogaster" post=" make use of iso-female lines ( i.e. founded with one female) to simulate clonal lines [ &lt;a " name="binomial"/>

Using this idea, it has been shown that allopatric populations of the fly " exact="Sepsis cynipsea" xpath="/html[1]/body[1]/div[2]/div[5]/div[6]/p[1]" match="Sepsis cynipsea" post=" have a larger potential to diverge reproductively if the populations were of high density rather t" name="binomial"/>
