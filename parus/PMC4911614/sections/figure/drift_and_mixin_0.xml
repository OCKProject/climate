Colours refer to the receiving populations (DDU, Pointe Géologie near Dumont D'Urville station; HAL, Halley Bay; MZW, Mertz West; MZE, Mertz East; NEU, Neumayer; WSH, Cape Washington). Dashed circle: Antarctic polar circle (S66°33'). (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) Neighbour-net based on pairwise identity-by-state between all sampled individuals. Branch lengths represent pairwise Hamming distances. Colours correspond to colonies on map
