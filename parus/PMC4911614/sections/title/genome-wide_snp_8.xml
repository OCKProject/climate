  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">24</a>. Genomic DNA was checked for degradation on a 1.5% agarose gel, and only samples with consistently high molecular weight were retained and quantified by fluorometry (Life technologies Qubit). A total of 110 samples were retained and sequenced in 5 distinct libraries. (i) ∼150 ng of genomic DNA per sample were digested with the restriction enzyme 
  <span class="italic">Sbf</span>-I-HF (NEB); (ii) each sample was then ligated to a unique barcoded P1 adapter before pooling in a single library. The library was then sheared by sonication (7 cycles of 30 s ON—30 s OFF); (iii) sonicated libraries were concentrated to 25 μl by DNA capture on magnetic beads (beads solution/DNA=0.8:1), thus further reducing the carry-over of non-ligated P1 adapters, and the target size range fraction (350–650 bp) was then selected by automated gel electrophoresis (BluePippin); (iv) capture on magnetic beads using the same beads/DNA ratio (0.8:1) was then employed in all following purification steps (after blunt-end repairing, poly-A tailing, P2 adapter ligation and library enrichment by PCR). Magnetic beads were kept together with the library throughout the pre-PCR steps, and DNA was re-bound to the beads for purification using a PEG-8000-binding solution; (v) PCR amplification was performed in 8 × 12.5 μl aliquots pooled after the amplification in order to reduce amplification bias on few loci because of random drift. PCR was performed using NEB Phusion polymerase with the following cycles: 30 s denaturation at 98 °C, 18 cycles of amplification (10 min at 98 °C, 30 s at 65 °C and 30 s at 72 °C), and a final elongation of 5 min at 72 °C; (vi) the library was then quantified by a fluorimetry-based method (Life technologies Qubit), and molarity was checked on an Agilent Bioanalyzer chip (Invitrogen). A final volume of 20 μl for each library was submitted for paired-end sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer (V3 chemistry, libraries 1–3) or HiSeq2500 (V4 chemistry, libraries 4–5), at the Norwegian Sequencing Centre, University of Oslo, spiked with 20% PhiX control library in order to reduce low-diversity bias.
