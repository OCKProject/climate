Two colonies were sampled in the Weddell Sea area, across the continent: Atka Bay colony, near Neumayer research station (‘NEU'), ∼6,500 km away from Adélie Land, and Halley Bay colony (‘HAL'), ∼700 km further. Finally, one colony was sampled from the Ross Sea area (Cape Washington, ‘WSH'), ∼1,700 km from Adélie Land and ∼8,000 km from HAL.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" href="#b27">27</a>, the Emperor penguin exhibits a remarkable degree of genetic homogeneity at the continent scale. Pairwise fixation index (

   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table 1</a>), and only ∼0.5% of total variance is explained by colony structure (as per analysis of molecular variance, or AMOVA). High genetic mixing is supported by all classical descriptors of genetic variation as estimated on our consensus SNP set. Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium holds across 466 out of 590 scaffolds with all colonies assessed together (out-of-equilibrium scaffolds all have less than 5 SNPs). The mean homozygosity across all individuals is low (F=0.051±0.094) and does not exhibit any inter-colony difference. The nucleotide diversity is low and highly similar across all colonies (

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1b</a>). Overall, the variance explained by geographical structure is extremely low. The first principal component analysis (PCA) component of variance (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</a>) shows a weak general pattern of isolation-by-distance along the coast. Mertz colonies stand on the one end, Pointe Géologie in the centre, and Atka Bay and HAL at the other end, yet Ross sea samples do not stand out, as would be expected in case of strong isolation-by-distance. However, this pattern remains extremely marginal: the variance explained by the first component barely amounts to 1.4% of the total variance, and colonies cannot be distinguished on the basis of PCA. Inference of population split topology based on allele frequency variation among populations also supports this view: neutral genetic differentiation from the ancestral population increases eastward from WSH to MZE, but with numerous migration events inferred between most colonies (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</a>). Finally, in clustering analyses performed either on called genotypes or on genotype likelihoods, the preferred model consistently had 
   <span class="italic">k</span>=1, that is, no inferred clusters in the data. The very limited genetic drift observed between colonies separated by several thousands of kilometres suggests intense gene flow in this flightless seabird along the coast of Antarctica.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Long-term demographic reconstruction</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The existence of a common, homogeneous gene pool for the entire species also implies that all present-day colonies share a common demographic history. To test this, we reconstructed past Emperor penguin population size changes in BEAST2 (ref. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">30</a>) under an extended Bayesian skyline plot model. In accordance with our expectation, reconstructions based either on a single colony or on haplotypes sampled randomly from the whole continent converge to the same estimate of effective population size and to the same demographic history (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2a</a>). All reconstructions show a moderate increase in population size over the past 100,000 years (with some uncertainty as to the precise dating of the beginning of the expansion, because of the difficulty of precisely calibrating mutation rates in a multilocus approach), regardless of the very different present-day colony sizes (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2b</a>). This trend is in accordance with the findings of Li 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" href="#b31">31</a> based on a single-genome pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent approach. Emperor penguin population size does not appear to have been affected by the last glacial period. This is in stark contrast with the sudden post-glacial population expansion of the Emperor's sister species, the King penguin 
   <span class="italic">A. patagonicus</span> from the sub-Antarctic region
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">32</a>, a difference probably explained by the contrasting breeding habitats and strategies of the two species, the King penguin being dependent on year-round ice-free breeding sites. The inferred long-term demographic stability also excludes past genetic fragmentation, which is known to reduce effective population size
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" href="#b33">33</a>. Thus, overall, the agreement of coalescent histories at both local and global sampling scales supports the idea that all extant colonies share the same genetic pool, and that the effects of neutral genetic drift between distant areas are durably counterbalanced by the intensity of gene flow.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Importance of continent-wide dispersal</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To quantitatively assess the importance of continental dispersal, we modelled the inter-colony migration rates required to generate such a level of genetic admixture. We first co-estimated effective population size and bidirectional migration rates between a subset of four colonies representing our whole sampling area by simulating genetic data under a continuous-time Markovian coalescent model against the observed two-dimensional allele frequency spectra, using a composite-likelihood approach
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">34</a>. Analysis was calibrated using a RADome mutation rate as estimated for the King penguin
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">32</a> and a generation time of 16 years
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">15</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" href="#b16">16</a>. Effective population sizes all converge to an average of ∼4,000 (from 1,120 to 7,640) breeding individuals (detailed estimates in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table 2</a> and 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1a</a>), in keeping with the observed median size of extant colonies
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" href="#b35">35</a>. Each colony is estimated to receive, on average, between 0.7% and ∼4.2% of its effective population size in migrants every generation. Thus, if we were to scale these results to present-day observed census size, a colony such as Pointe Géologie (DDU), with a count of ∼7,000 breeding adults, would exchange, on average, between ∼260 and ∼300 migrants (3.8–4.2%) per generation with the rest of the continent. Remarkably, strongly asymmetric gene flow pattern is inferred between DDU and MZE (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1a</a>), with nearly all dispersal occurring towards MZE. It is relevant that the DDU colony has indeed gone through a strong population reduction in the recent past, and environment-induced adult mortality was suggested to be the main cause
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" href="#b13">13</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">15</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" href="#b36">36</a>. However, our results point towards a very central role of dispersal, as direct human disturbance (for example, effect of flipper-banding
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" href="#b37">37</a>) on the DDU colony may have led to vastly increased emigration flow from DDU to MZE. We further validated these results using a haplotype-based multilocus Bayesian approach as implemented in Migrate-n
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">38</a>. Model ranking using Bayes factor model choice gives clear support for a full-migration model with very high gene flow. Estimated migration rates (

Although slightly higher, this estimate is of the same order of magnitude as the one derived from the joint allele frequency spectra.
