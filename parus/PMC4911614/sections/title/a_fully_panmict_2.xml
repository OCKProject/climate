  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" href="#b27">27</a>, the Emperor penguin exhibits a remarkable degree of genetic homogeneity at the continent scale. Pairwise fixation index (
  <span class="italic">Fst</span>) values, calculated either as a function of allele frequency covariance between populations over variable sites, or from called genotypes using Reich's estimator
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" href="#b28">28</a>, are very low (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table 1</a>), and only ∼0.5% of total variance is explained by colony structure (as per analysis of molecular variance, or AMOVA). High genetic mixing is supported by all classical descriptors of genetic variation as estimated on our consensus SNP set. Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium holds across 466 out of 590 scaffolds with all colonies assessed together (out-of-equilibrium scaffolds all have less than 5 SNPs). The mean homozygosity across all individuals is low (F=0.051±0.094) and does not exhibit any inter-colony difference. The nucleotide diversity is low and highly similar across all colonies (

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1b</a>). Overall, the variance explained by geographical structure is extremely low. The first principal component analysis (PCA) component of variance (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</a>) shows a weak general pattern of isolation-by-distance along the coast. Mertz colonies stand on the one end, Pointe Géologie in the centre, and Atka Bay and HAL at the other end, yet Ross sea samples do not stand out, as would be expected in case of strong isolation-by-distance. However, this pattern remains extremely marginal: the variance explained by the first component barely amounts to 1.4% of the total variance, and colonies cannot be distinguished on the basis of PCA. Inference of population split topology based on allele frequency variation among populations also supports this view: neutral genetic differentiation from the ancestral population increases eastward from WSH to MZE, but with numerous migration events inferred between most colonies (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</a>). Finally, in clustering analyses performed either on called genotypes or on genotype likelihoods, the preferred model consistently had 
  <span class="italic">k</span>=1, that is, no inferred clusters in the data. The very limited genetic drift observed between colonies separated by several thousands of kilometres suggests intense gene flow in this flightless seabird along the coast of Antarctica.
