  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1a</a>). To assess both fine- and large-scale processes, we sampled three colonies in a tight cluster around Adélie Land, in Eastern Antarctica: Eastern and Western Mertz colonies
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" href="#b20">20</a> (‘MZE' and ‘MZW'), as well as the Pointe Géologie colony, near Dumont d'Urville research station (‘DDU'), all three within ∼300 km. Two colonies were sampled in the Weddell Sea area, across the continent: Atka Bay colony, near Neumayer research station (‘NEU'), ∼6,500 km away from Adélie Land, and Halley Bay colony (‘HAL'), ∼700 km further. Finally, one colony was sampled from the Ross Sea area (Cape Washington, ‘WSH'), ∼1,700 km from Adélie Land and ∼8,000 km from HAL.
