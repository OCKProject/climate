 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each HiSeq sequencing lane yielded an ∼201,000,000 paired-end reads (±16,000) with a mean Phred score of 37, only part of which was dedicated to that project. After barcode demultiplexing and quality filtering, we retained an average 147,000,000 read pairs per library (±13,000,000). Concordant alignment rate was high (70.7±9.1%). However, after filtering, a large proportion of the reads was identified as duplicates and removed from further analysis. On average, 479,000 read pairs were retained per individual. We built an average 78,000 loci per individual (±17,000). Overlap between SNP calling methods was high: 111,686 SNPs were called by GATK (173,704 SNPs total), ANGSD (203,801 SNPs total) and Stacks (148,721 SNPs total;

After filtering by coverage (minimum 3 ×) and missing data (minimum 75% representation), 59,037 highly confident SNPs (hereafter our ‘consensus SNP set', as opposed to the ‘full data set', which includes all sequencing data that passed our quality checks and aligned successfully to autosomal or pseudo-autosomal scaffolds) were retained for analysis, with a mean depth of 6.8 × . Of these, 582, spread across 15 scaffolds, were identified as unambiguously belonging to the non-recombining region of the Z chromosome.
