 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An independent estimate of population size changes through time was performed in BEAST2 (ref. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">30</a>). We proceeded as above for locus selection and haplotype down-sampling. To remain agnostic as to population structure, we performed analysis on each colony separately, as well as on the whole data set, as the lack of strong population structure, evidenced by all other analyses, allowed us to sample haplotypes from the whole species without violating the model's assumptions. We used an extended bayesian skyline plot model
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b64" href="#b64">64</a> in order to co-estimate present-day 
  <span class="italic">Î˜</span> and possible past fluctuations. We followed the protocol of Trucchi and colleagues
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">32</a>, but reduced the parameter space by defining only one site-model per locus class (five or six SNPs), using HKY models with empirical base frequencies, and allowing for rate variation in four discrete gamma categories. Kappa was linked across site models, according to our expectation for neutral variation, in order to alleviate computational load. All chains were run in duplicate to check for convergence and for a sufficient length to gather effective sample sizes (ESS)&gt;200 for all parameters, which necessitated ca 1,000,000,000 steps on all models. We used the same estimates for mutation rate and generation time as in Migrate-n analyses. Reconstruction for WSH colony is much less precise because of the very small number of haplotypes (
  <span class="italic">N</span>=4) sampled per locus. However, present-day population size estimate converges with reconstructions based on the other colonies.
