 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Material was collected from six locations of East Antarctica, between 2004 and 2012: Cape Washington in the Ross Sea area (‘WSH'), Pointe Géologie (‘DDU') in Adélie Land, ‘MZE' and ‘MZW' in George V Land, Atka Bay (‘NEU') in Dronning Maud Land area and ‘HAL' in the Weddell Sea area. All procedures employed during field work were approved by national Ethical Committees, and authorizations to enter the breeding site and to collect samples from living or dead birds were delivered by the US Antarctic Conservation Act (permit no 2004-010), the French ‘Ministère de l'Enseignement Supérieur et de la Recherche' and the ‘Terres Australes et Antarctiques Françaises' (permit nos 2012-126, 2012-111 and 2012-117), the German Environmental Agency (Umweltbundesamt, permit no I 3.5–94003-3/295) and the British Antarctic Survey/University of Cambridge Animal Ethics Review Committee. On the DDU colony, blood samples were collected from 23 chicks before fledging. In WSH, MZE, MZW, NEU and HAL, muscle samples were collected from frozen chick carcasses collected around the colony (WSH:
