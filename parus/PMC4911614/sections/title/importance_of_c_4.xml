 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To quantitatively assess the importance of continental dispersal, we modelled the inter-colony migration rates required to generate such a level of genetic admixture. We first co-estimated effective population size and bidirectional migration rates between a subset of four colonies representing our whole sampling area by simulating genetic data under a continuous-time Markovian coalescent model against the observed two-dimensional allele frequency spectra, using a composite-likelihood approach
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">34</a>. Analysis was calibrated using a RADome mutation rate as estimated for the King penguin
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">32</a> and a generation time of 16 years
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">15</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" href="#b16">16</a>. Effective population sizes all converge to an average of ∼4,000 (from 1,120 to 7,640) breeding individuals (detailed estimates in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table 2</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1a</a>), in keeping with the observed median size of extant colonies
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" href="#b35">35</a>. Each colony is estimated to receive, on average, between 0.7% and ∼4.2% of its effective population size in migrants every generation. Thus, if we were to scale these results to present-day observed census size, a colony such as Pointe Géologie (DDU), with a count of ∼7,000 breeding adults, would exchange, on average, between ∼260 and ∼300 migrants (3.8–4.2%) per generation with the rest of the continent. Remarkably, strongly asymmetric gene flow pattern is inferred between DDU and MZE (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1a</a>), with nearly all dispersal occurring towards MZE. It is relevant that the DDU colony has indeed gone through a strong population reduction in the recent past, and environment-induced adult mortality was suggested to be the main cause

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">15</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" href="#b36">36</a>. However, our results point towards a very central role of dispersal, as direct human disturbance (for example, effect of flipper-banding
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" href="#b37">37</a>) on the DDU colony may have led to vastly increased emigration flow from DDU to MZE. We further validated these results using a haplotype-based multilocus Bayesian approach as implemented in Migrate-n
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">38</a>. Model ranking using Bayes factor model choice gives clear support for a full-migration model with very high gene flow. Estimated migration rates (

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">32</a>, we can estimate that each colony receives, on average, from 5.40% (±0.22) to 10.00% (±0.42) of its total effective size as migrants from other colonies at each generation. Although slightly higher, this estimate is of the same order of magnitude as the one derived from the joint allele frequency spectra.
