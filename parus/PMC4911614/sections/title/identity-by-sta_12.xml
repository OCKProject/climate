  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b58" href="#b58">58</a>) based on the consensus SNP set. Allelic distance for pairs of individuals is rather sensitive to uneven coverage (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</a>, lower triangle), with lower-depth individuals appearing more similar to all other individuals than higher-depth ones. However, IBD inference, which takes into account the total genetic variance in the whole sample, appears more robust to coverage variation (

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</a>), appear markedly more related to each other than to the rest of the sample. Of these two clusters, only one individual was retained for inbreeding-sensitive analyses, such as PCA. Pairwise IBS (Hamming) distances were used to generate a neighbour-net using SplitsTree
