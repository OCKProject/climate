 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Clustering analyses were performed both on called genotypes, using fastStructure
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b62" href="#b62">62</a>, and on genotype likelihoods, using ngsAdmix
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b63" href="#b63">63</a> and a stricter filtering was applied: as input in fastStructure we selected unlinked 6,825 SNPs with a maximum amount of missing data of 10%. In ngsAdmix, we filtered the data set to 3,020 high-confidence sites on the basis of probability of being variable, coverage and phred score. We tested a number of components ranging from 1 to 10, with three independent replicates. For fastStructure, we used a simple prior for 
  <span class="italic">K</span> values ranging from 1 to 10, and a logistic prior for values from 1 to 3. Most likely number of components was chosen using fastStructure's chooseK.py script for fastStructure models and Evanno's Î”
  <span class="italic">K</span> method for ngsAdmix models.
