 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is important to note that the estimates we present here reflect the migration parameters averaged over many generations, and not the instantaneous dispersal rate (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Note 1</a> for details). Therefore, neither population sizes nor migration rates should be interpreted as referring literally to the immediate state of extant colonies but rather to the average coalescence-based population size and migration rate over time. Dispersal itself is not necessarily a stationary process: it may be very heterogeneous in space and time (as was shown, for example, in the Little penguin 
  <span class="italic">Eudyptula minor</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" href="#b39">39</a>), while individual colonies may show positive or negative dispersal balance according to the current local habitat conditions and modifications.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It appears from our results that Emperor penguin colonies are largely open systems, in which demographic coupling with other colonies through dispersal is a fundamental mechanism. Recent observations suggest that this view may be extended to other seabird species
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" href="#b26">26</a>. For example, we have repeatedly resighted micro-tagged King penguins born on one colony in the Crozet Archipelago, at different colonies in the same archipelago, and at colonies in the Kerguelen Archipelago, 1,500 km away (Le Bohec, personel communication, 2016). As pointed out by Mayr
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" href="#b40">40</a>, ‘
  <span class="italic">a high dispersal ability is a necessity for occupants of temporary habitats'</span>. This necessity appears to be twofold. First, from a mechanistic point of view, habitat instability can force dispersal. Indeed, dispersal has been the immediate response for colonies facing habitat disturbance in the recent past
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">18</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">19</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">21</a>, and it can play an important role by adding flexibility to an otherwise rigid philopatric system, and allowing species to dynamically exploit the best breeding locations in rapidly changing polar environments. Second, high dispersal rates are expected to impose a high 
  <span class="italic">migration load</span> on natural selection, and to counteract the effects of local adaptations
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" href="#b41">41</a>, thus allowing the species to preserve a gene pool that is adapted to a wider range of possible environmental conditions: it may thus itself be adaptive in highly unstable habitats. Yet, a direct consequence is that colony-level demographic events are of local rather than global significance. Population trends extracted from a single colony reflect the immediate quality of the focal location on a generation scale, rather than species-wide parameters (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2c</a>). In this context, the colony is not a truly relevant demographic unit, but rather a transient aggregation of individuals at a particular point of time. To distinguish this structure from panmictic and metapopulation systems, we propose the term 
  <span class="italic">synnome</span> for this combination of an exceptionally fragmented space and a very fluid gene pool (see full definition in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Note 1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although exceptional if compared with current knowledge about other marine predators, such as turtles
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">25</a>, marine mammals
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" href="#b27">27</a> and most seabird species
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" href="#b26">26</a>, intense dispersal is expected to be a common evolutionary strategy in unstable high-latitude environments
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" href="#b26">26</a>, especially under ongoing climate warming. Importantly, most of the evidence accumulated up to now in seabirds has relied heavily on mitochondrial DNA
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" href="#b26">26</a> (see also 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Note 2</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</a> for details), which is known to provide biased evidence due to its faster coalescence rate and non-recombining character
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b42" href="#b42">42</a>. SNP data can also provide evidence of more intense gene flow than mitochondrial DNA (as has been shown, for example, in the Black-footed albatross 
  <span class="italic">Phœbastria nigripes</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" href="#b43">43</a>). Therefore, several species that are currently treated as fragmented metapopulation systems, may in fact appear to be closer to the Emperor penguin's 
  <span class="italic">synnome</span> structure once genome-wide data will be available.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our findings highlight the importance of adopting a cross-disciplinary approach, integrating population genomics and behavioural ecology, to the study of population dynamics. Such an approach accounts for the temporally and spatially complex ecological processes that shape the structure of worldwide populations, and should help in the development of more robust and accurate demographic projections at the whole species level. These refined projections will then be more likely to allow estimation of the extent of threats to vulnerable species and identifying the proximal causes of their decline. As a single genetic population, Emperor penguins will respond to climate change through a unified evolutionary trajectory. This insight thus presents new challenges to our understanding of how current climate scenarios will impact upon the future of the most cold-adapted species in the world, an iconic bio-indicator of the delicate Antarctic ecosystem.</p>
