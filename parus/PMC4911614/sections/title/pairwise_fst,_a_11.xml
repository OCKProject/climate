 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pairwise fixation index was estimated by two independent methods. We calculated Reich's estimator
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" href="#b28">28</a> on called genotypes of our consensus SNP set, using custom R scripts. Without calling genotypes, we calculated Reynolds' estimator
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b53" href="#b53">53</a> on the full data set, taking into account uncertainty in site-allele-frequency, according to the method implemented in ngsTools
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b50" href="#b50">50</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b54" href="#b54">54</a>. Both methods were performed on a per-site basis and averaged over 1-kb non-overlapping sliding windows, as the ratio of the windowed sum of inter-population variance over the windowed sum of total variance. For the genotype-call-free method, only sites with a probability of being variant at least equal to 0.95 were included in the estimation. Mean homozygosity, nucleotide diversity and Tajima's 
  <span class="italic">D</span> were calculated on a per-locus basis, using the consensus SNP set. To avoid possible biases due to low coverage in estimating nucleotide diversity and Tajima's 
  <span class="italic">D</span>, we randomly sampled one haplotype for each individual, and performed calculations on this haploid subset. Calculations were made using

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b56" href="#b56">56</a> packages, as well as custom R scripts. To quantify the proportion of variation at each organization level, AMOVA was performed on a 22,875 unlinked SNP data using Arlequin
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b57" href="#b57">57</a>, on a per-locus basis, with 1,000 permutations.
