 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PCA was performed on called genotypes in the consensus SNP set using R library 
  <span class="italic">adegenet</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b55" href="#b55">55</a>, and on genotype likelihoods for the full data set using ngsCovar
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b54" href="#b54">54</a>. Analysis was performed either on all samples or keeping only one individual for each highly related cluster. When performed on all samples, analysis was mostly driven by the HAL relatedness cluster, with the first principal component of variance (PC) accounting for 2.84% of total variance. Interestingly, these outliers are also identified as a separate group in admixture analyses (see below), with high repeatability, although with only a slight gain in model fit compared with a single-population model (Evanno's Î”
  <span class="italic">K</span> over 10 replicates). However, discriminant analysis of principal components
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b60" href="#b60">60</a> performed in 
  <span class="italic">adegenet</span> on the consensus SNP set, and contrasting these outliers and the main sample group, showed that single-locus contributions were very low and evenly spread across the genome, thus excluding any strong directional selective phenomenon. After removal of all samples but one in each high-relatedness cluster, variation did not appear to be driven by outliers anymore.
