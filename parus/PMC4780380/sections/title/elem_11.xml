 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adaptive divergence across populations has long been considered conditional on a) antagonistic selection across habitats and b) a physical isolation between divergent populations, thereby restricting gene flow (Wright 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0140" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0140">1943</a>; Maynard Smith 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0087" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0087">1966</a>). Both theoretical (e.g. Garcia‐Ramos and Kirkpatrick 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0051">1997</a>) and empirical evidence (e.g. Hendry et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0063">2002</a>) supported this view for almost half a century. Our overall understanding of adaptive divergence today includes much more complexity. For instance, it is now recognized i) that restricted gene flow can either be a cause or a consequence of adaptive diversification (Räsänen and Hendry 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0108" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0108">2008</a>), ii) that in some instances, gene flow can induce rather than constrain phenotypic divergence (Guillaume 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0058">2011</a>) and iii) that local adaptation can occur at a very fine spatial scale despite gene flow (see e.g. Muir et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0096" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0096">2014</a>; Langin et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0080">2015</a>; Moody et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0094" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0094">2015</a>). In a recent review, Richardson et al. (
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0113" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0113">2014</a>) discuss a set of mechanisms that can initiate divergence or reinforce it even in the presence of gene flow. Here we review evidence in our system for three of these nonexclusive mechanisms: habitat selection, selective barriers against migrants and positive assortative mating.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Habitat selection</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are several lines of evidence suggesting that a process of matching habitat choice (Edelaar et al. 
   <a rid="eva12282-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0045">2008</a>) could cause directed gene flow between forest habitat types. The fact that birds from E‐Pirio are smaller and lighter than birds from D‐Muro allowed Blondel and colleagues (fig. 2 in Blondel et al. 
   <a rid="eva12282-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0012">1999</a>) to provide the first evidence for nonrandom gene flow as immigrants showed more similar morphometrics compared to resident birds than expected by chance, suggesting that birds born in deciduous habitats would prefer to breed in deciduous habitats, and 
   <span class="italic">vice versa</span> for birds from evergreen habitats. Later on, a study of feather isotopic signatures in the main study sites presented in Box 
   <a rid="eva12282-fea-0002" ref-type="boxed-text" href="#eva12282-fea-0002">2</a> partly confirmed such habitat choice, while also revealing in each area a set of immigrant birds with outlier isotopic signatures, presumably originating from oak void habitats (Charmantier et al. 
   <a rid="eva12282-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0029">2014</a>). Further investigations are underway to refine the definition of isoscapes within and around our study populations, in the aim of identifying the landscape origin of each immigrant bird (C. de Franceschi, work in progress). This would allow testing for a matching habitat choice process, for example to test the prediction that blue tits with fast exploratory behaviour preferentially disperse to deciduous forest patches while ‘slow’ birds prefer to breed in evergreen patches.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Selective barriers against migrants</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Richardson et al. (
   <a rid="eva12282-bib-0113" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0113">2014</a>) describe this mechanism as reduced fitness for migrants, acting before they reproduce through premating isolation. The habitat‐specific breeding phenology could well work as a reinforcing barrier against maladapted dispersal if laying date is culturally or genetically inherited. Indeed, if two populations are breeding at different spring periods, they will obviously not mate with each other, which in turn will strengthen the reproductive barrier that may have arisen for other independent reasons. Anecdotic cases of birds born in deciduous habitats but breeding in evergreen ones support this view, as these birds initiated reproduction too early compared to the caterpillar abundance (Charmantier, pers. comm.), and vice versa for the reverse situation. Apart from this phenological mismatch between habitat types, it has also been suggested that differences in social dominance of birds originating from deciduous or evergreen habitats could contribute to restricting dispersal and maintaining population phenotypic differentiation at a micro‐geographic scale (Braillet et al. 
   <a rid="eva12282-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0017">2002</a>). Indeed, the larger size of male blue tits from D‐Muro (and possibly stronger colorations) provides them with a systematic dominance over the smaller males of E‐Pirio, thereby creating a potential barrier for the settlement of evergreen birds in deciduous areas. Finally, the dialects and differences in avian songs detailed previously could also contribute in driving population divergence, such as what has been shown in species where females prefer to mate with the males possessing the local versus a foreign dialect (e.g. Podos 
   <a rid="eva12282-bib-0103" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0103">2010</a>). Hence, the existence of dialects in Corsica could contribute to explain the reduced gene flow between valleys, previously highlighted as part of an insular syndrome (Blondel et al. 
   <a rid="eva12282-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0012">1999</a>). In the future, we aim at testing this crucial hypothesis using both mate choice experiments and playbacks.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Positive assortative mating</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After they settle in a new habitat, maladapted immigrants can still have a restricted contribution to the local gene pool because of sexual selection processes (Richardson et al. 
   <a rid="eva12282-bib-0113" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0113">2014</a>). In particular, positive assortative mating may discriminate against rare phenotypes. In Corsica, we found support for a positive assortative mating in handling aggression scores (estimated correlation between male and female handling aggression: 0.156, 95% CI = [0.054, 0.260]; Fig. 
   <a rid="eva12282-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12282-fig-0003">3</a>) and for exploratory speed in the openfield for young females of 1 and 2 years (estimated correlation: 0.280, 95% CI = [0.073, 0.473], 
   <span class="italic">n </span>= 41 females, 38 males; 2011–2014). Similar assortative mating for personality has been identified in several bird species, including great tits (Groothuis and Carere 
   <a rid="eva12282-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0056">2005</a>) and zebra finches 
   <span class="italic">Taeniopygia guttata</span> (Schuett et al. 
   <a rid="eva12282-bib-0120" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0120">2011</a>). Assortative mating for UV–blue and yellow coloration is also around 30%, while varying across years (A. Fargevieille unpublished data). Such assortative mating also suggests a potential role of sexual selection in the observed phenotypic differentiation, which needs further exploration in future work.
