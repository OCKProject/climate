 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Blue tit song also shows marked divergence between populations (Table

  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0040">2001</a>). The average repertoire size (number of song types produced by one male in one morning) varies among Corsican sites and is larger in these sites than in the D‐Rouviere mainland population (Doutrelant et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0038">2000a</a>). In addition, across northern Europe, blue tit song is characterized by the presence of a rapid trill (a fast series of identical notes repeated at the end of song, Bijnens

  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0036">2001</a>; Doutrelant et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0040">2001</a>). Our mainland population fits this description as about 70% of the recorded songs contain a trill. By contrast, in Corsica, the percentage of songs possessing a trill is lower, varying between 0% (E‐Pirio) and 30% (D‐Muro, Doutrelant and Lambrechts 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0036">2001</a>; Doutrelant et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0040">2001</a>). Overall, local variation is much more pronounced in Corsica than on the mainland, revealing the existence of different song dialects (Doutrelant et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0040">2001</a>). In particular, blue tit songs in D‐Muro and E‐Pirio display significantly different frequency range, maximum frequency, number of phrases and total duration (Table 
  <a rid="eva12282-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#eva12282-tbl-0001">1</a>, Doutrelant et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0040">2001</a>), and they share very few song types (around half the repertoire if we consider the whole range of song types produced but none in common if we only consider the song types sung by more than 10 individuals, Doutrelant et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0040">2001</a>). Founder effects, isolation or drift could drive a large part of the geographic variation observed because song is a cultural trait that needs to be learned to be correctly emitted and thus is very sensitive to stochastic factors (Catchpole and Slater 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0021">2008</a>). However, playback experiments and correlative data suggest that adaptation to both local vegetation and local interspecific competition with great tits is also a good candidate to explain the described song differences (Doutrelant et al.
