 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are several lines of evidence suggesting that a process of matching habitat choice (Edelaar et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0045">2008</a>) could cause directed gene flow between forest habitat types. The fact that birds from E‐Pirio are smaller and lighter than birds from D‐Muro allowed Blondel and colleagues (fig. 2 in Blondel et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0012">1999</a>) to provide the first evidence for nonrandom gene flow as immigrants showed more similar morphometrics compared to resident birds than expected by chance, suggesting that birds born in deciduous habitats would prefer to breed in deciduous habitats, and 
  <span class="italic">vice versa</span> for birds from evergreen habitats. Later on, a study of feather isotopic signatures in the main study sites presented in Box 
  <a rid="eva12282-fea-0002" ref-type="boxed-text" href="#eva12282-fea-0002">2</a> partly confirmed such habitat choice, while also revealing in each area a set of immigrant birds with outlier isotopic signatures, presumably originating from oak void habitats (Charmantier et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0029">2014</a>). Further investigations are underway to refine the definition of isoscapes within and around our study populations, in the aim of identifying the landscape origin of each immigrant bird (C. de Franceschi, work in progress). This would allow testing for a matching habitat choice process, for example to test the prediction that blue tits with fast exploratory behaviour preferentially disperse to deciduous forest patches while ‘slow’ birds prefer to breed in evergreen patches.
