 <p>Our first thanks go to our collaborators Jacques Blondel, Marcel Lambrechts, Philippe Perret, Arnaud Grégoire, Samuel Caro, Dany Garant and Denis Réale who have been a great ‘male’ tit team and have participated to most of the results exposed here. We are very grateful to the numerous generations of fieldworkers who collected data in the mainland and Corsican study sites, as well as to the APEEM, the MAB and the local city councils and communities for access to the field sites. We thank the French ANR (grant ANR‐12‐ADAP‐0006‐02‐PEPS), the Region Languedoc Roussillon (CD), the ERC (Starting grant ERC‐2013‐StG‐337365‐SHE to AC), the Marie‐Curie Fellowship scheme (IEF to MS) and the OSU‐OREME for funding in recent years. Gabrielle Dubuc‐Messier was supported by the Fonds Québécois de la Recherche sur la Nature et les Technologies scholarships (FQRNT) and by a postgraduate scholarship from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC). We finally thank Maren Wellenreuther and Louis Bernatchez for triggering this review, as well as Jacques Blondel, Marcel Lambrechts, Charles Perrier, Dany Garant and three anonymous reviewers for constructive comments on the manuscript.</p>
