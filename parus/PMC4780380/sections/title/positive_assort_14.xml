 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After they settle in a new habitat, maladapted immigrants can still have a restricted contribution to the local gene pool because of sexual selection processes (Richardson et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0113" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0113">2014</a>). In particular, positive assortative mating may discriminate against rare phenotypes. In Corsica, we found support for a positive assortative mating in handling aggression scores (estimated correlation between male and female handling aggression: 0.156, 95% CI = [0.054, 0.260]; Fig. 
  <a rid="eva12282-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12282-fig-0003">3</a>) and for exploratory speed in the openfield for young females of 1 and 2 years (estimated correlation: 0.280, 95% CI = [0.073, 0.473], 
  <span class="italic">n </span>= 41 females, 38 males; 2011–2014). Similar assortative mating for personality has been identified in several bird species, including great tits (Groothuis and Carere 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0056">2005</a>) and zebra finches 
  <span class="italic">Taeniopygia guttata</span> (Schuett et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0120" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0120">2011</a>). Assortative mating for UV–blue and yellow coloration is also around 30%, while varying across years (A. Fargevieille unpublished data). Such assortative mating also suggests a potential role of sexual selection in the observed phenotypic differentiation, which needs further exploration in future work.

   <p>Relationship between handling aggression scores (0 to 3, with 0 no aggressive behaviour and 3 maximum aggressiveness) of male and female social partners in Corsican populations (E‐Pirio, D‐Muro and E‐Muro) from 2011 to 2014; the slope (0.156, 95% 
    <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">CI</span>
    <span class="italic"> </span>= [0.054;0.260]) and intercept (1.400, 95% 
    <span style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">CI</span> = [1.084;1.751]) of the line are derived from a linear mixed model (Bayesian framework) with females handling aggression score as response variable, partner handling aggression score and year as fixed effects and female identity, partner identity and handling aggression observer as random effects; 
    <span class="italic">n</span> = 336 females, 345 males, 10 observers. The size of the points refers to the number of pairs with a given combination of handling aggression scores (min = 2, max
