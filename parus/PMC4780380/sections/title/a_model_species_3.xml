 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The geographic configuration of Mediterranean landscapes, characterized by a heterogeneous, fine‐grained mosaic of habitats, provides an exceptional study system for investigating plastic and adaptive responses in spatially structured populations (Blondel and Aronson 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0008">1999</a>; Blondel et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0016">2010</a>). In this system, we have focused on the variability expressed by a passerine bird, the Blue tit, whose ecological niche is preferentially linked to oak woodlands. The Blue tit is present in a narrower range of habitats compared to the Great tit 
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span> (Snow 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0128" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0128">1954</a>; Lack 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0070">1971</a>), and yet is a common breeder throughout Europe and western Asia where it readily breeds in nest boxes, which makes it an ideal model to study adaptation to environmental heterogeneity. In our study area, the breeding activity of about 350 blue tit pairs is monitored each year in more than 1000 nest boxes erected across eight study sites, in a series of habitats that strongly differ in being dominated by patches of either deciduous (
  <span class="italic">Quercus pubescens</span>) or evergreen (
  <span class="italic">Quercus ilex</span>) oaks (Box 
  <a rid="eva12282-fea-0002" ref-type="boxed-text" href="#eva12282-fea-0002">2</a>). In deciduous forest patches, the leafing process occurs ca. 1 month (3–5 weeks depending on the scale of analysis) earlier compared to evergreen forests, and all leaves are renewed. This results in an earlier and more abundant caterpillar peak in deciduous patches (Zandt et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0141" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0141">1990</a>; Dias et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0034">1994</a>), which are considered as higher quality breeding habitats (Blondel et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0015">2006</a>). These differences between habitats are clearly visible to the human eye (Box 
  <a rid="eva12282-fea-0002" ref-type="boxed-text" href="#eva12282-fea-0002">2</a>) and can be mapped at a large scale using vegetation reflectance data from satellite sensors, the latter correlating remarkably well with the number of either type of oak quantified on the ground within a 50 m radius from each nest box (Szulkin 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-5555" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-5555">2015</a>). Apart from the notable heterogeneity of the Mediterranean landscape, these study populations are also situated at the species range‐edge, a position known to be conducive to geographic differentiation (Mayr 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0089" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0089">1970</a>; Endler 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0046">1977</a>). Hence, the study of these populations may be of particular conservation value because they represent significant components of intraspecific biodiversity (Hardie and Hutchings 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0060">2010</a>) and potential sources of evolutionary innovation and persistence during rapid environmental change such as global warming (Sexton et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0121" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0121">2009</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over the last forty years, the Montpellier blue tit group has ringed 6653 blue tit parents and 33 489 blue tit chicks in these study populations. This sustained hard work aimed at elucidating the phenotypic variation displayed by blue tits at three spatial scales (Blondel et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0015">2006</a>): mainland versus Corsica (min. distance of 85 km off mainland Italy and 170 km off the French mainland), a scale that is not the main focus of the present study (but more details about this inference level can be found in Dias and Blondel 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0033">1996</a>; Lambrechts et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0075">1997b</a>; Blondel et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0013">2001</a>; Doutrelant et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0040">2001</a>); Muro versus Pirio valleys (24.1 km between D‐Muro and E‐Pirio, where ‘D’ stands for Deciduous and ‘E’ for Evergreen), and three deciduous plots (D‐Muro) versus three evergreen plots (E‐Muro) within the Muro valley (separated by 5.6 km). Although these distinct study plots within the Muro valley have been detailed in some previous publications (e.g. Lambrechts et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0077">2004</a>), we have pooled their blue tit populations here as they never display any significant differentiation, neither phenotypically nor genetically.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because of the low rate of capture–recapture data using multisites, our knowledge on natal and breeding dispersal in the Blue tit remains approximate, with very different results in different studies. For example, while a maximum dispersal distance of 14.5 km was recorded in Belgium (Tufto et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0132" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0132">2005</a>), an earlier study over 1200 km² in Germany revealed that natal dispersal could reach distances of 24 km in males and 470 km in females (Winkel and Frantzen 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0139" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0139">1991</a>). Note that in the same study, breeding dispersal (that is the distance between successive reproductive events) reached maximal distances of 0.75 km for males and 37 km for females. At the same time, the mode of the distribution is likely to be much smaller, especially in Corsican blue tits (Blondel et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0012">1999</a>), and most of our dispersal events are recorded within sites even when other populations are monitored close by. Over the last 17 years of ringing in Corsica, we observed 2 dispersal events between D‐Muro and E‐Muro (5.6 km), 2 reverse events between the same sites, and none between the Muro valley and E‐Pirio (24.1 km).
