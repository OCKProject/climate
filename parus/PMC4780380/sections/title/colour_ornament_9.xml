  <a rid="eva12282-fea-0002" ref-type="boxed-text" href="#eva12282-fea-0002">2</a> displays a unique colour phenotype (for detailed statistical results see A. Fargevieille, A. Grégoire &amp; C. Doutrelant, in preparation) when combining measures on the blue crown patch and the yellow chest. Compared to Corsican blue tits, birds from the mainland have brighter yellow and UV–blue colorations and less dichromatic yellow chroma. Corsican populations also differ from one another. First, the chromatic values of the UV–blue coloration separate D‐Muro from E‐Muro and E‐Pirio: deciduous birds display more UV (lower hue and higher UV chroma) and are more dichromatic (Fig. 
  <a rid="eva12282-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12282-fig-0002">2</a>). Second, the chromatic values of the yellow coloration separate E‐Muro from D‐Muro and E‐Pirio: the yellow chroma of E‐Muro birds is lower and less dichromatic. Finally, the population of E‐Pirio shows different brightness patterns, with duller UV–blue coloration and brighter yellow coloration. More studies are needed to understand the origin of these population differences and whether or not they are adaptive, but it is noteworthy that D‐Muro and E‐Muro birds differ so strongly in both UV–blue and yellow coloration. These differences may contribute to the observed genetic differentiation if mate choice preference for colour signal differs between these populations or if individuals do not settle randomly in respect to their coloration. In the face of a habitat‐specific divergence at a micro‐geographic scale, the observed differences in the UV–blue coloration between the two Muro populations are particularly interesting to illustrate this possible divergent intrasexual selection. Indeed, the blue crown patch is involved in social and intrasexual interactions (Rémy et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0110" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0110">2010</a>; Midamegbe et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0092" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0092">2011</a>), and as the deciduous forest of D‐Muro offers a richer breeding habitat than the evergreen forests of E‐Muro and E‐Pirio, birds in D‐Muro might display more UV because they are socially dominant over the birds breeding in evergreen patches (Braillet et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0017">2002</a>). Another hypothesis, involving plasticity in coloration, is that the stronger UV in D‐Muro results from a lower cost of breeding in this population. We indeed experimentally demonstrated that increasing the cost of reproduction affects the parents coloration in the following year (Doutrelant et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0041">2012</a>).
