 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Differences in breeding phenology are particularly striking (Lambrechts et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0074">1997a</a>; Fig. 
  <a rid="eva12282-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12282-fig-0001">1</a>). As leaf‐eating caterpillars, the main prey collected for blue tit chicks, are available 1 month later in evergreen compared to deciduous forests (Blondel et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0012">1999</a>), the birds' breeding synchronization with local seasonal variation in food leads to divergent breeding phenologies even at a geographical scale much smaller than the dispersal range of the birds (Blondel et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0010">1993</a>): indeed, average laying dates are 1 month apart between D‐Muro and E‐Pirio, and 10 days between D‐Muro and E‐Muro (Table 
  <a rid="eva12282-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#eva12282-tbl-0001">1</a>, Fig. 
  <a rid="eva12282-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12282-fig-0001">1</a>). In fact, the breeding dates in E‐Pirio are the latest described in the whole species distribution (see the striking fig. 1 in Visser et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0133" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0133">2003</a>), which was originally quite surprising considering this population is at the southern range of the species distribution and is under a much warmer climate than most other populations included in this comparison. Interrogations on the plastic versus genetic origin of such drastic differences in the onset of laying emerged in the mid‐1980s (Blondel 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0007">1985</a>) and led to common garden experiments in aviaries, including hand‐reared chicks (Blondel et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0009">1990</a>). These experiments suggested that differences observed in the average onset of laying had a strong genetic basis when comparing birds from mainland deciduous and Corsican evergreen habitats (Blondel et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0009">1990</a>; Lambrechts and Dias 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0071">1993</a>). Similar attempts to test for a genetically based difference in laying date between D‐Muro and E‐Pirio were less successful, presumably because D‐Muro birds seemed to cope less well with novel and artificial environments than birds from other populations (Lambrechts et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0076">1999</a>). Concurrently to the evidence for a genetically based microgeographic variation in laying date, at least between the mainland and Corsican blue tits, plasticity was also revealed important. In these populations, as in many other bird species (Charmantier and Gienapp 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0024">2014</a>), the timing of breeding is a plastic trait responding to various environmental cues. Early aviary tests confirmed that photoperiod is a key determining factor of timing of breeding (Lambrechts et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0075">1997b</a>; Lambrechts and Perret 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0072">2000</a>). Further experiments revealed the role of other factors such as aviary characteristics and social environment (Caro et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0019">2007</a>), and long‐term series analyses revealed a relatively strong plastic response to spring temperature in all populations (Porlier et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0104" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0104">2012a</a>). In the context of elucidating proximate factors involved in the adjustment of the onset of breeding, our Mediterranean blue tit populations offered a valuable opportunity to test simultaneously the roles of food availability/temperature on the one hand (as historically favoured by ecologists, e.g. Perrins 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0102" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0102">1991</a>) and photoperiod on the other (as favoured by physiologists, e.g. Silverin et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0123" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0123">1993</a>), respectively. They still offer promising perspectives for more refined aviary experiments (S. Caro, work in progress). Phenotypic differences in clutch size among the study sites are equally strong, with the E‐Pirio population presenting the lowest average clutch size recorded for this species (Table 
  <a rid="eva12282-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#eva12282-tbl-0001">1</a>, Blondel et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0010">1993</a>, 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0011">1998</a>). This variation in the number of eggs laid is well related to the abundance of food supply (Lambrechts et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0074">1997a</a>; Blondel et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0015">2006</a>), that is caterpillars, during the breeding season, yet artificial food conditions in the aviaries make it difficult to test for a genetic mechanism, as has been done for laying date (Blondel et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0009">1990</a>). Overall, classic selection analyses showed that habitat‐specific differences in the timing and abundance of food result in divergent selection for both laying date and clutch size (see detailed selection estimates in Porlier et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0104" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0104">2012a</a>) and thus confirm the possible role of habitat in driving phenotypic differences.
