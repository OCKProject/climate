 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Very recently, the study of variation in personality using openfield protocols (Mutzel et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0097" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0097">2013</a>) and handling aggression (Class et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0031">2014</a>) scores (0–3) has revealed that these behaviours are repeatable and show strong differentiation among evergreen versus deciduous habitat patches in Corsica (G. Dubuc‐Messier, A. Charmantier &amp; D. Réale, in preparation). In short, individuals from the deciduous island habitat (D‐Muro) show higher speed in the openfield and higher handling aggression compared to individuals from the evergreen island habitats, with similar patterns in males and females (Table 
  <a rid="eva12282-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#eva12282-tbl-0001">1</a>). At the same time, we did not find any personality difference between the two evergreen island habitats for both traits (openfield exploration speed and handling aggression). These results are consistent with the pace‐of‐life hypothesis proposed by Réale et al. (
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0109" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0109">2010</a>): individuals from the rich deciduous habitat (D‐Muro) show life history characteristic of a fast pace‐of‐life (e.g. low adult survival, high reproductive investment, see Table 
  <a rid="eva12282-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#eva12282-tbl-0001">1</a>) and display a personality phenotype classically associated with this kind of pace‐of‐life, that is fast exploration patterns in the openfield and higher handling aggression. The opposite is true for individuals from the evergreen habitats (E‐Muro and E‐Pirio), which are showing life history and personality phenotypes typical of a slow pace‐of‐life, demographically illustrated by lower fecundity (clutch size, number of fledglings) and higher survival rates. Similarly to the divergence observed in song characteristics, such behavioural differences across habitats could arise from restricted gene flow, and in turn could reinforce the isolation process (see more discussion on this in the mechanisms section below).
