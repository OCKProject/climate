 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Blue tits from the mainland belong to the nominal 
  <span class="italic">Cyanistes caeruleus caeruleus,</span> and are 15% larger than blue tits from Corsica, which belong to the subspecies 
  <span class="italic">C. c. ogliastrae</span> (Table 
  <a rid="eva12282-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#eva12282-tbl-0001">1</a>, Dias and Blondel 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0033">1996</a>). Additionally, within Corsica, birds are smaller and lighter (yet with longer bills) in the poorer evergreen habitat compared to the richer deciduous habitat, with once again birds from E‐Pirio displaying extreme phenotypic values (Table 
  <a rid="eva12282-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#eva12282-tbl-0001">1</a>). This habitat‐linked morphological divergence has repeatedly been shown significant for adult birds (e.g. Blondel et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0012">1999</a>) as well as for nestlings (Charmantier et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0027">2004b</a>). Interestingly, there is strong divergent selection on adult size between habitats because small adult males have a higher breeding success compared to large males in the poor evergreen forest while the reverse is true in the deciduous environment (Blondel et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0014">2002</a>). This is in contrast with results of similar selection analyses for chick morphology, which show consistent selection for larger and heavier nestlings, although with differing selection force across the study populations (Charmantier et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0027">2004b</a>). Contrarily to what has been described above for laying date, the difference in body mass (independently of adult size) measured between evergreen and deciduous habitats vanished in common garden aviary experiments (Braillet et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0017">2002</a>) as well as in cross‐fostering studies (Simon et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0124" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0124">2005</a>), suggesting a major role of phenotypic plasticity. Both caterpillar abundance and parasite prevalence were identified as key factors driving the phenotypic plasticity in morphometrics and explaining the habitat‐specific divergence with smaller and lighter birds in the poorer habitat (Blondel et al. 
  <a rid="eva12282-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12282-bib-0015">2006</a>).
