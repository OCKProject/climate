  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref009">9</a>]) has been linked to breeding phenology, reproductive success and survival in a wide range of taxa including birds, mammals and fish [

  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref011">11</a>]. In northern Europe, positive values of the index are associated with warmer, wetter winters and negative values with colder, drier ones, while the reverse is the case in North America (i.e. negative values, warm and wet; positive values, cold and dry) [

  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref014">14</a>], and earlier breeding in response to warmer springs has been documented in many species [

It is a reasonable assumption that warmer springs are likely to follow warmer winters and thus a link between the NAO WI and bird breeding phenology in the immediately following spring might be expected and has indeed been demonstrated in both Europe and North America. For example, a significant negative relationship between the NAO WI and timing of breeding has been reported for several British great tit (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>) populations, i.e. breeding started earlier following a warmer winter [
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref017">17</a>], and recent work on European starlings (
  <span class="italic">Sturnus vulgaris</span>) in British Columbia found an earlier start to egg laying following warmer mid-winter temperatures [
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref014">14</a>]. Other studies have reported time-lags of one or more years in relationships with the NAO WI [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper, we use 23 years of data for great tits breeding in deciduous woodland in eastern England to examine the effect of the NAO WI on timing of breeding. Instead of an expected direct effect of the immediately preceding winter [
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref017">17</a>], we found a novel relationship between the birds’ timing of breeding (measured as first egg dates) and the NAO WI such that timing can be predicted one year in advance, i.e. timing in year i is positively related to the NAO WI in year i-1. We also show how this relationship appears to be generated by a one year time-lag in an abiotic link between the NAO WI and local spring warmth in our study area. This time-lagged link has developed since the mid 1970s suggesting a recent shift in the large-scale climate processes influencing the birds’ breeding phenology.
