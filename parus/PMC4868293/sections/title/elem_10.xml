 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Timing of breeding by great tits in all three study woods was linearly related to local weather conditions, measured by the warmth sum, such that egg laying started earlier in warmer springs (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155241.g003" href="#pone.0155241.g003">Fig 3</a>). The relationships for all three woods were similar in slope, and for MW and BW also in intercept, but the latter differed for WW where, on average, breeding started consistently later (c. 6–7 days) than in the other two woods (ANOVA, F
  <sub>(2,66)</sub> = 7.81, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.001). In the models examining the influence of rainfall on timing of breeding, rainfall in the preceding months of December, January, February and March had no significant effect either separately or when combined as total winter rainfall. The month of December came closest with a non-significant delaying effect (F
  <sub>(1,62)</sub> = 3.06, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.085). The best overall model included year because of a significant interaction with site, Wennington Wood having significantly later egg dates than the other two woods (see above), but the effect of year on its own was not significant (F
  <sub>(1,61)</sub> = 3.50, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.066). Despite the strong effect of warmth sum on egg dates (F
  <sub>(1,61)</sub> = 63.31, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001), the time-lagged NAO WI had an additional effect (F
  <sub>(1,61)</sub> = 16.41, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001) and the total variance explained by the model was 82.3%.
