 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Timing of breeding in all three woods was related to both the one year time-lagged NAO WI (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155241.g001" href="#pone.0155241.g001">Fig 1</a>) and the annual change in the NAO WI (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155241.g002" href="#pone.0155241.g002">Fig 2</a>). Overall, the strengths of the relationships with timing using either the one year time-lagged NAO WI or the annual change were similar, but using the NAO WI for the preceding year, we can putatively predict timing of breeding one year in advance (e.g. NAO WI for 2013/14 predicts first egg dates for spring 2015). Using jackknife cross-validation, the mean % errors (± SE) of predicted first egg dates were: Monks Wood: 6.92 ± 1.44; Brampton Wood: 8.51 ± 1.77; Wennington Wood: 3.02 ± 0.63. Overall, the relationships with the lagged NAO WI tended to over-estimate the mean dates, i.e. predicted a later start to breeding than that observed. There were no significant relationships using the NAO WI for the immediately preceding winter (for MW, BW, WW respectively, R
