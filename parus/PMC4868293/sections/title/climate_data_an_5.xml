Relationships between the annual mean timing of breeding of great tits in each wood and the NAO WI were then examined for the study period using least squares linear regression (Minitab Release 15). We used the NAO WI for the immediately preceding winter and also for one and two year time-lags, i.e. year i, year i-1 and year i-2. To test the predictive power of the one year time-lagged relationship for each wood, we used a jackknife approach to derive a mean % error (± SE) for the prediction of mean first egg date, i.e. we omitted each year sequentially and used the remaining 22 years to predict the timing of the missing year.

For our measure of local spring warmth, we used the ‘warmth sum’ calculated as the sum of maximum daily temperature for 1

  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref029">29</a>] in relation to great tit breeding parameters. Although the time period of 1
  <span class="sup">st</span> March to 25
  <span class="sup">th</span> April is fixed whilst the average onset of breeding can vary by as much as 3–4 weeks between years depending on weather conditions, using a fixed index provides an unbiased measure of local spring warmth in relation to the NAO WI. We also examined how the warmth sum and/or the timing of breeding were related to the annual change, calculated as current year index minus previous year index, in the NAO WI. We used this annual change as an attempt to link events back to the previous year because, although it was clear how the immediately preceding NAO WI might have an influence, it was not clear how such an influence might act across time in the event of a one-year time-lag (but see 
  <a ref-type="sec" rid="sec010" href="#sec010">discussion</a>). We also investigated if winter or early spring rainfall might influence timing of breeding. We used a general linear modelling approach with site as a random factor, and warmth sum, NAO WI, rainfall and year as covariates. Rainfall was entered separately as the total monthly rainfall for the months of December, January, February and March, and was also modelled as combined winter rainfall, i.e. the total for December to March combined. We could not use year as a factor because, to avoid pseudoreplication, our first egg dates are average values for each wood for each year. However, year can be used as a covariate and this is also appropriate in the context of global warming promoting earlier breeding [

Maximum daily temperatures, and total monthly rainfall, for the 23-year study period were obtained from a UK Met Office weather station located approximately 50 m from the south side of Monks Wood (and approximately 4 km from WW and 9 km from BW).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To investigate the link between the warmth sum and the NAO WI in the longer term, we used a 23-year sliding window, with annual stepping, and data going back to 1878 [
