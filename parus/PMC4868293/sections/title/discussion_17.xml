 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is well known that many bird species, including great tits, begin breeding activity earlier in warmer springs [
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref015">15</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref016">16</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref033">33</a>]. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a relationship with climate has been shown to enable prediction of the likely timing of breeding one year in advance. Although our results are for the date of egg laying in great tits, the prediction can be applied to spring phenology in general (in eastern England at least) because earlier breeding activity in warmer springs is related to temperature-dependent development of vegetation and invertebrate food supplies. Great tits attempt to exploit the spring peak in defoliating arboreal caterpillars to rear their young [
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref013">13</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref034">34</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref036">36</a>] and the timing, abundance and duration of maximum caterpillar availability depends on factors, such as tree bud burst and leafing phenology, which are influenced by temperature and other environmental conditions [
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref022">22</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref037">37</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref040">40</a>]. Rainfall did not significantly influence timing, probably because wet springs are also usually cold [
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref022">22</a>] and, overall, temperature has by far the greatest influence.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The onset of breeding in tits can typically vary by up to about a month between years; across all three of our woods, the mean annual first egg date varied by a maximum of 28 days across the 23 years. Despite this variation, our predictive ability was generally robust, R
  <span class="sup">2</span> values for the relationships between timing and the lagged NAO WI in the three woods ranged from 0.463 to 0.563 with P &lt; 0.001 in all cases (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155241.g001" href="#pone.0155241.g001">Fig 1</a>). Using these relationships and the NAO WI value for 2014/15 (i.e. 3.56), average (± SD) first egg dates for 2016 for MW, BW and WW respectively are predicted as 25
  <span class="sup">th</span>April (± 7.6 days), 24
  <span class="sup">th</span> April (± 7.4) and 1
  <span class="sup">st</span> May (± 6.5), which, as in 2015, will be another relatively late spring, five days later than the overall 23-year mean dates. However, despite the general observation that breeding in birds starts earlier in warmer years, the response to temperature, and other conditions, is likely to be more complex than this ‘rule of thumb’ implies [
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref021">21</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref038">38</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref042">42</a>] and may account for the unexpectedly early start to breeding in WW in 2009 (c. two weeks earlier than predicted). In contrast to this early start, the usually consistent later start to breeding in WW was probably indicative of habitat differences, for example, timing is known to become later as wood size declines [
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref024">24</a>] and WW has a higher proportion of ash trees than either MW or BW which may have implications for the abundance and diversity of invertebrate food supplies [
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref043">43</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Influences of large-scale climate processes in ecology are well established [
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref001">1</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref007">7</a>] and have been used to examine historical events as well as to predict future ones. For example, in an analysis of great tit population dynamics spanning 100 years in Switzerland [
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref011">11</a>], breeding phenology and performance were linked to a chain of events starting with global climate processes (measured using winter/late spring NAO indices and the North Sea–Caspian Pattern), proceeding through local weather patterns (rainfall and temperature) and habitat phenology (beech bud burst) and ending with individual life histories. A number of studies have also reported time-lags in ecological responses to the NAO, but these are usually driven by biotic rather than abiotic factors. For example, lags of several years in annual cohort sizes of cod (
  <span class="italic">Gadus morhua</span>) have been recorded with both negative and positive relationships in different populations depending on local sea conditions [
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref006">6</a>]. These effects were driven by biotic links between the NAO WI, local sea temperatures and high recruitment following maturation of particular generations following increased survival of younger, immature stages in previous years. Similarly, abundance of red deer (
  <span class="italic">Cervus elaphus</span>) at Sør-Trøndelag in Norway and on the Isle of Rum in Scotland both showed a two year lag in relation to the NAO WI [
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref010">10</a>], although the biotic mechanisms underlying these relationships (increases in annual fecundity and\or changes in over-winter survival) differed between the two locations.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a recent review of climate impacts on wildlife populations [
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref044">44</a>] it was concluded that indirect biotic mechanisms have greater impact than abiotic ones (the work concentrated on long-term effects, with a minimum data run of 20 years, and did not consider short-term extreme events, [
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref022">22</a>]). Such complexity is well demonstrated by golden plover (
  <span class="italic">Pluvialis apricaria</span>) population sizes in the English Peak District where a decline in numbers showed a two year time-lag in relation to the NAO [
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref045">45</a>] and local weather conditions. Numbers of tipulids, the main prey item for plover chicks, could be reduced by as much as 95% due to larval mortality in dry weather in the previous year, causing low recruitment and hence plover population decline in the following year [
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref046">46</a>]. Other studies [
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref017">17</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref047">47</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref048">48</a>] have shown a direct link between the immediately preceding NAO WI and timing of breeding which is consistent with breeding starting earlier under warmer conditions. For the 23 years of our study, despite a strong direct relationship between first egg dates and local spring warmth (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155241.g003" href="#pone.0155241.g003">Fig 3</a>), there was no significant (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.077) direct link with the NAO WI for the immediately preceding winter, although the relationship showed a distinct positive trend, i.e. warmer springs were associated with positive values of the NAO WI. Given the strong relationship between the timing of breeding and the warmth sum, and between the warmth sum and both the annual change in the NAO WI (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155241.g005" href="#pone.0155241.g005">Fig 5</a>), and its value in the previous year (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155241.g004" href="#pone.0155241.g004">Fig 4</a>), it seems likely that there is a time-lag in abiotic factors linking the large-scale climate processes to the local spring weather rather than a biotic link.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The observation that positive values of the NAO WI are associated with warmer and wetter winters in northern Europe provides a plausible link to the warmth sum in the immediately following spring, but how the NAO WI might influence the warmth sum with a one year delay is unclear. The sliding window analysis suggested that conditions causing the delay are a relatively recent development. Factors influencing large-scale climate processes are complex, for example, the range of factors influencing the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) include solar radiation, melting of ice sheets, natural fluctuations in greenhouse gases, human induced global warming and various feedback mechanisms [
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref049">49</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref050">50</a>]. Thus it may not be surprising that full development of an El Niño can be delayed for a year, e.g. the event predicted for 2014 eventually developed in 2015 and is now set to last until mid 2016 [
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref051">51</a>]. Concerning our study, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) is an index based on sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean [
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref052">52</a>]. Sea surface temperatures influence air temperature in the UK, and the AMO has been found to correlate well with the occurrence of dry and wet periods in North America [
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref053">53</a>]. Furthermore, recent work suggests that the NAO may be influenced by the AMO across a 10 to 15 year timescale with potential for decadal forecasting [
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref054">54</a>]. Thus interactions between ocean, atmospheric and land temperatures may involve substantial time-lags, but how this might influence our findings is currently only speculation, and relationships with the AMO merit further investigation. Whatever the cause of the current lagged relationship between spring warmth in eastern England and the NAO WI, it appears to be indicative of recent change in larger-scale processes underlying and associated with the NAO WI consistent with general observations of changing global climate. Other recent work has also documented such change, for example, Schmidt et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref004">4</a>] describe a climate change-related shift in a long-term relationship between seabird population dynamics and ocean conditions, including a greater influence of large-scale El Niño events on survival than local ocean conditions. Thompson and Ollason [
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref055">55</a>] also highlight the potential for changes in the effects of climate systems on long-lived seabirds to take years to become apparent. The current strength of our time-lagged relationship between the warmth sum and the NAO WI suggests that it might have relevance for other temperature-dependent ecological relationships [
  <a rid="pone.0155241.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref056">56</a>].
