  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Timing of breeding in all three woods was related to both the one year time-lagged NAO WI (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155241.g001" href="#pone.0155241.g001">Fig 1</a>) and the annual change in the NAO WI (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155241.g002" href="#pone.0155241.g002">Fig 2</a>). Overall, the strengths of the relationships with timing using either the one year time-lagged NAO WI or the annual change were similar, but using the NAO WI for the preceding year, we can putatively predict timing of breeding one year in advance (e.g. NAO WI for 2013/14 predicts first egg dates for spring 2015). Using jackknife cross-validation, the mean % errors (± SE) of predicted first egg dates were: Monks Wood: 6.92 ± 1.44; Brampton Wood: 8.51 ± 1.77; Wennington Wood: 3.02 ± 0.63. Overall, the relationships with the lagged NAO WI tended to over-estimate the mean dates, i.e. predicted a later start to breeding than that observed. There were no significant relationships using the NAO WI for the immediately preceding winter (for MW, BW, WW respectively, R

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Timing of breeding by great tits in all three study woods was linearly related to local weather conditions, measured by the warmth sum, such that egg laying started earlier in warmer springs (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155241.g003" href="#pone.0155241.g003">Fig 3</a>). The relationships for all three woods were similar in slope, and for MW and BW also in intercept, but the latter differed for WW where, on average, breeding started consistently later (c. 6–7 days) than in the other two woods (ANOVA, F
   <sub>(2,66)</sub> = 7.81, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.001). In the models examining the influence of rainfall on timing of breeding, rainfall in the preceding months of December, January, February and March had no significant effect either separately or when combined as total winter rainfall. The month of December came closest with a non-significant delaying effect (F
   <sub>(1,62)</sub> = 3.06, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.085). The best overall model included year because of a significant interaction with site, Wennington Wood having significantly later egg dates than the other two woods (see above), but the effect of year on its own was not significant (F
   <sub>(1,61)</sub> = 3.50, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.066). Despite the strong effect of warmth sum on egg dates (F

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For our 23-year study period, local spring weather, measured as the warmth sum, showed a significant (R
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.426, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.001) negative relationship with a one year time-lagged NAO WI, i.e. warmth sum for year = i and NAO WI for year = i-1 (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155241.g004" href="#pone.0155241.g004">Fig 4</a>). In contrast, there was a positive relationship between the warmth sum and the NAO WI for the immediately preceding winter, i.e. warmer springs were associated with positive values of the NAO WI, but the relationship was not significant (warmth sum = 678 + 12.5 NAO WI, R
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.141, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.077). There was also a positive relationship between the warmth sum and the annual change in the NAO WI (

   <span class="sup">2</span> value than the relationship with the time-lagged NAO WI.

   <a rid="pone.0155241.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0155241.ref017">17</a>] found significant relationships between the immediately preceding NAO WI and timing of breeding in some great tit populations. However, more recently, from the mid 1970s (about Period 87) onwards, the time-lagged relationship has become the most significant which is suggestive of a change in climate patterns in recent years (although given the smoothing effect of this approach, these results must be interpreted carefully). There was no significant correlation between the NAO WI in successive years, either in the whole of the period 1878–2015, or in the 23-year periods in which there were highly significant relationships between the NAO WI and the warmth sum (Ljung-Box tests, Q ≤ 2.6,
