 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mean air temperature, mean wind speed and total rainfall data for each day were summarised from measurements collected by an automated weather station (Davis Instruments Vantage Pro 2, Hayward, CA) located at 51° 27’ 17” N, 3° 9’ 45” W, 0.75 km and 4.5 km from CBWR and CLCP, respectively. Temperature measurements were summarised for the analysis to include mean temperature for all April measurements, the mean temperature during the egg laying period (the mean of air temperature measurements taken in the five days leading up to the production of the first egg for each nest), mean temperature during the incubation period (the mean of air temperature measurements during the incubation period for each nest) and mean temperature during the nestling period (the mean of air temperature measurements during the six days after hatching for each nest). Total rainfall (in mm) was the total measure of all the rainfall measurements taken during the laying, incubation or nestling periods (as specified above for mean temperature), for each nest. Likewise, wind speed (m/sec
  <span class="sup">-1</span>) was the mean wind speed value for the laying, incubation or nestling periods for each nest.
