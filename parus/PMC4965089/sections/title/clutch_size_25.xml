 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Clutch size in reed warblers appears to be less variable than in many other passerine species [
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref053">53</a>]. This may represent the outcome of a trade-off between current reproductive effort and future reproduction and survival [
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref054">54</a>]. Maintaining small clutch sizes reduces the period of egg-laying, as well as the duration required for incubation and nestling periods [
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref055">55</a>]. The advantages of this include reducing the period of vulnerability to predators and brood parasites [
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref056">56</a>], as well as leading to the earlier initiation of subsequent broods. Such benefits may outweigh the gains of increasing the clutch size of the first brood.
