 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A measure of weekly invertebrate prey availability was determined at each site using double-sided yellow (dry-stick) invertebrate traps (measuring 50 mm

Total weekly captures of Diptera, Aranea, Hymenoptera and Hemiptera, as well as other less-frequently encountered taxa (&lt;1%) such as Coleoptera and Lepidoptera are recorded for each trap. The number of invertebrates captured by these traps reflects both their abundance and activity [

  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref035">35</a>], so the mean weekly captures are used as an invertebrate “activity-density” to reflect the availability of naturally occurring prey for foraging reed warblers.
