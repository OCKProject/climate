 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A central task for ecologists is to understand the drivers of population change and community structure. Food availability is a central consideration and understanding food limitation in natural populations helps to inform the impacts of environmental change on animal populations. In this study, we investigate the mechanisms linking changes in food availability with changes in the breeding behaviour and productivity of a bird population. Migratory insectivorous songbirds are well-studied and respond to short-term changes in the environment [
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref001">1</a>]. For example, in temperate regions, climate change is advancing the emergence dates of invertebrates in spring, so that food for many breeding insectivorous songbirds peaks earlier in the breeding season [
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref002">2</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref005">5</a>]. As income breeders, whose breeding productivity depends primarily on current resources [
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref006">6</a>], songbirds require large quantities of food to support the energetically costly activities of egg production, incubation and nestling provisioning. The breeding season is therefore a period when birds are strongly affected by changes in food abundance, and in the timing of food availability.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many songbird species have shown advances in mean laying date in response to warming spring temperatures, which are likely to be linked to phenological advances in their prey [
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref007">7</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref011">11</a>]. Failure to adapt to this shift due to phenological mismatch has resulted in population declines in some long-distance migrant species reliant on short-lived peaks in invertebrate abundance early in the breeding season[
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref012">12</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref014">14</a>]. The influence of phenological mismatch, however, may have less impact on population sizes than widely believed [
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref015">15</a>]. Instead, the abundance of prey, rather than timing of prey peaks has been suggested as a more important consideration for breeding [
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref016">16</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref017">17</a>]. In wetlands, where the peaks of invertebrate abundance are more prolonged, the effects on breeding birds of climate-driven advancement of prey phenology may be less marked or even beneficial [
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref011">11</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In many songbird species, increases in food availability are associated with larger clutch sizes [
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref018">18</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref019">19</a>] and with earlier laying dates [
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref020">20</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref025">25</a>]. In multi-brooding species, earlier initiation and completion of the first brood can result in a greater likelihood of successful completion of the second brood, and higher overall productivity [
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref026">26</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref027">27</a>]. However, while larger clutches potentially increase first brood productivity by producing more offspring, the larger clutches take longer to lay and incubate [
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref028">28</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref029">29</a>]. As well as delaying the completion of the first brood, additional eggs prolong the period of high vulnerability to nest predation and brood parasitism [
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref021">21</a>]. In order to maximise overall productivity, birds could prioritise early completion of the first brood by maintaining typical clutch sizes. Increases in food availability earlier in the breeding season may result in higher breeding success and population growth by enabling earlier breeding and faster nestling growth, particularly if birds do not increase their clutch size. In the present study, we use a food supplementation experiment to measure the extent to which changes in food availability (as may occur in future climate scenarios) may drive changes in the different aspects of breeding behaviour that can affect overall demography.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eurasian reed warblers, 
  <span class="italic">Acrocephalus scirpaceus</span> (hereafter ‘reed warblers’) have an increasing West-European population and a northwest-advancing geographic distribution [
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref030">30</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref031">31</a>]. This trend, linked with increasing spring temperatures suggests that, despite inhabiting a habitat with plentiful resources throughout the breeding season, reed warblers are limited during the very early stages, either by phenology of their prey, growth of nesting habitat or by weather conditions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we test this limitation by experimentally increasing food availability (i.e. through the supply of more food) for a sample of breeding reed warblers, during the early stages of three breeding seasons, and compared the behaviour and breeding performance of this sample with that of a control group with natural food availability. Individual breeding pairs were supplemented with an unlimited food supply; they could not be provisioned with the additional amount of food predicted to occur under a particular climate projection. This was because multiple birds (and species) used the same supplementary feeders and so precisely regulating the amount of food for each pair was not feasible. The study should not, therefore, be viewed as an attempt to simulate future food availability. Rather, by 
  <span class="italic">ad libitum</span> food supplementation during the early stages of the breeding season, at a time when the natural levels of food availability are gradually increasing, the food peak can be artificially and immediately advanced. This approach allows focussed investigation of the aspects of reed warbler behaviour and breeding performance that are currently limited by food availability during the early stages of the breeding season.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assess how different aspects of breeding behaviour including laying date, clutch size, incubation period, nestling growth and first brood productivity responded to increasing food availability. We predict that: i) reed warblers will respond to increases in food availability by advancing their laying date and increasing nestling growth rates, in order to prioritise advancement of first brood completion; ii) clutch size will be unchanged in favour of maintaining a short period of incubation; and iii) the net effect of increased food availability will result in an increase in first brood productivity as well as earlier fledging of the first brood. Late completion of first broods may preclude the successful completion of second broods [
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref032">32</a>]. These mechanisms, linking protracted climate-driven increases in food supply across the spring in wetland habitats, to reed warbler breeding behaviour and productivity, may explain the current growth of reed warbler populations.
