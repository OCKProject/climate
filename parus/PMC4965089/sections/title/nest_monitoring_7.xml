 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Active nests (n = 102) were located by systematic searching of suitable nesting habitat (dense, tall stands of 
  <span class="italic">Phragmites</span>) and by visually tracking adults back to the nest. The status of each nest was checked every two days until the first eggs were laid (in April and May), then they were checked twice a day (at ~10:00 and ~16:00 BST) until fledging (in June and July). In order to minimise disturbance to breeding birds and damage to 
  <span class="italic">Phragmites</span> habitat, only first broods were monitored in this study.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The number of days since 1 April of that year was used as a measure of laying date earliness. The incubation period was defined as the time between the laying day of the last egg and the day of hatching of the first egg. Nestlings (at day four and day six after hatching) were weighed to 0.1 g using an electronic balance (Satrue SA-500). Since the nestlings were ringed on day six, it is not possible to assign growth rates to individual birds between day four and day six. Instead nestling weights were modelled using age and nest identity as independent variables to account for non-independence of measurements from the same age groups and nests. The effect of food supplementation on total first brood productivity was measured by comparing the mean number of chicks produced for each nest (including depredated nests and failures) in control and fed treatments. All nests in both treatment groups were filmed on at least three occasions during the nestling period, for up to two hours on each occasion, to confirm whether or not nestlings were being provisioned with mealworms as well as with other invertebrate taxa.</p>
