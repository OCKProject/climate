  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The guidelines promoted by the Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour for the ethical use of animals in research are followed. The species caught as part of this study are common and not registered as an endangered or protected species in any country. All fieldwork was conducted after ethical approval from the British Trust for Ornithology ringing unit (Vafidis licence no; 5475; Facey licence no: 5411; Thomas licence no: 4127). Special approval from the animal ethics committee was not required for these activities as they are included on the authors’ bird ringing licences.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two wetland locations in South Wales, UK, were used for the study. Cardiff Bay Wetland Reserve (CBWR; 51° 27’ 32” N, 3° 10’ 11” W) is a four-hectare wetland consisting of mixed scrub habitat, open pools and large areas of 
   <span class="italic">Phragmites australis</span> reedbed. Cosmeston Lakes Country Park (CLCP, 51° 24′ 53″ N 3° 6′ 0″ W) supports two adjacent small reedbed sites (with a total area of approximately 1.5 hectares) separated by 200 m of freshwater lake habitat. Both sites are publicly owned and access was arranged through the local authority.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Food supplementation</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prey availability for reed warblers was experimentally increased across the two study sites over three breeding seasons by providing live and dried mealworms, 
   <span class="italic">Tenebrio molitor</span> larvae (Coleoptera), in containers (2 litre-capacity) resting on small tables at 1.5 m height, from 1st of April onwards. Each study site supports three feeding stations, which were supplied with at least 200 mealworms (mean weight ± SD of mealworms = 112.00 ± 2.60 g, n = 100) and refilled every day (when required), until the end of the breeding season (September). Feeding bowls were enclosed in a wire mesh cage (measuring 300 x 200 x 200 mm of 10mm mesh) to prevent the mealworms being taken by carrion crows (
   <span class="italic">Corvus corvus</span>) and black-billed magpies (
   <span class="italic">Pica pica</span>), but permitting access to reed warblers. Each feeding station was regularly visited by between three and five pairs of colour-ringed breeding reed warblers each season (CBWR 2013–2014: 22 supplemented pairs out of 56 monitored territories; CLCP 2012–2013: 19 supplemented pairs out of 46 monitored territories). Other small passerines including European robins (
   <span class="italic">Erithacus rubecula</span>), common reed buntings (
   <span class="italic">Emberiza schoeniclus</span>) and Eurasian blue tits (
   <span class="italic">Cyanistes caeruleus</span>) occasionally gained access to the mealworms, but mealworms were always available for reed warblers using the feeders. All adults nesting within 50 m of the feeding stations discovered the mealworms within two to five days, and fed daily on the supplemented food from the laying period until the end of the breeding season in late July. Fed and control sites were located at least 150 m apart, to minimise the likelihood of accidental supplementary feeding of control birds visiting fed areas (no such incidences were observed). This was confirmed by individually identifying the adult reed warblers using the feeding stations and by remotely monitoring the stations with small video cameras (Sony Handycam DCR-SR32, Sony Corporation, 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sony.co.uk/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://sony.co.uk</span>) and infrared-triggered trail cameras (Bushnell HD. 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Bushnell.co.uk" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://Bushnell.co.uk</span>). Activity around the feeding stations was recorded between 06:00 and 18:00 BST every two days throughout the breeding cycle. The positions of feeding stations were moved between successive breeding seasons to allow the treatment state of site-faithful individuals to change between years.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nest monitoring</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Active nests (n = 102) were located by systematic searching of suitable nesting habitat (dense, tall stands of 
   <span class="italic">Phragmites</span>) and by visually tracking adults back to the nest. The status of each nest was checked every two days until the first eggs were laid (in April and May), then they were checked twice a day (at ~10:00 and ~16:00 BST) until fledging (in June and July). In order to minimise disturbance to breeding birds and damage to 
   <span class="italic">Phragmites</span> habitat, only first broods were monitored in this study.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The number of days since 1 April of that year was used as a measure of laying date earliness. The incubation period was defined as the time between the laying day of the last egg and the day of hatching of the first egg. Nestlings (at day four and day six after hatching) were weighed to 0.1 g using an electronic balance (Satrue SA-500). Since the nestlings were ringed on day six, it is not possible to assign growth rates to individual birds between day four and day six. Instead nestling weights were modelled using age and nest identity as independent variables to account for non-independence of measurements from the same age groups and nests. The effect of food supplementation on total first brood productivity was measured by comparing the mean number of chicks produced for each nest (including depredated nests and failures) in control and fed treatments. All nests in both treatment groups were filmed on at least three occasions during the nestling period, for up to two hours on each occasion, to confirm whether or not nestlings were being provisioned with mealworms as well as with other invertebrate taxa.</p>

Total weekly captures of Diptera, Aranea, Hymenoptera and Hemiptera, as well as other less-frequently encountered taxa (&lt;1%) such as Coleoptera and Lepidoptera are recorded for each trap. The number of invertebrates captured by these traps reflects both their abundance and activity [

Temperature measurements were summarised for the analysis to include mean temperature for all April measurements, the mean temperature during the egg laying period (the mean of air temperature measurements taken in the five days leading up to the production of the first egg for each nest), mean temperature during the incubation period (the mean of air temperature measurements during the incubation period for each nest) and mean temperature during the nestling period (the mean of air temperature measurements during the six days after hatching for each nest). Total rainfall (in mm) was the total measure of all the rainfall measurements taken during the laying, incubation or nestling periods (as specified above for mean temperature), for each nest. Likewise, wind speed (m/sec
   <span class="sup">-1</span>) was the mean wind speed value for the laying, incubation or nestling periods for each nest.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study tests the effects of food treatment on reed warbler laying date, clutch size, incubation duration, hatching success, rates of nestling growth, and overall first brood productivity (of all nesting attempts). As well as the availability of food, these reproductive parameters may also be affected by factors such as local weather conditions, and by other unmeasured constraints which may vary by year and site (e.g. competitive pressure, predator density).</p>

Where appropriate, the identity number for each nest is used as a random effect in mixed-effects models to account for repeated measures (e.g. nestling measurements) from the same nest. The final models are selected using backward deletion of non-significant (P&gt; 0.05) terms. The rates of predation are compared between fed and unfed treatments using a Fisher’s exact test due to the low instances of predation in the treatment group.

Outliers are identified using Cleveland plots, and collinearity is assessed using pair plots and variance inflation factor values. Homogeneity of variance is assessed by plotting the model residuals against the fitted values, and normality of residuals is assessed using histogram and QQ plots. Finally, influential observations are assessed using Cooks’ distance values.
