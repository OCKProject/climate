 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using supplementary feeding, this study investigates how changes in food availability affect different reproductive parameters that, together, influence the breeding success of reed warblers. Fed birds have earlier laying dates, higher nestling masses, and more fledged young. Incubation period was shorter in fed treatment groups when the mean April temperatures were warmest. In contrast, food supplementation does not measurably influence clutch size or hatching success.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Laying date</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Supplemental food advances the laying date by up to 5.6 (± 0.3) days during the warmest mean April temperatures. These results are consistent with observational studies of reed warblers [
   <a rid="pone.0159933.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref031">31</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0159933.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref040">40</a>], where earlier breeding was associated with warmer May to July temperatures. Continental European populations of reed warbler have been reported to be laying 18 days earlier over the last 33 years [
   <a rid="pone.0159933.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref031">31</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0159933.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref041">41</a>], but it has been unclear whether the primary driver behind earlier laying is the faster growth of nesting vegetation, or the earlier rise in availability of invertebrate prey. The relationship identified between later laying dates and higher values of invertebrate availability and reed height is likely to be correlated with time rather than more invertebrate prey and higher reeds driving later breeding. The significant food supplementation effect on laying phenology in our study suggests that laying date is constrained by food availability, as birds in both treatments were exposed to the same 
   <span class="italic">Phragmites</span> growth conditions. It is likely that reed warblers may only be able to advance their laying date in response to increased food availability if reed growth phenology (which is limited by spring temperatures [
   <a rid="pone.0159933.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref042">42</a>]) has advanced sufficiently to provide habitat suitable for earlier nest building.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Consistent with our findings, experimental increases in food availability are associated with earlier breeding dates in other passerine birds, including Eurasian blue tit [
   <a rid="pone.0159933.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref043">43</a>]; great tit,

   <a rid="pone.0159933.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref046">46</a>]. Many of these species rely on highly seasonal prey resources (e.g. caterpillars) and therefore risk mismatch between supply and demand if they nest too late. This is less likely for reed warblers, which feed their young on a diverse range of invertebrate prey populations which emerge sequentially throughout the summer, resulting in a prolonged period of high abundance without any clear peak [
   <a rid="pone.0159933.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref047">47</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0159933.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref050">50</a>]. Instead, reed warblers may be taking advantage of the higher abundance of invertebrates and earlier reed growth under warmer spring conditions to maximise fitness of their offspring by breeding earlier, enabling longer periods to acquire experience in foraging before autumn migration [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Clutch size</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Clutch size in reed warblers appears to be less variable than in many other passerine species [
   <a rid="pone.0159933.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref053">53</a>]. This may represent the outcome of a trade-off between current reproductive effort and future reproduction and survival [
   <a rid="pone.0159933.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref054">54</a>]. Maintaining small clutch sizes reduces the period of egg-laying, as well as the duration required for incubation and nestling periods [
   <a rid="pone.0159933.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref055">55</a>]. The advantages of this include reducing the period of vulnerability to predators and brood parasites [
   <a rid="pone.0159933.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref056">56</a>], as well as leading to the earlier initiation of subsequent broods. Such benefits may outweigh the gains of increasing the clutch size of the first brood.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nest predation</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Egg predation occurs much less frequently in supplementally fed nests than in control nests. Furthermore, the depredated control nests were subject to complete predation of the whole clutch, while the one supplemented nest only lost two eggs to predation. This difference may be explained by different nest attendance rates between treatment groups, with supplemented parent reed warblers spending less time foraging, reducing the frequency and duration of eggs being undefended, and uncovered by the well-camouflaged parent [
   <a rid="pone.0159933.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref057">57</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0159933.ref058" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref058">58</a>]. Lower rates of nest predation have been found in species that incubate continuously, such as mourning doves, 
   <span class="italic">Zenaida macroura</span> [
   <a rid="pone.0159933.ref059" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref059">59</a>], common eiders,

   <a rid="pone.0159933.ref060" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref060">60</a>], and common pheasants,

   <a rid="pone.0159933.ref061" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref061">61</a>], as a strategy to reduce the period of nesting to minimise vulnerability to predation and maximise opportunities to multi-brood. As no nestling predation was observed in this study, the egg-laying and incubation stage appears to be the period most vulnerable to nest predation. Having sufficient food supplies during this period may well represent a means to minimise substantial losses to predation.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nestling growth</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Supplementary feeding of parent reed warblers resulted in an increased rate of nestling growth. Nestlings of food-supplemented parents weighed 0.5 g (± 0.2) more at day six than nestlings of unsupplemented parents, which could be explained by more rapid growth or heavier stomach contents due to earlier feeding before being measured [
   <a rid="pone.0159933.ref062" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref062">62</a>]. Increases in food abundance, parental investment and predation have all been shown to modify nestling growth rate in 
   <span class="italic">Acrocephalus</span> warblers [
   <a rid="pone.0159933.ref063" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref063">63</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0159933.ref065" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref065">65</a>]. Likewise, the offspring of supplementally fed great tits grew faster than control nestlings [
   <a rid="pone.0159933.ref066" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref066">66</a>]. Greater prey availability for parents is therefore likely to increase nestling growth rates, which could accelerate fledging and thus reduce the period of vulnerability to predation and adverse weather conditions. Nestling reed warblers normally fledge after 10–11 days but are able to jump from the nest to evade predators from day seven [
   <a rid="pone.0159933.ref067" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref067">67</a>]. Given the high rates of predation in wetlands [
   <a rid="pone.0159933.ref068" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref068">68</a>], adaptations to reduce the period of nestling vulnerability are likely to be strongly favoured by selection.
