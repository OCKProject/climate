 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Egg predation occurs much less frequently in supplementally fed nests than in control nests. Furthermore, the depredated control nests were subject to complete predation of the whole clutch, while the one supplemented nest only lost two eggs to predation. This difference may be explained by different nest attendance rates between treatment groups, with supplemented parent reed warblers spending less time foraging, reducing the frequency and duration of eggs being undefended, and uncovered by the well-camouflaged parent [

  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref061" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref061">61</a>], as a strategy to reduce the period of nesting to minimise vulnerability to predation and maximise opportunities to multi-brood. As no nestling predation was observed in this study, the egg-laying and incubation stage appears to be the period most vulnerable to nest predation. Having sufficient food supplies during this period may well represent a means to minimise substantial losses to predation.
