 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">European wetlands currently provide abundant prey resources for breeding wetland migrants, but it is predicted that climate warming will further increase overall prey abundance [

To investigate the effects of such climate-driven increases and phenological advances in food availability, in the present study individual breeding pairs received either an unlimited food supply or natural food availability under current climate conditions. The results suggest that reed warblers advance the initiation of first broods in response to earlier onset of suitable foraging and nesting conditions, whereas clutch size, incubation duration and hatching success were not directly affected by additional food. First brood productivity was higher in food supplemented treatment groups, which is due to lower rates of predation. Further research is needed to test the possibility that offspring survival and recruitment may be increased through lower predation and earlier fledging of supplemented nests. Despite their access to extensive periods of abundant invertebrate food throughout the breeding period, the success rate of subsequent breeding attempts in reed warblers is low (â‰¤30% [
