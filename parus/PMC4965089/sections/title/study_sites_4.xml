 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two wetland locations in South Wales, UK, were used for the study. Cardiff Bay Wetland Reserve (CBWR; 51° 27’ 32” N, 3° 10’ 11” W) is a four-hectare wetland consisting of mixed scrub habitat, open pools and large areas of 
  <span class="italic">Phragmites australis</span> reedbed. Cosmeston Lakes Country Park (CLCP, 51° 24′ 53″ N 3° 6′ 0″ W) supports two adjacent small reedbed sites (with a total area of approximately 1.5 hectares) separated by 200 m of freshwater lake habitat. Both sites are publicly owned and access was arranged through the local authority.
