 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Supplemental food advances the laying date by up to 5.6 (± 0.3) days during the warmest mean April temperatures. These results are consistent with observational studies of reed warblers [
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref031">31</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref040">40</a>], where earlier breeding was associated with warmer May to July temperatures. Continental European populations of reed warbler have been reported to be laying 18 days earlier over the last 33 years [
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref031">31</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref041">41</a>], but it has been unclear whether the primary driver behind earlier laying is the faster growth of nesting vegetation, or the earlier rise in availability of invertebrate prey. The relationship identified between later laying dates and higher values of invertebrate availability and reed height is likely to be correlated with time rather than more invertebrate prey and higher reeds driving later breeding. The significant food supplementation effect on laying phenology in our study suggests that laying date is constrained by food availability, as birds in both treatments were exposed to the same 
  <span class="italic">Phragmites</span> growth conditions. It is likely that reed warblers may only be able to advance their laying date in response to increased food availability if reed growth phenology (which is limited by spring temperatures [
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref042">42</a>]) has advanced sufficiently to provide habitat suitable for earlier nest building.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Consistent with our findings, experimental increases in food availability are associated with earlier breeding dates in other passerine birds, including Eurasian blue tit [
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref043">43</a>]; great tit, 
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span> [
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref044">44</a>], common starling, 
  <span class="italic">Sturnus vulgaris</span> [
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref045">45</a>]; and European blackbird, 
  <span class="italic">Turdus merula</span> [
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref046">46</a>]. Many of these species rely on highly seasonal prey resources (e.g. caterpillars) and therefore risk mismatch between supply and demand if they nest too late. This is less likely for reed warblers, which feed their young on a diverse range of invertebrate prey populations which emerge sequentially throughout the summer, resulting in a prolonged period of high abundance without any clear peak [
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref047">47</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0159933.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0159933.ref050">50</a>]. Instead, reed warblers may be taking advantage of the higher abundance of invertebrates and earlier reed growth under warmer spring conditions to maximise fitness of their offspring by breeding earlier, enabling longer periods to acquire experience in foraging before autumn migration [
