 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Once the model performance assessed, it was used to identify sites favorable to the establishment of common reed through seeds, either based on current or simulated climatic conditions associated with various climate change scenarios. For this study, the periods compared were 1961–1989 (reference period with actual climate data) and 2040–2069 (simulated climate data; Croley 
  <a rid="b16" ref-type="bibr" href="#b16">2003</a>; Fagherazzi et al. 
  <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2005</a>; Morin et al. 
  <a rid="b65" ref-type="bibr" href="#b65">2009</a>). Simulations of river flows and air temperatures modified by climate change were carried out using mean values from the 2040–2069 period, commonly associated with the year 2050. The simulated climate data were extracted from two general circulation models integrating greenhouse gas emission scenarios, one resulting in very warm and wet conditions (HadCM3 A1FI) and the other under very warm and dry conditions (CGCM2 A21; Mortsch et al. 
  <a rid="b66" ref-type="bibr" href="#b66">2005</a>). Among all the climate change scenarios available for modeling (Mortsch et al. 
  <a rid="b66" ref-type="bibr" href="#b66">2005</a>), these two scenarios were the most recent ones providing hydrologic series for the study area and corresponded to conditions that differed most from those currently known for the St. Lawrence River sector under study. The hydrologic series with climate change data were only available in a quarter-monthly time step format.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each climate change scenario was associated with monthly temperature differences, also known as monthly deltas, between current values and those of the 2040–2069 period. From the overall number of climate models developed for small-scale gridding (approximately 400-km
  <span class="sup">2</span> grids; Mortsch et al. 
  <a rid="b66" ref-type="bibr" href="#b66">2005</a>), a unique monthly value was applied to the entire study area. Daily temperature data recorded at Dorval-Trudeau (1961–1989) were used as reference. The monthly temperature deltas were then applied to each quarter-monthly time step of the series measured at Dorval-Trudeau for the entire period studied. The monthly differences applied to the reference temperature data for scenario HadCM3 A1FI were, on average, 4°C, and ranged from 3.2°C (May) to 5.2°C (August). For scenario CGCM2 A21, the average monthly temperature difference was 3.0°C and ranged from 1.0°C (December) to 5.9°C (January). The beginning and the end of the common reed germination and seedling growth period, determined using mean daily temperature values, were recalculated for each climate change scenario based on the adjusted temperature data available in a quarter-monthly time step format.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Simulated data from the 2040–2069 scenarios were generated using the delta method (Croley 
  <a rid="b16" ref-type="bibr" href="#b16">2003</a>; Fagherazzi et al. 
  <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2005</a>) and expressed as hydrologic series. Water flows from the Great Lakes watershed were simulated by Croley (
  <a rid="b16" ref-type="bibr" href="#b16">2003</a>) and took into account precipitation, evapotranspiration, ice cover, soil humidity, and surface water runoff. The water flows were then adjusted according to projected climate differences (monthly deltas), and new predictive hydrologic series were developed, incorporating the influence of climate change scenarios on St. Lawrence River flows.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of four hydrologic series were used in this study. The first two series were (1) the historically measured (MEAS) series, corresponding to the data observed between 1961 and 1989 (Morin and Bouchard 
  <a rid="b60" ref-type="bibr" href="#b60">2000</a>; Morin et al. 
  <a rid="b62" ref-type="bibr" href="#b62">2003</a>); and (2) the comparison (COMP) series, developed using the same method as for the climate change series, but taking into account previous climate data (1961–1989; Croley 
  <a rid="b16" ref-type="bibr" href="#b16">2003</a>; Fagherazzi et al. 
  <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2005</a>; Morin et al. 
  <a rid="b65" ref-type="bibr" href="#b65">2009</a>). The COMP series was used to compare results with or without climate change, thereby identifying any biases associated with this comparison method. If the models were perfect, the COMP series would provide the same results as the MEAS series. The next two series, used for future climate conditions; were (3) the warm and wet (WAWE) series, associated with climate scenario HadCM3 A1FI; and (4) the warm and dry (WADR) series, associated with scenario CGCM2 A21. The MEAS and COMP series were roughly similar, but to fully understand the impact of climate change on hydrology, it was important to compare both climate change scenarios to the COMP series and not the MEAS series. Finally, to determine the impacts of climate change on wetlands, the model was initiated with reference conditions from 1960. Changes in the spatiotemporal distribution of the various classes of wetlands were determined by the hydrologic conditions associated with each hydrologic series (see Turgeon et al.
