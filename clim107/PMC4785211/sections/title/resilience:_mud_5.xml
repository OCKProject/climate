 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">‘Resilience,’ rather than gaining clarity with time, is increasingly confusing and ambiguous. Even before its use in the climate change lexicon, resilience as an ecological concept was becoming confusing due to multiple interpretations (Walker et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2004</a>). Despite initial understanding within the conservation community of climate change resilience as a limited stopgap strategy, its use and definition in conservation and policy has expanded widely (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>), thus according “resilience” a very elastic quality, from “the amount of disturbance a system can absorb without changing states” (Holling 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">1973</a>) to “the ability to anticipate, prepare for, and adapt to changing conditions and withstand, respond to, and recover rapidly from disruptions,” (Exec. Order No. 13653). Departing from the early adaptation concept of resilience (Millar et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2007</a>) and borrowing from the social-ecological systems realm (Folke 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">2006</a>), resilience now includes the full spectrum of climate change adaptation strategies, and encompasses the ability to 
  <span class="italic">resist</span> change, or absorb change, or 
  <span class="italic">transform</span> through response and self-organization (Carpenter et al.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Resilience is a positive, reassuring word implying strength, perseverance, and ultimate triumph over hardship, and any action may now claim to be one of ‘resilience’ in the name of adaptation. But is this catch-all label useful or is it a maladaptive term that confuses and impedes progress in climate change adaptation? Efforts to understand and address climate change impacts often bring together diverse assemblages of people from different backgrounds, sectors, and professional contexts (e.g., academic and agency scientists, engineers, adaptation specialists, land managers, policy makers, and public stakeholder groups), with attendant communication and linguistic challenges. Additionally, existing efforts illustrate that in response to the accelerating rate of climate change and its impacts, climate change adaptation best proceeds iteratively and collaboratively through science-management partnerships (Dilling and Lemos 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">2011</a>; Halofsky et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2011</a>). For example, a local-scale adaptation effort underway in the northern Great Plains includes actors from six federal agencies, two state-level programs, one academic institution, two tribal partners, and two non-profit organizations. Thus, the need to collaborate on climate change adaptation strategies at large spatial scales across management jurisdictions demands clear, commonly understood terminology, yet this elastic definition of resilience now renders the term as broad, vague, and uninterpretable as ‘naturalness’ (Yung et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">2010</a>). Decision frameworks for adaptation require defining conservation features, establishing clear management objectives, identifying necessary management actions, evaluating effectiveness, and revisiting and revising each step (Cross et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">2012</a>; Stein et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200" href="#CR200">2014</a>). The now-conflicting components of this expanded concept of resilience mean that objectives are simultaneously met and missed, depending on each stakeholder’s understanding of the term. At best, this expanded definition requires further specificity of sub-definitions to be useful in climate change adaptation (Morecroft et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">2012</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fact that the term resilience is common in everyday language further encourages divergent interpretations by, and thus confusion among, key stakeholder groups involved in climate adaptation, including administrative planners, conservation area managers, and the general public. Language matters, and popular understanding of the word resilience is “the ability of something to 
  <span class="italic">return to its original shape</span> after it has been pulled, stretched, pressed, bent, etc.” (Merriam-Webster.com 2014). For natural resources and land management, this understanding refers to 
  <span class="italic">existing</span> species, community types, and ecological processes. To many, a resilience strategy is a way to maintain historical fidelity and preserve current ecosystem states and processes in the face of perturbation (Higgs 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">2003</a>; Cole et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">2010</a>). Thus, expectations of a resilience strategy may vary from resisting change for administrative planners and the public, to fostering directional change for some adaptation practitioners. Both of these goals may be desirable, but using the same word for both outcomes will result in perceived failure for at least one group, potentially damaging (often-tenuous) collaborative relationships.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ongoing climate change further challenges the popular understanding of resilience by making it increasingly difficult to maintain both ecological patterns and processes on the landscape. Maintenance of ecological process in a changing world will often mean a change in patterns (e.g., community composition) on the landscape; conversely, maintaining current or historical species patterns may require intervention in ecological processes. For example, in areas where specific wildlife species depend on local vegetative biomass production (ecological process) for food, maintenance of adequate forage in the future may require a change in vegetation composition (pattern), whereas retention of historical plant species (adapted to past conditions) may cause a decline in biomass production and subsequent change in the wildlife community. As another example, wildfire activity and impacts in the western U.S. are already changing due in part to warming temperatures and drier conditions (Westerling et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2006</a>; van Mantgem et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2013</a>) such that a goal of maintaining current species assemblages may require additional management intervention aimed at altering the ecological process of fire. Maintaining pattern and process may be especially challenging in protected areas established to conserve features of scenery, species, communities, and ecological processes, thus heightening the need for transparency regarding goals and inherent tradeoffs in all discussions of climate change adaptation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Transfer of a climate change resilience strategy from concept to implementation can also be difficult due to mismatches across disciplines and scales. Within social-ecological-systems, directed transformation of either or both the social and ecological aspects may be considered a resilience strategy. For example, the transformation of fish species assemblages found near a fishing village may require a transformation in the time, location, and equipment required to harvest newly abundant species in order to maintain a resilient fishery. Additionally, climate-mediated disturbance responses by human societies, such as behavioral changes and technological innovation, may occur over much shorter time scales than those required for ecosystem adjustment, such as the natural development of mature forests (Mace 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">2014</a>). Thus, these differences in the time scale of responses further obscure what may be meant by resilience.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With respect to scale, natural resource management has generally been a species-centric undertaking, within relatively small management units (&lt;1 million hectares) and over short time periods (years to decade) (Groves et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">2002</a>), whereas some recent definitions of resilience focus on ecological processes and functions at much larger (sub-continental) spatial scales and multi-decadal to centennial temporal scales (Zavaleta and Chapin 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">2010</a>). While management focus on ecological processes and functions across larger landscapes is necessarily increasing, management at the species level still predominates and is required in many circumstances, such as for endangered and culturally significant species. We doubt many local managers or stakeholders would consider a strategy that enables current species within an area established in part for their protection to migrate out and a new suite of species to colonize the area as achieving resilience.
