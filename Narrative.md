# Narrative

## origins

The project arises from a number of sources:
* PMR's anger at the closed nature of scientific publications (especially on climate)
* Simon Worthington and GenR (TIB Germany) making contact
* eLife sprint Cambridge 2019 - an oportunity to test prototypes.

## initial goals

### create dictionaries
Dictionaries linked to Wikidata and Wikipedia will be created for general and special terms for climate

### create open annotated corpus
Download the open access papers (e.g. 65K in EuropePMC, annotate them with dictionaries)

### extract snippets and data
When the goals and corpus are clearer we can collect and normalize methods, summary reports. If there are regular standard
embedded data and graphs extact into semantic form
