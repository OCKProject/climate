Despite recognition that climate change poses serious threats to species, ecosystems, and human communities, implementation of adaptation measures is not yet happening on a broad scale. Among different regions, a range of climate change trajectories, varying political contexts, and diverse social and ecological systems generate a myriad of factors that can affect progress on climate change adaptation implementation. In order to understand the general versus site-specific nature of barriers and opportunities influencing implementation, we surveyed and interviewed practitioners, decision-makers, and scientists involved in natural resource management in four different North American regions, northern Ontario (Canada), the Adirondack State Park (US), Arctic Alaska (US), and the Transboundary Rocky Mountains (US and Canada). Common barriers among regions related to a lack of political support and financial resources, as well as challenges related to translating complex and interacting effects of climate change into management actions. Opportunities shared among regions related to collaboration, funding, and the presence of strong leadership. These commonalities indicate the importance of cross-site learning about ways to leverage opportunities and address adaptation barriers; however, regional variations also suggest that adaptation efforts will need to be tailored to fit specific ecological, political, social and economic contexts. Comparative findings on the similarities and differences in barriers and opportunities, as well as rankings of barriers and opportunities by region, offers important contextual insights into how to further refine efforts to advance adaptation actions in those regions.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Adaptation</kwd><kwd>Adirondacks</kwd><kwd>Alaska</kwd><kwd>Climate change</kwd><kwd>Ontario</kwd><kwd>Rocky mountains</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009763</institution-id><institution>Kresge Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000243</institution-id><institution>W.

While adaptation planning within social and ecological systems is progressing (NRC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2010</xref>; Bierbaum et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>), implementation of adaptation actions is not keeping pace with an ever-increasing need (Archie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2012</xref>; Runhaar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2012</xref>; Bierbaum et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>; Kemp et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2015</xref>). To understand this &#x0201c;stubborn gap&#x0201d; between the perception of climate change as a significant issue and the development of on-the-ground adaptation actions (Betsill and Bulkeley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2007</xref>: 448), a growing body of research addresses the barriers and opportunities affecting adaptation (Bassett and Shandas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2010</xref>; Uittenbroek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2012</xref>; Lemieux et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2013</xref>; Kemp et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2015</xref>). Generally, barriers are considered factors that may hamper the process of developing and implementing climate change adaptation actions, but can be overcome using a variety of means and approaches (Moser and Ekstrom <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2010</xref>); opportunities (also referred to as drivers, bridges, triggers, stimuli) are factors that can promote, enable, or strengthen adaptation planning and implementation (West et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2009</xref>; Jantarasami et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2010</xref>; Engle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2012</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">Research on factors that impede adaptation actions has taken place at an international scale across a variety of sectors (Measham et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2011</xref>; Dannevig et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>; Broto and Bulkeley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2013</xref>; Aylett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>). While certain sectors, locales, or political frameworks may produce unique challenges for planners, managers and decision-makers working to address climate change, a core of common barriers seems to exist, including lack of resources (Lemieux et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2015</xref>; Aylett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>; Nordgren et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2016</xref>), lack of information (Aylett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>; Kemp et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2015</xref>; Runhaar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2012</xref>), lack of leadership (Flugman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2011</xref>; Hamin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2014</xref>), and competing priorities (Measham et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2011</xref>; Ellenwood et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2012</xref>). Within each of these general barrier categories, more specific factors emerge. A lack of funding is often cited as the top resource-related barrier, while insufficient staff and lack of time also reduce the capacity to adapt to climate change (West et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2009</xref>; Flugman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2011</xref>; Bierbaum et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>). Information-related barriers include lack of information at scales relevant to management (Jantarasami et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2010</xref>; Archie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2012</xref>; Kemp et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2015</xref>), difficulty understanding climate science (Nordgren et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2016</xref>), and the challenge of transforming knowledge into action (Measham et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2011</xref>; Aylett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>). Lack of leadership within organizations and agencies charged with adapting to climate change is a frequently cited barrier, while a lack of political will among government officials has also been noted (Hamin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2014</xref>; Aylett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>). The barrier of competing priorities may be a reflection of resource deficits, but may also indicate conflicting values, within an organization or at the community or governmental level (Aylett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>; Shi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">Despite the significant range and depth of factors impeding efforts to address climate change, research shows that planning and implementation of adaptation actions are taking place in many countries around the world (Aylett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>). Where such progress is being made, available funding (Lemieux et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2015</xref>; Shi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2015</xref>) and political and organizational leadership (Burch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2010</xref>; Measham et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2011</xref>; Nordgren et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2016</xref>) are commonly cited as key drivers, highlighting the fact that certain factors can either enable or impede adaptation. Other frequently cited factors enabling climate change adaptation include awareness of present or future climate change impacts (Tompkins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2010</xref>; Shi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2015</xref>) and collaboration and sharing of information between organizations and agencies (Juhola and Westerhoff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2011</xref>; Lemieux et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2015</xref>; Nordgren et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">The incorporation of adaptation into everyday action and decision-making within the natural resource management and conservation sector, specifically, has also been slow to emerge, despite the fact that many natural resource management agencies have high-level mandates to include climate change in policies and planning (Ellenwood et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2012</xref>; Kemp et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2015</xref>). Natural resource managers face many of the common barriers and opportunities discussed above, with lack of financial and human resources cited almost universally, especially by managers in state and federal agencies (Jantarasami et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2010</xref>; Archie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2012</xref>; Kemp et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2015</xref>). Despite these commonalities, there are some specific factors affecting adaptation in the natural resource management and conservation sector. Upper-level organizational directives may be unclear, leaving managers uncertain about what to prioritize or how to translate climate science into management initiatives (Archie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2012</xref>). Ecosystems and species of concern for natural resource managers often span a mosaic of land ownership jurisdictions, adding complexity to the process of planning and implementing adaptation actions (Jantarasami et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2010</xref>; Lemieux et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2015</xref>). As public land is often managed for multiple uses, reconciling competing and potentially incompatible land uses make implementing climate adaption actions challenging (Ellenwood et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2012</xref>). Additionally, as federal, state and provincial land management decisions must include public consultation, natural resource managers cite insufficient stakeholder support or public opposition as hurdles to implementation (Jantarasami et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2010</xref>; Archie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2012</xref>). Managers have also noted that the extensive scope of responsibility and organizational size&#x02014;of federal agencies in particular&#x02014;can slow the integration of climate change science into management policies (Archie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2012</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">Although a small number of studies do focus on the policies, processes, and organizations/agencies responsible for natural resource management and climate change adaptation in rural and wild landscapes (e.g., Jantarasami et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2010</xref>; Archie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2012</xref>; Ellenwood et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2012</xref>; Kemp et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2015</xref>; Lemieux et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2015</xref>), research on adaptation barriers and opportunities has largely focused on urban planning (e.g., Preston et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2010</xref>; Flugman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2011</xref>; Uittenbroek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2012</xref>), and coastal zone and water management (Biesbroek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2013</xref>). Additionally, research has most often involved single or neighboring regions and municipalities (Burch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2010</xref>; Dannevig et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>; Broto and Bulkeley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2013</xref>), leaving a need for comparative studies across contexts, particularly in addressing biodiversity conservation (Biesbroek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2013</xref>; Eisenack et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2014</xref>). Recent studies also identify the need to move beyond basic enumeration of barriers into a more nuanced understanding of the factors both within a particular context and across contexts to understand how they might be addressed (Biesbroek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2013</xref>). Research suggests that the &#x0201c;counterpoint&#x0201d; to a particular barrier may not be the most effective way to overcome it (Biesbroek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2013</xref>: 1125); for example, if a lack of human resources is cited as a barrier, simply hiring more staff may not help if the leadership and political will are not present to ensure that new staff are incorporating climate change into their work. Therefore, investigation of opportunities in addition to barriers adds important insight into what is actually driving climate change adaptation actions and how specific barriers might be overcome (Eisenack et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2014</xref>). Research, particularly qualitative inquiry, focusing on perceptions and experiences of key individuals in resource management working on adaptation is recognized as a valuable tool for understanding what is limiting adaptation and how efforts can best be advanced (Tompkins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2010</xref>). In summary, there is a recognized need for in-depth, cross-site investigation of factors inhibiting and promoting climate change adaptation, particularly in the field of natural resource management.</p><p id="Par7">To address these research gaps and provide a more nuanced look at barriers and opportunities affecting planning and implementation of adaptation actions to conserve biodiversity, we conducted a comparative study across four North American landscapes: northern Ontario (Canada), the Adirondack State Park (US), Arctic Alaska (US), and the Transboundary Rocky Mountains (US and Canada). These landscapes include two countries (Canada, USA), three states (New York, Alaska, Montana) and one province (Ontario), and each face different challenges due to varied climate change trajectories, political contexts, and social and ecological systems (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). By ranking barriers and opportunities according to perceived importance, and quantifying similarities and differences across the four landscapes, we sought to identify general as well as contextually-dependent factors affecting adaptation in these regions. In researching opportunities as well as barriers, we aimed to go beyond an investigation of what is not working to offer insight on factors enabling practitioners to overcome obstacles and implement adaptation action in each region. Building on a history of significant involvement in conservation in each of the four landscapes, study results and analyses inform work that the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), a global conservation non-governmental organization (NGO), engages in with partner organizations to develop practical strategies for advancing climate change adaptation efforts. This study also supports the development of cross-cutting &#x0201c;lessons learned&#x0201d; about climate change barriers and opportunities across regions. The impacts of climate change create increasingly challenging social, political, and ecological conditions across the globe which make determining how to move from planning to action ever more important.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Four North American conservation landscapes selected for this study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="267_2017_933_Fig1_HTML" id="d29e565"/></fig>

WCS invited individuals to attend these climate change workshops based on their expertize, experience and influence in their respective regions. Some workshop participants were directly engaged in natural resource management and decision-making, whereas others conducted research, education and policy work supporting natural resource management.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Survey</title><p id="Par11">We sent a web-based questionnaire to all individuals invited to participate in the workshops (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;165), within two years after the workshops. We chose a web-based survey as it allowed for branching and skipping questions and made it possible to tailor a single survey to four regions (Sexton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2011</xref>). We contacted respondents at their work e-mail addresses and used a standard four-wave design (Dillman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2000</xref>). The questionnaire was divided into two main parts: (1) a workshop evaluation for those participants who attended, including a segment on adaptation action taken since each meeting; and (2) a section for all respondents to rank the perceived level of importance of various barriers and opportunities affecting adaptation in practice, with a specific section on collaboration. In this paper, we present the results from the second part of the survey.</p><p id="Par12">We developed the questionnaire (Appendix 1) based on a review of evaluations after each workshop, a review of the climate change literature, and discussions with natural resource professionals in order to create a list of potential barriers and opportunities to adaptation practice. To elicit responses uninfluenced by the content of forced-choice questions, sections on barriers and opportunities began with open-ended questions on climate change. We provided lists of barriers and opportunities and asked participants to rate the current importance of each in affecting progress made by them, or their organizations, in addressing climate change.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Interviews</title><p id="Par13">We conducted ten semi-structured interviews after the survey was administered to further investigate collaboration, progress within the phases of climate change adaptation, and highly ranked barriers and opportunities (Appendix 2).

We ranked barriers and opportunities for combined regions as well as for individual regions. Where &#x0201c;very important&#x0201d; scores were equal between barriers or opportunities, we used &#x0201c;important&#x0201d; scores to break the tie. For results and discussion, we refer to rankings instead of raw scores to show how barrier scores compared to one another within each landscape. We coded open-ended questions to identify patterns and themes, and ranked the themes according to their frequency in responses.

Due to the non-random sampling used to select the study regions as well as the survey and interview participants, results from this study may not be generalizable across all agencies, organizations or regions; yet, experiences and lessons learned can inform climate change priorities in these landscapes and should have application for other organizations addressing climate change in similar types of landscapes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Baseline Information</title><p id="Par16">Of the 165 workshop invitees asked to complete the survey, 97 (59%) completed the entire survey, a typical result for a setting in which participants are vested (Dillman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2000</xref>). Thirty-five percent of completed surveys were from the Adirondacks, 29% from Ontario&#x02019;s Northern Boreal, 22% from the Transboundary Rockies, and 14% from Arctic Alaska. Across all landscapes, 87% of participants responded that climate change is part of their organization&#x02019;s mission. Combined regional responses showed that 43% of organizations place significant emphasis on planning, 40% place significant emphasis on research, and 14% place significant emphasis on implementation. Emphasis on these elements varied across regions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Regional representation of emphasis placed on climate change research, planning and implementation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="267_2017_933_Fig2_HTML" id="d29e769"/></fig>

Our results provide insight into the most important barriers and opportunities to adaptation as perceived by a variety of managers, researchers, private landowners, Indigenous Peoples, and decision-makers in four North American regions and enable us to identify regional differences and similarities to further refine recommendations and influence adaptation action in these and other landscapes.</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>Regional Similarities</title><p id="Par54">Across the four landscapes, managers face common barriers to advancing adaptation, including lack of political support, resource deficits, competing pressures from land use changes, and uncertainty in designing management actions to address the impacts of climate change. Resource deficits, particularly funding, are frequently cited as a primary explanation for why practitioners have not begun implementation of adaptation actions (Moser and Ekstrom <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2010</xref>; Archie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2012</xref>; Kemp et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2015</xref>). While 79% of survey participants in this study considered lack of financial resources an important barrier, other barriers emerged as more influential in most landscapes, an indication that participants perceive more diverse challenges to adaptation. In particular, participants in all the landscapes but Arctic Alaska identified lack of political will and support as a top impediment to adaptation, particularly as it related to initial problem recognition, priority setting and allocation of resources. This finding is consistent with the international literature for urban and rural settings, which shows that a lack of high level government support can inhibit climate change adaptation efforts at local scales (Measham et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2011</xref>; Aylett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>; Lemieux et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2015</xref>). In our study, survey respondents in every landscape identified the challenge of sustaining political support for long-term action as one of the top two most influential barriers to adaptation action. Similarly, participants highlighted the difficulty of addressing the scale and complexity of climate change within the constraints of one or two-year funding cycles. Taken together, our results support other findings that suggest the short-term nature of political agendas and funding cycles has significant effects on an organization&#x02019;s capacity to implement actions to address climate change (Crabb&#x000e9; and Robin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2006</xref>; Ford et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>; Bierbaum et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>; Aylett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par55">Barriers related to climate change data and information, such as uncertainty of climate change projections and poor information transfer between researchers and practitioners are well-documented (Jantarasami et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2010</xref>; Murthy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2010</xref>; Kemp et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2015</xref>); however, these particular barriers did not emerge as influential in our study suggesting there has been progress in making climate change information more readily available, in these landscapes at least. More significant and pervasive across all landscapes were barriers related to understanding how climate change interacts with complex social, ecological and political dynamics, ongoing land uses and other changes affecting wild ecosystems, and identifying appropriate management actions in response to those interactions. This finding reflects the results from Aylett (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>), who found that barriers become more pronounced as one moves from general climate change information to understanding local impacts and formulating definitive management plans. Our interview responses strongly suggest that even when managers accept climate change as a critical threat to resources and ecosystems, the general challenge of &#x02018;not knowing what to do about it&#x02019; may prevent them from taking meaningful action (Jantarasami et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2010</xref>; Archie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2012</xref>; Kemp et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2015</xref>), especially if they simultaneously face other limitations, e.g., funding deficits, staffing and time constraints, and a lack of political support. Such findings indicate that barriers cannot be understood as isolated factors, but as interconnected and cumulative influences on adaptation action (Eisenack et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par56">In addition to perceiving common barriers to climate change adaptation, managers also identified a number of common opportunities that have helped advance climate change planning and action in their regions, including those related to government funding and incentives, collaboration, and leadership. Collaboration emerged in our survey results as being necessary to address the impacts of climate change, a finding supported in the social learning and adaptation literature (Collins and Ison <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2009</xref>; Lauber et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2011</xref>; Juhola and Westerhoff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2011</xref>; Eisenack et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2014</xref>). Without exception, interview participants corroborated the critical role that collaboration plays, particularly in enabling work across large landscapes, as well as in overcoming barriers related to resource deficiency by promoting shared resources, information and expertize (Burch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2010</xref>). The importance of collaboration is consistent across many natural resource management contexts where governments often formally or informally rely on other entities to achieve desirable management goals (Wondolleck and Yaffee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2000</xref>; da Fonseca <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2003</xref>; Hatchwell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2014</xref>). Reflecting these results, a number of organizations have adopted a collaborative and participatory approach to climate adaptation, bringing science and management experts together to learn about climate change science and use systematic planning processes to apply that science to management decisions (Cross et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2012</xref>; Littell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2012</xref>; Cross et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2013</xref>; Janowiak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par57">Political and organizational leadership also emerged as critical enablers of adaptation action, a finding consistent with other studies (Ford et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>; Bierbaum et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>; Eisenack et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2014</xref>). Our study participants identified leadership as important in terms of setting agendas, directing resources, leading collaborative efforts, initiating projects, and sustaining momentum. These findings suggest that leadership can help overcome barriers related to competing priorities, financial and human resource deficits, and lack of long-term support for adaptation. Interview results also suggested that organizational leadership can help close the gap between national policy and adaptation action at the local level, and may be a critical factor in shifting to new approaches and new ways of looking at issues that include climate change (Moser and Ekstrom <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2010</xref>; Measham et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2011</xref>; Shi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2015</xref>). The above results related to collaboration and leadership support the idea that strengthening the ability to convert existing resources into action can be as critical as finding additional resources (funding, time or information) (Burch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2010</xref>).</p><p id="Par58">The finding that particular barriers and opportunities are common across most or all landscapes highlights that certain factors can affect adaptation efforts regardless of the specific context or location. We suggest this finding offers support for the importance of cross-site learning. With comparative studies, the findings may yield more generalizable recommendations or principles for adaptation. For example, investing in efforts that lessen financial constraints, build and strengthen collaboration, and develop and support climate change advocates within organizations and agencies, in local communities, and at various political levels will likely help to promote adaptation action in all landscapes. Yet addressing only these barriers may not be sufficient to move from adaptation planning to implementation, due to the landscape-specific nature of other barriers, as described below.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Regional Differences</title><p id="Par59">Differences in how participants in our study reported barriers and opportunities across regions lend support for the need to also plan and develop adaptation efforts tailored according to specific contexts and the needs of particular landscapes. For example, while participants in all of the landscapes identified the importance of barriers related to political will and support, those barriers varied across landscapes in their scale and nature. In the Adirondacks, a landscape composed entirely of state and private lands, highly ranked barriers illustrated the need for increased political will and support at local and regional scales. In that landscape, it will likely be necessary to invest in activities that can increase political support for adaptation among the more than 100 towns and villages in the region, as well as within the regional Adirondack Park Agency. However, in landscapes such as the Transboundary Rockies, dominated by federal public lands and managed by federal agencies, investments in political will at the national level may be relatively more important. In Ontario&#x02019;s Northern Boreal, where First Nations and government ministries are the decision-makers, participants perceived a lack of national political support as an influential barrier, a finding supported in other literature addressing integration of climate change adaptation in higher level environmental planning in Canada (Aylett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>). Consequently, strengthening formal provincial, federal and international policies and commitments will be important to integrating local approaches to adaptation and supporting internal networks for addressing climate change within Ontario. Understanding how adaptation can best be coordinated across jurisdictions and among different levels of government, and connecting high-level directives to local strategies and efforts will be essential to building, managing, and sustaining effective climate change adaptation in each region.</p><p id="Par60">Disparities among regions in the relative importance of challenges associated with understanding climate change impacts and translating the science into action should lead to differential investments in funding, research and monitoring across the landscapes. For example, in Ontario&#x02019;s Northern Boreal, investment in technology to better monitor climate and ecosystem changes appears important, while adaptation in Alaska may benefit more from providing Arctic-specific climate change information and strengthening climate change expertize within organizations. In the Transboundary Rockies and Adirondacks, priorities include less emphasis on research related to climate change impacts, and more effort on building practitioners&#x02019; comfort level with translating the science that does exist into practical management strategies. The decision-making process for investing in climate change work might benefit from considering more targeted approaches to climate impacts assessment that &#x0201c;first&#x0201d; identify the most critical information needs and the sensitivities of particular systems &#x0201c;before&#x0201d; analyzing climate change projections to evaluate risk (Brown and Wilby <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2012</xref>). These additional steps could help identify and prioritize appropriate local sites for management actions and evaluate the tradeoffs between multiple management options.</p><p id="Par61">Differences in opportunities among landscapes can also suggest appropriate directions for funding and adaptation efforts. Highly ranked opportunities in a particular landscape lend insight into what should likely receive continued focus. For example, in Ontario&#x02019;s Northern Boreal, participants rated increased access to data as an influential opportunity whereas participants from Arctic Alaska saw private funding as being important to their adaptation efforts. Opportunities considered less influential by participants may indicate areas that could be targeted to strengthen adaptation efforts in the future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Barriers as Opportunities</title><p id="Par62">Several themes that were top barriers across landscapes were also top opportunities, including funding, political support and leadership, and using climate change data to identify management actions. This finding is congruent with other studies showing that certain factors may serve as either drivers or barriers (Engle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2012</xref>; Uittenbroek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2012</xref>; Lemieux et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2015</xref>). The presence of particular factors as both barriers and opportunities may indicate that individuals or organizations in our study have been able to transform barriers into opportunities through creativity, learning, leadership, and/or use of varied approaches. In the Transboundary Rockies and Adirondacks, for example, organizations have been able to circumvent political and community wariness of climate change by framing climate change adaptation in terms of key regional resource issues. In the Rockies, framing climate change as a water management issue has garnered support from natural resource management agencies and the ranching community who have implemented actions to address declining snowmelt inputs to streams, such as the installation of low-cost and low-tech structures constructed from willow branches and other local vegetation. These structures mimic beaver activity and restore the natural water storage capacity of riparian and wetland ecosystems. In the Adirondacks, framing of the issue in terms of protecting winter recreation opportunities, a major economic driver in the area, has motivated groups to work together on addressing climate-related issues. For instance, three New York state-owned ski resorts (two based in the Adirondacks) have pledged to be powered by 100 percent renewable energy by 2030 and invest millions of dollars into making the resorts year-round destinations with ample non-snow related activities. Other landscapes and organizations may be able to incorporate similar approaches in their own efforts, corroborating the importance of sharing insights and expertize across regions and between organizations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par63">Priorities for conservation action in the face of climate change within a particular region must include an understanding of how climate change interacts with the myriad other forces affecting conservation of wild landscapes, and how adaptation can most effectively be carried out within the social, political, and cultural contexts that influence governance and adaptation decisions in that region. Fortunately, some frameworks have successfully helped practitioners integrate climate change planning into management actions (e.g., Gleeson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2011</xref>; Poiani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2011</xref>; Cross et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2013</xref>; Raymond et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2013</xref>; Janowiak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2014</xref>). Some decision-support tools, such as scenario planning (e.g., Weeks et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2011</xref>; Rowland et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2014</xref>), are useful for integrating climate change alongside other stressors and land uses, facilitating collaborative planning across disciplines and organizations. Further use of these methods and frameworks may help to address a number of the barriers and opportunities identified by participants in this study. In fact, our results suggest that within some landscapes increased investment in adaptation planning and the translation of existing science into management actions may be more effective at addressing key barriers than would investing in more or &#x02018;better&#x02019; science on climate impacts.</p><p id="Par64">By connecting networks of individuals, collaboration should enable identification, education and support of climate change leaders and advocates. In working with targeted advocates, particularly in areas with relatively less political, public or agency/organizational support for climate change, it may be useful to discuss approaches for effectively bringing climate change considerations into discussions and planning sessions with co-workers and organizational leadership. Broadening the reach of climate change planning and educational efforts to include other planning professionals, such as city, municipal/county, and regional planners and local-elected and regionally-elected officials, could also contribute to increasing political support for adaptation. As collaboration is an important tool for understanding local and cultural contexts, as well as for building capacity to mobilize resources and expertize to address complex natural resource challenges (Wondolleck and Yaffee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2000</xref>; Bodin and Crona <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2009</xref>), the effect of collaboration on adaptation planning and implementation will be important to assess throughout the process.</p><p id="Par65">Additionally, sharing experiences across regions using common terms for barriers and opportunities, as presented in this paper and incorporated from other research, will be an important next step for improving adaptation planning and implementation. Several opportunities exist for sharing these lessons, for example through climate adaptation networks and hubs such as the Ontario Centre for Climate Impacts and Adaptation Resources (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.climateontario.ca/">http://www.climateontario.ca/</ext-link>) and the Northern Institute of Applied Climate Science (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.forestadaptation.org">https://www.forestadaptation.org</ext-link>). Professional conservation, management and adaptation conferences, such as the National Adaptation Forum (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nationaladaptationforum.org">https://www.nationaladaptationforum.org</ext-link>) or the North American Wildlife and Natural Resources Conference (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wildlifemanagement.institute/conference">https://wildlifemanagement.institute/conference</ext-link>) offer additional opportunities for exchanging ideas on ways to overcome barriers and capitalize on opportunities to advance adaptation progress.</p><p id="Par66">Overall, our results suggest that there is value in exploring the specific factors that might enable or inhibit adaptation progress within and across diverse landscapes, so that limited time and financial resources are strategically invested to address potential barriers and capitalize on available opportunities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec26"><p>
