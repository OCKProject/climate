This species is highly dependent on alpine habitats, which are considered vulnerable to rapid climate change. This study aimed to assess the impact of climate change on potential <italic>L. muta japonica</italic> habitat based on predicted changes to alpine vegetation, to identify population vulnerability under future climatic conditions for conservation planning. We developed species distribution models, which considered the structure of the alpine ecosystem by incorporating spatial hierarchy on specific environmental factors to assess the potential habitats for <italic>L. muta japonica</italic> under current and future climates.

Future potential habitat for <italic>L. muta japonica</italic> was projected to decrease to 0.4% of the current potential habitat in the median of occurrence probabilities under 24 GCMs, due to a decrease in alpine vegetation communities.

Small sustainable habitats may serve as refugia, facilitating the survival of <italic>L. muta japonica</italic> populations under future climatic conditions.

Engler et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] predicted that 36&#x02013;55% of alpine plant species, 31&#x02013;51% of subalpine plant species, and 19&#x02013;46% of montane plant species in Europe will lose more than 80% of their suitable habitat by 2070&#x02013;2100. Sekercioglu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] predicted that approximately 30% of land birds will be at worldwide extinction risk by 2100. A study of the northern and southern range limits of British birds showed that the northern range boundaries of 59 species will move 18.9&#x000a0;km northwards on average over a 20-year period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">The average global temperature has increased by 0.74&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C over the last century, and it is projected to increase by a further 1.8&#x02013;4.0&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C by 2090&#x02013;2099 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. If a significant cut in global greenhouse gas emissions is achieved, temperature rise may stabilize at approximately 2&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C; however, even with this limit, a certain amount of damage is unavoidable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is thus necessary to assess the impact of climate change on species distributions to determine the extent of potential ecological risk, and to design appropriate conservation strategies for adaptive management.</p><p id="Par19">Reducing the vulnerability of species and ecosystems to climate change is an increasingly important conservation objective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Identifying areas likely to become important for vulnerable populations is necessary to assist their adaptation to climate change. Artificial climate change experiments, such as those involving rainfall and CO<sub>2</sub> manipulation, have been widely used to elucidate how species will respond to future climate change, particularly for plant species and communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Several ecological phenomena, including phenological change and advancement of spring events, which are considered to be related to rising temperature, have been detected in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, for animal species, it is difficult to detect signs of climate change impacts using artificial climate change experiments because of their higher mobility. Therefore, quantitative assessments that identify current and future areas of particular conservation concern for populations are required to facilitate adaptive management practices. Species distribution models (SDMs) have been recognized as a useful tool for assessing the impact of environmental change on the distribution of organisms, and for selecting natural ecosystems important for preservation and management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Although several advantages of using SDMs projections in conservation planning have been acknowledged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], the projections include uncertainties caused by such as variation of climate models (i.e. GCMs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The inclusion and reduction of uncertainties in conservation planning is, therefore, important to increase the reliability of spatial conservation planning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Montane and alpine species are expected to be considerably influenced by global warming (e.g., the American pika [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], the White-tailed Ptarmigan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], the Black Grouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]). In particular, alpine plants and animals in Japan are considered to be vulnerable to climate change, because they already inhabit mountain tops, and consequently cannot shift to higher elevation refuges in response to global warming. The Rock Ptarmigan <italic>Lagopus muta</italic>, which has low fecundity, high survival, a long generation time, and slow population recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], is adapted to arctic and alpine environments, with some southern populations being isolated in alpine habitats as relicts of the glacial epoch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In the Swiss Alps, Revermann et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] predicted that up to two-thirds of potential <italic>L. muta helvetica</italic> habitat will be lost by 2070 and showed that potential habitat would shift toward mountaintops by using several statistical modeling approaches, including species distribution models. Consistent with this prediction, in some regions of the Swiss Alps, volunteer observers have increasingly recorded Ptarmigans at higher elevations over the last three decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In Europe, <italic>L. muta</italic> populations are likely to decline under warming scenarios, with a projected 54% decline in suitable climate space from the present to the 2080s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">According to the IUCN Red List, the worldwide status of <italic>L. muta</italic> is of least concern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, in Japan, populations of the subspecies (<italic>L. muta japonica</italic>) have already become extinct in some mountain areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In the 1980s, the population of <italic>L. muta japonica</italic> was estimated at 3000 birds. In the northern part of Japan&#x02019;s Southern Alps, the number of breeding pairs declined by ~&#x02009;50% from 1981 to 2004 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In addition, there is concern that the grazing impacts of increasing Sika deer <italic>Cervus nippon</italic> populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], along with an increase in montane terrestrial predators, will negatively affect the flora and fauna of the alpine zone. As a consequence, the ranking of <italic>L. muta japonica</italic> was raised from vulnerable to endangered in the Japanese Red List revised in August 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. On the basis of the law for the conservation of endangered wild fauna and flora species, the Ministry of the Environment introduced a program for the conservation of <italic>L. muta japonica</italic> in October 2012. In central Japan, the subspecies <italic>L. muta japonica</italic> inhabits the mountain alpine zone, which represents the southernmost limit of the global distribution of this species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. <italic>L. muta japonica</italic> uses the Japanese stone pine (<italic>Pinus pumila</italic>), which is a dominant alpine zone shrub species, as nesting sites and shelters from predators. <italic>L. muta japonica</italic> mainly feeds in alpine fellfields and snowbed grasslands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Consequently, this species is highly dependent on alpine habitats, which are considered vulnerable to rapid climate change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Therefore, <italic>L. muta japonica</italic> is hypothesized to be influenced by changes to alpine vegetation due to global warming. Of particular concern in this regard is the prediction by Nakamura that most of the available habitat for <italic>L. muta japonica</italic> would disappear if the annual mean temperature rises by 3&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">In the present study, to assess the vulnerability of <italic>L. muta japonica</italic> populations and identify sites for conservation planning under future climate change, changes in the potential habitat for <italic>L. muta japonica</italic> were predicted using an SDM, which describes how the alpine ecosystems interact with 24 future climate simulations. The results are expected to identify sustainable and vulnerable habitats of <italic>L. muta japonica</italic> in the study area, which could be integrated into the conservation planning for the species under future climate change.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study area</title><p id="Par23">The study site was a 20&#x000a0;km&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;30&#x000a0;km area in the southern part of Japan&#x02019;s northern Alps (36.25&#x02013;36.5&#x000b0;N, 137.5&#x02013;137.7&#x000b0;E), of which the highest peak is 3190&#x000a0;m (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The study area supports approximately one-third of the current <italic>L. muta japonica</italic> populations, and so represents a major component of <italic>L. muta japonica</italic> habitats.

In this analysis, we used the distribution of territories as occurrence data of <italic>L. muta japonica</italic>.

The dataset is calculated from meteorological temperature observations collected between 1953 and 1982 and precipitation data collected between 1953 and 1976. Four climatic factors considered important for forming alpine vegetation were used as explanatory variables in the species distribution model: (1) the warmth index, which is defined as the annual sum of positive differences between monthly mean temperature and +&#x02009;5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and provides a measure of effective heat quantity required for plant growth; (2) monthly mean daily minimum temperature in the coldest month (minimum temperature), which is a measure of extreme cold; (3) summer (May&#x02013;September) precipitation, which provides a measure of water supply during the growing season; and (4) maximum snowwater equivalent (maximum snowwater), which provides a measure of snow accumulation. Maximum snowwater was calculated by aggregating daily changes in snowfall, rainfall, and meltwater (degree-day method) based on the daily climatic dataset supplied from the Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System. Snow disappearance dates were derived from 10-day composites of Satellite data and climatic data for grid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Future climate change scenarios</title><p id="Par27">To assess the impact of climate change by incorporating the uncertainties related to general circulation models (GCMs), we applied 24 GCMs from the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3) multi-model dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] as future climates (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S1). The climate change scenarios were generated based on scenario A1B of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emission Scenarios, which assumed rapid economic growth, the rapid spread of new and efficient technologies, and a balanced emphasis on all energy sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The A1B scenario is most commonly cited as a high emission scenario in the Fourth Assessment Report of IPCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. We selected the A1B scenario as a possible future because we considered that we should assess the worst case first for the purpose of conservation. The A1B scenario is similar to between Representative Concentration Pathways 6.0 and 8.5 in the later climate scenarios CMIP5 in the Fifth Assessment Report of IPCC, which is second and highest emission scenarios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. We only used the data for the period 2081&#x02013;2100 because the fractional uncertainty for natural factors of internal variability (such as the El Ni&#x000f1;o Southern Oscillation, which occurs every few years or decades) is larger in shorter-term climate scenarios. Such internal variability is a noise for global warming prediction, which would emphasize or cancel the effects of greenhouse gases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The climate of the twentieth century experiment (20c3m) was used as baseline for current climate. We calculated differences in the means and minimum daily temperatures, and ratios of precipitation between 1961 and 1980 of 20c3m and 2081 and 2100 of the A1B scenario.
