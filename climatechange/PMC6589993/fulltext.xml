can be useful for studying climate change impacts, but it is unclear whether domestication to laboratory conditions has altered their thermal tolerance and therefore how representative of wild populations they are. Zebrafish in the wild live in fluctuating thermal environments that potentially reach harmful temperatures. In the laboratory, zebrafish have gone through four decades of domestication and adaptation to stable optimal temperatures with few thermal extremes. If maintaining thermal tolerance is costly or if genetic traits promoting laboratory fitness at optimal temperature differ from genetic traits for high thermal tolerance, the thermal tolerance of laboratory zebrafish could be hypothesized to be lower than that of wild zebrafish. Furthermore, very little is known about the thermal environment of wild zebrafish and how close to their thermal limits they live. Here, we compared the acute upper thermal tolerance (critical thermal maxima; CT<sub>max</sub>) of wild zebrafish measured on-site in West Bengal, India, to zebrafish at three laboratory acclimation/domestication levels: wild-caught, F<sub>1</sub> generation wild-caught and domesticated laboratory AB-WT line. We found that in the wild, CT<sub>max</sub> increased with increasing site temperature. Yet at the warmest site, zebrafish lived very close to their thermal limit, suggesting that they may currently encounter lethal temperatures. In the laboratory, acclimation temperature appeared to have a stronger effect on CT<sub>max</sub> than it did in the wild. The fish in the wild also had a 0.85&#x02013;1.01&#x000b0;C lower CT<sub>max</sub> compared to all laboratory populations. This difference between laboratory-held and wild populations shows that environmental conditions can affect zebrafish&#x02019;s thermal tolerance. However, there was no difference in CT<sub>max</sub> between the laboratory-held populations regardless of the domestication duration. This suggests that thermal tolerance is maintained during domestication and highlights that experiments using domesticated laboratory-reared model species can be appropriate for addressing certain questions on thermal tolerance and global warming impacts.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Acclimation</kwd><kwd>critical thermal maxima</kwd><kwd>CT<sub>max</sub></kwd><kwd><italic>Danio rerio</italic></kwd><kwd>domestication</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Swedish Research Council Formas</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100001862</named-content></funding-source><award-id>2013-947</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Research Council of Norway</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100005416</named-content></funding-source><award-id>262942</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Climate change is predicted to cause a continued increase in global water temperatures and increase the frequency and severity of extreme heat waves (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Meehl and Tebaldi, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">IPCC, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">Seneviratne <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). In some areas, this will impose stress on aquatic ectotherms as temperatures approach their thermal limits (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Doney <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Sandblom <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Thermal stress triggers a multitude of physiological acclimation responses within the organism in order to improve overall function at non-optimal temperatures (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Dietz and Somero, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Angilletta, 2009</xref>). This phenotypic plasticity can be advantageous to organisms living in heterogeneous environments and could similarly be so under a climate change scenario. However, the thermal acclimation process can be both energetically costly (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Angilletta, 2009</xref>) and come at a cost to fitness (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Krebs and Loeschcke, 1994</xref>) and maintaining the capacity to acclimate when living in homogeneous environments, such as in a laboratory, might therefore be disadvantageous and selected against. This means that using laboratory model species for experiments on thermal tolerance might underestimate the acclimation potential of animals in nature. Yet, highly domesticated species are frequently used to answer questions on thermal tolerance and global warming impacts (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Gilchrist <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Schaefer and Ryan, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">Paaijmans <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) are one of the most widely used laboratory species (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Meyers, 2018</xref>). A wide range of domestication effects has been observed in zebrafish, both between laboratory-strain and wild-caught fish (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Robison and Rowland, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">Whiteley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) as well in wild-caught zebrafish after being kept in the laboratory for only nine generations (<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">Uusi-Heikkil&#x000e4; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). These domestication effects include behavioural (reduced startle response), physiological (increased growth rate) and genetic (genetic changes related to growth and maturation processes) alterations (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Robison and Rowland, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">Uusi-Heikkil&#x000e4; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Laboratory zebrafish are able to acclimate to a wide range of temperatures, and under normal holding temperatures (28&#x000b0;C), they have an upper acute thermal tolerance that exceeds 40&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Cortemeglia and Beitinger, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Schaefer and Ryan, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Majhi and Das, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Morgan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). This makes it a practical species to address questions within thermal biology, and it has previously been used in such experiments (reviewed in <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000f3;pez-Olmeda and S&#x000e1;nchez-V&#x000e1;zquez, 2011</xref>). The zebrafish AB-WT laboratory population has been held in a controlled laboratory environment at optimal temperatures (26&#x02013;28&#x000b0;C) with low thermal variation and few thermal extremes since the 1970s (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Spence <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). It could therefore be predicted that laboratory populations, through decades of adaptation to laboratory conditions with no adaptive value for high thermal tolerance, have lost some of their high temperature tolerance. Wild populations, on the other hand, experience daily and seasonally fluctuating temperatures with potentially harmful extreme temperatures (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Engeszer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">Suriyampola <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), suggesting that high thermal tolerance is of great adaptive value for wild zebrafish. However, whether there is a difference in thermal tolerance between laboratory-held lines, domesticated lines and wild zebrafish is currently unknown.</p><p>Surprisingly little is known about the natural environment of zebrafish, especially regarding their thermal background. Zebrafish inhabit rivers and streams in India, Nepal and Bangladesh and have been found in water temperatures ranging from 12.3&#x02013;38.6&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Engeszer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Spence <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Arunachalam <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Wild zebrafish are therefore assumed to be tolerant to a wide temperature range and to have a high thermal tolerance. However, it is currently unknown what thermal safety margin (the difference between an organism&#x02019;s thermal tolerance and the environmental extremes) wild zebrafish might have. As thermal extremes increase in frequency, the shallow waters inhabited by wild zebrafish may reach temperatures above their maximum thermal tolerance leading to mass mortality. Whether or not zebrafish will be able to cope with future climate warming will partly be determined by their capacity for thermal acclimation. A greater understanding of the thermal biology and acclimation capacity of zebrafish both in the wild and in the laboratory is therefore urgently needed.</p><p>The aims of this study were the following:

In Experiment 2, we measured the acute thermal tolerance on-site in India of wild zebrafish collected at a range of temperatures, as well as of fish from the F<sub>1</sub> generation that were acclimated to a wide temperature range (10&#x02013;34&#x000b0;C) in the laboratory for 30&#x000a0;days. This allowed us to compare the acclimation capacity of wild and short-term domesticated zebrafish. To measure thermal tolerance, we used the critical thermal maxima (CT<sub>max</sub>) test, which provides a quick and repeatable measure of acute thermal tolerance in zebrafish (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Morgan <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec3"><title>Animal collection and housing</title><p>Zebrafish were collected in North West Bengal, India, from 12 sites at the foothills of the Himalayas, close to India&#x02019;s border with Bhutan and Bangladesh, in October 2016 (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4&#x02013;10 fish per site; <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).

A random subset of wild-caught zebrafish (F<sub>1</sub> generation, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;130, from the collection event in August to September 2016) were acclimated to temperatures ranging from 10&#x02013;34&#x000b0;C in 2&#x000b0;C increments with 10 fish acclimated to each temperature (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).

Two water samples per site were collected to measure turbidity<sub>NTU</sub> (nephelometric turbidity units, measured using a turbidity metre, HI93703; Hanna instruments, Limena, Italy).

The opposite result, i.e. that wild fish have a higher CT<sub>max</sub> than domesticated lines, has previously been shown in certain species of trout, where it was suggested that genetic differences due to domestication could have altered thermal tolerance (<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">Vincent, 1960</xref>; <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Carline and Machung, 2001</xref>). Indeed, daily thermal fluctuations and extreme temperatures, such as what many species of fish experience in the wild, have previously been shown to increase, not decrease, thermal tolerance both in zebrafish (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Schaefer and Ryan, 2006</xref>) and in other ectotherms (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Feldmeth <italic>et al.</italic>, 1974</xref>; <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Kern <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). It is therefore somewhat surprising that we found the opposite result here. The improved conditions in a laboratory environment (e.g. high water quality and no diseases or parasites) could provide an explanation for the increased thermal tolerance in the laboratory. This was speculated to be the reason for a similar increase in thermal tolerance in wild-caught <italic>Drosophila</italic> after being brought into the laboratory (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Krebs <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Diet is also known to modulate the thermal tolerance in fish (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Hoar and Cottle, 1952</xref>; <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Gomez Isaza <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>), so the shift from a natural diet to laboratory diet (dry food and artemia) could have increased the thermal tolerance. The laboratory-held fish were fasted for 24&#x000a0;hours prior to testing their thermal tolerance, while the feeding state of the fish in the wild was unknown (but no food was provided during the 6&#x000a0;hours holding period before the CT<sub>max</sub> test commenced). If the wild fish had recently fed, this could have reduced their CT<sub>max</sub>. In addition, the wild fish may have experienced greater handling stress than the laboratory-held fish and thus might have been more sensitive to the testing conditions. The site temperature in India was also only measured once at each site and during daytime. Therefore, the recorded temperature at the time of collection may represent the peak temperature and be an overestimation of the average daily temperature that the fish experienced and were acclimated to. However, since it was not possible to stay at each field site for a full day or return to the sites over different seasons we do not know the extent to which daily or seasonal temperatures fluctuated at these sites and the effect this could have on the wild zebrafish&#x02019;s thermal tolerance. Finally, the lower thermal tolerance in the wild could be due to a low genetic diversity at each of the sites. At 28 degrees, the wild fish tested on-site came from just one site, compared to the ancestral and F<sub>1</sub> populations that originated from multiple sites. However, we were unable to detect any differences in variation between the populations tested here.</p><table-wrap id="TB1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Environmental data from 12 collection sites in West Bengal, India, sampled in October 2016.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Site</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Coordinates</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Date</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Time</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Temperature (&#x000b0;C)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Turbidity<sub>NTU</sub></th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Conductivity (&#x003bc;S cm<sup>-1</sup>)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

there was no difference in thermal tolerance between the laboratory-acclimated wild-caught zebrafish and domesticated groups. The long-term domesticated line had the same, high, CT<sub>max</sub> as both the ancestral laboratory-acclimated population and the F<sub>1</sub> short-term domesticated population. This suggests that thermal tolerance is not a costly trait for zebrafish and that the domestication process may not have as strong effect on thermal tolerance as it may have on other traits. This is further supported by <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Stitt <italic>et al.</italic> (2014</xref>) who found that the thermal tolerance of brook trout (<italic>Salvelinus fontinalis</italic>) populations still reflect the historical adaptations to conditions in their ancestral sources despite being maintained for many generations in captivity. Furthermore, the population with the longest time in captivity (25 generations) had the highest thermal tolerance of all populations tested (<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Stitt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Possible reasons for why thermal tolerance has been conserved in zebrafish in the absence of thermal stress could be related to a potentially complex genetic architecture underlying the trait. Currently, very little is known about the specific genes involved in thermal tolerance. As a wide range of processes (molecular, cellular and physiological) are thought to be able to affect thermal tolerance; however, it is likely that many genes would have to be modified to see an evolutionary change (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Bettencourt <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, for example, a trade-off association between heat and cold tolerance has been identified suggesting the genes for these two traits are either highly linked or pleiotropic (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Norry <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). In addition, if genes for thermal tolerance are pleiotropic or highly linked to genes for other fitness traits that are under high selection pressure in the laboratory (e.g. fecundity and growth rate), this would further constrict evolvability and offers an additional explanation to why thermal tolerance has been conserved in the absence of thermal stress. Additionally, if evolution of thermal tolerance is a slow process, then zebrafish may not have been domesticated for a sufficient time.</p><p>High crowding densities and inbreeding are two conditions that are likely to occur during domestication (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Lorenzen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Both of these factors have been shown to increase the production and expression of heat-shock proteins (Hsps) (<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">S&#x000f8;rensen and Loeschcke, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Kristensen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">S&#x000f8;rensen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), and the expression of Hsps, in some cases, is correlated with an organism&#x02019;s thermal tolerance (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Iwama <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). This suggests that Hsps could be under stabilizing selection in the laboratory and provides an alternative hypothesis to why high thermal tolerance has been maintained under optimal thermal conditions in laboratory-held fish. Importantly, we only used one of a multitude of available strains of laboratory zebrafish. We do not know whether all laboratory strains or even all populations within the AB-WT strain will have maintained their thermal tolerance during domestication or whether this is unique to the specific population that we tested.</p><p>Acclimation temperature is commonly known to affect an ectotherm&#x02019;s thermal tolerance (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Beitinger and Bennett, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">Schulte <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Huey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), and this is what we observed in zebrafish both in the wild and in the laboratory. Even though there was a positive relationship between water temperature and thermal tolerance in the wild, water temperature had a much stronger effect on thermal tolerance for laboratory-acclimated wild fish (F<sub>1</sub> generation), suggesting the F<sub>1</sub> generation differ in their acclimation capacity compared to the wild fish. In the wild, zebrafish spawn mostly at the onset of the monsoon season (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Spence <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) during which time water temperatures could be low. If the temperature during embryonic development was higher in the laboratory-reared F<sub>1</sub> generation (26&#x02013;28&#x000b0;C) compared to in the wild, this could explain the differences in acclimation capacity (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Schaefer and Ryan, 2006</xref>). In addition, while the acclimation temperature was precise and constant for the F<sub>1</sub> generation, it was an imprecise measurement in the wild, since the thermal profiles of the sites are unknown. It is therefore challenging to compare laboratory acclimation temperature and site temperature.</p><p>Despite these uncertainties, the thermal safety margin (difference between acclimated temperature and upper tolerance temperature) was just 5.4&#x000b0;C at the warmest site in India and decreased with increasing acclimation temperature. Since our measurements were not taken at the warmest time of the year it is likely that the maximum temperatures at these sites can be higher. Indeed, zebrafish have been found in the wild at temperatures as high as 38.6&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Engeszer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). For fish living at the highest temperatures, this leaves only a very small thermal safety margin to buffer future warming events. Additionally, acute CT<sub>max</sub> measurements tend to overestimate the thermal tolerance, and fish show lower tolerance temperatures during longer thermal exposures (<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">Terblanche <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). This could suggest that the thermal safety margin can be very low in wild zebrafish and that thermal tolerance is under strong selection pressure.</p><p>The high temperatures that zebrafish likely experience in the wild could provide an alternative explanation for why high thermal tolerance has been maintained in laboratory populations. If there has been strong selection on high thermal tolerance in the wild historically, then the genetic diversity for this trait could have been reduced (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Falconer, 1981</xref>). Since genetic diversity is a prerequisite for evolution (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Falconer, 1981</xref>), lack of genetic diversity would mean that the trait would not evolve or is fixed. A low genetic diversity in thermal tolerance in the founding population of the AB-WT laboratory fish could be the reason why high thermal tolerance persists in the absence of extreme temperatures despite decades of domestication.</p><p>In India, the conductivity of the water where we found zebrafish was lower (62.3&#x02013;218.0&#x000a0;&#x003bc;S cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) than what is commonly used in zebrafish facilities (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Avdesh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). It is surprising therefore that a relatively small increase in conductivity had a negative effect on thermal tolerance. However, a follow-up laboratory experiment (&#x000c5;sheim <italic>et al.</italic>, in preparation) over a much wider range of salinities found that salinity had no effect on CT<sub>max</sub> in zebrafish. This suggests that the negative relationship we found in India was caused by a confounding factor (e.g. pollutants, turbidity and nutrient load) that co-varies with conductivity rather than being caused by conductivity itself. This is further supported by the positive correlation between conductivity and turbidity that was found in this study.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that thermal tolerance is lower in wild zebrafish tested on-site compared to in laboratory-acclimated and domesticated populations. The lower thermal tolerance and reduced acclimation response observed in India was likely due to environmental rather than genetic effects, but it does illustrate that wild zebrafish can be found very close to their thermal limits. If the lower thermal tolerance observed in the wild compared to the laboratory was due to some of the reasons discussed (e.g. diet, disease and stress) then we might overestimate the warming tolerance of wild populations if using laboratory experiments alone, and this does provide some cause for concern. Time in captivity, however, had no effect as CT<sub>max</sub> did not differ between short-term laboratory-acclimated and domesticated fish. Thermal tolerance therefore appears to be a robust trait, which has been maintained during domestication in zebrafish. Experiments using laboratory-kept species and model organisms may therefore sometimes be appropriate for addressing questions about the impacts of global warming.</p></sec><sec id="sec14"><title>Ethics</title><p>The experiments were approved by the Norwegian Animal Research Authority (permit number: 8578), and all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.
