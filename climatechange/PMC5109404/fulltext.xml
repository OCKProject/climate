This geographic, intraspecific variation could be of significance for range dynamics under climate change beyond edge-core comparisons. In this study, we did a reciprocal transplant experiment between the temperature-regimes of two latitudes with an ectotherm insect, examining the effects on energy metabolism and flight performance. <italic>Pararge aegeria</italic> expanded its ecological niche from cool woodland (ancestral) to warmer habitat in agricultural landscape (novel ecotype). Northern males had higher standard metabolic rates than southern males, but in females these rates depended on their ecotype. Southern males flew for longer than northern ones. In females, body mass-corrected flight performance depended on latitude and thermal treatment during larval development and in case of the southern females, their interaction. Our experimental study provides evidence for the role of ecological differentiation at the core of the range to modulate ecophysiology and flight performance at different latitudes, which in turn may affect the climatic responsiveness of the species.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Many species respond to current climate change by range shifts. Such effects are most easily observed at the expanding range edge<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Newly colonized populations at the range edge may differ in phenotypic traits from long-established populations at the core of the range<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Dispersive individuals that are more likely to colonize new sites can be a non-random sample of the population<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. There can be further selection on functional traits in new populations at the moving edge creating stronger differentiation between edge and core populations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Studies comparing phenotypic traits between edge and core populations have been helpful to better understand range limits and expansion under climate change<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, but changing climatic conditions may also change ecological and evolutionary responses across an organism&#x02019;s range. Therefore, distributions of phenotypic variation may also change at the core of the range and not exclusively at the expanding edge under climate change.</p><p>Several mechanisms contribute to geographic changes in phenotypic variation under climate change including phenotypic plasticity, mutations and evolution, evolution of increased phenotypic plasticity or invasion of southern phenotypes/genotypes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. The altered phenotypic composition may, in turn, influence responses at the population level and range dynamics at the species level. There is growing interest for studying phenotypic and genetic clines within the context of ecological and evolutionary responses to climate change<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p><p>At different latitudes, organisms are faced with different climatic conditions favoring specific life-history traits (or trait values). Such climate-related patterns are of particular significance for ectotherms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Along latitudinal clines, populations of ectotherms are faced with different activity time budgets and different trade-offs between current and future reproduction. As predicted by the metabolic cold adaptation hypothesis, metabolic rates of ectotherms (including many insects) from cold environments tend to be higher compared to those from warm environments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Usually, these patterns are related to selection on growth rates and development time. However, recent work on <italic>Drosophila</italic> showed an alternative explanation for the same pattern; selection for survival in highly thermally variable habitats could also drive the evolution of respiratory metabolic rate in a pattern that is consistent with metabolic cold adaptation, but independent of selection on growth rate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Independent of juvenile or larval growth, such variable thermal conditions may be highly relevant for adult activity and locomotor performance in individuals of ectothermic species at different latitudes, or generally in different thermal environments.</p><p>Here we are interested in biogeographic, intraspecific variation in energetic constraints and management in adult insect ectotherms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, and more particularly in flying heliotherms like butterflies. Their body temperature is strongly influenced by solar radiation, ambient temperature and wind speed through behavioural thermoregulation; body temperature will equal ambient temperature only in the absence of direct solar radiation. In temperate regions, values for the voluntary flight activity range lie well above the average ambient temperature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Most adult activities require active flight, but insect flight is metabolically costly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Average ambient temperature and solar radiation decrease with increasing latitude reducing the thermal window for butterfly activity. Moreover, weather conditions become more variable with increasing latitude, affecting potentially plastic responses and their evolution for energetic needs and physiological performance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Weather and its variability influence the occurrence of flight and inactivity and the duration of flight bouts in butterflies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Reestablishing metabolic activity to resume adult activity and coordinated movement is energetically intensive requiring significant quantities of ATP to restore homeostasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Hence, reduced activity budgets under more variable weather conditions at higher latitude can be compensated by an increased metabolic rate under conditions that allow adult activity.</p><p>Independent of latitudinal variation, different habitat types can also be associated with significant intraspecific variation in energetics and locomotor performance. Therefore, species with ecotypes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> differing in thermal physiology and mobility that occur at the same latitude are of particular interest in the context of climate change. Here we addressed the issue of habitat-related energy metabolism and flight performance at two different latitudes within the core range of the Speckled wood (<italic>Pararge aegeria</italic> L.). The range of this butterfly has expanded northward<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, but in NW-Europe it recently also filled its range by niche expansion from woodland to agricultural landscape<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Common garden experiments and reciprocal transplant experiments have pointed to several adaptive differences between populations of woodland and agricultural landscape origin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Woodlands are more humid, cooler and thermally buffered environments, whereas <italic>P. aegeria</italic> habitat in agricultural landscape is drier, warmer, but also more variable, and much more fragmented<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p><p>In the laboratory, we simulated a reciprocal transplant experiment between two latitudes by rearing offspring of females of both ecotypes (woodland and agricultural populations) at the average temperature of the northern latitude (Belgium) and of the southern latitude (France) according to a full factorial design. There is latitudinal variation in morphology (e.g., larger adults with latitude), but the steepness of the gradients varies between the ecotypes (e.g., stronger increase in size in agricultural compared to woodland ecotype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). We measured standard metabolic rate (SMR) and quantified flight performance (i.e., flight endurance, measured as distance flown under stimulation) and simultaneously flight metabolic rate (FMR) in a flight mill in order to test for sex-specific latitude and ecotype effects after larval development under northern or southern thermal conditions.</p><p>Because of the short adult lifespan in <italic>P. aegeria</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, weather-related interruptions of flight activity are assumed to be of considerable biological significance. Latitude-related constraints in adult activity budget and in higher synchronization of adult emergence in the north<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> lead to the prediction of increased metabolic rates in northern compared to southern populations. This effect is predicted to be stronger in males because <italic>P. aegeria</italic> is a monandrous species with an increasing degree of protandry in the north<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Although male behaviour differs between woodland and agricultural populations, there is no evidence of differences in SMR between males adopting different mate-locating behaviours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Similar to males, northern females are predicted to have an increased metabolic rate than southern females. However, taking into account ecotype-related thermal differences in females<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, metabolic rates could be more canalized in females of woodland origin (i.e., more buffered thermal environment) compared to females of agricultural landscape origin. We predict higher plasticity in metabolic rates in individuals of agricultural landscape origin &#x02013; which may interfere with latitudinal variation &#x02013; as thermal conditions in <italic>P. aegeria</italic> habitat in agricultural landscape is more variable compared to cooler and thermally buffered habitat in woodlands<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p><p>Females are the dispersive sex in <italic>P. aegeria</italic> responsible for between-population exchange and colonization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Female flight performance can be traded-off against life-history traits like fecundity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> and longevity (but in an ecotype-specific way<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). Males and females differ in flight pattern corresponding to different flight performances and energetic needs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. In another butterfly, the relationship between FMR and flight duration was indeed positive in females, but not in males<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. So, northern females are predicted to have stronger performances for flight endurance and corresponding FMR compared to southern ones as they have to deal with a reduced time budget to spread their eggs across suitable host plants. Hence, northern females should be more mobile compared to southern conspecifics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, but under the assumption of local adaptation, mobility may be compromised when reared under cooler conditions for southern individuals and warmer conditions for northern individuals. However, predictions are different for males. At low ambient temperatures, males principally adopt a territorial perching strategy, while they adopt a patrolling, searching strategy with longer periods of flight when ambient temperature is highest<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Both behavioural strategies require different flight patterns<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>; flight endurance, as measured here in a flight mill, better reflect flight performance during patrolling rather than for territorial perching, which principally relies on acceleration and maneuverability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Assuming higher specialization on perching in the north and in cooler woodland habitat compared to warmer agricultural habitat, we consequently predict lower flight endurance in the north, and particularly so in the woodland ecotype.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">2</xref> summarize the statistical analyses of SMR, flight performance and FMR (for all three we controlled for body mass, held as covariable in the models) relative to latitude, ecotype and developmental treatment for males and females, respectively.</p><sec disp-level="2"><title>Standard metabolic rate</title><p>As predicted, the results for SMR were very different in adult males and females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>).

Northern males flew shorter distances than southern males. In contrast, northern females flew longer distances after development under cool, northern developmental temperature, and <italic>vice versa</italic> for southern females, but the latter was only significant in females of woodland origin as there was no significant difference relative to developmental temperature in southern females of agricultural landscape origin.

The results for males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>) turned out to be more complicated with habitat specific effects but in interaction with the thermal treatment. Under southern thermal conditions FMR was higher in southern males of agricultural ecotypes compared to woodland ecotypes and in northern males FMR tended to be actually higher in the woodland ecotype compared to the agricultural ecotype. However, this difference was only true for males of southern origin and disappeared at northern thermal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>) explaining a tendency for a three-way interaction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).

These two-by-two correlations among SMR, FMR and distance flown did not differ across different latitudes and habitats (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary information</xref>). In males, the decrease of flight distance with SMR was similar at both latitudes (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary information</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we focused on mechanistic, ecophysiological insights into how conspecifics of different habitats (i.e. ecotypes) and latitude cope differently with energetics and flight performance after larval development under different thermal conditions. Our reciprocal transplant experiment under laboratory conditions with <italic>P. aegeria</italic> butterflies originating from two different habitat types at two different latitudes showed sex-specific effects of the influence of latitude and habitat type on metabolic rate and flight performance. Ecological context modulates physiology of organisms and affects their context-dependent performance through behaviour<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. We will discuss i) the sexual dimorphism in metabolic rate relative to latitude and habitat and the significance of context-dependent plasticity; ii) flight performance in the flight mill relative to dispersal (and other movements); iii) the potential link with the pace-of-life concept; and iv) broader biogeographic and life history context of range dynamics within core areas of distribution ranges under climate change.</p><p>As predicted, patterns of SMR differed between males and females. The main effect of latitude on SMR independent of the thermal developmental conditions in males suggests a contribution of the genotype as we worked with F2 individuals. Northern or Belgian genotypes had higher SMR in males than southern or French genotypes, as predicted. However, females responded very differently as there was no effect of latitude on SMR, but a strong interaction effect between thermal conditions during larval development and the habitat type of origin. Females that originated from the ancestral woodland ecotype showed a canalized response for SMR relative to thermal treatment both for northern and southern latitudes. Females that originated from the agricultural landscape ecotype showed a much more plastic response, with higher SMR after the warm, southern developmental treatment compared to the cool, northern developmental treatment. This result supports the idea of female-limited differences in the degree of phenotypic plasticity of SMR between the ecotypes. This difference was independent of latitude, at least at the spatial scale it was tested here. The mechanistic underpinning of latitudinal variation in metabolic rates is still poorly understood, but recent work on orchid bees indicates a significant role for flight muscle membrane composition in explaining variation in FMR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>.</p><p>Flight performance as quantified in a flight mill showed a sexual signature. The thermal treatment had no effect on the distance flown in males but southern males were more mobile than northern ones, whereas in females we found significant interaction effects between the thermal treatment and both latitude and habitat type, respectively. Flight distance was reduced if females developed under &#x02018;transferred&#x02019; thermal conditions relative to their latitude of origin. So, southern genotypes that were forced to develop under cooler, northern conditions flew shorter distances in the flight mill than after development under warmer, southern conditions, and <italic>vice versa</italic>. The only exceptions were females of southern agricultural landscape origin; they did not reduce significantly their locomotor performance after cooler, northern developmental conditions as did the southern woodland ecotype. The general pattern is largely in line with local adaptation, i.e. constraints on flight performance after a thermal, larval development that deviated from the environment of origin. This was most pronounced in females of southern woodland landscape. This result is interesting for studying the effects of climate change related-movements that may occur also within the core of the range, with southern types moving poleward; like French butterflies joining, and eventually, taking over Belgian populations. One could also note that the southern agricultural females performed relatively poorly under their natural conditions compared to the other groups. Anyway, our results lead to the hypothesis that the probability, success rate and speed to colonize or invade northern areas or populations &#x02013; also within the core of the range &#x02013; is likely to differ between the ecotypes<sup>cf.</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. In another study, flight endurance was found to increase with latitude in the butterfly <italic>Pieris brassicae</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, whereas we found an opposite pattern in <italic>P. aegeria</italic> males. This shows the relevance of the total behavioural context as males of <italic>P. brassicae</italic> are always patrollers throughout their range, whereas in <italic>P. aegeria</italic> perching and patrolling coexisted but in different proportions relative to latitude and habitat type<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>.</p><p>In line with the dispersal-related predictions, FMR showed a clear relationship with latitude in females only. Northern females had higher FMR than southern females, but without any signature of their ecotype of origin. In males there was a significant negative effect of age, but that was a covariate and not a factor of interest in our experiments; age-effects of insect flight performance at the physiological level are known since long<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Our results for SMR and FMR gave different patterns<sup>cf.</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> indicating that they cannot be interchanged as surrogates, opposite to results in several endotherms.</p><p>Particularly in vertebrate endotherms, several recent studies have interpreted latitudinal variation in resting metabolic rate within the context of the pace-of-life concept as an integrated mechanistic framework to understand variation in life styles relative to thermal conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Tropical birds were shown to have lower pace of life characteristics compared to temperate-zone birds at the inter- and intraspecific level<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. If we would assume a similar relationship between SMR and pace of life in butterflies, then latitudinal effects tend to go in the same direction, but at a much smaller spatial scale (<italic>c</italic>. 500&#x02009;km) within the core of the distribution range. Such generalizations should be cautious at this stage; the universal validity of using metabolic rates as fundamental drivers of ecological and evolutionary processes has recently been questioned<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> and the assumption of resting or standard metabolic rate as a proxy for energetic constraints may depend upon the general model of energy management that is applicable to the study organism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Although much of this work was developed with endothermic vertebrates as study systems, the issue of energy management in ectotherms (including flying heliotherms like butterflies) and what that signifies for the assumption of the use of SMR as proxy for energetic constraints relative to other life history traits and fitness components needs further attention<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Flight mills have been used before<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, but we combined this performance measure with respirometry as the mill was constructed in a climatic chamber<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Several studies on the evolutionary ecology of insect flight implicitly assumed flight performance to be unidimensional, but different flight types correspond to different performances (e.g., speed, maneuverability, endurance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). The performance in the flight mill corresponds to flight endurance, which is relevant for dispersal or other longer bouts of flight like in male patrolling behaviour to locate females. Hence, this device does not provide a universal proxy for flight performance. Earlier work has addressed maneuverability and acceleration capacity, which are more relevant to male territorial perching behaviour, rather than flight endurance per se<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. FMR showed significant heritability that was context dependent in another butterfly species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> and was influenced by genotype-by-environment interactions with temperature as relevant environmental factor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. As butterflies were tethered, one has to be cautious with the absolute values of our estimates of flown distances, but our principal interest is a comparison between ecotypes and sexes.</p><p>Phenotypic change of a local population can be as important as environmental variability to understand population dynamics at the local, regional or range scale<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Behavioural and physiological traits of founders can have strong impact on population traits of new local populations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Combining butterfly monitoring schemes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref> with phenotypic and genetic surveys at a wider geographic scale would be an interesting approach to better grasp the eco-evolutionary dynamics of range dynamics, beyond core-edge comparisons and providing much needed insights into the dynamics, admixture and replacements of southern and northern genotypes/phenotypes within populations across the organism&#x02019;s range.</p><p>In conclusion, our study provides experimental evidence for the sex-specific role of ecological context (i.e., habitat) to modulate intraspecific ecophysiology and flight performance in a context of range dynamics in an ectothermic insect under niche expansion. We demonstrated the relevance of studying functional phenotypes and performance at the core of the range in a context of climate-related range dynamics.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Species and study system</title><p><italic>P. aegeria</italic> is a Palearctic butterfly; in NW-Europe it increased both in distribution and abundance over the last few decades<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Females lay eggs singly on different grasses. Gravid females (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;44) were captured in nine populations: four populations in north Belgium (north; 51.0&#x000b0;N) and five in France (South; 46.3&#x000b0;N) along one longitude (4&#x02013;5&#x000b0;E).

Before the experiment, butterflies were kept in individual cages (30&#x02009;cm<sup>3</sup>), had free access to moist cotton wool and were weighted to the nearest 0.1&#x02009;mg (Ohaus Balance). Next, the individual was placed in a 25-cl transparent plastic metabolic chamber connected to a stop-flow respirometer with a CO<sub>2</sub> analyzer (Sable Systems Co) and with an internal thermoprobe (Physitemp probe type MT-29/1B connected to a Physitemp BAT-12 thermometer).

The individual was left in the chamber to acclimatize (25&#x02009;min).

CO<sub>2</sub>-free dry air was pumped through the respirometer system. Next, the chamber was closed for 10&#x02009;min and the CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by the resting butterfly accumulated. The chamber was then flushed again (flow rate: 1981&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;37&#x02009;ml/min; Sable Systems subsample TR-SS3 pump) and the previously accumulated CO<sub>2</sub> measured for 2&#x02009;min (i.e., until reaching an almost null CO<sub>2</sub>-level).

Analyses were done separately for males and females. Models tested the effects of latitude, habitat of origin (i.e., ecotype), developmental treatment and interaction effects. Age, temperature at testing and body mass were covariates. Full models of flight performance (i.e., distance flown) and FMR included total flight duration and testing time as covariates. The random factor population(family(paired larval rearing plant(larval rearing plant))) adjusted the analysis for the experimental design and pedigree (i.e., relatedness at the population and family level, common hatching date and rearing environment). Stepwise backward selection was applied selecting the minimal adequate model (keeping at least population(family) as random factor). We kept the model with the best fit based on the log-likelihood ratio test.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Van Dyck, H. and Holveck, M.-J.
