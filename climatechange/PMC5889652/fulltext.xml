Here, we examine the relative merits of afforestation, reforestation, management changes, and harvest residue bioenergy use in the Pacific Northwest. This region represents some of the highest carbon density forests in the world, which can store carbon in trees for 800 y or more. Oregon&#x02019;s net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) was equivalent to 72% of total emissions in 2011&#x02013;2015. By 2100, simulations show increased net carbon uptake with little change in wildfires. Reforestation, afforestation, lengthened harvest cycles on private lands, and restricting harvest on public lands increase NECB 56% by 2100, with the latter two actions contributing the most. Resultant cobenefits included water availability and biodiversity, primarily from increased forest area, age, and species diversity. Converting 127,000 ha of irrigated grass crops to native forests could decrease irrigation demand by 233 billion m<sup>3</sup>&#x022c5;y<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Utilizing harvest residues for bioenergy production instead of leaving them in forests to decompose increased emissions in the short-term (50 y), reducing mitigation effectiveness. Increasing forest carbon on public lands reduced emissions compared with storage in wood products because the residence time is more than twice that of wood products. Hence, temperate forests with high carbon densities and lower vulnerability to mortality have substantial potential for reducing forest sector emissions. Our analysis framework provides a template for assessments in other temperate regions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>forests</kwd><kwd>carbon balance</kwd><kwd>greenhouse gas emissions</kwd><kwd>climate mitigation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="gs1"><funding-source id="sp1">US Department of Energy BER</funding-source><award-id rid="sp1">DE-SC0012194</award-id></award-group><award-group id="gs2"><funding-source id="sp2">USDA NIFA</funding-source><award-id rid="sp2">2014-67003-22065</award-id><award-id rid="sp2">2014-35100-22066</award-id><award-id rid="sp2">and 2013-67003-20652</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p content-type="flushleft">Strategies to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions through forestry activities have been proposed, but regional assessments to determine feasibility, timeliness, and effectiveness are limited and rarely account for the interactive effects of future climate, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment, nitrogen deposition, disturbance from wildfires, and management actions on forest processes. We examine the net effect of all of these factors and a suite of mitigation strategies at fine resolution (4-km grid). Proven strategies immediately available to mitigate carbon emissions from forest activities include the following: (<italic>i</italic>) reforestation (growing forests where they recently existed), (<italic>ii</italic>) afforestation (growing forests where they did not recently exist), (<italic>iii</italic>) increasing carbon density of existing forests, and (<italic>iv</italic>) reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Other proposed strategies include wood bioenergy production (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), bioenergy combined with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), and increasing wood product use in buildings. However, examples of commercial-scale BECCS are still scarce, and sustainability of wood sources remains controversial because of forgone ecosystem carbon storage and low environmental cobenefits (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Carbon stored in buildings generally outlives its usefulness or is replaced within decades (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) rather than the centuries possible in forests, and the factors influencing product substitution have yet to be fully explored (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Our analysis of mitigation strategies focuses on the first four strategies, as well as bioenergy production, utilizing harvest residues only and without carbon capture and storage.</p><p>The appropriateness and effectiveness of mitigation strategies within regions vary depending on the current forest sink, competition with land-use and watershed protection, and environmental conditions affecting forest sustainability and resilience. Few process-based regional studies have quantified strategies that could actually be implemented, are low-risk, and do not depend on developing technologies. Our previous studies focused on regional modeling of the effects of forest thinning on net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) and net emissions, as well as improving modeled drought sensitivity (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), while this study focuses mainly on strategies to enhance forest carbon.</p><p>Our study region is Oregon in the Pacific Northwest, where coastal and montane forests have high biomass and carbon sequestration potential. They represent coastal forests from northern California to southeast Alaska, where trees live 800 y or more and biomass can exceed that of tropical forests (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1720064115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new">Fig. S1</ext-link>). The semiarid ecoregions consist of woodlands that experience frequent fires (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Land-use history is a major determinant of forest carbon balance. Harvest was the dominant cause of tree mortality (2003&#x02013;2012) and accounted for fivefold as much mortality as that from fire and beetles combined (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Forest land ownership is predominantly public (64%), and 76% of the biomass harvested is on private lands.</p><p>Many US states, including Oregon (<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), plan to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in accordance with the Paris Agreement. We evaluated strategies to address this question: How much carbon can the region&#x02019;s forests realistically remove from the atmosphere in the future, and which forest carbon strategies can reduce regional emissions by 2025, 2050, and 2100? We propose an integrated approach that combines observations with models and a life cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate current and future effects of mitigation actions on forest carbon and forest sector emissions in temperate regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). We estimated the recent carbon budget of Oregon&#x02019;s forests, and simulated the potential to increase the forest sink and decrease forest sector emissions under current and future climate conditions. We provide recommendations for regional assessments of mitigation strategies.</p><fig id="fig01" fig-type="featured" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Approach to assessing effects of mitigation strategies on forest carbon and forest sector emissions.

The largest potential increase in forest carbon is in the mesic Coast Range and West Cascade ecoregions.

Urban demand for water is projected to increase, but agricultural irrigation will continue to consume much more water than urban use (<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Converting 127,000 ha of irrigated grass crops to native forests appears to be a win&#x02013;win strategy, returning some of the area to forest land, providing habitat and connectivity for forest species, and easing irrigation demand. Because the afforested grass crop represents only 11% of the available grass cropland (1.18 million ha), it is not likely to result in leakage or indirect land use change. The two forest strategies combined are likely to be important contributors to water security.</p><p>Cobenefits with biodiversity were not assessed in our study. However, a recent study showed that in the mesic forests, cobenefits with biodiversity of forest species are largest on lands with harvest cycles longer than 80 y, and thus would be most pronounced on private lands (<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). We selected 80 y for the harvest cycle mitigation strategy because productivity peaks at 80&#x02013;125 y in this region, which coincides with the point at which cobenefits with wildlife habitat are substantial.</p><p>Habitat loss and climate change are the two greatest threats to biodiversity. Afforestation of areas that are currently grass crops would likely improve the habitat of forest species (<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), as about 90% of the forests in these areas were replaced by agriculture. About 45 mammal species are at risk because of range contraction (<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Forests are more efficient at dissipating heat than grass and crop lands, and forest cover gains lead to net surface cooling in all regions south of about 45&#x000b0; latitude in North American and Europe (<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). The cooler conditions can buffer climate-sensitive bird populations from approaching their thermal limits and provide more food and nest sites (<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Thus, the mitigation strategies of afforestation, protecting forests on public lands and lengthening harvest cycles to 80&#x02013;125 y, would likely benefit forest-dependent species.</p><p>Oregon has a legislated mandate to reduce emissions, and is considering an offsets program that limits use of offsets to 8% of the total emissions reduction to ensure that regulated entities substantially reduce their own emissions, similar to California&#x02019;s program (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). An offset becomes a net emissions reduction by increasing the forest carbon sink (NECB). If only 8% of the GHG reduction is allowed for forest offsets, the limits for forest offsets would be 2.1 and 8.4 million metric tCO<sub>2</sub>e of total emissions by 2025 and 2050, respectively (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1720064115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new">Table S6</ext-link>). The combination of afforestation, reforestation, and reduced harvest would provide 13 million metric tCO<sub>2</sub>e emissions reductions, and any one of the strategies or a portion of each could be applied. Thus, additionality beyond what would happen without the program is possible.</p><p>State-level reporting of GHG emissions includes the agriculture sector, but does not appear to include forest sector emissions, except for industrial fuel (i.e., utility fuel in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1720064115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new">Table S3</ext-link>) and, potentially, fire emissions. Harvest-related emissions should be quantified, as they are much larger than fire emissions in the western United States. Full accounting of forest sector emissions is necessary to meet climate mitigation goals.</p><p>Increased long-term storage in buildings and via product substitution has been suggested as a potential climate mitigation option. Pacific temperate forests can store carbon for many hundreds of years, which is much longer than is expected for buildings that are generally assumed to outlive their usefulness or be replaced within several decades (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). By 2035, about 75% of buildings in the United States will be replaced or renovated, based on new construction, demolition, and renovation trends (<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Recent analysis suggests substitution benefits of using wood versus more fossil fuel-intensive materials have been overestimated by at least an order of magnitude (<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Our LCA accounts for losses in product substitution stores (PSSs) associated with building life span, and thus are considerably lower than when no losses are assumed (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). While product substitution reduces the overall forest sector emissions, it cannot offset the losses incurred by frequent harvest and losses associated with product transportation, manufacturing, use, disposal, and decay. Methods for calculating substitution benefits should be improved in other regional assessments.</p><p>Wood bioenergy production is interpreted as being carbon-neutral by assuming that trees regrow to replace those that burned. However, this does not account for reduced forest carbon stocks that took decades to centuries to sequester, degraded productive capacity, emissions from transportation and the production process, and biogenic/direct emissions at the facility (<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Increased harvest through proposed thinning practices in the region has been shown to elevate emissions for decades to centuries regardless of product end use (<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). It is therefore unlikely that increased wood bioenergy production in this region would decrease overall forest sector emissions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s3"><title>Conclusions</title><p content-type="flushleft">GHG reduction must happen quickly to avoid surpassing a 2 &#x000b0;C increase in temperature since preindustrial times.

Forests are carbon-ready and do not require new technologies or infrastructure for immediate mitigation of climate change.
