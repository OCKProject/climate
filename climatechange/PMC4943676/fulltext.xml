This could result in a large-scale loss of ecological services and economical value in a changing climate. In order to evaluate the potential consequences of this drought-sensitivity, we investigated potential species range shifts for European beech forests on calcareous soil in the 21<sup>st</sup> century by statistical species range distribution modelling for present day and projected future climate conditions. We found a dramatic decline by 78% until 2080. Still the physiological or biogeochemical mechanisms underlying the drought sensitivity of European beech are largely unknown. Drought sensitivity of beech is commonly attributed to plant physiological constraints. Furthermore, it has also been proposed that reduced soil water availability could promote nitrogen (N) limitation of European beech due to impaired microbial N cycling in soil, but this hypothesis has not yet been tested. Hence we investigated the influence of simulated climate change (increased temperatures, reduced soil water availability) on soil gross microbial N turnover and plant N uptake in the beech-soil interface of a typical mountainous beech forest stocking on calcareous soil in SW Germany. For this purpose, triple <sup>15</sup>N isotope labelling of intact beech seedling-soil-microbe systems was combined with a space-for-time climate change experiment. We found that nitrate was the dominant N source for beech natural regeneration. Reduced soil water content caused a persistent decline of ammonia oxidizing bacteria and therefore, a massive attenuation of gross nitrification rates and nitrate availability in the soil. Consequently, nitrate and total N uptake of beech seedlings were strongly reduced so that impaired growth of beech seedlings was observed already after one year of exposure to simulated climatic change. We conclude that the N cycle in this ecosystem and here specifically nitrification is vulnerable to reduced water availability, which can directly lead to nutritional limitations of beech seedlings. This tight link between reduced water availability, drought stress for nitrifiers, decreased gross nitrification rates and nitrate availability and finally nitrate uptake by beech seedlings could represent the Achilles&#x02019; heel for beech under climate change stresses.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA 1217/2-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dannenmann</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KO 1035/41-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>K&#x000f6;gel-Knabner</surname><given-names>Ingrid</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SCHL 446/11-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schloter</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RE 515/33-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rennenberg</surname><given-names>Heinz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PO 362/19-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Polle</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work has been supported by the German Science Foundation (DFG) under the contract numbers DA 1217/2-1, KO 1035/41-1, SCHL 446/11-1, RE 515/33-1 and PO 362/19-1.

About one third of the potential beech forest area in Central Europe is located on calcareous soil that is highly susceptible to water deprivation. For future forestry in Central Europe, it has even been suggested to replace spruce by beech [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, beech responds to lower water availability with reduced growth and competitive power, and this apparent drought sensitivity of beech is a matter of current concern and debate [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] due to observations of increased heat waves and drought periods in wide regions of Central Europe [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This trend is expected to continue and intensify in the coming decades [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Two different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the sensitivity of beech to increased temperature and drought [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]: (1) tree physiological limitations; and (2) nutritional limitations due to decelerated microbial N turnover in soil, specifically due to impaired liberation and provision of bioavailable N by soil microbes. The latter mechanism may be of particular importance in calcareous soils and apply especially for beech seedlings with their restricted root system, because Rendzic Leptosols are poor in bioavailable N [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Furthermore, these soils are characterized by a shallow profile, high gravel content, clayey texture, and low water and nutrient retention capacity. Hence, bioavailable N released by microorganisms is frequently limiting growth of this forest type [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, due to the lack of experimental evidence, and a range of severe methodological problems in the quantification of gross N turnover in the plant-soil-microbe system, this mechanism remained a hypothesis.</p><p>Nitrogen mineralization and nitrification as well as the subsequent competitive partitioning of bioavailable organic N monomers and inorganic N compounds between the soil microbes and vegetation regulate tree N uptake in N-limited forests. There is now ample evidence that trees&#x02014;including European Beech&#x02014;successfully compete for organic N as well as for mineral N with free living microorganisms in a wide range of forest ecosystems with or without the help of mycorrhizal fungal symbionts [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Hence, trees can actively influence soil microbial N turnover processes by competing for the same substrates at several stages of the N cycle: (1) Trees may take up monomeric organic compounds such as amino acids thus limiting this substrate for microbial uptake of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and microbial ammonification. (2) Trees may take up ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) thus reducing substrate availability for autotrophic nitrification and microbial immobilisation. (3) Trees may take up nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) thus limiting microbial NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> utilization [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Furthermore, trees influence microbial N turnover in soil by the determination of organic matter composition via plant residues, thus influencing substrate quality for N mineralization [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and by direct carbon (C) allocation to microorganisms via root exudation [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Surprisingly, the recognition of the importance of plant-microbe interactions for gross N turnover has only rarely been reflected in experimental designs for quantification of soil or plant N turnover. In contrast, soil scientists usually determine gross N turnover rates in plant-free disturbed soil, and plant physiologists frequently deploy N uptake measurements with washed roots in absence of soil and soil microorganisms [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Such experimental approaches neglect plant-soil-microbe C/N interactions such as plant-microbe competition for N, microbial resupply of plant nutrients and plant rhizodeposition effects on microbial soil N turnover [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Hence it may be questioned if N flux rates determined based on isolated views of the plant or soil compartments are realistic. Studies interlinking both sides are less common and have been performed aiming at elucidating plant-microbial competition for N in different ecosystems like tundra [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], alpine meadow [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], grassland [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and temperate forests [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, these studies almost exclusively performed simple tracing experiments aiming at the determination of <sup>15</sup>N recovery rates in plant and microbial N pools rather than providing actual N turnover rates. Studies characterizing the competition for N between plants and microorganisms in a process-oriented way, i.e., by determining simultaneously occurring rates of microbial N turnover in soil and N uptake by plants are still very rare [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Thus, our goals were (1) to explore the extent of potential species range shifts of European Beech on marginal calcareous soils in the 21<sup>st</sup> century and (2) to test whether there is a soil microbial mechanism limiting beech seedling N nutrition and establishment and thus competitive strength under reduced water availability in a changing climate, potentially contributing to expected species range shifts on top of plant physiological constraints. Therefore, we conducted statistical species range modelling for European beech forests on calcareous soil for present day conditions and for the year 2080. In view of the importance of seedling establishment for species range shifts we assessed beech seedling performance under exposure to climate change conditions in a field experiment, thereby considering soil microbial community composition, gross rates of microbial N turnover, soil N availability and N nutrition of beech seedlings. For this purpose, we deployed an enriched stable isotope-based experimental approach to simultaneously quantify all major N turnover processes in intact beech seedling-soil-microbe systems, thereby maintaining plant-soil microbe interactions and competition for N. By translocation of soil-mesocosms containing natural beech regeneration across a narrow valley from the northwest (NW, cool moist microclimate) to the southwest (SW, warm-dry microclimate) aspect, we combined this approach with a space-for-time climate change experiment. In addition to exposure-induced reduction of soil water availability, a roof system accelerated drought during a 39 days period at the SW aspect. Supporting measurements included abundance of genes related to ammonia oxidation, mycorrhizal colonization and N metabolite levels in fine roots as well as plant biomass and isotope recovery in beech seedlings three months after <sup>15</sup>N isotope labelling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Statistical species distribution model</title><p>For the species distribution model we used presence/absence information for European beech derived from an international monitoring network (ICP level I&#x02014;more than 8000 plots with 1097 presence observations of European beech) as response variable that we combined with high-resolution derivations of precipitation and temperature from the WorldClim- database, which implies modelling the realized niche of the species. For the projection under future conditions, we used output from the global circulation model HADCM3 driven by the SRES scenario A2 [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] until the year 2080, which was calibrated and statistically downscaled to 30-arc-second tiles. We fitted a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with logit link function and calibrated the model by a stepwise selection using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) with five bioclimatic variables entering the model including: yearly sum of degree days above 5&#x000b0;C, iso-thermality, a yearly drought index, sum of precipitation in the warmest quarter of the year and the precipitation of the most humid month. As the threshold value for transforming predicted probabilities into binary presence information we used Cohen&#x02019;s Kappa. We used the area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and Cohen&#x02019;s Kappa to evaluate the performance of the model.

To validate the model we carried out a 10-fold cross-validation, for which we randomly split the data into a training and an evaluation dataset. The model appears to be robust with the cross validation means being very close to the model values and the variation within cross validation results being low (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0158823.s003">S1 Table</xref>).

Coring and Transfer of beech seedling-soil-mesocosms was conducted within one week in absence of precipitation in July 2010. For coring, a suitable sampling area of 50 * 50 m with identical slope (18&#x000b0;) and similar soil profile was identified. In this representative area, finer grained soil (Ah horizon) was only found in the uppermost 15&#x02013;20 cm (i.e., the main rooting zone of beech natural regeneration). There was a sharp transition between this almost gravel-free clay-rich finer grained soil and the deeper gravel-dominated periglacial layers which were not suitable for coring. In this sampling area, beech natural regeneration trees of 2.2&#x02013;2.5 mm stem diameter and 30&#x02013;40 cm height were selected. Custom-made stainless steel cylinders (height 150 mm, outer diameter 168 mm, sharp edge at bottom, wall thickness 2 mm, open at bottom and top) were manually driven into the soil with the selected beech seedling growing in the centre. A custom-made extension tool fitting to the stainless steel cylinders facilitated coring under avoidance of damage to the aboveground part of the plant. After coring, the cylinders, containing an intact beech-soil-mesocosm, were carefully excavated under preservation of an even ending at the bottom. Excavated beech-soil-mesocosms were immediately reburied vertically either within NW or after transfer to SW. The litter layer was preserved and contained in the cylinders during coring. Pre-tests showed that the entire root system of beech seedlings of this size fitted well to the embraced volume of the used steel cylinders. Only mesocosms without visible damage or cut beech roots were used.</p><p>While reburying beech-soil-mesocosms, extreme care was taken to create a realistic transition between the bottom of the soil cores and the ambient soil. For this purpose, beech-soil-mesocosms were placed vertically in holes with a 5 cm thick horizontal bed made of homogenized NW soil and subsequently gently hammered down 2 cm at the new position. Finally, continuous contact between the litter layer on the transferred beech-soil-mesocosms and the surrounding litter layer at the new position was established. After transfer, all reburied intact beech-soil-mesocosms at both sites were irrigated with 500 ml of water over a period of two hours to avoid drying or death of enclosed beech seedlings following transfer. The amount of water corresponded to a precipitation event of 23.7 l m<sup>-2</sup>, i.e., a typical summer convective rainfall event. The survival rate of transferred beech seedlings was 97%.</p><p>Ten further beech-soil-mesocosms were transferred (5 within the NW slope, 5 to the SW slope) to monitor soil temperature and soil moisture in 5 cm depth in the mesocosms (n = 5 each slope) using horizontally installed combined soil moisture/temperature probes (DECAGON EC-5, Decagon Devices, Inc., Pullman, USA) with an hourly temporal resolution.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Isotope labelling of beech seedling-soil-mesocosms</title><p>In order to facilitate the simultaneous quantification of gross rates of all major N turnover processes in the beech-soil-microbe system, the intact soil-root-mesocosms were labelled with either <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>13</sup>C-enriched glutamine, <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> or <sup>15</sup>NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. To enable homogeneous distribution of isotopes in the root-soil system, we applied an isotope injection method developed for large soil cores [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and optimized and adapted it for the Tuttlingen soil. For this purpose, we conducted pre-experiments in March 2011 using Brilliant Blue FCF colour dye instead of <sup>15</sup>N enriched label solution. Various injection patterns and depths, numbers of injections per mesocosm and solution volumes per single injection were tested to achieve homogeneous 3-dimensional distribution of label solution in the soil-root-system at minimized amounts of injected liquid to minimize label artefacts such as stimulation of N turnover and leakage of labeled solution at the bottom of the beech-soil-mesocosms. In this pre-experiment, mesocosms were harvested one day after dye application by removing soil stepwise from bottom to top in layers of 2 cm. The distribution of the colour dye in the soil was monitored visually. Outflow at the bottom of the labelled beech-soil-mesocosms was examined by storing the beech-soil-mesocosms on white paper sheets. To inject dye and later <sup>15</sup>N solution we used custom-made stainless steel side port cannulas with lasered depth check marks. In this labelling optimization experiment the following setup facilitated homogeneous colour dye distribution with only minimal leakage: 16 single amounts of 3 ml solution each were injected into the beech seedling-soil-mesocosms to a depth of 1 and 3 cm each, and another 8 injections of 3 ml each to a depth of 6 cm. Additionally, 10 ml of <sup>15</sup>N-labelled solution were homogeneously spread on top of the soil surface. Hence, the total amount of added label solution was 130 ml, applied to 2.3 kg dry soil contained on average in the beech-soil-mesocosms. Paper calibres indicating injection patterns and depths were constructed to fit onto the stainless steel cylinders in order to ensure reproducible labelling. Before <sup>15</sup>N-labelling, the litter layer was removed from the top of the soil surface and later replaced. An earlier study showed that the litter layer is of very minor significance for N nutrition of beech natural regeneration [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>Labelling was conducted simultaneously at NW and SW starting at 5:00 am and took 3 hours (June) and 2 hours (August). The label solution always contained all three N compounds used in this experiment, i.e., NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and glutamine, and depending on the labelling treatment, either NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> or glutamine was isotopically enriched (50 atom % <sup>15</sup>N). Glutamine was also enriched in <sup>13</sup>C (50 atom%) <sup>13</sup>C for glutamine). Glutamine was chosen as an organic N compound because earlier studies showed high glutamine uptake capacities of and abundance in beech seedlings and adult beech trees at this site [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

Soil NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> background concentrations in unlabeled soil were hardly different between NW and SW. However, background soil NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations were generally much smaller at SW than at NW. Therefore, the ratio of added NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>-N via label solution to background soil NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> was larger for SW than for NW. In June, N added via label solution equalled to 76% and 80% of ambient NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> concentrations and 35% and 78% of ambient NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations at NW and SW, respectively. In August, this equalled 84% and 114% of ambient soil NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> concentrations. However, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> levels were extremely low at SW, so that added label equalled to 211% and 762% of ambient NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations at NW and SW, respectively. Hence, several-fold reduced soil NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> levels were observed both in unlabelled mesocosms and in labelled mesocosms of the climate change treatment.</p><p>Mean total <sup>15</sup>N isotope recovery (sum of extractable and non-extractable soil N pools plus plant N pools) six hours after isotope application was 74&#x000b1;4% (standard error of the mean) after <sup>15</sup>N glutamine labelling, 86&#x000b1;5% after <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> labelling, and 61&#x000b1;4% after <sup>15</sup>NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> labelling.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Beech-soil-mesocosm harvest and sample preparation</title><p>Eight intact beech-soil-mesocosms were harvested every sampling point for each of the three N-compound labelling treatments and each of the two slopes (NW exposure, control treatment and SW exposure, climate change treatment).

Durbin-Watson test statistics revealed absence of autocorrelation between time points. Depending on the parameters investigated, the factor time has different levels with independent observations, since samples were taken from different beech-seedling-soil-mesocosms. There were two levels for gross rates of N turnover (June, September), three levels for N pools and abundance of microbial ammonia monooxygenase genes (June, August, September) and five levels for isotopic composition of C and N pools (June_6 hours after labelling; June_48 hours after isotope labelling; August_6 hours after isotope labelling; August_48 hours after isotope labelling and September_3 months after isotope labelling). Differences between the levels of the time factor within each treatment level were further tested by applying the Tukey post-hoc test. For plant metabolites in fine roots, single comparisons between SW and NW were performed with non-parametric U-tests due to smaller number of replicates.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec022"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec023"><title>Potential species range distribution modelling for beech on calcareous soil</title><p>Based on statistical species distribution models driven by climatic predictors [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], we computed the distribution range in the form of the realized niche of beech forests on calcareous soil in Europe.

This approach is based on relationships to climate indicators and is&#x02014;in contrast to process-based ecosystem models&#x02014;neither based on physiological nor on biogeochemical processes. Furthermore, such predictions of the suitable growth area can underestimate the adaptive capacities of tree species [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Evidence for adaption of beech to drought conditions was observed close to their dry distribution limit [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Compared with the SRES A2 scenario used for the statistical modelling, the <italic>in situ</italic> space-for-time climate change experiment represents a smaller effect of climatic change. The NW exposure corresponds to a model climate for present day conditions of many beech forests in Central Europe, while the SW exposure is considered a model for climatic conditions expected in the target region for the following decades in the first half of the 21st century [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The differences in temperature across the valley of approx. 1&#x000b0;C correspond to expected climatic changes between the periods 1971&#x02013;2000 and 2021&#x02013;2050 [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Such a warming would correspond to an SRES B1 scenario, which has to be considered as very optimistic given the actual level of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. We therefore used the A2 scenario as a framework for a potential development of the area of beech under climate change and rather difficult site conditions.</p><p>The fast and clear changes in N biogeochemistry and N nutrition observed here due to translocation from NW to SW exposure raise questions regarding the extent the beech stands in the investigated valley were affected by aspect in the past decades. Indeed these two beech stands&#x02014;planted at both sides of the valley 80 years ago&#x02014;are characterized by marked differences with 35% reduced basal area, 5 m less tree height and a timber volume of 236 rather than 349 solid m<sup>3</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup> at SW compared to NW exposure [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Hence, already the past microclimatic differences across the valley appeared to have been sufficient to impair the development of the beech stand at the warm-dry stand with SW exposure.</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>Experimentally simulated climate change decelerates beech N nutrition as a consequence of impaired N cycling</title><p>Homogeneous and reproducible triple <sup>15</sup>N isotope labelling allowed the simultaneous quantification of all major N turnover systems in the investigated intact beech seedling&#x02014;soil-mesocosms under persistence of plant-microbe interactions during the experimental incubation period. This is expected to have resulted in comparable realistic rates of gross N turnover. The N cycle revealed by this approach was characterized by high rates of microbial mineralization&#x02013;immobilisation turnover. The comparably low soil inorganic N concentrations in the range of daily rates of gross inorganic N production and consumption rates show that microbial N turnover largely controlled soil inorganic N availability. The dominance of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> over NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> as a source for beech seedling N nutrition is in line with earlier studies at the site conducted with adult trees [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Generally significantly larger N uptake in June than in August (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158823.g006">Fig 6</xref>) confirmed an earlier study [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], showing highest N uptake capacity of beech seedlings at the onset of the growing season. Such studies on N uptake capacity also indicated that glutamine is of high importance for N nutrition of beech seedlings [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Here, the homogeneous application of double-labelled <sup>13</sup>C-carbon (<sup>13</sup>C)/<sup>15</sup>N glutamine to intact soil showed that <sup>15</sup>N but not <sup>13</sup>C was retrieved in mycorrhizal and plant tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158823.g006">Fig 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0158823.s008">S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0158823.s009">S7</xref> Tables). This suggests that either uptake of intact glutamine was not significant under such realistic field conditions or glutamine derived C was already subjected to respiration in the mycorrhizal mantle [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These findings show the limitation of uptake capacity studies to explain actual <italic>in situ</italic> uptake of organic N in the presence of microbial competition.</p><p>The most striking finding of the simulation of climatic change via transfer from NW to SW exposure was a chain of effects related to NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> production and consumption, i.e., the persistently reduced community of AOB and the associated five-fold decline of gross nitrification, soil NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations and beech NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake. This suggests a tight link between soil water availability, nitrifier community, gross nitrification rates, soil NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> availability and N nutrition of beech seedlings. Apparently this microbial mediated effect of climate change on beech seedling N nutrition was strong enough to reduce growth and competitive performance of beech seedlings already after one year, as indicated by plant biomass and N content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158823.g006">Fig 6</xref>). A parallel study using the same experimental facilities as our work but focusing on the quantification of transcripts of functional N cycle genes found a persistent reduction of the transcripts of ammonia oxidizing archaea in the climate change treatment [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. This indicates that&#x02014;though not visible in the gene abundance levels&#x02014;also the nitrifying activity of archaea was negatively affected by the exposure to simulated climate change, which probably also contributed to the observed reduction of gross nitrification rates.</p><p>The still significantly reduced number of gene copies of AOB at the end of the growing season in September in conjunction with the positive correlation of the abundance of AOB in soil and nitrification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158823.g007">Fig 7</xref>) suggest that the climate-change triggered mechanism of impaired nitrification activity with associated consequences for NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> availability and uptake by beech seedlings is persistent. This was also confirmed by the smaller long-term <sup>15</sup>N recovery in beech seedlings in all labelling treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158823.g008">Fig 8</xref>) and the reduced N metabolite levels in the beech seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158823.g009">Fig 9</xref>).</p><p>Ammonification and soil NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> levels were only marginally reduced in the climate change treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158823.g006">Fig 6</xref>). This was confirmed by a parallel study [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], which did not detect a significant reduction of transcript levels of the mineralization related genes chiA due to translocation from NW to SW exposure. Unaltered mineralization rates in the climate change treatment indicate that lower soil moisture accounted for attenuated nitrification through detraction of AOB metabolism and limitation of N substrate diffusion [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Soil moisture is the major environmental driver of <italic>in situ</italic> nitrification in Rendzic Leptosols with maximum nitrification at 65% of maximal water holding capacity [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], i.e., the soil water levels frequently found at NW exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158823.g005">Fig 5</xref>). A strong reduction of gross nitrification rates when soil moisture falls below this optimum is in line with our general understanding of nitrification [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] as well as with earlier observations for Rendzic Leptosols in beech stands [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The strong sensitivity of the AOB community to climatic change conditions may be related to the fact that these microorganisms obligatorily depend on ammonia oxidation without metabolic alternatives. Thus, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>-dominated N nutrition of beech seedlings may represent a major obstacle for beech performance under reduced soil water levels in marginal soil in a changing climate, leading to reduced growth and, thus, impaired competitive performance. The observed reduction of gross NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> supply at SW in June equals to 2 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup> and thus has the potential to affect the N balance of the entire forest stand with its estimated N demand of roughly 100 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> growing season<sup>-1</sup>. Adult beech growing on Rendzic Leptosol has been observed to exhibit decreased maximum NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake capacity and basal stem area with declining soil water availability [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and has no opportunities to access deeper soil N pools in this shallow soil type.</p><p>It needs to be noted that the experimental findings from the space-for-time climate change experiment on the significant contribution of nutritional limitations to the drought sensitivity of European beech on marginal calcareous soil cannot be directly linked to the results of potential species range distribution modelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158823.g002">Fig 2</xref>), as this statistical modelling approach is not based on physiology or biogeochemistry. The statistical model used in this study compares presence or absence of beech with climatic parameters only so that regional differences in N availability and their impacts on beech seedling N nutrition are not considered. The present study suggests that this problem could be tackled by the use of indices of N limitation such as atmospheric N deposition and soil C:N ratios in statistical species range models, which should improve their performance with regard to predicting regional differences in vulnerability and resilience of beech stands in a changing climate. Dynamic vegetation models so far focus on light and water as determinants of stand development and species competition in a changing climate. Our work shows that N dynamics is a critical component to be included in such models. The presented data facilitate testing whether dynamic vegetation models coupled to process-oriented biogeochemical ecosystem models [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] can consider effects of climate change on beech performance more comprehensively, taking also into account N availability as mediated by soil microbes. For this purpose, such biogeochemical test data on plant-soil-microbe N dynamics is urgently needed also for other forest stands. The inclusion of microbial nutrient dynamics in such models is also important in the light of recent observational evidence that nutrient availability could dominate as control of net ecosystem productivity in forests at a global scale [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>Implications for future forest management and ecosystem services</title><p>Impaired microbial provision of bioavailable N may be a stressor for beech in addition to plant physiological limitations under reduced soil water availability, enhancing the drought sensitivity of beech under predicted climatic changes. The nutritional deficiency could be further exacerbated by enhanced N leaching after prolonged drought due to retarded stabilization of microbial N in organo-mineral associations [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>The results of the present study were gained for beech seedlings, however also could have direct implications for adult beech stands, because the shallow soils and the shallow root system do not allow adult beech to tap much deeper water and nutrient resources than beech seedlings. Furthermore, the competitive performance and establishment of beech seedlings is of importance for the rejuvenation of the stands. By highlighting the relationships between drought, N cycling and beech N seedling nutrition, our work provides pointers to developing mitigation options to increase beech seedling resilience and adaptation potential in a changing climate. In intensively managed forests and plantations, nutritional limitations could be counteracted by fertilization to increase levels of bioavailable N in soil. However, trade-offs such as undesired rapid hydrological NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> leaching in the joint aquifers of limestone karst systems would need to be quantified. The associated risk for nitrous oxide losses may remain small due to high nitrous oxide reductase activity in such soils, converting nitrous oxide into harmless dinitrogen [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Another option to promote beech seedling establishment and performance is silvicultural reduction of the stand density. This treatment increased soil water availability via increased throughfall and reduced competition for water in coniferous stands [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. A further alternative is mixing beech stands with deep-rooting trees such as oak. Such mixing approaches appear to improve water balance of soil and beech via hydraulic lift of water from deeper aquifers followed by water efflux from oak roots [<xref rid="pone.0158823.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], and thus may increase the resilience of beech seedlings to climate change in stands mixed with deep rooting tree species.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec029"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0158823.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Supporting materials and methods.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0158823.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0158823.s002"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Supporting materials and methods.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0158823.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0158823.s003"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Model statistics and accuracy measures for the fitted model.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0158823.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0158823.s004"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Primer sets and thermal profiles used for the absolute quantification of the respective genes.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0158823.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0158823.s005"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Abundance of microbes involved in nitrification based on the quantification of marker genes.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0158823.s005.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0158823.s006"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title><sup>15</sup>N enrichment (atom%) in excess of natural abundance in mycorrhizal root tips.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0158823.s006.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0158823.s007"><label>S5 Table</label><caption><title>Aboveground and belowground dry plant biomass (mg) of beech seedlings for the three harvest dates.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0158823.s007.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0158823.s008"><label>S6 Table</label><caption><title><sup>13</sup>C recovery in plant.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0158823.s008.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0158823.s009"><label>S7 Table</label><caption><title><sup>13</sup>C enrichment (atom%) in excess of natural abundance in mycorrhizal root tips harvested in June, August and September.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0158823.s009.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work has been supported by the German Science Foundation (DFG) under the contract numbers DA 1217/2-1, KO 1035/41-1, SCHL 446/11-1, RE 515/33-1 and PO 362/19-1.
