However, gaps remain in understanding how households&#x02019; adaptive capacities can become uneven. This paper investigates how development transitions&#x02014;such as the recent adoption of &#x02018;green revolution&#x02019; agricultural policies throughout sub-Saharan Africa&#x02014;intersect with cross-scale social-environmental processes to unevenly shape smallholders&#x02019; adaptive capacities and adaptation pathways. Drawing on quantitative and qualitative material from a multi-season study in Rwanda, we investigate smallholder adaptation processes amid a suite of rural development interventions. Our study finds that adaptive capacities arise differentially across livelihood groups in the context of evolving environmental, social, and political economic processes. We show how social institutions play key roles in shaping differential adaptation pathways by enabling and/or constraining opportunities for smallholders to adapt livelihood and land use strategies. Specifically, Rwanda&#x02019;s Crop Intensification Program enables some wealthier households to adapt livelihoods by generating income through commercial agriculture. At the same time, deactivation of local risk management institutions has diminished climate risk management options for most households. To build and employ alternate livelihood practices such as commercial agriculture and planting woodlots for charcoal production, smallholders must negotiate new institutions, a prerequisite for which is access to capitals (land, labor, and nonfarm income). Those without entitlements to these are pulled deeper into poverty with each successive climatic shock. This illustrates that adaptive capacity is not a static, quantifiable entity that exists in households. We argue that reconceptualizing adaptive capacity as a dynamic, social-environmental process that emerges in places can help clarify complex linkages among development policies, livelihoods, and adaptation pathways. To ensure more equitable and climate-resilient agricultural development, we stress the need to reformulate policies with careful attention to how power structures and entrenched social inequalities can lead to smallholders&#x02019; uneven capacities to adapt to climate change.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kg005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Adaptation</kwd><kwd>Agricultural intensification</kwd><kwd>Climate change</kwd><kwd>Institutions</kwd><kwd>Livelihoods</kwd><kwd>Vulnerability</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0025">Looming over smallholder producers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are constellations of climate change and ambitious development interventions that aim to enhance agricultural productivity as a way to end hunger and stimulate economic growth.

Conceptual and empirical work clarifying linkages between development policies and smallholder capacities to adapt to socio-environmental change is particularly limited (<xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">Eakin and Lemos, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="b0290" ref-type="bibr">Lemos et al., 2016</xref>), as is research on how social and political economic relations shape vulnerability to climate change (<xref rid="b0485" ref-type="bibr">Turner, 2016</xref>).

Some have encouraged differentiating between &#x0201c;specific&#x0201d; adaptive capacities (those explicitly addressing climate-related risk) and &#x0201c;generic&#x0201d; capacities (i.e. general livelihood components and the structural constraints leading to inequalities in education, income, or political autonomy) and examining positive and negative feedback between the two (<xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">Eakin et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="b0285" ref-type="bibr">Lemos et al., 2013</xref>).

We investigate how adaptive capacities are unevenly shaped amid development transitions in rural Rwanda and how this leads to differential adaptation pathways for smallholder households. This paper illustrates how development interventions that emphasize input-led agricultural intensification have uneven outcomes for smallholders' capacities to adapt to climate change and other risks. In so doing, this research speaks to the need to reformulate development policies in ways that can address deeply-rooted social inequalities and facilitate &#x0201c;transformative adaptation&#x0201d; (<xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">Bassett &#x00026; Fogelman, 2013, p50</xref>; see also, <xref rid="b0390" ref-type="bibr">Pelling, 2011</xref>). The paper presents the results of a mixed-methods case study of four communities in rural Rwanda. Two questions frame our analysis: (1) How do cross-scalar social, political economic, and environmental processes converge to shape smallholders&#x02019; adaptive capacities? and (2) How do these uneven capacities lead to differential adaptation pathways?</p><p id="p0045">In addressing these questions, we contribute empirical reinforcement and conceptual clarity on how specific and generic components of adaptive capacity intersect. We find that the implementation of an input-led agricultural intensification program in Rwanda has deactivated social institutions of climate risk management (e.g. autonomy over cropping decisions and seed sharing), leading to diminished specific adaptive capacities for many households. In their place, new adaptation options have emerged for some households in the form of (a) commercial agriculture with associated input access and crop insurance, and (b) planting woodlots on surplus land for charcoal and timber. However, a consequence of development programs in Rwanda is that these adaptation strategies are only available to households with certain livelihood portfolios. To build and employ these alternate specific capacities, smallholders must negotiate new social institutions, a prerequisite for which is land, labor, and stable nonfarm income. We find that the majority of households that lack these entitlements are pulled deeper into poverty with each successive climatic shock.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Research framework and background</title><p id="p0050">To investigate how adaptive capacity is differentially built amid development transitions in rural Rwanda, we integrate recent insight on the multiple components of adaptive capacity and adaptation pathways with livelihoods perspectives, which have long attended to multi-scalar processes of agrarian change within which smallholders make decisions (<xref rid="b0430" ref-type="bibr">Scoones, 2009</xref>).

As a lens to consider how vulnerability and adaptation emerge at the interface of political economic structures and smallholder agency, some suggest considering the role that institutions play in adaptation processes (<xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">Birkenholtz, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">Carr, 2008</xref>, <xref rid="b0405" ref-type="bibr">Rasmussen, 2018</xref>, <xref rid="b0525" ref-type="bibr">Yeh et al., 2014</xref>).

In hopes of catalyzing an African Green Revolution (<xref rid="b0515" ref-type="bibr">World Bank, 2007</xref>), major development actors (e.g. the World Bank, the United States Agency for International Development, and the United Nations) and national governments have made substantial investments in agricultural intensification, (<xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">Jayne et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="b0335" ref-type="bibr">Moseley et al., 2015</xref>). As in earlier Green Revolutions in Mexico and Asia, contemporary agricultural intensification programs throughout SSA center on smallholders, aiming to encourage households to adopt high-yielding varieties of maize, rice, and wheat and to increase application of agrochemicals, which these varieties often require to achieve optimal productivity. Africa&#x02019;s Green Revolution has thus far taken shape as a top-down enterprise, with governments and development agencies incentivizing and sometimes enforcing the increased adoption of technologies (<xref rid="b9035" ref-type="bibr">Gengenbach et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="b0335" ref-type="bibr">Moseley et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">Clay, 2017</xref>). Not only do intensification policies aim to sustainably end hunger and malnourishment&#x02014;which have abated very little in SSA compared to other regions&#x02014;they illustrate a renewed development emphasis on agriculture as an engine of overall economic growth (<xref rid="b0400" ref-type="bibr">Rashid et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="b0515" ref-type="bibr">World Bank, 2007</xref>). As with earlier Green Revolutions, land and technology are identified as the limiting factors (<xref rid="b9010" ref-type="bibr">Jarosz, 2014</xref>). Increased inputs (such as hybrid seed, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides) and agroengineering (terracing, draining wetlands, and irrigating fields) are thus positioned as essential to shore up &#x02018;yield gaps&#x02019; and thereby curtail further expansion of agricultural land into biodiverse areas (<xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">Foley et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="b0295" ref-type="bibr">Lobell et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="b0475" ref-type="bibr">Tilman et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p id="p0095">However, political economic and agroecological contexts in contemporary SSA poorly resemble those of 1960s and&#x000a0;1970s Asia.

In 2007, the country was the first to sign a compact with the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP), a pan-African framework of agriculture-led growth. Since 2004, Rwanda&#x02019;s Strategic Plans for the Transformation of Agriculture (PSTAs) have systematically transformed rural landscapes and livelihoods through land reform and technology adoption (<xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">Clay, 2017</xref>, <xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">GOR, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="b9040" ref-type="bibr">MINAGRI, 2012</xref>). Striving to become a middle-income country by 2020, the GoR aims to convert largely subsistence-based smallholders to professional farmers. With its Land Policy (since 2006) and CIP (implemented since 2007 in pilot phases and countrywide since 2010), the Government of Rwanda (GoR) and development partners have formalized land tenure, drained marshlands, and constructed terraces throughout the country (<xref rid="b0250" ref-type="bibr">Kathiresan, 2012</xref>). The CIP aims to increase the productivity of export-oriented crops by increasing access to hybrid seed and fertilizer, by augmenting agricultural extension services, and by compelling smallholders to consolidate landholdings with neighbors and cultivate crops selected by government authorities (<xref rid="b0320" ref-type="bibr">MINAGRI, 2011</xref>). Crops under this &#x02018;crop regionalization&#x02019; mandate (wheat, maize, rice, bean, cassava) were selected via a national-level exercise that considered agroecological zones and the crops&#x02019; export potential (<xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">Huggins, 2014</xref>).

Agriculture (either own farm or working others&#x02019; land) is the principal livelihood for nearly all households, who cultivate rain-fed, mixed crop-livestock systems for both subsistence and commercial ends. Cultivation on hillsides is circumscribed by two growing seasons per year (one from September to December, the other from March to May) and restricted to marsh and valley areas during dry seasons. When possible, households diversify livelihoods to include non-farm employment such as small businesses, skilled labor in masonry or house framing, and other labor such as collecting sand or making charcoal.

The rules are most strict in terraced areas. A regional agronomist selects crops each season according to government targets. Although households retain land titles, farmers are strongly compelled to cultivate selected crops by threat of fine, jailing, or land expropriation if a crop is not cultivated during a growing season. On unterraced land, restrictions are somewhat eased. However, households are still incentivized to grow selected crops and discouraged from growing four crops known for their subsistence importance: sweet potato, cassava, sorghum, and a regionally important grain known locally as <italic>ciraza</italic>. Prior to each growing season, households submit contracts to local leaders indicating that they will grow selected crops. If they do not meet these contracts, individuals can be publicly disgraced during weekly meetings of village-level farmer associations. Cooperatives coordinate intensification activities in marshlands, with a regional agronomist making cropping decisions. While access to marshlands prior to 2005 was subject to <italic>de facto</italic> land rights and planted in mixed crops and grazing, access now requires paying cooperative membership (5000&#x0202f;RWF, or 8&#x0202f;USD) and seasonal use fees (2000&#x0202f;RWF, 3&#x0202f;USD) per 100&#x0202f;m square parcel.

Focus group and institutional interviews early in this study revealed that adverse climate and soil fertility are major impediments to agriculture.

Study participants commonly spoke of rains that used to occur but no longer do, or changes to their start and end dates.

First, four crops that were once extensively cultivated (sweet potato, cassava, ciraza, and sorghum) are now effectively forbidden by the GoR. According to respondents and local leaders, the chief reason for this shift is that these crops are not part of the CIP due to their low market values. This is in spite of wide agreement that these are among the most drought and flood tolerant crops, especially when compared to much riskier CIP crops. We also explored with producers the issues of adopting the CIP in terms of institutions of climate risk management. Intersections between the government&#x02019;s intensification program and issues of climatic uncertainty in Kibirizi were evident early on and throughout this study. When asked about any difficulties of adopting CIP land use practices, study participants often couched responses in terms of climate.

Adoption is widespread, with over 93 percent of survey respondents taking up CIP land use practices in 2015. To better understand the uneven outcomes of this institutional change, we situate Rwanda&#x02019;s program of agricultural commercialization in a shifting social, environmental, and political economic context within which smallholders manage risks and make adaptive decisions. While the aim of the CIP is to intensify and commercialize agriculture to create more resilient smallholder production systems, we find that the program has had corollary shifts in local social institutions of smallholder climate risk management that, for many, actually decrease resilience to droughts and heavy rain. As observed elsewhere in SSA, smallholders in Rwanda employ various climate risk management strategies that include <italic>ex-ante</italic> (decisions made prior to a growing season to minimize risks), <italic>in-season</italic> (responses to perceived and forecast weather conditions that drive adjustments to crops or cultivation practices), and <italic>ex-post</italic> (buffering negative impacts of climate shocks that already occurred) (see <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">Cooper et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="b0495" ref-type="bibr">Waha et al., 2013</xref> for this typology). Surveys and interviews revealed that smallholders in Kibirizi have traditionally employed a range of strategies (summarized in <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). These include four principal <italic>ex-ante</italic> land use strategies to buffer risks of uncertain climate: a) intercropping several crop varieties within a parcel; b) cultivating parcels at multiple locations (including upper, mid, and lower hillside as well as valley and marshland); c) preparing fields and acquiring inputs ahead of time such that seeds can be sown after first rains; d) selecting low-risk crops. Respondents noted two principal <italic>in season</italic> risk management strategies: a) adjusting crops in response to perceived and forecast weather conditions such as planting short-maturation crops like sweet potato rather than maize if rains are delayed; and b) avoiding investing further inputs in fields that are seen as likely to fail following adverse climate conditions (for example, not weeding or applying fertilizer after inconsistent rains in the first months of a growing season). Some strategies extend across seasons; for example, social networks of seed sharing permitting cultivation in a season after drought even if household seed stores are depleted.<table-wrap id="t0015" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Specific capacities for adapting to and coping with climate shocks in Kibirizi, their related social institutions.

These capacities are facilitated by various social institutions operating at multiple levels. Many of these institutions are currently in flux due to intersecting social-environmental changes (summarized in <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Several key social institutions pertain to flexible decision-making at household and parcel levels concerning which crops to grow. Respondents noted that norms of land-use flexibility are deeply engrained in Kibirizi. However, the state&#x02019;s crop regionalization and land use consolidation programs have sharply eroded household autonomy over cropping decisions: 75 percent of survey respondents indicated that the government primarily makes cropping decisions. In short, this means that smallholders are increasingly compelled to grow crops selected by local leaders for their supposed economic value rather than selecting crops themselves according to household needs, agroecological features of their parcels, and climate risk. As interview respondents noted: &#x02018;Decisions have changed because of the government program and performance contracts;&#x02019; &#x02018;The plots are under land use consolidation where one selected crop by local leaders is grown;&#x02019; &#x02018;All decisions are coming from our local leaders.&#x02019;</p><p id="p0175">One result of these governance changes is that 91 percent of households now cultivate fewer crop varieties than they did ten years ago. Not only does this eradication of flexible decision-making institutions debilitate <italic>ex-ante</italic> capacities, it also has implications for <italic>in-season</italic> capacities. As discussed above, smallholders must submit contracts (which both bind producers to the state&#x02019;s selected crops and allow calculation of the amount of seed to be delivered to particular rural areas) months ahead of growing seasons. This affords little leeway to adjust cropping decisions in response to climate cues. Constraints to <italic>in-season</italic> capacities are most pronounced in terraced areas, where producers risk land appropriation if they choose not to cultivate their holdings for a season. Negative effects associated with these policy changes are widespread, as summarized in the following responses: &#x02018;We don't have good production and we lose all the crops planted;&#x02019; &#x02018;we harvest less and we are obligated to buy additional food on market;&#x02019; &#x02018;this program is the main cause of hunger because we are growing just one crop.&#x02019;</p><p id="p0180">Another risk management strategy that 64.4 percent of respondents noted is preparing fields ahead of time so that when rain does arrive seeds can be planted without delay. However, due to challenges in accessing seeds and labor on time, 35.3 percent of respondents report planting late during the preceding year. Difficulties planting fields on time appear to be increasingly common for several intersecting reasons associated with development transitions in Rwanda. For one, hybrid seed (maize, wheat, and bean) for CIP crops, along with inputs that are required for these crops, must be purchased. Privatization of seed and fertilizer distribution has decreased ability to access seed, since seed must be purchased at steep interest rates, a risk that many smallholders are unwilling to accept. Further, commercialization of input networks appears to have led to a decline in local seed sharing practices. These seed access challenges converge especially among those lacking nonfarm income, who must first work in others&#x02019; fields before they prepare their own fields in order to afford seed and other inputs. Moreover, respondents commonly noted that government seed deliveries are frequently delayed, and that they are not permitted to plant other seed but must instead delay planting fields until seed arrives and therefore risk missing a crucial period in the growing season.</p><p id="p0185">Government-implemented institutions associated with carrying out the CIP have in some ways replaced more locally-based institutions. These could in theory correct for the diminished specific adaptive capacity caused by the suppression of traditional risk management institutions, perhaps thereby easing the transition to intensive production of commercial crops. For example, distribution of seed and fertilizer for CIP crops has been privatized and is now being carried out by agricultural cooperatives and by Tubura. Tubura provides maize seed and chemical fertilizer on credit, charging 19 percent interest. While the company provided a rebate of 50 percent on these loans following a nationwide drought, many respondents noted that for local or regional climate shocks they offer no such assistance. Similarly, cooperatives do not provide a rebate following localized flooding that frequently destroys crops. As such, these institutions are seen by many respondents as limited in their risk mitigation effectiveness. Moreover, they are not even accessible to households without a steady cash flow, who see Tubura&#x02019;s high interest rates as potentially exacerbating risks in the event of climate shocks or pest outbreaks. These reservations are reflected in uneven Tubura membership, shown in <xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. While nearly 60 percent of the wealthier households are members, only 21 percent of the poorest households are members of this institution.<table-wrap id="t0020" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Results of ANOVA and Chi-Square, displaying variation in membership rates in key institutions associated with the CIP as well as the percent of CIP land where yield-reducing challenges were indicated.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th colspan="2">Tubura Member<hr/></th><th colspan="2">Cooperative Member<hr/></th><th colspan="3">Land in CIP<hr/></th></tr><tr><th>Generic capacity level</th><th>N</th><th>Percent of group</th><th>N</th><th>Percent of Group</th><th>Percent total land</th><th>Percent of parcels</th><th>Percent CIP land with challenges</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Low</td><td>21</td><td>20.8</td><td>22</td><td>19.0</td><td>34.4</td><td>34.0</td><td>36.1%</td></tr><tr><td>Medium low</td><td>52</td><td>40.3</td><td>32</td><td>23.7</td><td>30.3</td><td>32.2</td><td>29.8%</td></tr><tr><td>Medium high</td><td>61</td><td>50.0</td><td>25</td><td>19.8</td><td>24.8</td><td>29.4</td><td>21.6%</td></tr><tr><td>High</td><td>28</td><td>58.3</td><td>14</td><td>28.6</td><td>19.0</td><td>30.6</td><td>14.7%</td></tr><tr><td>All</td><td>162</td><td>40.5</td><td>93</td><td>21.8</td><td>28.3</td><td>31.6</td><td>26.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Sig.</td><td>0.000</td><td>0.104</td><td/><td>0.366</td><td>0.000</td><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="p0190">Given that they are accessible only to households that already have substantial generic capacity, reliance on institutions such as Tubura does not confer inclusive risk mitigation. Moreover, lack of access to the core institutions of the CIP among the poorest households creates a paradox in that these households are relatively more invested in the CIP than are their wealthier neighbors by proportion of land area. As shown in <xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, the poorest households have more than one third of their land under CIP management, while the wealthier households have less than one fifth of their land set aside for the program. In other words, those with less institutional support to make the transition to commercial agriculture are, often unwillingly, under greater pressure to alter production practices in line with the government&#x02019;s vision. Many interview respondents among lower capacity households expressed challenges in how institutional change and climatic shocks have intersected over the past five years. For example, an elderly male smallholder explained:<disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;They told us not to grow sweet potato and cassava and only to grow wheat and beans, and farmers were dying of hunger. It cost between 5,000 and 6,000 Frw for a basket of sweet potatoes [about ten times the typical price].&#x0201d;</p><p><bold>Interviewer:</bold> &#x0201c;Is it the government policy that caused sweet potatoes to become so expensive?&#x0201d; &#x02018;No. it is because of two reasons. The first reason is that there was too much sun [drought] and people could not cultivate sweet potatoes. Then after rain those who did plant sweet potato had them uprooted by local leaders.&#x02019;</p></disp-quote></p></sec><sec id="s0070"><title>Acquiring marsh and valley land</title><p id="p0195">Marshland in Kibirizi has become less accessible with the transition from ownership by local associations to more formal cooperatives. Many respondents noted that they were once part of relatively informal associations that regulated marshland use prior to 2005. At that time, people were cultivating as they liked in marshlands, often intercropping sweet potato with maize or other crops, a strategy seen to increase resilience of the plots to flooding. Now, marshlands are part of the CIP and only one crop is grown at a time. Respondents expressed frustration about this transition, noting the challenge of joining cooperatives due to high cost and the fact that cooperatives quickly reached a cap after which further members were not admitted. They lamented the loss of decision-making power over crop choice and spoke of frequent flooding that has occurred in marshlands ever since they were drained and cultivated on a large scale in just one crop.</p><p id="p0200">With marshland circumscribed by CIP cropping systems, valley land has taken on renewed importance as a dry season cultivation option. Qualitative analysis of interviews clarifies that there are several intersecting reasons for this. For one, valley land can be highly fertile and permit cultivation through long dry periods. Secondly, valleys are now the only place where prohibited but important food security crops like sweet potato and sorghum are, unofficially, allowed to be cultivated. However, this higher demand has led to escalating costs for purchasing or renting valley land. As <xref rid="t0025" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> shows, access to valley land is uneven. As a proportion of total cropland (including woodlots), valley land comprises only around 10 percent among lower capacity households, compared to two and three times that among the two higher capacity groups. <xref rid="t0025" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> also shows that there is unevenness in the number of different parcel locations operated and that diverse parcel locations have increasingly concentrated in the hands of higher capacity households. In short, while there is a net loss in parcel locations among lower capacity groups, the highest capacity group has seen a net gain in parcel locations.<table-wrap id="t0025" position="float"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Results of ANOVA and Chi-Square, displaying differential access to valley land, parcels outside of formal CIP jurisdiction, and unevenness and change in number of parcel locations operated according to socioeconomic groups.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th colspan="2">Land in Valleys<hr/></th><th colspan="3">Parcel Locations (1&#x02013;5 locations)<hr/></th><th colspan="2">Has field (s) beyond CIP<hr/></th></tr><tr><th>Generic capacity level</th><th>Proportion of total cropland</th><th>Cultivate in dry season (% of group)</th><th>Number of locations</th><th>Locations decreased</th><th>Locations increased</th><th>N</th><th>Percent of Group</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Low</td><td>11.7%</td><td>29.2</td><td>1.8</td><td>19.1</td><td>13.6</td><td>47</td><td>46.1</td></tr><tr><td>Medium low</td><td>8.7%</td><td>37.6</td><td>2.0</td><td>16.4</td><td>17.2</td><td>61</td><td>48.8</td></tr><tr><td>Medium high</td><td>18.0%</td><td>43.2</td><td>2.2</td><td>12.2</td><td>17.9</td><td>68</td><td>58.6</td></tr><tr><td>High</td><td>28.1%</td><td>57.1</td><td>2.5</td><td>8.2</td><td>22.4</td><td>30</td><td>68.2</td></tr><tr><td>All</td><td>14.6%</td><td>39.3</td><td/><td>14.9</td><td>17.1</td><td>206</td><td>53.2</td></tr><tr><td>Sig.</td><td>0.001</td><td>0.006</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>0.039</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="p0205">This discrepancy is also reflected in the proportions of each group operating agriculture during the dry season and those with access to fields beyond the formal reach of the CIP (<xref rid="t0025" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). <xref rid="t0030" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> further clarifies other factors associated with access to these key land types. Intensity of CIP activity is negatively related to accessibility of places to plant CIP crops, suggesting that where the program is most strict, access to places to plant food security crops is also lowest. Relatedly, CIP intensity, in combination with lower household capacity and numbers of field locations stands out in the&#x000a0;number of climatic and other challenges experienced by households on CIP land. Similarly, households living in areas of higher CIP intensity are more likely to run out of food earlier than they were ten years ago (&#x02018;consume household produced food earlier&#x02019; in <xref rid="t0030" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>).

Over 74 percent of survey respondents noted that trees have increased in their umudugudu during this period. This is due to the perceived resilience of woodlots to climatic shocks and their importance as a source of cash once the wood is harvested and sold for charcoal or for construction. In the minds of many study participants, the rapid adoption of woodlots is closely linked to <italic>Ruchamakara</italic> (meaning &#x0201c;charcoal making hunger&#x0201d;), one of the worst famines in the past century. The Ruchamakara hunger period is understood to have arisen following three growing seasons of markedly low yield due to adverse climatic conditions. Though the order of climate shock events is not completely clear, most respondents indicated that it began with a prolonged period of drought that negatively affected two seasons. This drought is said to have been followed by unusually heavy rains in a third growing season. The prolonged duration of this hunger period reportedly caused some households to migrate, some individuals to perish, and a great many to participate in the production of charcoal. Charcoal making, as the name of the hunger period would indicate, was widely seen as the only recourse for households to purchase food from market in the wake of three failed harvests. Ruchamakara occurred around the year 2000, and stories still circulated of even stumps being cut out of the ground and processed in charcoal kilns. Respondents in Kibirizi also clarified that there are structural factors underlying increased tree farming. The GoR has incentivized woodlot adoption, ensuring that tree seedlings of two eucalypt species are made widely available at subsidized rates (seedlings cost 20 Frw each). Additionally, the GoR requires that all fields beyond 45 degrees (deemed too steep to farm) must be planted with trees to reduce erosion. The 45-degree slope rule is enforced by local leaders, who are often called upon to settle disputes regarding woodlots. This explicit erosion-reduction measure nests within a broader afforestation policy that has been implemented throughout Rwanda.</p><p id="p0215">Converting agriculture to woodlot is an adaptive land use strategy that has thus come about through the intersection of a changing climate, declining soil fertility, increased connectivity to urban areas where charcoal is delivered, and government policy to increase tree cover. It has become a generic adaptive capacity strategy that also enhances specific adaptive capacity to climate change. Whether or not they currently owned a woodlot, respondents frequently acknowledged that they could plant trees in a woodlot, put very little work into their upkeep, and after ten or 15&#x0202f;years hire somebody to cut the trees into poles for home construction (if the trunks are straight enough) or charcoal (if the trunks are less straight). Both of these outputs provide substantial cash income to the woodlot owner. Perhaps more importantly, woodlots can be effectively cashed in at any time, whenever the household is most in need of money. Indeed, numerous interview respondents indicated that trees are an effective income diversification strategy, even preferable to having money in a bank.</p><p id="p0220">However, adoption of woodlots is a highly uneven adaptation. Interviews clarified that woodlots are by all accounts recognized as a land use option largely available to wealthier households. And, as shown in <xref rid="t0035" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>, the percentage of total household land in woodlots correlates strongly with livelihood group. Only 26.7 percent of the poorest households own any woodlot, which is generally small and used to gather firewood, compared to 93.8 percent of among the wealthiest households, many of whom own large woodlots which are harvested for making charcoal or selling timber. Further illustrating this discrepancy, the wealthiest group of households has roughly half of their total land in woodlots while the poorest households have less than ten percent of their landholdings in woodlots. This finding is strongly supported by in-depth interviews, wherein respondents commonly acknowledged that although woodlots are the preferred climate-resilient land use, they are unable to convert to woodlots given the need to continuously produce food for their families. Indeed, while half of wealthier households report expanding woodlots in the past ten years, only 8 percent of the poorest households have planted more trees in that time period. For wealthier households, conversion to woodlots has become an important livelihood diversification strategy, as the following quotes illustrate:<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;The number of trees has increased so much. People who have land for tree planting do so.&#x02019;</p><p>&#x02018;They started to grow more trees after realizing timber are being exported and trees are fetching much money.

In the next section we employ the adaptive livelihoods framework to evaluate what these findings mean in terms of the differential livelihood pathways that emerge out of uneven adaptive capacities.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0080"><label>5</label><title>Discussion: Adaptive livelihoods?</title><p id="p0230">The above results demonstrate that agricultural intensification and afforestation policies in SSA intersect with changing and variable climates to shape pathways for adapting land use strategies and livelihoods. In rain-fed smallholder farming systems, the success of these policies can be predicated on how they facilitate adaptive capacities to adjust practices to mitigate increasing climatic variability and uncertainty. Our findings from southwest Rwanda suggest that land use transitions aligned with the &#x02018;New African Green Revolution,&#x02019; a mandate of intensified, commercial-oriented agriculture, have uneven effects on the diverse range of smallholder households in the midst of global climate change. CIP-prescribed land use practices have been differentially adopted in Kibirizi, with households closest to the margin putting proportionately more of their land into the program than households with more diversified land use systems and livelihood portfolios. This has meant that smallholders most reliant on subsistence agriculture have felt the largest impact of the destabilization of local social institutions that enabled flexible decision-making in the past. The poorest households experience far more yield-reducing challenges (both climatic and non-climatic) in fields planted under CIP-specifications, challenges that are exacerbated by the degree of intensity of CIP activity, with the most strictly regulated terraced areas showing the largest negative effects on household abilities to produce enough food and to continue planting core food security crops together with their forced adoption of commercial agriculture.</p><p id="p0235">By combining the adaptation pathways approach with research on the specific and generic components of adaptive capacity, this study contributes insight into how negative effects of development policies can arise through uneven access to new institutions (e.g. cooperatives and buying inputs on credit from companies) which can become necessary for managing climate risks in the absence of traditional institutions. Diversifying livelihoods to include nonfarm income has become a prerequisite for access to risk management institutions, leaving many households behind and curtailing their chances for succeeding with the CIP. In the context of these abrupt institutional changes&#x02014;which compel households to adopt riskier land use practices&#x02014;substantial farm assets (land and livestock) as well as sufficient capital or steady income are increasingly needed to buffer climate shocks and facilitate adaptation. While flexible land-use strategies have become less of an option for all, households with substantial landholdings (especially valley land that falls outside the CIP jurisdiction) are able to practice traditional polyculture systems of agriculture alongside intensified production. Overall, this is a diversified system that facilitates continued buffering of environmental and economic shocks and enables the continued production of food security crops. Another observable trend is that valley land, originally an important risk management resource, appears to be transitioning into a wealth accumulation platform for wealthier households, those who hold a significantly larger proportion of their cropland in valleys than do poorer households and are twice as likely to cultivate during dry seasons. In these ways, smallholders that additionally have steady nonfarm income and who operate across a variety of land types are far better positioned to absorb the risks of involvement in commercial agriculture. These households, which have higher generic capacity to begin with, can further build that foundation and thus expand their adaptive capacity to future social and environmental change. Such households can be seen to have adaptive livelihoods in that they draw on livelihood capitals in ways that enhance their abilities to manage risk and uncertainty. Conceptually, this also underscores the value of nuancing an adaptation pathways approach by considering how generic and specific capacities intersect.</p><p id="p0240">By contrast, a majority of smallholder households could be classified as risk averse in that their circumstances preclude diversifying into riskier livelihoods and/or land uses. For such groups, <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">Eakin et al. (2014)</xref> argue that development policies should aim to &#x0201c;build generic capacities without undermining the existing endogenous capacities for risk management: i.e., their specific capacities&#x0201d; (p. 3). Yet, our findings indicate that development resources are being expended in ways that provoke further inequality in household abilities to access and adopt climate risk mitigation mechanisms. The case of uneven adoption of woodlots as a climate-resilient land use strategy further illustrates how uneven adaptation pathways are produced through the interface of development policy and climate change. Faced with more uncertain climate and decreased soil fertility, households with surplus land have been able to capitalize on subsidized access to tree seedlings by dramatically expanding woodlots across their landholdings. Yet those without these bundles of resources and livelihoods (especially nonfarm work) have not adopted woodlots as a land use strategy. This uneven ability to invest in woodlots curtails adaptation pathways for many households, who instead are forced to adopt CIP agriculture on much of their land. Relatedly, the proliferation of woodlots also means less available land for rent for poorer households to produce food, which in turn is a factor in escalating land prices.</p><p id="p0245">In summary, an approach that combines longer term concerns of adaptation pathways with the multiple components of adaptive capacity can help us understand how complex development processes influence households&#x02019; adaptive capacities to climate change. On top of having limited specific capacities due to these new institutional arrangements, poorer households are experiencing food shortages that stem from the challenges of implementing land use according to CIP specifications. Furthermore, without access to woodlots or enough valley land, poorer households have difficulty engaging in land use and livelihood practices that help to strengthen their fundamental livelihood capitals in the face of an uncertain climate. This demonstrates that when agricultural intensification policies focus exclusively on building general livelihood capacities through commercialized agriculture they can undermine specific adaptive capacities, leading to unwitting adoption of riskier farming practices. Opportunities can emerge for alternative risk management mechanisms. However, our findings illustrate that the adoption of these alternate specific capacities can be highly uneven as it is often rooted in fundamental livelihood capitals and capabilities (or &#x02018;generic capacities&#x02019;). As the above narrative illustrates, a series of climatically adverse seasons&#x02014;as occurred from 2013 to 2016 in Kibirizi&#x02014;can set in place a downward spiral that will make it even more challenging for the poorest smallholder households to climb out of poverty. These divergent synergies (negative for poorer households, positive for wealthier households) are illustrated in <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>.<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Differential livelihood pathways emerge out of uneven adaptive capacities. Institutional change prohibits traditional risk management and the resulting scenarios for wealthier households (adaptation as adoption of new specific adaptive capacities through use of livelihood capitals) and poorer households (continued poverty due to lack of options for diversifying livelihoods and land uses while also being forced to adopt commercial agriculture).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s0085"><label>6</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0250">This study considers household impacts and responses to climatic shocks and change (including late rain onset, drought, and heavy rain) amid broader social-environmental changes in Rwanda to understand how smallholder producers come to differ in their abilities to mitigate and adapt to climatic uncertainty, variability, and change. Findings show that certain combinations of livelihood and land use practices enable households to more effectively cope with discrete climatic shocks and adaptively respond to perceived climate changes so as to mitigate current and future risks of uncertain and variable rainfall. We demonstrate that adaptation options emerging within the context of social-environmental change are attenuated by differential adaptation pathways that embody pre-existing resource access regimes and power asymmetries. Individuals and households must navigate new institutions in order to mitigate risks of increasingly uncertain precipitation patterns and episodes of drought and heavy rain. Mitigating risk now requires either accessing institutions associated with the CIP (which require surplus land, income, livestock, and labor) or diversifying land use into woodlots (which demands surplus land). Households lacking these resources have limited access to newly important specific capacities (crop insurance, woodlots, and dry season planting areas) to effectively respond to risks of climatic variability and uncertainty and to adapt to climate change. The overall result is that an important segment of the smallholder farming population in Rwanda cannot effectively adapt livelihood and land-use portfolios to navigate structural changes and climatic changes.</p><p id="p0255">The longer-term implications of the CIP in Rwanda bode poorly for pro-poor agricultural development. As this research demonstrates, negative synergies can arise when households with low generic capacity plant riskier commercial crops in lieu of traditional food security crops during periods of increasing climatic unpredictability. A series of climatic and other shocks can deplete a household of what little capitals it has, forcing adoption of livelihood activities that are not compatible with needed longer-term investments in livelihoods in ways that can create future opportunities for poverty reduction and increased wellbeing. To help promote sustainable adaptation for households across socio-economic groups, agricultural development policies must be mindful of the important role of local institutions in mitigating risk. Such an effort can be guided by attention to two questions about institutional change: 1) how does it differentially constrain and/or enable households&#x02019; traditional specific capacities? And 2) how does it differentially constrain and/or enable households to adapt livelihoods and land use to adopt new specific capacities? With looming climate change and visions of agriculture-led growth for SSA, both questions compel public leaders and private partners to face up to the potential for an economic growth paradox that pits the relative merits of higher productivity and incomes for already-advantaged households against the prospect of greater food insecurity among those at the lower end of the spectrum, for whom poverty and hunger continue to be ever-present realities.</p><p id="p0260">This research addresses a deeper issue: whether the orientation of Green Revolution inspired agricultural development approaches towards economic growth precludes consideration of risk management as a policy component. These results suggest that large-scale intensification programs with externally prescribed quotas for planting export crops can exacerbate existing risks and introduce new risks in the form of crops ill-suited for the region or for particular parcels or farming systems. The negative impacts of cropping mandates are particularly evident during rainfall deviations and among households lacking capitals to invest in commercial crops (<xref rid="b9030" ref-type="bibr">Clay, 2018b</xref>). These results further confirm the need for &#x0201c;localized, community-based efforts to increase local adaptive capacity&#x0201d; in highland East Africa (<xref rid="b0470" ref-type="bibr">Thornton, Jones, Alagarswamy, Andresen, &#x00026; Herrero, 2010</xref>). Absent such attention, crop productivity gains will come at the expense of disadvantaged individuals&#x02019; livelihoods. For Rwanda&#x02019;s agricultural policy agenda, care should be taken to ensure that the most vulnerable groups do not slide further into poverty. Specifically, rather than applying the CIP indiscriminately across relatively arbitrary spatial jurisdictions that comprise administrative units, the intensification program should be designed to adaptively respond to spatial and temporal variations across the mountainous agro-ecological landscape. For households lacking the requisite generic capacities to adapt successfully, it is essential to consider options for easing the requirements of compulsory crop cultivation. This need for flexibility resonates across resource use systems, as a recent case from Botswana illustrates (<xref rid="b0265" ref-type="bibr">King, Shinn, Yurco, Youngh, &#x00026; Crews, 2018</xref>).</p><p id="p0265">To broader work at the interface of climate and development, this paper contributes understanding of how uneven adaptive capacities can arise through interacting social-environmental processes over time (<xref rid="b9050" ref-type="bibr">Watts, 1983</xref>). Development research and policy must actively consider such dynamics whether or not a study or program specifically targets climate adaptation. Optimistically, adaptation processes can embody the &#x02018;potential to constitute or to contest authority, subjectivity and knowledge claims&#x02019; (<xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">Eriksen, Nightingale, &#x00026; Eakin, 2015, p. 523</xref>) and active application of pathways approaches through participatory work and continuous reflection on management paradigms can empower individuals to take action to remake institutions (<xref rid="b0510" ref-type="bibr">Wise et al., 2014</xref>). However, rigid institutions of environmental governance can also constrain livelihood adaptations (<xref rid="b0260" ref-type="bibr">King, Shinn, Crews &#x00026; Young, 2016</xref>). To visualize and implement transformative adaptation that actively reworks structural constraints and social inequalities (<xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">Bassett and Fogelman, 2013</xref>, <xref rid="b0390" ref-type="bibr">Pelling, 2011</xref>), it is essential to understand how adaptive capacity is unevenly built during development transitions and within contexts of environmental change.</p></sec><sec id="s0090"><title>Conflict of interest statement</title><p id="p0270">The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.
