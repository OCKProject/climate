Grain filling depends on assimilate supply. Increased assimilate partitioning to developing spikes and grains had the greatest impact on improving yield potential in wheat in the past (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Foulkes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Grain yield is predominantly sink limited and grains grow under saturated source supply (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Borr&#x000e1;s <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Thus, improved assimilate uptake capacity and partitioning towards the grains can improve yield potential in wheat. Due to anthropogenic activities, the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentration is projected to increase to 550 ppm by 2050, accompanied by higher global temperatures and increasing extreme weather events such as heat waves (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Barriopedro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Many studies also report observed increases in frequency, intensity, and/or longevity of heat waves, which can strongly impact plant growth (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">De Boeck <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). While CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment frequently improves carbon (C) assimilation and increases plant biomass in many species (<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Taub <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), sink limitation often occurs, leading to photosynthetic feed-back inhibition (<xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">White <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). This suggests that photosynthesis is only optimal at non-limiting sink capacity and therefore insufficient assimilate translocation could be critical (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Aranjuelo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p><p>CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment causes reduced nitrogen (N) and protein levels in non-leguminous C<sub>3</sub> species and alters acquisition, remobilization, redistribution, and concentration of N (<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Taub and Wang, 2008</xref>). CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment physiologically induces N deficiency, reducing both N uptake from soil and N reduction from nitrate into amino N (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Bloom <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Reduced N concentrations are only partially alleviated by increased N fertilization (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Fangmeier <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Similarly, micronutrients such as S, Mg, Ca, and Fe, as well as Zn, Mn, and Cd are markedly reduced upon CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment in wheat grains (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">H&#x000f6;gy and Fangmeier, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Pleijel and H&#x000f6;gy, 2015</xref>). Thus, CO<sub>2</sub> stimulation of grain yield is negatively correlated with the N status and may partially respond upon sufficient N supply (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Kant <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> is the major anthropogenic greenhouse gas, and rising CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations will influence growth and yield of crop plants via both its direct effects as substrate for photosynthesis and its indirect climatic effects. While future CO<sub>2</sub> trends will probably increase global yields by ~1.8% per decade, warming trends are likely to reduce global yields by ~1.5% per decade (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Lobell and Gourdji, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Grains take up sucrose and amino acids from the phloem (<xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Weber <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Sucrose is important in transport and as a nutrient sugar, and also as a signal (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Koch, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Braun <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Griffiths <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Sucrose initiates seed maturation, signals the transition into the storage mode, thereby acting at transcriptional, hormonal, and metabolic levels, and is thus a key player within the regulatory network controlling seed maturation. Altering gene expression of assimilate transporters is promising for manipulating uptake capacity and partitioning. Expressing the amino acid permease gene <italic>VfAAP1</italic> in pea embryos increases amino acid supply, total seed N, and protein content, but leads to deregulated C to N balances (<xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">Weigelt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Sucrose transporter overexpression in pea cotyledons also stimulates seed protein production (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Rosche <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).</p><p>The barley sucrose transporter gene <italic>HvSUT1</italic> has been ectopically expressed in winter wheat cv. Certo controlled by the barley <italic>Hordein B1</italic> promoter (HOSUT lines). We have shown earlier that in these lines sucrose uptake capacity and storage protein synthesis are stimulated (<xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">Weichert <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Repeated experiments in small unregulated greenhouses in field soil and with 400 plants m<sup>&#x02013;2</sup> revealed a large yield advantage for three independent HOSUT lines (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Saalbach <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Higher thousand grain weight (TGW), grain width, and length pointed to increased individual grain sink strength and improved sucrose partitioning at the whole-plant level. The observed increase in individual grain size was somewhat compensated by lower grain numbers per spike. In addition, there was a trend towards lower grain protein concentrations. Finally, it was concluded that increased seed size and ear number per plant mostly contributed to the higher grain yield (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Saalbach <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The HOSUT lines are suitable models to better understand determinants of grain size and number, its relationship to grain sink strength, and the potential limitations of wheat yield potential. This study is based on existing data on three different wheat lines ectopically expressing a sucrose transporter. While yield advantages of these lines compared with the wild type have already been reported (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Saalbach <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), the lines have never been grown under varying assimilate source strength. CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment means a potential increase in assimilate source strength both via increasing non-structural carbohydrate pools in the stems to be mobilized during grain filling and by stimulating flag leaf photosynthesis. At the same time, indirect effects of CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment such as extreme climatic events may counteract this CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization effect. As a third variable, N supply has to be taken into account since high N supply may possibly alleviate the trade-off between grain yield and grain protein concentration. Here, we wanted to analyse the combinatorial effects and interactions of elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, a heat wave applied during grain filling, and variation in N fertilization on growth and yield-related parameters of the HOSUT line as compared with the non-transgenic line Certo. The aim of this work was to test the hypothesis that the HOSUT line with improved sink strength can benefit more from source stimulation by CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment compared with the wild-type control. Data on plant phenology, yield-related traits, grain dimensions, and composition were collected and investigated using a full four-factorial analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Experimental design and data analysis</title><p>A full factorial experiment was performed under controlled conditions in phytochambers with four factors, each with two levels.

The heat wave treatment decreased grain starch, but increased grain N concentration. Grain sucrose concentration was lower at high N fertilization.

Unloading of assimilates into grains represents a potential bottleneck, and increasing transport activities might therefore improve grain sink strength (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Ruan, 2014</xref>). We showed that ectopic expression of the barley <italic>HvSUT1</italic> sucrose transporter gene in winter wheat increased sink activity under semi-controlled conditions and led to significantly increased grain yield compared with Certo, mainly due to higher TGW and increased ear number per plant (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Saalbach <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Thus, HOSUT plants are models with improved assimilate supply to grains, leading to higher grain yield.</p><p>While in HOSUT plants sink activity has been increased, elevated CO<sub>2</sub> signifies increased source activity, which in many plants stimulates photosynthesis and regularly induces faster growth and biomass accumulation (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Amthor, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Jablonski <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>).

In parallel, the effects of a heat wave during early grain development and influences from high N fertilization were analysed.</p><sec id="s15"><title>The HOSUT line has favourable traits at the whole-plant level</title><p>The <italic>HvSUT1</italic> transgene is expressed in developing caryopses but, somewhat unexpectedly, also in other tissues, preferentially in young vegetative sink organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). It was shown earlier that the <italic>Hordein B1</italic> promoter controls a seed storage protein gene in the endosperm (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Marris <italic>et al.</italic>, 1988</xref>). However, promoters across different cereals may change their tissue specificity (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Furtado <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), indicating that the barley <italic>Hordein B1</italic> promoter in wheat is not solely grain specific, and altered sucrose transport potential and partitioning can be anticipated in other organs as well. This may explain the changed performance of HOSUT with respect to lower tiller numbers, higher number of ears per pot, and higher aboveground biomass. If the transgene is already active in young organs, this might lead to more ears. Later on, the high grain sink strength could lead to an earlier senescence of existing tillers, which would reduce the number of existing tillers at maturity.</p><p>While flowering time was accelerated only in Certo by elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, HOSUT plants flowered earlier under both ambient and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentration compared with Certo. Sucrose is important to stimulate flowering induction and, accordingly, changed expression of sucrose transporters alters flowering time, indicating that sucrose translocation and distribution are critical (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Hackel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Sivitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Chincinska <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Early flowering is also reported under CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Reekie <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Springer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">May <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), which likewise may be an effect of improved assimilate supply. The <italic>HvSUT1</italic> transgene is expressed in apices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Thus, sucrose effects within the apex can be expected such as stimulation of cell proliferation resulting in general acceleration of development. Subsequently, this promotes flowering time in HOSUT plants, but without further acceleration by CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment.</p></sec><sec id="s16"><title>HOSUT effects and CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment are partially overlapping</title><p>Increased TGW is a stable characteristic of HOSUT and has been repeatedly observed across different years and lines (<xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">Weichert <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Saalbach <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). From early grain filling onwards, HOSUT endosperm cell number exceeds that of Certo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Sugar signalling and assimilate supply affect cell proliferation together with many other factors, which may integrate and communicate sucrose flux, or the potential of sucrose flux (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Dante <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Carbon source availability as sucrose determines cell division by controlling the expression of D-type cyclins in Arabidopsis (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Riou-Khamlichi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Accordingly, endosperm cell proliferation in wheat is regulated by assimilate supply (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Brocklehurst, 1977</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Singh and Jenner, 1984</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Ruan, 2014</xref>). It is concluded that increased HOSUT endosperm cell number is responsible for higher grain size.</p><p>Both factors, intrinsic HOSUT traits and CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment, positively affected phenological and yield-related traits in a similar manner, as was shown for canopy height, biomass of stems and ears, total aboveground biomass, grain yield, ears per plant, TGW, grain starch concentration, and WUE. However, the two factors differ in their mode of action. While CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment frequently stimulates biomass accumulation by improving C assimilation and thereby increasing source strength, the HOSUT transgene potentially fuels sucrose transport and partitioning mainly in grains and young sink tissues, and thus increases sink strength.</p><p>While for some phenotypic changes, HOSUT effects mimicked those of CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment, clear differences accounted for others. Tiller number was increased due to CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment, but was decreased in HOSUT compared with Certo. Nevertheless, ear number per plant was increased by both treatments. This confirms that elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and HOSUT effects at least partially function in a different context.</p><p>Grain nutrient element concentrations were in general lower at elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, but were not lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>) or were even increased in HOSUT grains compared with Certo (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Saalbach <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Thus, the effects of gene expression in the HOSUT line improved grain nutrient element concentration relative to CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment. Possibly, amended transport and/or allocation could play a role because it has been suggested that feed-forward control of microelement loading is regulated by sucrose flux into the endosperm and therefore may respond to increased grain sink strength of the HOSUT line (<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Stomph <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). The transfer route of nutrient elements into grains resembles that of sucrose (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Pearson <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Higher Zn contents, as seen in the HOSUT grains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>), might be due to improved sucrose uptake capacities, supporting the suggestion that grain sink strength is important for micronutrient delivery (<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Stomph <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Another factor could be a possibly increased mass flow due to HOSUT effects. A relationship between transpiration and nutrient acquisition has been suggested (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">McGrath and Lobell, 2013</xref>), showing that higher mass flow occurs upon increased water use/transpiration, which could improve nutrient acquisition. Since mineral element depletion in grains due to increasing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations might represent a threat to human nutrition in the future (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">H&#x000f6;gy and Fangmeier, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Myers <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), this trait of HOSUT should be considered when dealing with hidden hunger problems.</p></sec><sec id="s17"><title>HOSUT is saturated in response to CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization</title><p>HOSUT and Certo responded significantly differently to CO<sub>2</sub> treatment with respect to biomass of stems and ears, total aboveground biomass, grain yield, N yield, and grains per plant. For both HOSUT and Certo, all these traits reacted positively to CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment. However, the response was significantly more pronounced for Certo. CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment was less effective in HOSUT, indicating that it is already optimized according to assimilate translocation to grains. Thus, while Certo could be strongly promoted by elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, generating additional sinks such as stems and ears, HOSUT was more saturated and responded only weakly. The fact that HOSUT did not strongly react directs attention to other factors, which may be limiting for grain filling in wheat. While sucrose transporters could affect assimilate loading and unloading, other limiting factors can be critical such as development of the vascular system and/or short-distance transport within the spike, rachis, and spikelet.</p><p>Higher individual grain sink strength in HOSUT is accompanied by lower grain number per spike, a trait which strongly depends on assimilates allocated to the spike (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Ghiglione <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). A negative relationship between grain size and grain number per spike has been observed earlier for HOSUT (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Saalbach <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>) and could indicate limited assimilate supply/transport at the spike level. Accordingly, we conclude that higher individual grain sink strength cannot be fully balanced by assimilate transport into HOSUT ears.</p><p>The line responses to CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment revealed that increased starch levels at elevated CO<sub>2</sub> occurred only for HOSUT but not for Certo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). Thus, grain starch of HOSUT responded more strongly to CO<sub>2</sub> than Certo, indicating again that translocation processes/grain sink strength are more optimized in HOSUT compared with Certo. Subsequently, the additional C provided from CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment could be more efficiently used, especially in the grains.</p></sec><sec id="s18"><title>HOSUT responds more strongly to high N fertilization compared with Certo</title><p>Both HOSUT effects and CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment decreased the concentrations of free amino acids, storage proteins, and grain N in a similar way, although the effect was stronger for CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>). Thus, yield increases, due to either HOSUT effects or CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment, were strongly associated with loss of grain quality, expressed as a percentage of grain N (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). It has been shown that CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment frequently reduces N concentrations in plants (<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Taub <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). The mechanisms responsible are dilution effects by increased production of non-structural carbohydrates, decreased root N uptake, reduced transpiration and N uptake with water mass flow from the soil, as well as improved photosynthetic N use efficiency by less N investment in Rubisco. Our results show that CO<sub>2</sub> and HOSUT effects exert analogous C:N imbalances. However, line responses to N fertilization for ear biomass, grain yield, grains per pot, and harvest index indicate N stimulation preferentially for HOSUT. This could be due to the fact that HOSUT is optimized for assimilate transfer/mass flow especially towards grains and may profit from the additional N with respect to ears and grains (<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Taub and Wang, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Chapman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). This could finally improve grain yield, ear biomass, and grain number per plant. On the other hand, vegetative growth was preferentially stimulated in Certo by high N fertilization relative to HOSUT. The optimized N use is also underpinned by the fact that high N fertilization decreased the harvest index in Certo relative to HOSUT. High N fertilization in Certo stimulated vegetative growth and decreased the harvest index, whereas in HOSUT N could be used more efficiently due to improved transport to sinks, not only for sucrose but also for N.</p><p>The heat wave at early grain filling decreased aboveground and ear biomass, grain yield, harvest index, grain size parameters, water use, and grain starch concentration, and at the same time increased grain sucrose concentration, but did not alter N yield for both HOSUT and Certo. Even a moderate heat wave during early grain development, which is quite common in spring or early summer in Western Europe, strongly affected grain developmental parameters, which finally decreased yield by ~15%. The heat wave strongly affected starch biosynthesis and/or conversion of sucrose to starch, which is reflected by an increased sucrose to starch ratio in the grains (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Barnab&#x000e1;s <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Mangelsen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Phan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The increase of the concentrations of all storage proteins except albumins/globulins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>) after additional N fertilization clearly showed that this treatment had the expected effect.

The HOSUT line and the CO<sub>2</sub> effects on the protein distribution confirmed earlier studies that looked at these effects separately (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">H&#x000f6;gy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Saalbach <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s19"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The HOSUT line expressing a sucrose transporter is potentially enhanced in sucrose transport and shows a superior performance for many yield-related traits compared with Certo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Our results reveal that both HOSUT and CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment similarly improve a wide range of phenotypic and yield-related traits although associated with lower grain quality. Responses to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> are more pronounced for Certo and less effective for HOSUT. This suggests that HOSUT is already optimized and may benefit only weakly from any future CO<sub>2</sub> increase. The fact that HOSUT cannot use additional C from source stimulation as efficiently as Certo points to other rate-limiting factors for grain filling, such as short-distance transport at the spike level. Obviously the improved sink strength of HOSUT diminishes a positive CO<sub>2</sub> effect on grain yield. While both factors, HOSUT and elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, diminish grain protein concentration, HOSUT benefits more strongly from high N fertilization with respect to grain yield, grain number per plant, and ear biomass. This might point to a basic improvement in assimilate transfer, especially to grains. Relatively high N fertilization is necessary to develop the HOSUT yield advantage. Application of a moderate heat wave at early grain filling considerably diminishes grain size, yield, and starch concentration without apparent interaction with line or CO<sub>2</sub> effects.</p></sec><sec id="s20"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p>Table S1. <italic>P</italic>-values signifying the influence of factors HOSUT, CO<sub>2</sub>, N fertilization, and heat wave on response variables and all interactions.</p><p>Table S2.
