However, it is unclear whether the observed decline in recruitment is driven by impairment of spore germination, or post-settlement processes (e.g. space competition). To address this, we conducted an experiment using a dominant CCA, <italic>Porolithon</italic> cf. <italic>onkodes</italic> to test the independent and combined effects of OA, warming, and irradiance on its germination success and early development. Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> negatively affected several processes of spore germination, including formation of the germination disc, initial growth, and germling survival. The magnitude of these effects varied depending on the levels of temperature and irradiance. For example, the combination of high CO<sub>2</sub> and high temperature reduced formation of the germination disc, but this effect was independent of irradiance levels, while spore abnormalities increased under high CO<sub>2</sub> and high temperature particularly in combination with low irradiance intensity. This study demonstrates that spore germination of CCA is impacted by the independent and interactive effects of OA, increasing seawater temperature and irradiance intensity. For the first time, this provides a mechanism for how the sensitivity of critical early life history processes to global change may drive declines of adult populations of key marine calcifiers.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP-120101778</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diaz-Pulido</surname><given-names>Guillermo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Great Barrier Reef Foundation</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diaz-Pulido</surname><given-names>Guillermo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This project was funded by the Australian Research Council (DP-120101778) and the Great Barrier Reef Foundation through grants awarded to GDP.

Therefore, understanding how global climate change affects marine populations requires consideration of the ecology of early stage processes. Our study focuses on the process of algal germination, which in the broader sense is defined as the stage after attachment in which a germ starts to sprout, grow and develop [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Following spore maturation within the reproductive structures, spores are released to the external environment where they attach to the substrate and germinate. Subsequent cell division occurs, a germination disk is formed, and in the case of calcifying red algae, calcification takes place further cementing the crusts to the substrate, completing the settlement process [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Germlings and propagules are the stages most susceptible to mortality in many marine organisms life history because they can be killed by extreme habitat conditions or overgrown by other organisms, creating bottlenecks for marine populations [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Despite the fundamental importance of early life stages to most marine organisms, there is a critical knowledge gap of the interactive effects of climate change stressors (ocean acidification and warming) with other environmental factors on the development of marine algae (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]), particularly on tropical populations.</p><p>Crustose coralline algae (CCA) are a group of calcifying red algae that play several important roles in marine ecosystems. CCA are a major calcifying component of the marine benthos, contributing to the formation and growth of tropical and temperate reefs worldwide through deposition of calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), which also helps cement and stabilize reef framework [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Further, coralline algae build algal ridges and maerl beds providing habitat and food for a number of organisms [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Importantly, they are a preferred substrate for the settlement of many invertebrate larvae, especially reef-building corals [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This ability makes tropical CCA critical facilitators of the recovery of coral reefs after disturbances [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, CCA are sensitive to the impacts of human-induced ocean acidification and warming [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and it is unclear whether CCA will continue to be able to maintain these ecological functions under future climate change.</p><p>Ocean acidification (OA) is a global problem caused by increased carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions to the atmosphere, altering seawater carbonate chemistry [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. OA reduces net calcification rates and can cause skeletal dissolution in many calcifying organisms including corals [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], molluscs, foraminifera [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and CCA [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The skeletons of CCA are mainly composed of high-magnesium (High-Mg) calcite, a carbonate mineral form more soluble than the aragonite of corals [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], making CCA among the calcifying organisms most sensitive to OA [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

Importantly, laboratory and field experiments show a reduction in the abundance of recruitment of CCA in response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, and it has been proposed that space competition with fleshy seaweeds is a major driver of the observed recruitment failure [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. An alternative hypothesis is that OA directly reduces germination rates of early life stages of CCA, which has a negative implication for recruitment success. However, it is unknown whether spore germination of reef-building CCA is sensitive to elevated pCO<sub>2</sub> and how climate change stressors independently, and in interaction with other environmental factors, affect the supply-side ecology of CCA [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>Studies on adult stages of CCA show that elevated temperature exacerbates the negative impacts of OA causing tissue bleaching and mortality in tropical and temperate CCA [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].

However, it is unknown whether the effects of climate change stressors differ between the early and adult life history stages of reef-building coralline algae. In this study we first ask the question whether spore germination and early settlement of the key reef-building alga <italic>Porolithon</italic> cf. <italic>onkodes</italic> is sensitive to climate changes stressors, and secondly we ask whether the effects of pCO<sub>2</sub> on the CCA are exacerbated by the interactions with increased seawater temperature and irradiance.

We have further used the colour of specimens in the field to make sure we were collecting the same species. Our specimens were pink-orange in colour. Our field observations and molecular work (in progress) indicate that crusts&#x02019; colour (for specimens occurring in the same light environment) can assist in the selection of samples to be collected to ensure that individuals of the same species are used in the experiment.

This means that the tetrasporangial plants (or tetrasporophytes, diploid, 2n) are morphologically similar to the gametangial plants (gametophytes, haploid, n). There is a further microscopic stage that develops inside the reproductive structure of a fertilized female plant (called the carposporophyte stage, which produces carpospores). Tetrasporophytic plants (2n) produce tetraspores (n) that are released to the environment and develop into haploid gamete-producing plants (n), the gametophytes (female or male). Tetraspores were the subject of this investigation. Coralline algae also have an asexual life cycle in which the tetrasporophytic plants produce self-perpetuating bisporangia. However, bisporangia were not observed in our samples.</p><p>Tetrasporophytic plants were recognised in the laboratory by removing the roof of the reproductive structures (conceptacles) using a blade and checking for the presence of tetraspores (zonately arranged spores).

[<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], Roleda et al.[<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], however we did not quantify the actual release of spores or reproductive output of the experimental CCA. Fertile CCA were placed in a shallow tray without water in a dark cold room (18&#x000b0;C) for 30 min. Sterilized seawater was then added to the tray so that individuals were submerged (ca. 2 cm depth); individuals were then exposed to artificial halide and blue lights (160 &#x003bc;mol. photons m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>) for a period of 7 hours. After this period the majority of CCA began releasing tetraspores, and at this stage (i.e. onset of spore release), the adults with spores released on their surface were gently transferred to each experimental tank (1L plastic tanks) in which they were exposed to the experimental CO<sub>2</sub>, temperature and light conditions. Adults continue to release spores in the experimental tanks. We used three adult CCA fragments (belonging to different individual thalli) per experimental tank, to guarantee the availability of sufficient number of spores to commence the germination trials. Polystyrene, transparent petri dishes (94 mm &#x000d7; 16 mm diameter) positioned at the bottom of each experimental tank were used as a substrate for spore settlement and to facilitate manipulation when viewed under the microscope. Water flow produced by the incoming water into the experimental tanks (500 mL min&#x02013;1) was sufficient to disperse spores on the petri dishes. After placing the adults in the tanks, 8 randomly selected petri dishes were examined every hour during 3&#x02013;4 hrs for spore attachment and initial stages of cell division, indicative of the onset of germination. Attachment was recognised by the presence of a halo (mucus) surrounding the spore [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and by gently brushing the spores to ensure spores did not detach easily. Commencement of the first cell division was initially detected in some spores at ca. 3&#x02013;4 hours, and at this moment, adults were removed from the tank and a representative area on the petri dish was delimited and photographed using an Olympus digital camera DP72 mounted on a compound Microscope Olympus BX5 using a 10x objective lenses (the area of the microscope field analysed was 3.8mm<sup>2</sup>) for further analysis (this corresponded to T0 for our germination measurements, see below). Subsequent photographs of the same marked area were taken every 6 to 12 hrs for two days to study germination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189122.g001">Fig 1</xref>), and then every 24 hrs for additional two days for further population analyses. This photographic sequence allowed us to follow the development of individual spores through time. Adults were removed from the tanks to minimise a mixture of spores with different ontogenetic stages at the commencement of the measurements (see below), particularly since spore release under laboratory conditions is not synchronous among conceptacles (per. obs.). Despite removing the adults, the total number of spores varied across the experimental tanks at the beginning of the experiment (e.g. 10 to 60 spores were counted in microscopic fields of 3.8mm<sup>2</sup>).</p><fig id="pone.0189122.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0189122.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Sequential photographs of spore cell division, germling development and formation of germination disc in <italic>Porolithon</italic> cf. <italic>onkodes</italic>.</title><p>Sequence shows spores after (a) four, (b) ten, (c) twenty-two, (d) twenty-eight, and (e) forty-four hours from spore release.

This estimate was recorded 48 (&#x000b1;3) hrs following the first observation of spore attachment (T0). Photographs taken between T0 and the final time (at 48 hr) were used to document spore development but not used in the quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189122.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Unsuccessful germination included spores that neither initiated cell divisions nor formed a germination disc. In addition, those spores that died or detached from the petri dish were included in this category (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189122.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Because the number of spores varied considerably among microscopic fields (e.g. 10 to 60), and the process of germination occurring rapidly in our experimental species, we limited our observations to 10 spores in one microscopic field. <italic>Germling growth rate</italic> was estimated by the change in surface area of 5 individual germlings (spores) over a period of 48 hrs beginning at T0. A considerable number of spores coalesced during the course of the experiment (process not quantified in this study) and this limited the number of individual spores that could be followed effectively through time because the margin of the individual crusts fused with others.</p><p>In addition to germination metrics, we also quantified the <italic>percentage of abnormalities</italic> in germling development and this was assessed by calculating the proportion of germlings with abnormal cell divisions or sizes in a subsample of 10 spores.

The effects of pCO<sub>2</sub> on spore abnormalities and growth are stronger than the effects and interactions of the other factors we examined. This provides empirical support to a body of work that suggests a vulnerability of germlings and propagules of other groups of marine organisms to climate change (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]). As supply-side ecology processes are fundamental to marine populations [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], our results highlight the importance of studying not only adults but other stages of the life cycle to better understand the impacts of ocean acidification and warming on reef-building processes and reef resilience. CCA play critical roles in reef cementation and induction of coral larval settlement, therefore, a disruption of CCA germination and growth may impair reef stability and recovery potential as the oceans continue to acidify and warm in the future.</p><p>Importantly, we provide a mechanistic understanding of how recruitment failure occurs in CCA in response to OA. Elevated pCO<sub>2</sub> reduces the rate of spore germination and growth, and produces abnormalities in recently germinated spores, independently of space competition with other organisms such as filamentous and fleshy algae, as suggested by earlier research [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The formation of the germination disc and the development of spore cells, as well as the growth of germlings are all directly and negatively impacted by ocean acidification. Post-germination processes, such as the growth of germlings, however, increased with moderate pCO<sub>2</sub> enrichment, suggesting that different aspects of the early life stages of CCA respond differently to environmental stressors, and that moderate CO<sub>2</sub> increases may benefit growth of CCA juveniles. Our study isolated the effects of spore germination from space competition by filamentous algae as potential drivers of recruitment failure in CCA exposed to ocean acidification. However, filamentous algae can indirectly affect CCA spores, either positively (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]) or negatively (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]). Therefore, future studies should consider the relative contribution of space competition by filamentous algae and spore germination on CCA recruitment, preferably in natural habitats where the natural variability in ecological processes can be considered, variability that cannot be incorporated in laboratory experiments.</p><sec id="sec017"><title>Germination success</title><p>Spore germination in CCA is sensitive to elevated pCO<sub>2</sub> and this sensibility is exacerbated considerably when spores are exposed to higher temperatures, such as those recorded during the austral summer in the southern GBR. We showed that spores incubated under the combination of elevated pCO<sub>2</sub> and high temperature exhibited 40% less germination than spores kept under ambient pCO<sub>2</sub> and temperature conditions. Although our study is the first to report inhibition of spore germination of coralline algae exposed to these conditions, other marine organisms also show similar responses, at least for elevated pCO<sub>2</sub>. For example, the unicellular green alga <italic>Chlorella</italic> experienced inhibition of cell division when exposed to CO<sub>2</sub> oversaturation [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Multicellular spores of the giant kelp <italic>Macrocystis</italic> exposed to low pH (7.61) showed a significant reduction of spore germination [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The mechanisms explaining this decline are poorly understood, but could involve CO<sub>2</sub> saturation in the boundary layer affecting the transport systems and gas exchange altering cell divisions [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], or an impairment in early calcification processes in CCA. The cellular processes by which elevated temperature exacerbates the negative response of spore germination to high pCO<sub>2</sub> are unknown and require experimental examination. Synergistic effects of high pCO<sub>2</sub> and high temperature have also been documented in adult CCA populations [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], coral [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] and abalone larvae [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Abnormalities in germling development</title><p>Abnormalities in CCA germlings were more frequent in spores exposed to high pCO<sub>2</sub> than those growing under control conditions, suggesting a role of CO<sub>2</sub> in altering the normal development of early stages of CCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189122.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). A similar finding was reported for the Mediterranean CCA <italic>Phymatolithon lenormandii</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Cell enlargement, cell density reduction and cell wall thinning in adult CCA exposed to high pCO<sub>2</sub> have also been described [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In our study, the abnormal germlings presented irregular and enlarged cells, especially among cells forming the germination disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189122.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Irradiance variability also modified the normal development of germlings in our study, with more abnormal germlings occurring at low irradiance intensity agreeing with the fact that low irradiance does not seem optimal for <italic>P</italic>. <italic>onkodes</italic> development [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The reasons why low irradiance causes abnormalities is unclear, but it is likely that abnormal development is related to reduced availability of resources for growth (e.g. light). Spores from other macroalgae are quite sensitive to environmental stressors such as elevated nutrients [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] and high irradiance intensity [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The implications of spore abnormalities for subsequent early development, spore viability, and life cycle of CCA are unknown, but abnormal early development may impact adult populations as shown in terrestrial plants [e.g. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]].</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Germling growth and area cover by germlings</title><p>Growth rates of individual germlings and total cover of CCA germlings showed a parabolic response to elevated pCO<sub>2</sub>, with intermediate pCO<sub>2</sub> enrichment favouring growth rates<sub>.</sub> This trend was clearer under low irradiance conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189122.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). This suggests that different response variables of the early life stages of CCA respond differently to environmental stressors. On the other hand, our results suggest that moderate pCO<sub>2</sub> enrichment may in fact favour the growth of early stages of the CCA <italic>P</italic>. <italic>onkodes</italic>, as has been observed on some adult CCAs [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. CO<sub>2</sub> is a substrate for photosynthesis, therefore elevated pCO<sub>2</sub> can potentially alleviate CO<sub>2</sub> limitation leading to enhancement of algal growth [e.g. as discussed in [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]]. This will depend on whether <italic>P</italic>. <italic>onkodes</italic> uses CO<sub>2</sub> directly from the surrounding water via diffusion gradients, or whether it uses bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) as a source of carbon for photosynthesis [e.g. via carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCM)], as well as the ability to upregulate or down-regulate CCM activity [e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]]. Although we demonstrated that intermediate pCO<sub>2</sub> concentrations favour the growth of early life stages of CCA, this only occurred under low irradiance conditions. Photosynthesis from non-calcifying red algae in low irradiance environments that lack CCM increases when exposed to high CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. In these algae, CO<sub>2</sub> is incorporated to the site of photosynthesis via direct diffusion gradients with little participation of CCM (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]), and this may be a process by which CCA increase growth under moderate CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment. Our results contrast with those from Bradassi <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] who found that the growth of early stages of temperate CCA were not altered by variations in pCO<sub>2</sub>. Different methodologies were employed by Bradassi <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]: they measured growth rates on two week old juveniles, while we recorded growth on 1&#x02013;6 day old germlings making direct comparisons difficult. The decline in growth rates under elevated pCO<sub>2</sub> is consistent with other studies that have shown declines in CCA recruitment with high pCO<sub>2</sub> [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]<sub>.</sub> We can infer that the decline observed in CCA recruitment under high pCO<sub>2</sub>/low pH in our experiment may be a direct result of the inability of the spores to commence cell division and germination disc formation and the decrease of germling growth rate.</p><p>Our study also demonstrates a positive effect of elevated temperature on individual germling growth rates. Elevated temperature in itself may enhance metabolic processes leading to increased algal growth which has been suggested for CCA [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] and other macroalgae [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. The effects of temperature on CCA growth depends on species, temperature levels and interactions with other factors. For example, rising temperature accelerated the growth of germlings of a temperate coralline alga in Japan [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. On the other hand, elevated temperature in combination with high pCO<sub>2</sub> reduced CCA growth and calcification on tropical and temperate CCA, but temperature in itself did not have a significant effect on growth [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Contrary to this, no interactive effects of pCO<sub>2</sub> and temperature were observed on a tropical CCA [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Different results can also vary depending on the biological process being measured; for instance, diel net calcification in <italic>Lithothamnion corallioides</italic> increased under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> with a progressive temperature increase from 10&#x02013;19&#x000b0;C, while some photosynthetic pigments were reduced [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. As discussed earlier, elevated temperature in our experiment did reduce germination (germination disc formation) but only under high pCO<sub>2</sub>. From these results and the literature we conclude that the effect of rising temperature can be positive or negative, but in general when temperature interacts with high pCO<sub>2</sub> it synergistically impairs CCA physiology.</p><p>Variation in irradiance played a minor direct role in germling growth compared to the effects of pCO<sub>2</sub> and temperature, however, irradiance interacted with the climate stressors to determine the direction and magnitude of the CCA responses. High irradiance slightly enhanced individual growth by 14%. This is not surprising as <italic>P</italic>. <italic>onkodes</italic> is generally found in well-lit shallow environments [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Few studies, however, have tested the interactive effects of irradiance with ocean acidification and warming on coralline algae. Comeau <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] documented a decrease in net calcification of the CCA <italic>Hydrolithon reinboldii</italic> with rising pCO<sub>2</sub> at low irradiance and ambient temperature, possibly as a consequence of photosynthesis reduction at low irradiance. As photosynthesis helps control the pH at site of calcification regulating the concentration of carbonate ion and consequently precipitation of CaCO<sub>3</sub>, a reduction of photosynthesis can impair calcification [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Growth rates of our experimental species dropped when exposed to the combined effects of low irradiance, elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and ambient temperature, in line with Comeau <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] findings. However, when temperature was increased, the direction of the response shifted enhancing algal growth rates, both under ambient CO<sub>2</sub> and high CO<sub>2</sub>, alleviating the negative impacts of ocean acidification. As explained before, temperature may have accelerated physiological processes which could explain these results. Our study, once again, highlights the importance of considering multiple factors when studying the response to different environmental stressors.</p><p>Our study focussed on germination, an important process in the supply-side ecology of coralline algae. There are other early life history processes that may also be sensitive to the impacts of OA and that may exert considerable control on population and community structure of reef building CCA, but that have not been considered in the context of ocean acidification and climate change research. These include fecundity or reproductive output [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], spore release [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], and spore coalescence [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Information on the direction and magnitude of the responses of these processes to environmental stressors will enable a better understanding of CCA dynamics. For instance, coalescence in seaweeds (a process observed but not quantified in our experimental CCA germlings) has been suggested to enhance growth on some fleshy macroalgae, potentially conferring adaptive advantages to populations of coalescing seaweeds [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec020"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, independently from other factors, elevated pCO<sub>2</sub> has a strong negative effect directly on spore germination of the reef-building coralline alga <italic>P</italic>. cf. <italic>onkodes</italic>. It decreases spore germination success, generates abnormalities and hampers growth rates (although moderate pCO<sub>2</sub> increase enhances growth). However, irradiance and temperature could intensify these effects. Our paper provides a mechanistic understanding of the likely causes of recruitment failure in CCA when exposed to OA, and identifies spore germination as a key process highly sensitive to the impacts of elevated pCO<sub>2</sub>. Subsequent competition for space with filamentous algae may exacerbate the negative effects of OA on recruitment (but see Short et al. [<xref rid="pone.0189122.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]). Our results have also underlined the critical importance of simultaneously studying the effects of multiple stressors related to global environmental change, not only on the adult phase, but also on other stages of the life cycle of marine organisms. The influence of different environmental factors on the early stages of CCA will not only be reflected on adult populations and their communities, but on the role that these organisms play in coral reefs ecosystems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec021"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0189122.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><p><bold>Average (a) pH and (b) temperature measurements (</bold><sup><bold>o</bold></sup><bold>C) in experimental tanks and sumps across different CO</bold><sub><bold>2</bold></sub>
