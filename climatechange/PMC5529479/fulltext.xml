This study was based on cotton phenology and climate data collected from 13 agro-meteorological experimental stations and 13 meteorological stations on the North China Plain from 1981 to 2012. Spatiotemporal trends in the cotton phenology data, lengths of the different growing phases, mean temperatures, and rainfall were analyzed. These results indicated that warming accelerated cotton growth, advanced cotton phenology, and shortened the growing period of cotton. However, harvest dates were significantly delayed at 8 (61.5%) stations, the length of both the flowering-boll opening and boll opening-harvest periods increased at 10 (77.0%) stations, and a positive correlation was found between the mean temperature and the length of the whole growing period at 10 (77.0%) stations. Therefore, cotton practices and cultivars on the North China Plain should be adjusted accordingly. The response of cotton phenology to climate change, as shown here, can further guide the development of options for the adaptation of cotton production in the near future.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Climate change is projected to dramatically affect crop production across broad regions of the world in the 21<sup>st</sup> century<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.

However, the whole growing period of cotton in the southern part of the North China Plain decreased, which may be due to the impact of the change in Tmean on cotton phenology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Comparisons with previous studies in other crops and other regions</title><p id="Par16">Previous studies showed a delay in the sowing date of winter wheat of 1.5 days per decade on average but an advance in the harvest date of 1.4 days per decade; therefore, the whole growing period was shortened<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Wang <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> reported that the summer maize sowing date occurred relatively early at 13 (48.1%) of 27 stations examined on the North China Plain, while maturity dates were significantly delayed at 10 (37.0%) stations; thus, the length of the whole growing period increased at 18 (63.0%) stations. Comparisons between these two crops showed that winter wheat and summer maize exhibited opposite results, whereas the results for cotton were more complex. These differences may be due to an impact of soil temperature on the sowing date and a warming trend in recent decades that has caused delayed sowing of winter wheat and advanced sowing of summer maize; however, because plastic film mulching technology has been applied for cotton, climate warming has less effect on cotton sowing date. Furthermore, the maturity date of winter wheat may have occurred early because warming may have accelerated crop growth and shortened the growing period. The maturity date of summer maize has been delayed because farmers have adopted appropriate farming practices and cultivars in response to climate warming, such as double delay technology for winter wheat and summer maize<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. The harvest date of cotton has generally been advanced in the southern part of the North China Plain and delayed in the northern part, which may due to the indeterminate growth habit of cotton and the fact that the southern portion exhibits greater accumulated temperatures. Nevertheless, Lu <italic>et al</italic>. reported that increased temperatures advanced cotton phenology but whole growth period lengths were prolonged or shortened in various stations of eastern Australia, which was generally consistent with this study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. However, Huang and Ji reported that climate warming prolonged the whole growth period length of cotton in Xinjiang Province of China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par17">Previous studies about other crops conducted in Europe and on the U.S. Great Plains have shown strong negative links between temperature and phenology, and the agricultural phases of many crops have been advanced due to increased temperatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. These findings are similar to our results. However, the lengths of the boll opening-harvest period and the whole growing period were positively correlated with Tmean in the present study, possibly because of the indeterminate growth habit of cotton. The indeterminate growth habit of cotton means that as long as the environment is suitable for cotton, it could continue to grow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the majority of published studies have investigated the relationship between temperature change and crop phenology, but only a few studies have investigated the relationship between changes in rainfall and crop phenology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The results of the present study showed that the relationship between rainfall and the length of the whole growing period was positive.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Countermeasures for the impact of climate change on cotton phenology</title><p id="Par18">Considering the increasing trend of temperature in relation to the cotton sowing time and the indeterminate growth habit of cotton, adjusting the sowing date would be beneficial for rational utilization of the heat resource to extend the period of cotton growth and to develop and improve the cotton yield potential. Moreover, farmers could make full use of the higher temperature during cotton sowing by adopting deep planting and other supporting technology to avoid the use of plastic film mulching during sowing and reduce &#x0201c;White Pollution&#x0201d;. Furthermore, this study indicated that flowering occurred earlier as a result of climate change. The risk of heat damage could increase by a combination of warming, the change in the date of flowering, and the particular sensitivity of cotton to extreme heat during flowering. Therefore, heat-resistant varieties and appropriate cultivation practices are required to reduce the impact of excessive heat. In addition, this study indicated that a warming trend in recent decades has delayed the cotton harvest date in the northern part of the North China Plain; therefore, adopting cultivars with a longer growing period would benefit future cotton production in the northern part of the North China Plain. Nevertheless, the temperature is higher after boll opening, and changes in farming practices, such as adjusting the sowing date and the use of newer cultivars, will therefore be necessary to adapt to climate warming.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Potential limitations of this study</title><p id="Par19">This study investigated the spatiotemporal changes in cotton phenology and the relationships between cotton phenology and climate change. However, the impact of climate change on cotton phenology was not quantified. Changes in cotton phenology were found to occur in response to the combined effects of temperature, rainfall, agronomic management practices, and cultivars. Therefore, the conclusions that can be drawn from this study are limited. Addressing these limitations will require further structured experimental approaches, such as factorial experiments or model simulations. Additionally, the effect of climate change on cotton yields was not considered in this study and is a topic that we will address in the future.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par20">This study investigated the spatiotemporal changes in cotton phenology and the length of different cotton growing phases and explored the relationship between the lengths of different cotton growing phases and climate change on the North China Plain from 1981 to 2012. The results showed that the sowing, emergence, squaring, flowering, and boll opening dates generally advanced, but harvest was delayed in the northern part and advanced in the southern part of the North China Plain. The sowing-emergence, emergence-squaring, and squaring-flowering periods of cotton were shortened by 1.50, 1.94, and 1.96 days per decade on average, respectively, but the flowering-boll opening and boll opening-harvest periods were prolonged on average by 1.28 and 2.20 days per decade, respectively. The lengths of the sowing-emergence, emergence-squaring, squaring-flowering, and flowering-boll opening periods were negatively correlated with Tmean, whereas the lengths of the boll opening-harvest period and the whole growing period were positively correlated with Tmean. The results indicated that the phenology of cotton on the North China Plain has been significantly impacted by climate change and that such changes in cotton phenology affect the development and yield of cotton. Therefore, adjusting the sowing date, using heat-resistant varieties, and adopting appropriate cultivation practices will be necessary to combat climate change in the future. These results support the exploration of appropriate agricultural strategies and policies to adapt to global climate change on the North China Plain and in other areas with a similar ecology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Study region</title><p id="Par21">The North China Plain extends from 112&#x000b0; to 122&#x000b0;E longitude and 32&#x000b0; to 42&#x000b0;N latitude, covering three provinces (Shandong, Hebei, and Henan) and two municipalities (Beijing and Tianjin; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>).

The Julian dates (day of year; DOY) of six phenological stages (sowing, emergence, squaring, flowering, boll opening, and harvest) were recorded at each station. A standardized observation method was used to collect the phenological data. On alternate days, observations were recorded by well-trained agricultural technicians. Each phenological event was clearly defined. For example, the squaring date was recorded when 50% of the cotton was budding, and the boll opening date was recorded when 50% of the bolls on the cotton plants were open<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. The whole growing period from sowing to maturity was divided into five phases, which included sowing-emergence, emergence-squaring, squaring-flowering, flowering-boll opening, and boll opening-harvest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par23">Meteorological observation data, including the daily maximum and minimum temperatures and precipitation, were also collected from the China Meteorological Administration for the same period.
