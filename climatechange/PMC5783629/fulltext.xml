These methods are applied to determine whether an aspect of system function has changed since a baseline or reference period, and then to determine whether/how much of that change could be attributed to climate change (<xref rid="c70" ref-type="bibr">Stone et al. 2013</xref>). The value of these studies was underscored by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change requirement that signatories to the convention adopt measures to &#x0201c;prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system&#x0201d; (<xref rid="c72" ref-type="bibr">UN 1992</xref>).</p><p>There have been limited efforts to understand the extent to which changes in the current burdens of climate-sensitive health outcomes could be formally attributed to climate change (<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">Cramer et al. 2014</xref>). Nevertheless there is strong evidence now that changing weather patterns associated with climate change are shifting the geographic range, seasonality, and intensity of transmission of selected climate-sensitive infectious diseases (<xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">Semenza and Menne 2009</xref>), and increasing morbidity and mortality associated with extreme weather and climate events (<xref rid="c56" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al. 2014</xref>). We now have a much better understanding of the character, timing, and spatial pattern of climate change due to research undertaken over the past several decades (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">IPCC 2013</xref>). Together with demonstrable changes in disease incidence and/or mortality, this means it is now possible, in a few instances, to attribute a portion of current burdens of specific climate-sensitive health outcomes to climate change. Building the evidence-base on detection and attribution (D&#x00026;A) is the basis for better evidence-based risk management to reduce current and plan for future climate change-related health burdens, and to inform advocacy for actions to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>We review detection and attribution methods, discuss their application in health research, provide three case studies selected to illustrate the diversity of issues in this field, and conclude with research and data needs for furthering D&#x00026;A studies in health.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Background on Detection and Attribution Methods</title><p>D&#x00026;A studies determine <italic>a</italic>) &#x0201c;whether a system is changing beyond a specified baseline that characterizes behavior in the absence of climate change&#x0201d;; and <italic>b</italic>) &#x0201c;whether climate change has contributed substantially to the observed change in a system&#x0201d; (Stone et al. 2013). Because climate is always changing, and because there are many factors that can influence whether an aspect of a health or other system changed over time, with these factors also changing over time, studies establish baselines or reference periods against which change is measured. D&#x00026;A analyses of impacts ideally isolate the system of interest, such as the constellation of influences on Lyme disease, and then determine whether the observed behavior in the system changes when other factors than climate are removed or held constant to the extent possible. Attribution studies typically focus on whether and to what extent a system has changed in response to observed climate change (<xref rid="c70" ref-type="bibr">Stone et al. 2013</xref>).</p><p>D&#x00026;A studies have a long history in climate science in quantifying the extent to which climate change has changed the mean and variability of weather variables (<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">Hegerl and Zwiers 2011</xref>). The main approaches to D&#x00026;A can be categorized into single-step and multi-step studies (Stone et al. 2013).
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>&#x02022;</label><p><bold>Single-step attribution</bold> uses a single comprehensive statistical model that detects a significant change in the variable of interest and compares the observed change with that expected if climate change had not occurred. This approach is typically used for weather data; for example, temperature and heat-related mortality.</p></list-item><list-item><label>&#x02022;</label><p><bold>Multi-step attribution</bold> links separate single-step approaches that <italic>a</italic>) attribute an observed change in a variable of interest to a change in climate or other environmental variable, and <italic>b</italic>) attribute the change in climate to external drivers (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions). For example, the first step links temperature increases to heat-related mortality. The second step links the temperature increase to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. The assessment of the relationships between climate and the variable of interest may involve a process model or statistical association. This approach has been used for D&#x00026;A in ecosystem studies (<xref rid="c69" ref-type="bibr">Root et al 2003</xref>; <xref rid="c68" ref-type="bibr">Parmesan and Yohe 2003</xref>).</p></list-item></list></p><p>In addition, synthesis assessments review and assess large numbers of results that demonstrate the sensitivity of impacts to a change in climatic conditions or other drivers. Through a meta-analysis, health outcomes (e.g., heat-related mortality) described in the existing (peer-reviewed) literature can be correlated with an actual pattern of observed warming. This approach often uses spatial and temporal measures of association. This approach has been used in ecosystem and agricultural detection and attribution studies (<xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr">Rosenzweig et al. 2008</xref>).</p><p>Specifying the causal factor to which a change is being attributed is important. Many climate D&#x00026;A studies focused on expected fingerprints of changes in weather patterns associated with climate change and their associated uncertainties, where fingerprints are metrics or space&#x02013;time patterns of the response of climate variables to anthropogenic (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions) or natural (e.g., solar radiation changes) forcing. Examples of fingerprints include changes in global mean surface temperature, precipitation, and sea ice extent (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">IPCC 2013</xref>).</p><p>In many sectors the paucity of long-run data series leads to a focus on sensitivity to weather (e.g., extreme events). But system responses to long-term change may be different to the responses to acute events. For example, on a time scale of decades, local food production may shift successfully to new heat-tolerant technologies or be abandoned altogether (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">IPCC 2013</xref>). There are few examples of health studies that seek to identify impacts in the long term. One is the report by Bennett et al. (<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) on the shifting balance of winter and summer mortality in Australia between 1968 and 2008 (<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">Bennett et al. 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Applying D&#x00026;A Methods to Health Outcomes</title><p>Detection analyzes data on health and weather/climate to determine whether any change occurred over time, and if so, the probability that this change can be explained by background variability in the system (<xref rid="c57" ref-type="bibr">Stocker et al. 2010</xref>). An identified change is considered to have occurred if its likelihood of occurrence due to natural variability is small (e.g., a signal can be detected). Health systems routinely collect and analyze data on a wide variety of health outcomes to chart trends over time and to evaluate the effectiveness of policies and plans to improve population health. Once a trend is detected, then attribution investigates the relative contributions of multiple possibly causal factors. This is not straightforward because many factors may influence the magnitude and pattern of health burdens in a particular region, including the effectiveness of control programs, weather and other environmental variables, sociodemographic change, land use change, trade and tourism, and others (<xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">Semenza et al. 2016</xref>). Systematic monitoring is required to provide robust estimates of how variables changed over time. Attribution then partitions the reasons for a trend amongst key drivers of the health outcome (e.g., outdoor air quality, smoking habits, and population age structure may be changing simultaneously and each influences mortality rates (compare <xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">Pr&#x000fc;ss-&#x000dc;st&#x000fc;n and Corval&#x000e1;n 2006</xref>; <xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">Pr&#x000fc;ss-&#x000dc;st&#x000fc;n et al. 2016</xref>).</p><p>D&#x00026;A assumes there is a reference period against which the health data will be compared, taking into consideration that weather and health data are characterized by year-to-year (and shorter-term) variability and longer-term trends. Disease incidence and mortality rates have changed substantially (mostly for the better) over recent decades, which means there is no natural reference period. For example, at the same time as evidence is accumulating that climate change is likely changing the geographic range of the <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes that can carry malaria, multiple international and national initiatives are reducing the burden of malaria (<xref rid="c56" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al. 2014</xref>). Another challenge is that uncertainties in data quality for many climate-sensitive health outcomes increase the further back one goes, but recent periods, those with the best data and therefore potentially the most suitable reference points, are those affected by early impacts of climate change, which means attribution of a climate change effect may be an underestimate of the true impact. In any case, clear specification of the reference period is needed so that estimates of the extent to which changing health burdens could be attributed to climate change can be quantified over time.</p><p>In epidemiology, attribution is often described using the population attributable fraction of a risk factor; it is the proportional reduction in deaths or cases of disease that would occur if exposure to this factor were removed or reduced to an alternative exposure distribution (<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">Pr&#x000fc;ss-&#x000dc;st&#x000fc;n and Corval&#x000e1;n 2006</xref>; <xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">Pr&#x000fc;ss-&#x000dc;st&#x000fc;n et al. 2016</xref>). Calculating the population attributable fraction requires data on the prevalence of exposure to the risk factor within the population of interest, and the relative risk of the health outcome associated with each level of exposure.</p><p>However, exposures to weather and climate are different than typical environmental exposures, which creates several challenges (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">Bernard and Ebi 2001</xref>). Everyone is exposed to weather. Even with most people spending much of their time indoors, virtually the entire population is affected (potentially) by the consequences of changing weather patterns, such as increases in the frequency and intensity of heatwaves. But this exposure is not the same for everyone&#x02014;vulnerability mapping shows that particular locations and population groups have higher levels of exposure to, for example, higher ambient temperatures than the average for a region or to greater risks for flooding (e.g., <xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">Reid et al. 2009</xref>). Another complexity is the lack of a well-defined reference period. Climate change has been changing weather and climate patterns for longer than there are quality health data sets in most regions, thus it is often not possible to establish what would be a &#x0201c;climate normal&#x0201d; for health detection and attribution studies before anthropogenic climate change. Autonomous adaptation (e.g., adaptation in response to experience of climate and its effects, without a specific focus on addressing the risks of climate change) also affects trends in some climate-sensitive health outcomes (e.g., <xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">&#x000c5;str&#x000f6;m et al. 2016</xref>; <xref rid="c60" ref-type="bibr">Todd and Valleron 2015</xref>).</p><sec id="s3.1"><title>Three Case Studies of D&#x00026;A of the Health Risks of Climate Change</title><p>Within this context, we explore three case studies to highlight different approaches to attributing some of the current burden of climate-sensitive health outcomes to climate change. The studies are concerned with heatwave deaths, emergence of Lyme disease in Canada, and emergence of vibrio infections in northern Europe. In different ways, the studies complete the requirements of D&#x00026;A to show that climate change is already adversely affecting human health. Other examples include cold-related mortality in England, Wales, and Australia; pollen production; changes in the geographic range of tick-borne encephalitis, plague, and tularemia; and malaria (summarized by <xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">Cramer et al. 2014</xref>). The following examples are purposely not exhaustive and should be considered illustrative only. Exploration of specific case studies highlights the diversity of methods used.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Approaches to Estimating the Number of Heatwave Deaths Attributable to Climate Change</title><sec id="s4.1"><title>Background</title><p>There is robust evidence that <italic>a</italic>) climate change is affecting the frequency, intensity, and duration of heatwaves (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">IPCC 2013</xref>); and <italic>b</italic>) exposure to high ambient temperatures is associated with excess morbidity and mortality (e.g., <xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">Gasparrini et al. 2015</xref>). Therefore, following multi-step attribution, recent assessments concluded that climate change is affecting heat-related mortality. For example, while noting there are multiple social, environmental, and behavioral factors that influence heat-related mortality, Cramer et al. (<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) concluded that climate change has contributed to increased heat-related mortality in recent decades in Australia, England, and Wales, with medium confidence (<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">Cramer et al. 2014</xref>).</p><p>Because few of the individuals who die during heatwaves are diagnosed as suffering from heat exposure, impact studies typically calculate excess mortality at the level of populations. The effects may be substantial: tens of thousands of excess deaths occurred during the European heatwave of 2003 and the Russian heatwave of 2010 (<xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">Robine et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="c54" ref-type="bibr">Shaposhnikov et al. 2014</xref>). Although some of the deaths would have occurred anyway during or shortly after a heatwave (mortality displacement), the lack of a substantial compensating undershoot in mortality in subsequent months and years suggests most of the lost person-time was a genuine heatwave effect (e.g., <xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">Robine et al. 2008</xref>).</p><p>Estimating how the change in exposure to heatwaves affects health requires considering other variables that influence heat-related morbidity and mortality such as age, poverty, education, living alone, race/ethnicity, preexisting medical conditions (diabetes, renal disease, CVD), etc., and how these factors changed over time.</p><p>Different approaches can be taken to estimate what proportion of deaths during a heatwave could be attributed to climate change as opposed to natural climate variability. As heatwaves outside recent historic experience increase, with higher probabilities that climate change was a major contributor to their occurrence, then the proportion of heatwave deaths attributed to climate change would be expected to increase.</p></sec><sec id="s4.2"><title>Approaches to Attributing Heatwave-Related Deaths to Climate Change</title><p>Attributing a proportion of deaths during a heatwave to climate change requires multiple steps, taking into account that natural climate variability and anthropogenic climate change jointly contribute to the occurrence and intensity of a heatwave. Event attribution is a growing field in climatology that determines whether (and to what extent) an individual event was influenced by anthropogenic forcing of the climate system (<xref rid="c63" ref-type="bibr">Easterling et al. 2016</xref>; <xref rid="c67" ref-type="bibr">NAS 2016</xref>; <xref rid="c71" ref-type="bibr">Stott et al. 2016</xref>). Primary approaches include using the observational record to determine the change in probability or magnitude of an event (e.g., <xref rid="c58" ref-type="bibr">Stott et al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">Sch&#x000e4;r et al. 2004</xref>) and using model simulations to compare the the probability of an event occurring with and without anthropogenic climate change (e.g., <xref rid="c65" ref-type="bibr">Hoerling et al. 2013</xref>). These provide slightly different information for use in estimating the number of deaths during a heatwave that could be attributed to climate change.</p><p>Without using event attribution, a simple approach to attributing heatwave-related deaths to climate change would be to estimate the shift in the distribution of heatwaves over the last few decades by intensity, duration, or frequency (<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">Murray and Ebi 2012</xref>). All deaths occurring in heatwaves above an <italic>a priori</italic> threshold, such as the top 5% or 1%, could then be attributed to climate change.</p><p>A more conservative approach that could be based on event attribution would be to assume that climate change increased ambient temperature during a heatwave (e.g., that the heatwave would have occurred anyway, but the temperature was higher than would have happened without climate change). Then the attributable deaths would be those due to the additional temperature. However, estimating this fraction is not straightforward. Questions include how to estimate the temperature increase due to climate change; one approach is to assume the temperature increase during the heatwave is the same as the increase in regional mean temperature. Sensitivity analyses can be used to estimate uncertainty around the numbers of deaths attributed to climate change. There is no standard approach to estimating the number of deaths at the tail of the distribution, in part because there are few data points to allow robust quantification. Deaths could be estimated assuming a linear relationship between temperature and mortality, or it could be assumed that the increase in mortality per degree is greater with extreme temperature; the approach taken will yield very different results (<xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">Rockl&#x000f6;v and Ebi 2012</xref>).</p><p>As the field of event attribution advances, estimates of heat-related mortality could be based on the degree to which the event showed a fingerprint of climate change.</p><p>Two recent efforts took different approaches to heat-related D&#x00026;A, not based on event attribution. A study in Stockholm, Sweden estimated the extent to which mortality due to temperature extremes during the period 1980&#x02013;2009 could be attributed to climate change based on 1900&#x02013;1929 baseline temperatures (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Astrom et al. 2013</xref>). There was an increase in the number of heat extremes (days with temperatures above the 98th percentile of the 1900&#x02013;1929 distribution) between the reference period (<inline-formula><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>220</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) and the study period (<inline-formula><mml:math id="M2"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>381</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>). The increase in daily mean temperatures suggested the increased number of heatwaves were due to climate change. The study concluded that mortality from heat extremes was double what would have occurred without climate change, adjusting for urbanization and the urban heat island effect.</p><p>Mitchell et al. estimated the number of deaths during the European heatwave of 2003 that could be attributed to climate change (D. Mitchell, M. Allen, K.L. Ebi, A. Gasparrini, L. Harrington, C. Heaviside, et al., unpublished data, 2015). Thousands of climate simulations of a high-resolution regional climate change generated a comprehensive description of the 2003 heatwave and the role of human influence. Climate change had a highly significant influence on large-scale modes of atmospheric variability. A health impact assessment approach was used to estimate the number of deaths attributed to anthropogenic climate change, using a percent increase in mortality per 1&#x000b0;C increase in maximum apparent temperature (includes temperature and humidity) above city-specific thresholds. The study estimated the risk of heat-related mortality increased about 70% in Central Paris and about 20% in London because of anthropogenic climate change.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Detection of Lyme Disease Emergence in Canada and Its Attribution to Climate Change</title><sec id="s5.1"><title>Background</title><p>The biologies of arthropod vectors and the dynamics of associated vector-borne diseases are intrinsically sensitive to weather, climate, and potentially, climate change (<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">Githeko et al. 2000</xref>). Whether or not climate change will have a major impact on the frequency of vector-borne diseases depends on the role of other, climate-independent factors on distribution, abundance, and activity of the vectors (<xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">Reiter 2001</xref>). This case study focuses on Lyme disease, a tick-transmitted zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic>, and in particular its emergence in Canada. The natural hosts of both the tick vector and bacterium are wild mammals and birds, and occasionally other taxa, with humans being accidental hosts for the vector and accidental and likely dead-end hosts for the bacterium. In theory, climate can impact Lyme disease risk at three levels, affecting <italic>a</italic>) tick vector distributions and abundance, <italic>b</italic>) <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> transmission cycle occurrence and efficiency (and thus the proportion of ticks infected), and <italic>c</italic>) the likelihood of transmission to humans.</p><p>Lyme disease emerged in North America in the 1970s, and it is thought that this emergence was associated with landscape change driven by socioeconomic factors (migration of rural communities to cities with reforestation of farmland) that in turn allowed abundance of a key animal host of the tick vector of Lyme disease (white-tailed deer) to rebound (<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">Barbour and Fish 1993</xref>). This then allowed the tick vector, <italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic>, to expand out of refuges in the northeast (particularly the New England town of Lyme from which Lyme disease gets its name) and the upper Midwest. Lyme disease risk continued to increase and expand its geographic range in the northern United States. Until the early 2000s there was only one known <italic>I. scapularis</italic> population in Canada (at Long Point on the north shore of Lake Erie in Ontario); prior to this time, this was considered the extreme northern outpost of the species. In the early 2000s, studies undertaken to explore what factors may limit the northward geographic spread of the tick (and Lyme disease risk) into Canada revealed that the habitat appeared suitable (<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">Ogden et al. 2006a</xref>), with ticks being regularly dispersed into Canada (<xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">Ogden et al. 2006c</xref>) likely by migratory birds (<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">Ogden et al. 2008a</xref>), but that temperature conditions were likely too cold for the ticks in most of Canada (<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">Ogden et al. 2005</xref>). For <italic>I. scapularis</italic> in southern Canada, &#x0201c;too cold&#x0201d; essentially means that the temperature conditions across the 2- to 3-y lifecycle of the ticks are too low to allow completion of the lifecycle due to cold temperatures slowing rates of development from one tick lifecycle to the next, rather than direct effects of cold winter temperatures on tick survival. The tick&#x02019;s woodland habitat to some extent protects refuges from the extremes of temperature that limit survival (reviewed by <xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">Ogden and Lindsay 2016</xref>).</p><p>A population model of <italic>I. scapularis</italic> that incorporated known impacts of temperature on the tick was used to predict the geographic occurrence of current climatic suitability, as well as project future climatic suitability in Canada (<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">Ogden et al. 2006b</xref>).

Besides oysters and clams, other seafood associated with these outbreaks includes shrimp, crab, squid, mackerel, tuna, and sardines. Recreational water use in areas with high bacterial load or working in affected areas can also result in infections of the eyes, ears, or open cuts and wounds. Subsequent to Hurricane Katrina, 22 <italic>Vibrio</italic> wound infections were reported, 3 caused by <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> and 2 of which were fatal.</p><p><italic>V. vulnificus</italic> is an even more virulent bacterium that can cause three types of infections (<xref rid="c64" ref-type="bibr">Heymann 2015</xref>): <italic>a</italic>) acute gastroenteritis from consuming raw or undercooked shellfish, including oysters; <italic>b</italic>) necrotizing wound infections due to exposure of skin lesions to contaminated marine water (case fatality rate 25%); and <italic>c</italic>) invasive septicemia due to exposure to contaminated food or infection of an open wound (50% case fatality rate).

Of the domestically acquired vibriosis cases, a third (402) were non-foodborne (confirmed or probable); of these 79% reported having skin exposure to a body of water within 7 d before illness began, 17% reported contact with marine wildlife, and 17% reported handling seafood (<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">CDC 2014</xref>).</p><p>In Europe, however, vibriosis is not a notifiable disease (<xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">Semenza et al. 2012a</xref>). <italic>Vibrio</italic> infections do occur, particularly along the coast of the Baltic Sea, one of the largest brackish inland seas by surface. Open ocean environments do not offer appropriate growth conditions for these bacteria due to the high salt content, low temperature, and limited nutrient content. The salinity of the water in the Baltic Sea is much lower than that of ocean water, due to freshwater runoff from the surrounding shoreline, and due to the shallowness of the sea itself. The Baltic Sea discharges through the Danish straits but a subsurface layer of more saline water moves in the opposite direction. It mixes very slowly with the upper layer, creating a salinity gradient from top to bottom. Thus, the brackish zone of recreational water use constitutes an area of ideal growth conditions for <italic>Vibrio</italic> species during periods of elevated SST. Historically, SST was determined by dipping a thermometer into a container of water that was manually pulled from the sea surface. However, SST measurements can also be made with satellite by sensing the ocean radiation in two or more wavelengths within the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum that can then be empirically related to SST. The rate of SST increase has accelerated over the decades: the warming rate from 1980 to 2010 increased to approximately 5&#x000b0;C (6&#x000b0;C for summer months) per century, a 6-fold increase from the 1854 to 2010 rate (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">Baker-Austin et al. 2013</xref>).

The vast majority of cases were reported from 1997 onward (234 cases, 85%). The number of cases over this period increased in correlation with temperature increases, with periods of reported infections in close association with the areas of maximum warming. For example, during the summers of 1994, 2003, 2006, and 2010, significant and sustained warm water anomalies were evident across much of the Baltic Sea area and these years corresponded with increases in reported <italic>Vibrio</italic>-associated illness. The relationship between the annual number of human cases of vibriosis and mean summer SST was examined using a generalized linear model. It showed a highly significant association between a mean summer temperature increase and the number of reported human cases of vibriosis: For every increase in the maximum annual SST, the number of observed cases increased 1.93 times (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">Baker-Austin et al. 2013</xref>). Thus, <italic>Vibrio</italic> cases can be attributed to SST increase.

There is also empirical evidence that during this time, higher temperatures were associated with faster tick population establishment accounting for other possible processes involved in tick population establishment.
