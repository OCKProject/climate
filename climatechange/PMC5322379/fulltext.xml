Without treatment, pollution control relies on a combination of natural degradation and dilution by natural runoff to reduce downstream effects. We quantify here for the first time the global sanitation crisis through its impact on organic river pollution from the threats of (1) increasing wastewater discharge due to urbanization and intensification of livestock farming, and (2) reductions in river dilution capacity due to climate change and water extractions. Using in-stream Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) as an overall indicator of organic river pollution, we calculate historical (2000) and future (2050) BOD concentrations in global river networks. Despite significant self-cleaning capacities of rivers, the number of people affected by organic pollution (BOD &#x0003e;5&#x02009;mg/l) is projected to increase from 1.1 billion in 2000 to 2.5 billion in 2050. With developing countries disproportionately affected, our results point to a growing need for affordable wastewater solutions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Organic pollution of rivers by wastewater discharge from human activities (cities, farming, industry) affects humans and ecosystems worldwide through the global sanitation crisis. First, untreated urban sewage contains pathogens that cause a variety of diseases, including diarrhoea<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, globally the leading cause of illness and death. As of 2015, up to 2.4 billion people, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia, lack access to proper sanitation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Second, accumulation of organic pollutants in rivers stimulates microbial growth, leading to oxygen depletion and disturbance of the entire river ecosystem<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.</p><p>The level of organic pollution in a river, commonly expressed by the Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, is the result of two counteracting mechanisms: pollutant loading and natural cleaning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Wastewater discharge from cities and intensive livestock farms constitute the main organic pollutant loads into rivers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. With rapid urban population growth expected in the next decades, both sources of organic pollution will increase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Although pollution is introduced at wastewater discharge points along the river, impacts extend to downstream populations and ecosystems, as pollutants are transported through the river network<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. The extent of downstream impacts depends on self-cleaning capacities of rivers via dilution by natural runoff and natural degradation by micro-organisms, as illustrated for two major basins in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>. Changes in river discharge due to climate change affect river dilution capacities, increasing the risk of river pollution in areas that experience reductions in climate wetness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Increases in water extractions to support a growing global population may further decrease river dilution capacities.</p><p>Quantitative assessments of human and climate effects on increasing in-stream BOD have been carried out at catchment and continental scales<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. However, climate-related organic river pollution requires a global perspective to articulate the geographic linkage of urbanization, intensive livestock farming, and freshwater variability. Global-scale studies of river BOD so far have ignored wastewater from livestock farming and self-cleaning capacities of rivers by natural degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, as well as future climate-related changes in river dilution capacity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Here, we calculate for the first time historical and future in-stream BOD concentrations in global river networks, accounting for BOD loading from urban areas and intensive livestock farming, wastewater treatment, downstream transport, dilution and natural degradation. Our model is described in Section S1, with detailed information on all spatially distributed model inputs in Section S2. Comparison of computed BOD concentrations to observations from global, continental, and national river BOD datasets in Section S3 provides confidence in the presented results. In what follows, we analyse global patterns of historical (year 2000) and future (year 2050) BOD concentrations and discuss wastewater management options to curb projected increases in organic river pollution.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Historical patterns of organic river pollution</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2a</xref> shows global patterns of computed BOD concentration for the year 2000 resulting from corresponding spatial patterns in river discharge (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2</xref>), urban population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3</xref>), intensive livestock farming (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figs S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S5</xref>), wastewater treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figs S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S7</xref>), and natural degradation. The impacts of intensive livestock farming are significantly more widespread than those of urban populations (about 5 times more polluted grid cells; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S13</xref>). Sizeable portions (about 23% of polluted grid cells) of these organic pollutants are naturally degraded. Further reductions in BOD concentrations by wastewater treatment are successful in removing river pollution in large parts of Europe (69%) and North America (68%), while in other regions (Indian sub-continent, mid-eastern China, South Korea, Brazil, Mexico, as well as smaller regions in Africa, south-eastern Asia) wastewater treatment remains insufficient to keep BOD concentrations below 5&#x02009;mg/l (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref> summarizes the number of people living near polluted rivers for major river basins around the world, with Asian basins (Ganges, Yangtze, Yellow &#x00026; Huai, Indus) topping the list. Note that about half of the affected people live in smaller basins scattered throughout the world. The numbers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref> also reveal the main pollution sources in each basin, i.e. urban (Yellow &#x00026; Huai), livestock (Ganges), or a combination of both (Yangtze). Natural degradation and wastewater treatment are most successful in reducing pollution impacts in the Rhine, Mississippi, and Danube basins.</p><p>These results largely agree with the notion of an environmental Kuznets curve<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>. Relatively low levels of pollution occur in both poor and rich nations due to, respectively, absence and control of pollution sources. Relatively high levels of pollution are found in rapidly developing nations characterized by urbanizing populations and expanding economies that have not yet implemented comprehensive control and treatment of pollution sources<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. There is however also large heterogeneity within countries. For example, China is one of the fastest growing economies in the world but its urban population and economic development are concentrated in the eastern part of the country. Likewise, organic river pollution is also concentrated in the east (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>), despite a higher rate of 55% wastewater treatment in eastern China compared to 20% in western China<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. While urban areas possess financial and technical resources for pollution control, control measures typically lag behind population increase.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Future patterns of organic river pollution</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2b</xref> shows computed BOD concentrations for the year 2050 resulting from projected changes in urban population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S9</xref>), intensive livestock farming (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figs S10</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S11</xref>), and river discharge (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S8</xref>), the latter due to climate change and changes in water extractions to support a growing global population. A sensitivity analysis suggests that the effect of temperature change on natural degradation is secondary (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">section S1</xref>) and it is thus not included. In all scenarios, wastewater treatment rates are kept constant at their current levels. As such, computed results give an indication of pollution impacts in the absence of additional investments beyond current treatment capacity to curb the global sanitation crisis.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref> shows that by 2050 the biggest deterioration is projected to occur in India, sub-Saharan Africa and Mexico, with many smaller regions all over the world also facing substantial challenges. Urbanization is the main factor in Africa, India, China, and parts of South America (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figs S9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S14a</xref>). Intensification of livestock farming is mainly a factor in India, Africa and South America (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S14b</xref>), while intensive livestock farming in Europe and China is expected to stay constant or decline in the coming decades, thereby reducing impacts on river basins in these regions. Finally, regions with a significant decrease in discharge, such as most parts of Europe, West Africa, western and southern Asia, and Latin America excluding the Amazon, experience a decrease in dilution capacity, which translates into increased pollution levels in several river basins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S14c</xref>: Ganges, Yangtze, Indus, Parana, Nile, Danube, Niger). Other basins (Yellow &#x00026; Huai, Mississippi) benefit from an increased dilution capacity due to a projected increase in mean discharge (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S8</xref>). However, increased discharge may also have negative effects not accounted for in our analysis. For example, cities may experience pollution surges as increases in urban stormwater overload the capacity of sewer systems and wastewater treatment plants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.</p><p>In terms of number of people affected, except for the Rhine, all basins listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref> are projected to experience increasing impacts in 2050 compared to 2000, with the largest increases in Ganges, Indus, Nile, and Niger. Reasons for these increases differ by basin. Urban population growth for the Yellow and Huai, Yangtze, and Mississippi, decreases in river discharge for the Danube basin, and a combination of all three factors for the Ganges, Indus, Parana, Nile, and Niger basins. Globally, a total of 2.5 billion people (26% of global population) will be affected by living near polluted rivers (BOD &#x0003e;5&#x02009;mg/l) in the year 2050, up from 1.1 billion people (19%) in the year 2000. Basins listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref> account for about half of affected people. This is a conservative estimate because several factors not accounted for in our analysis (industrial pollution, eutrophication, seasonal discharge cycles and smaller streams with limited dilution capacity) would further increase these numbers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Portfolio of wastewater solutions</title><p>Given that projected impacts are largest in developing regions, where wastewater treatment is still limited (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S6</xref>), there is an urgent and growing need for affordable wastewater solutions. In developed countries, organic river pollution from urban effluents has historically been reduced by a combination of environmental regulation and large-scale wastewater treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Such investments are likely not within reach of many developing regions, thus requiring a more decentralized approach<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Current efforts in that direction include subsidizing adoption of improved sanitation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, decentralized low-energy methods of wastewater treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, and novel ways of reusing wastewater<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p><p>As intensification and growth of livestock farming is driven by the global demand for meat and dairy, pollution impacts may also be tackled by economic policies such as pricing to more accurately reflect environmental and social costs. This is especially important in cases where international trade spatially separates meat consumption from the negative impacts of its production<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Such pricing policies, combined with a focus on raising environmental awareness of consumers, are useful tools for reducing global demand for meat and dairy.</p><p>Finally, additional pressure in several regions of projected reductions in river dilution capacity ties pollution control to basin-scale water management<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> and climate adaptation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, making dialogues with provincial and national governments as well as international cooperation important<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Any measures that increase freshwater availability may help here, such as reservoir releases and conjunctive use. Making water available for pollution control competes with several other water users and thus a proper balance needs to be found that considers all stakeholders.</p><p>In short, coordinated efforts are needed that combine innovative and affordable wastewater treatment with integrated water management, targeted economic policies, and consumer education. Spatially explicit evaluation of the full range of options holds great promise in addressing impacts of the global sanitation crisis, yet it remains largely unexplored.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Modelling strategy and equations</title><p>Any model must consider the trade-off between model complexity and data availability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. As such, a global model of organic river pollution cannot be expected to include all details and processes. Instead, our modelling strategy was to focus on the main drivers affecting spatial patterns of organic pollution in global river networks. Favourable comparison of the resulting model predictions to data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S11</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S9</xref> in the Supplement) confirms the validity of this approach. Assumptions and possible extensions of our model in light of available data are discussed in the next section. Here, we first provide more details on the conceptual and mathematical underpinnings of the model. Additional details on the methodology are available in the Supplement to this article.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref> shows a conceptual diagram of our approach for computing in-stream BOD concentrations as a function of urban organic pollution production, wastewater treatment, intensive livestock farming, upstream-downstream transport, dilution, and natural degradation.

However, locally, industrial pollution may still be an important factor: areas where our model underestimates observed concentrations due to potential industrial activities are identified and discussed in the Supplement. In the absence of globally extensive datasets, efforts to add industrial sources to the model should focus on these areas first.</p></list-item><list-item><p><underline>agricultural non-point sources</underline>: by their very nature, non-point sources, such as extensive livestock farming and manure applied to agricultural fields, contribute much lower BOD values than effluents from intensive livestock farming, albeit over larger areas. Previous work<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> in extensive livestock areas suggests that in-stream BOD levels exceed the range of natural water only during dry periods.

In the absence of systematic data on treatment efficiency in intensive livestock farming, we assumed a uniform efficiency of 85% (secondary level) based on the following considerations:(i) other studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref> considered intensive livestock farming a manufacturing activity subject to secondary or tertiary treatment, at least in European countries<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, (ii) in Asia, effluents from large livestock farms are either diluted and reused for irrigation, or processed through (an) aerobic treatment plants such as lagoons, resulting in organic removal rates that approach secondary treatment levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>, and (iii) a sensitivity analysis reveals that computed BOD concentrations are relatively insensitive to the assumed efficiency in Africa and South America because of the low fractions of livestock farming wastewater treatment in these regions (from 6% to 20%, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S6</xref>).</p></list-item></list></p><p>Finally, as with other climate change studies, our projections are subject to uncertainties in future population (e.g. grid-scale projected changes in urban population assume uniform exponential growth rates across each country<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>) and river discharge as simulated by a limited number of scenarios and generally imperfect global climate-hydrological models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. We note that projected river discharge applied in our model generally agrees with forecasting from IPCC (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2</xref>). In addition, one aim of our study is to estimate consequences of river pollution in the absence of additional investments in wastewater treatment. Thus, our projected results rely on the assumption that wastewater treatment remains at current levels.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article:</bold> Wen, Y. <italic>et al</italic>.

Without natural degradation and wastewater treatment (purple profiles), BOD concentrations gradually increase along the densely populated Rhine, whereas for the Yamuna-Ganges river a rapid increase near the cities of Delhi and Agra is followed by dilution with freshwater from several large tributaries. Pollutant loading from livestock farming adds significant pollution in both basins (red profiles). When natural degradation is taken into account (yellow profiles), BOD concentrations decrease significantly in both rivers, illustrating the self-cleaning capacity of natural rivers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Wastewater treatment (blue profiles) further reduces BOD concentrations, especially in the Rhine, but also near Delhi and Agra, which have higher rates of wastewater treatment than smaller cities further downstream<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="srep43289-f1"/></fig><fig id="f2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Global patterns of computed river BOD concentrations in the years 2000 and 2050<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="srep43289-f2"/></fig><fig id="f3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Number of people (in millions) living along polluted rivers in 10 major river basins.</title><p>Basins are listed from more to less polluted in the year 2000, with green and red arrows to the left indicating their change in ranking in the year 2050.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="srep43289-f3"/></fig><fig id="f4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Environmental Kuznets curves for the relation between computed country-wide organic river pollution (with and without wastewater treatment) and per capita income in the year 2000.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="srep43289-f4"/></fig><fig id="f5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Conceptual diagram of computing in-stream BOD concentrations.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="srep43289-f5"/></fig></floats-group></article>
