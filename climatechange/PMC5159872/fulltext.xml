A recent large-scale warming event in the North Pacific Ocean of unprecedented magnitude and duration allowed us to evaluate the sentinel status of giant kelp, a coastal foundation species that thrives in cold, nutrient-rich waters and is considered sensitive to warming. Here, we show that giant kelp and the majority of species that associate with it did not presage ecosystem effects of extreme warming off southern California despite giant kelp's expected vulnerability. Our results challenge the general perception that kelp-dominated systems are highly vulnerable to extreme warming events and expose the more general risk of relying on supposed sentinel species that are assumed to be very sensitive to climate change.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>Giant kelp is sometimes considered the &#x02018;canary in the coal mine' of coastal ecosystems.

Positive monthly temperature anomalies persisted through December 2015 with daily deviations as high as &#x0002b;5.8&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and monthly deviations averaging as much as &#x0002b;4.6&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. The unprecedented extent of the warming is evidenced by the occurrence and duration of unusually warm water events in 2014&#x02013;2015 compared with earlier in the time series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Fifty-eight per cent of the days during 2014 and 2015 (423 of 730 days) met the criteria of a marine heatwave (that is, five or more consecutive days when the mean temperature is warmer than the 90th percentile)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> compared with only 3.4&#x00025; (162 of 4,748 days) during the previous 13 years. Moreover, the duration of heatwaves averaged three times longer during 2014&#x02013;2015 (mean=39 days, maximum=151 days, <italic>n</italic>=11) compared with 2001&#x02013;2013 (mean=12 days, maximum=30 days, <italic>n</italic>=13).</p><p>Anomalies in bottom-water nitrate concentrations were negative in every month during 2014 and 2015 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Moreover, 2014&#x02013;2015 was characterized by three prolonged events with critically low nitrate (that is,&#x0003c;1&#x02009;&#x003bc;mol&#x02009;l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) lasting 50, 156 and 195 days, respectively, which collectively encompassed 54&#x00025; of the 2-year period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). In contrast, events of&#x0003c;1&#x02009;&#x003bc;mol&#x02009;l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> lasting at least 21 days (=maximum duration that growth in giant kelp can be sustained on internal nitrogen reserves<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>) were typically much shorter in duration in 2001&#x02013;2013, and collectively accounted for only 7&#x00025; of the days during this period.</p><p>Large storm waves tear out giant kelp and greatly alter kelp forest communities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Large winter swells coincided with the warm, nutrient-poor water associated with the severe El Ni&#x000f1;os of 1982&#x02013;1983 and 1997&#x02013;1998 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>), which made it difficult to disentangle the effects of ocean warming and low nutrients on kelp forests from those caused by wave disturbance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Unlike ocean temperature and nutrients, the wave climate in the Santa Barbara Channel during 2014 and 2015 was largely unremarkable. The largest monthly anomaly in maximum significant wave height during the recent warm period was 0.54&#x02009;m in October 2014 compared with 1.2&#x02009;m in March 1983 and 2.3&#x02009;m in February 1998 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Moreover, larger swells were recorded at our kelp forest study sites during the cool years of 2006 and 2008 than in the anomalously warm years of 2014 and 2015 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Thus, unlike during previous warming episodes of the latter twentieth century, anomalous disturbance from waves was not a confounding factor during the extreme warming in 2014&#x02013;2015.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Ecological responses</title><p>The community structure of kelp forests in the region varied substantially throughout the 15-year time series, but surprisingly, large responses to the unprecedented warm, nutrient-poor conditions were not obvious for most components of the community. In particular, we did not detect a dramatic response by giant kelp. Instead, we observed considerable inter-annual variability in its summer biomass with values for 2014 and 2015 within or slightly below the range of values recorded during the cooler years of the time series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Overall, kelp biomass decreased significantly during the 15-year record, but this decline was unrelated to anomalies in temperature in the previous year (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). Understory algae that grow on the sea floor beneath the canopy of giant kelp, and mobile reef fishes were even more unresponsive to the unprecedented warming, as their biomass did not vary significantly over time and remained well within the range of values observed during previous years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,f</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b,f</xref>). Moreover, multivariate analyses showed that the algal and fish assemblages did not differ appreciably between the cool and warm periods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a,c</xref>). Instead, the species composition of understory algae shifted gradually through time while that of reef fishes exhibited no consistent trend over the record.</p><p>Benthic sessile invertebrates that feed on plankton and other suspended matter in the water column constitute the largest consumer group in the kelp forest. Their biomass decreased significantly over the study period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>), but their decline was independent of the anomalously warm conditions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). The species assemblage of sessile invertebrates changed gradually over the course of the time series and showed a modest (21.3&#x00025;) dissimilarity between the cool (2001&#x02013;2013) and warm (2014&#x02013;2015) periods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The biomass of sea urchins, the most important grazers in kelp forests worldwide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, showed no consistent trend over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, neither the biomass of giant kelp nor understory algae explained any of the year-to-year variation in sea urchin biomass (neither variable met the 0.15 significance level for entry into a stepwise multiple regression model regardless of whether data for kelp and understory algae were derived from the same year as sea urchins or the previous year). Instead sea urchin biomass was negatively correlated with anomalies in bottom temperature (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>) Sea urchin biomass reached its lowest level in 2015 when it declined by 50&#x00025; from 2014. This abrupt decline is consistent with a rapid response to extreme warming that occurred during the previous 12 months. Indeed, our observations suggested that this abrupt decline resulted from an infectious disease (as evidenced by visible lesions on the epidermis) that is known to spread rapidly during warm periods<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. The absence of a large positive response by giant kelp and understory algae coinciding with this decrease in sea urchin biomass, and the generally poor correlation between sea urchins and their algal food supply throughout the time series, emphasizes the complexity of biotic and abiotic interactions in kelp-dominated systems<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>.</p><p>The most dramatic response to warming was observed in sea stars, an important group of invertebrate predators. Unlike other components of the kelp forest community, sea stars were increasing before the onset of warming in 2014, which accounted for an overall increasing trend during the time series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). However, in 2014 an epidemic outbreak of wasting disease led to mass mortalities of at least 20 species of sea stars from Alaska to Mexico<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Sea star biomass in the kelp forests off Santa Barbara declined to near zero by 2015. Museum specimens show that the densovirus linked to this disease has been present on the Pacific coast of North America for at least 72 years<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> and the anomalously warm water temperatures have been implicated in increasing its spread and the mortality rate in sea stars<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. This implication is consistent with the negative relationship that we observed between sea star biomass and bottom temperature anomalies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>). So far the mass mortalities of sea stars have not led to corresponding increases in their prey. The biomass of piddocks and shelled gastropods, favourite prey of sea stars, did not change appreciably in the 2 years following the disappearance of sea stars (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), although increases in these longer-lived animals may be expected in the future if sea stars do not recover.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Giant kelp populations are naturally quite variable, so changes in kelp forests can easily be misinterpreted unless viewed in the context of long-term data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Longer and more spatially comprehensive records of giant kelp and sea surface temperature (SST) obtained from satellite imagery confirm the patterns documented by divers and moored sensors at our study sites. Large seasonal and interannual fluctuations in giant kelp biomass characterized all of southern California from 1984&#x02013;2015 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). However, negative-kelp anomalies during 2014&#x02013;2015 from Santa Barbara to the Mexican border in San Diego were within the range observed during the 32-year time series despite unprecedented positive anomalies in ocean temperatures during this period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). This result is quite surprising given giant kelp's reported sensitivity to such conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> and stands in contrast to reports from other kelp systems showing sharp declines in response to warming conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. The location of our study within giant kelp's range offers one possible explanation for the difference; southern California, and Santa Barbara in particular, does not represent either the geographical or thermal limit for the species in the northeast Pacific<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> although San Diego is on average 1&#x02013;4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C warmer than Santa Barbara and closer to giant kelp's thermal limit (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Nevertheless, giant kelp populations are highly adapted to local nutrient conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> and the potential for rapid dispersal from distant populations that are better adapted to sudden changes in local conditions is limited<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Thus, similar to that shown for other habitat forming seaweeds<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, we would expect giant kelp populations far from the range edge to be equally sensitive to large and sustained anomalies in temperature and nutrients such as those associated with the recent warming event.</p><p>Anthropogenic climate change is predicted to cause the extinction of thousands of species over the next century<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> so understanding the responses of species to climate change is perhaps the most pressing issue facing ecologists today. Anomalous environmental conditions offer exceptional opportunities to test our expectations for ecosystem responses to climate change. The lack of an expected response to an extreme event, as in our study, reveals our limited ability to predict responses to longer term changes. Such limits on our forecasting ability underscore the key role of long-term data in detecting the effects of climate change on ecosystems as they occur<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, prompting calls for the need to identify and monitor sentinel species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Indeed, given the cost of collecting long-term data, efforts to focus research on the most sensitive and vulnerable species seem wise. However, our results expose the potential dangers of relying on easily measured iconic species with supposed sensitive traits as sentinels for evaluating ecosystem responses to climate change. We suggest that in the absence of an ability to reliably predict sentinel species, broader spectrum ecological monitoring is necessary to inform us of the status of biodiversity in the face of climate change.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Study region</title><p>We collected oceanographic and ecological data from 2001&#x02013;2015 at nine kelp forest sites located at 7&#x02013;10&#x02009;m depth along an 80&#x02009;km stretch of the mainland coast of the Santa Barbara Channel in southern California, USA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Oceanographic data</title><p>Sea temperature was measured every 10&#x02009;min using loggers (Stowaway Onset tidbits, accuracy&#x000b1;0.2&#x02009;&#x000b0;C; Onset Computer, Bourne, Massachusetts, USA) fastened to the bottom at each site.

The rationale for this definition is based on previous studies that concluded concentrations of nitrate&#x0003c;1&#x02009;&#x003bc;mol&#x02009;l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> are not sufficient to support normal growth in <italic>Macrocystis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> and its internal nitrogen reserves become exhausted within 21 days without any external supplies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Ecological data</title><p>Annual community surveys of marine flora and fauna were performed by divers using SCUBA in late July to early August each year. Sampling was done within 34 permanently located 40&#x02009;m &#x000d7; 2&#x02009;m plots distributed among the nine kelp forest sites. The density and size of giant kelp, large solitary understory algae, large mobile invertebrates and reef-associated fishes were measured within each plot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Smaller mobile invertebrates and solitary algae were counted within six 1&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup> quadrats placed at 8&#x02009;m intervals along the 40&#x02009;m axis of each plot. The per cent cover of sessile invertebrates and understory algae that are impractical to count as individuals was measured at 80 uniformly spaced points within each plot. Data on size and abundance of each species counted in the surveys were converted into biomass using species specific relationships developed for algae<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, invertebrates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> and fish<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref> in the region. Mean biomass values for the different taxonomic groups examined were calculated for each of the nine sites and then averaged to produce a regional mean value for each year.</p><p>Longer more spatially comprehensive records of giant kelp canopy biomass were estimated at 30-m resolution from 1984&#x02013;2015 using multispectral Landsat 5 and 7 Thematic Mapper satellite imagery following procedures developed by Cavanaugh <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Kelp canopy biomass was estimated using the observed relationship between diver-estimated kelp canopy biomass at our study sites and Landsat pixel kelp fraction. Cloud-free imagery allowed kelp biomass to be estimated approximately monthly. Seasonal canopy biomass determinations for each 30&#x02009;m &#x000d7; 30&#x02009;m pixel along the mainland coast of the counties of Santa Barbara, Los Angeles and San Diego Channel were summed to produce a value of kelp canopy biomass for each county, for each season of the 32-year time series.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The primary focus of our study was on detecting regional responses to a large-scale warming event. Therefore, our analyses involved models using regional means averaged across the nine sites rather than estimates of the mean and variance of variables from the time series of individual sites (for example, the regional mean and variance in the relationship between local kelp biomass and local temperature that would be derived from a mixed effects model). Thus we evaluated the amount of variation in the regional summer biomass of the different functional groups of kelp forest species that was explained by anomalous warming using stepwise multiple regression with a threshold level of significance=0.15 for entry into the model (SAS 9.4, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Annual anomalies in bottom temperature for the 12-month period preceding the summer measurements of biomass were used as an independent variable in the regression analysis of each functional group. Year was included as an additional independent continuous variable to account for temporal trends not explained by anomalous oceanographic conditions. Multi-collinearity of the two independent variables was low in all cases; condition indices were&#x0003c;26 and variance inflation factors&#x0003c;2 for all analyses.</p><p>Differences in the species structure of understory algae, sessile invertebrates and reef fishes before and after the extreme warming were analysed using multidimensional scaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref> and permutation-based analysis of variance using Type III sums of squares<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref> followed by similarity percentages (SIMPER) to decompose the contributions of individual species leading to dissimilarities (Bray&#x02013;Curtis) between the cool (2001&#x02013;2013) and warm (2014&#x02013;2015) periods. While multidimensional scaling plots provide an intuitive means of evaluating differences in species assemblages among years, the statistical significance of differences between cool and warm periods as determined by permutation-based analysis of variance should be viewed with caution due to the unbalanced replication of years between the two periods.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Data availability</title><p>Data collected by SBC LTER that support the findings of this study are available with the following identifiers: kelp forest species biomass doi:10.6073/pasta/449a810468445ef1ce60769466cd1fad; bottom temperature: doi:10.6073/pasta/c3ec3193ba97e7670b532cfbbe1632f9; Landsat kelp biomass (1984&#x02013;2011) doi:10.6073/pasta/329658f19d5e61dda0be5ee883cd1c41; Landsat kelp biomass (2012&#x02013;2015) available from authors.
