The land use types of study area are six, of which three are the main and the other three are the minor. The main three, forest, shrub or bush land and grassland, changed during the period, of which grasslands reduced by 5864&#x000a0;ha (40%), forest by 3071&#x000a0;ha (24%) and shrub and bush land increased by 8912&#x000a0;ha (43%). The other three minor land use types were bare land which had reduced by 238&#x000a0;ha (45%), river bed vegetation increased by 209&#x000a0;ha (72%) and agriculture increased by 52&#x000a0;ha (600%) over the period decades. Differences in spatiotemporal variations of vegetation could be largely attributed to the effects of climate factors, anthropogenic activities and their interactions. Precipitation and temperature have been demonstrated to be the key climate factors for plant growth and vegetation development where rainfall decreased by 200&#x000a0;mm and temperatures increased by 1.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C over the period. Also, the opinion of the community on the change of land use and management was attributed to climate change and also adaptation strategies applied by the community over time. For example unlike the common understanding that forest resources utilisation increases with increasing human population, Mukogodo dry forested ecosystem case is different in that the majority of the respondents (78.9%) reported that the forest resource use was more in that period than now and also a similar majority (74.2%) had the same opinion that forest resource utilisation was low compared to last 30&#x000a0;years. In Yaaku community, change impacts were evidenced and thus mitigation measures suggested to address the impacts which included the following: controlled bush management and indigenous grass reseeding programme were advocated to restore original grasslands, and agricultural (crop farming) activities are carried out in designated areas outside the forest conservation areas (ecosystem zoning) all in consultation with government (political class), community and other stakeholders. Groups are organised (environmental management committee) to address conservation, political and vulnerability issues in the pastoral dry forested ecosystem which will sustain pastoralism in the ecosystem.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Detection</kwd><kwd>Climate change adaptations</kwd><kwd>Impacts</kwd><kwd>Dry forested ecosystem</kwd><kwd>Land use</kwd><kwd>Vegetation cover</kwd><kwd>Yaaku</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">An understanding of land use or land cover change at local, regional and global scales is important in an increasingly human dominated biosphere. The terms land cover and land use, although often used interchangeably, their actual meanings are quite distinct. Land cover refers to the surface cover on the ground, while land use refers to the purpose the land serves. In this study, the terms are used interchangeably because both aspects are in consideration. Change detection is an important process in monitoring and managing natural resources, land use change analysis, monitoring of shifting cultivation and assessment of deforestation because it provides quantitative analysis of the spatial distribution of the population of interest.</p><p id="Par3">Laikipia County is predominantly a livestock rearing county with ranches occupying over 50% of the entire land and 580&#x000a0;km<sup>2</sup> of land covered by six gazetted and one non-gazetted forest. These forests are either natural or artificial in establishment, for instance Mukogodo dry forest is one of natural forests not gazetted at the lee ward side of Mount Kenya and inhabited by an indigenous and minority community known as the Yaaku. However, some factors such as forest fires, deforestation and grazing have largely led to depletion of the forest cover over the years. Poles, pastures, wood fuel and timber are the forest main products. The provision of setting of bee hives, research ground on flora, natural herbs and wildlife habitat for instance for elephants and birds has all been provided by this forest. In Mukogodo, ecotourism is a dominant activity through conservation of natural forests particularly at Iligwesi, kurikuri and lekuruki community conservancies. .</p><p id="Par4">The other land use patterns in the county are pastoralism, mixed farming, ranching, agro-pastoral, marginal mixed farming, much influenced by the climatic conditions and the ecological zones.</p><p id="Par5">The Yaaku community resides in the group ranches of kurikuri and lekuruki which include the forested ecosystem of Mukogodo.</p><p id="Par6">Laikipia County Government (LCG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2013&#x02013;2017</xref>) indicates that most vulnerable areas to climate change phenomenon are forested dry lands of Kenya. This is brought about by the friable nature of the environment that has been caused by encroachment by agricultural activities linked to increased human population and followed by unsustainable land use activities. In this regard, the frequency and severity of both droughts and floods are already high and are expected to increase in coming years (LCG, 2013&#x02013;2017). Availability of rainfall determines the smallholder farming and livestock production though the latter is dominant in the Mukogodo ecosystem. Major impacts of droughts on smallholder activities have increased food insecurity (food shortage and poverty) and loss of livelihoods (LCG, 2013&#x02013;2017).</p><p id="Par7">Pastoral communities in Laikipia have similar climate change impacts and concerns with other forested dry lands of Kenya, although, means to food security of communities varied from place to place as do the adaptation strategies to environmental hazards such as drought and floods, of which Laikipia County is no exception. Therefore, each agro-ecological zone has distinct challenges in maintaining food security, which often cut across all the sectors. Thus, the forested dry land of Laikipia County has different and distinct challenges from other agro-ecological zones.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study area</title><p id="Par8">The study was conducted in Mukogodo East Ward, which is in Laikipia North Sub-county of Laikipia County of Kenya. The Laikipia County lies between latitude 0&#x000b0; 18&#x02033; and 0&#x000b0; 51&#x02033; north and between longitude 36&#x000b0; 11&#x02033; and 37&#x000b0; 24&#x02032; east. It occupies an area of 9462&#x000a0;km<sup>2</sup> (2,338,111 acres) (LCG, 2013&#x02013;2017).</p><p id="Par9">As indicated in the map of the study area, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the Mukogodo East ward is composed of four locations, namely Makurian, Sieku, Mukogodo (Mumonyot) and Iipolei locations: Mukogodo East Ward borders, Mukogodo west to the west, Umande Ward to the south, Meru County to the east and Isiolo County to the north. The area is mainly dry forested ecosystem with grass undergrowth. The study site and the hazard (climate change) were identified by community participatory methodology known as community-managed disaster and risk reduction (CMDRR).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>A map of Laikipia County showing the study site</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10661_2018_6630_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par10">The pastoralist groups are found on the arid and semi-arid lands (ASALs), which constitute 84% of the country&#x02019;s area unlike the hunters and gatherers whose ecosystem is not well defined (IFAD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2012</xref>). As reported by IFAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2012</xref>), the difference between hunter, gatherers and pastoralists is not clear-cut since some hunters and gatherers keep cattle and many pastoralists mix livestock herding with other subsistence strategies (cultivation, hunting, gathering). The Yaaku is in this category where they are among the old Cushite groups in the Rift Valley of Tanzania and Kenya that became associated with various Nilotic tribes like clients, mostly as self-defence for their own preservation under the various waves of Nilotic migration into their ancestral area (Orville <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1996</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">The Yaaku are associated with the Maasai of Kenya and majority speak Maa language and are referred to as the <italic>Mukogodo</italic> Maasai. <italic>Athii</italic> and <italic>Mwoko</italic>re are names given to the Yaaku in the traditions by highland Bantus like Kikuyu and Meru. The Maasai called these early Cushitic people by the name Dorobo. The <italic>Dorobo</italic> are not one tribe but referred to various original forest-dwelling hunters-gatherers (Southern or Eastern Cushite). One connotation of <italic>Dorobo</italic> is poor people who do not own cattle (Orville <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1996</xref>). The Yaaku consider themselves Maasai and speak Maa language because they have gotten completely into Maasai culture and language. Between 1925 and 1936, they left their Cushitic language Yaaku for the Eastern Nilotic Maasai language (Yaaku dice database&#x02014;Internet). The hunters and gatherers have knowledge of the forests natural resources, its animals and its trees, the individual properties and use of thousands of plants, where to find and gather honey and how to use them in a sustainable way; this has not only sustained the hunters and gatherers themselves but has benefited their neighbours, with whom exchange networks have been established and functioned for centuries. Their neighbours are the Maasai and Samburu who are pastoralists and the Meru who are agro-pastoralists.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Topography</title><p id="Par12">At Ewaso Nyiro Basin in the north, the county altitude lies between 1500&#x000a0;m above sea level and 2611&#x000a0;m in the south. Marmanet Forest is found at a height of 2611&#x000a0;m above sea level. Mukogodo and Loldaiga forests are other areas of high altitude in the eastern part of the County. These areas lie at 2200&#x000a0;m above sea level (LCG, 2013&#x02013;2017). As illustrated in Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the Mukogodo Forest is the home of Yaaku community who occupy Mukogodo and Sieku locations of Mukogodo East Ward of Laikipia North Sub County of Laikipia County.

The population projection for year 2017 is 479,072 persons. The study targeted a small pastoralist community of about 4000 inhabitants &#x0201c;not certain&#x0201d; for they were included in category of &#x0201c;others&#x0201d; in 2009 population census (IFAD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2012</xref>), called the Yaaku living in Mukogodo and Sieku locations of Mukogodo East Ward of Laikipia County.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Vegetation cover</title><p id="Par14">Vegetation is an assemblage of plant species of the ground cover and canopy they provide. In Mukogodo dry forested ecosystem, the ground cover is mainly grasses and open canopy made of Cedar, Podo, Olive, Croton, Lichen, Ferns and Orchids. The shrubby vegetation mainly is Euclear and Tachonathus. The ecosystem is determined by the bioclimatic zone between the Mount Kenya wet forest and the north eastern savannahs of Kenya. Therefore, this vegetation cover is used as an indicator to evaluate terrestrial environmental conditions. Changes in the spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation alter the structures and functions of the landscape, thereby affecting ecological processes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Land use and land cover</title><p id="Par15">Whereas land cover indicates the physical land type such as forest or open water, consequently, land use documents how people are using the land and therefore land use data documents show how much of a region is covered by forests, wetlands, agriculture, bare areas and water types. An understanding of land use/land cover change at local, regional and global scales is important in an increasingly human-dominated biosphere. The terms land cover and land use, although often used interchangeably, their actual meanings are quite distinct. Land cover refers to the surface cover on the ground, while land use refers to the purpose the land serves (Shiraz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2014</xref>). Land cover/land use has been used extensively to derive a number of biophysical variables, such as vegetation index and biomass (Shunlin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2008</xref>). Land use and land cover are important components in understanding the interactions of the human activities with the environment, and thus, it is necessary to be able to simulate changes (Kuldeep and Kamlesh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2011</xref>). Land use and land cover change have become a central component in current strategies for managing natural resources and monitoring environmental change (Kuldeep and Kamlesh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2011</xref>). The properties measured with remote sensing techniques relate to land cover, from which land use can be inferred, particularly with supplementary data or a priori knowledge (Noam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1999</xref>). The detection of land use/land cover change is the process of identifying differences in the state of an object or phenomenon by observing it at different times (Singh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1989</xref>).</p><p id="Par16">The Mukogodo dry forested ecosystem has various land uses over the period of investigations ranging from gathering of fruits, honey harvesting, medicinal plants harvesting grazing, agriculture by the inhabitants the Yaaku community and tourism.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Change detection</title><p id="Par17">Change detection for GIS (geographical information systems) is a process that measures how the attributes of a particular area have changed between two or more time periods. Therefore, change detection involves comparing aerial photographs or satellite imagery of the area taken at different times or epoch. Change detection is an important process in monitoring and managing natural resources, land use change analysis, monitoring of shifting cultivation and assessment of deforestation because it provides quantitative analysis of the spatial distribution of the population of interest. The increasing impact of land cover change on the environment has been an issue of concern in the developed and the developing countries with consequential effects on sustainable development and long-term impact on the agricultural and other sectors of the economy. This involves the spatial and non-spatial data to query new information. Vegetation cover analysis has been carried out in Kenya by Tracy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">(2005)</xref> and Ayuyo and Sweta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2014</xref>) all of whom carried land change detection for Mau Water tower.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Climate change adaptations</title><p id="Par18">Climate change adaptation is a response to global warming and climate change, which seeks to reduce the vulnerability of social and biological systems to relatively sudden change and thus offset the effects of global warming. Adaptation is especially important in developing countries since those countries are predicted to bear the brunt of the effects of global warming. That is, the capacity and potential for humans to adapt (called adaptive capacity) are unevenly distributed across different regions and populations, and developing countries generally have less capacity to adapt.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Dry forested ecosystem</title><p id="Par19">Temperatures are high all year, but there is a better-developed dry season than in the tropical rain forest. Evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation for enough of the year to have a significant effect on the vegetation. Edaphic conditions (dryer, better-drained soil) may produce this vegetation type in the rain-forest zone. Soils are essentially like those of tropical rain forests, with the same processes. The deciduousness of most tree species is a significant difference from the tropical rain forest. Many evergreen tree species of the rain forest become deciduous in this zone. Growing conditions are not so optimal; thus, the tree canopy is lower (10&#x02013;30&#x000a0;m) than in the tropical rain forest and the trees less dense where drought is more extreme. The undergrowth is often dense and tangled because of greater light penetration. Species diversity is invariably lower than in nearby tropical rain forests. Environmental stress increases with instability (seasonality) of the environment, and fewer plants and animals can generate homeostatic mechanisms (for internal stability) to cope. Trees have thicker bark (anti-fire adaptation), thicker and smaller leaves (anti-desiccation adaptation), thorns (anti- herbivore adaptation), longer roots (to reach deeper water table) and other features along a gradient toward the well-developed drought adaptations of woody plants of the savanna and desert zones, The high productivity during the rainy season, coupled with relief from rains during the dry season, makes this a favourable environment for humans and domestic stock; so much of the zone has been cleared and developed for pastureland as well as agriculture.</p><p id="Par20">Mukogodo forest, spanning 30,000&#x000a0;ha of rugged hillside terrain in North West Laikipia, is the largest and best preserved of all the region&#x02019;s forests. That it has remained almost wholly intact is a tribute, not only to a relatively remote location and dry surroundings, but also to the astute custodianship of the Yaaku hunter-gatherers who, for centuries, have been living in the forest (CGL ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2017</xref>). The forest and the adjacent areas (community conservancies) totals to about 50,000&#x000a0;ha which were under study.</p><p id="Par21">This community has succeeded, in the absence of conservation interventions from without, in warding off loggers intent on plundering the area&#x02019;s Pencil Cedar trees, and in regulating access by pastoralist communities to grazing in the forest during dry spells. The integrity of the forest has been widely respected as a result. And today, Mukogodo is extolled as a model of sustainable use, and of the capacity of local people to safeguard the forest resources on which they depend.</p><p id="Par22">As well as impressive stands of Pencil Cedar and Olive, Mukogodo boasts some magnificent Crotons, <italic>C. megalocarpus</italic>, tall, graceful trees that are typical of dry forest habitats, having flattish, spreading crowns and layered silvery leaves. The nectar of the creamy-white Croton flowers attracts countless bees, providing local community groups with a rich source of honey. In the northern reaches of the forest, other plants&#x02014;such as giant <italic>Euphorbia candelabrum</italic> trees and &#x0201c;blue-bark&#x0201d; Commiphoras, <italic>C. baluensis</italic>&#x02014;come into their own. Before the rains, the Dombeya, <italic>D. rotundifolia</italic>, produces exquisite bunches of pale pink flowers resembling cherry blossoms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par23">The study population composed of 800 households in Mukogodo and Sieku locations in Mukogodo East Ward while the sampling frame, from which the study sample was drawn constituted all the households living in the nine villages of these two locations. The unit of analysis was the household, and the subject of analysis (the respondent) was the head of the household or their representative.</p><p id="Par24">In each of the nine villages, a list of the households was compiled during the process of community managed disaster and risk reduction (CMDRR) as used by Abdi and Cord Aid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2011</xref>), IIRR and Cord Aid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>) and CARE International (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2015</xref>), and systematic sampling was used to pick numbers of households (actually about 30% of households) from each village (Borg and Gall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2003</xref>). Then, random sampling was undertaken among the systematically selected households in each village to constitute a study sample of 240 households.</p><p id="Par25">Two formulae (from Mugenda and Mugenda <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1999</xref> and Kathuri and Pals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1993</xref>) were used for computing the study sample size but yielded rather large sample sizes that could not be sustained by the available resources for the study. According to Kathuri and Pals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1993</xref>), a minimum of 100 is recommended for a survey research and gives a reasonable unit for analysis.</p><p id="Par26">Borg and Gall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2003</xref>) indicated that at least 30% of the total population is representative. Thus, 30% of the accessible population is enough for the sample size. Thus, in this study, 30% of 800 households were 240 respondents.</p><p id="Par27">Hence, resorting to the provisions of the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) programme suggests that any sample size of 200 and above will allow perfect functioning of all the analytical procedures provided by the programme.</p><p id="Par28">A socio-ecological survey using a structured questionnaire was used to collect respondent&#x02019;s opinion on climate changes and adaptation on land use and management in specific based on livelihood capitals(natural capital) for the last three decades from 1986 to 2015.

The rainfall general net decrease of 200&#x000a0;mm was witnessed over the period, of which the most affected were the traditionally known seasons of MAM and OND. The change in rainfall over the study period in Yaaku community of Mukogodo forested ecosystem was attributed to climate change.

However, the variability in climate (rainfall and temperatures) had contributed to the change in land use and management of the pastoral forested ecosystem of Mukogodo in which there were decrease of grassland (40%), forest (24%), bare land (45%) and increase of shrub/bush land (43%), riverbed vegetation (72%) and agriculture (600%) cover by the last three decades.</p><p id="Par63">The opinion of the community on the change of land use and management was attributed to climate change and also adaptation strategies applied by the community over time, as evidenced by Niang et al.

Climate change impacts include shortening or disruption of growing seasons, reductions or increase in the area suitable for agriculture and declines in agricultural yields in many regions of sub-Saharan Africa. In Yaaku community, all these impacts were evidenced and thus mitigation measures were suggested to address the impacts. on harvesting of forest products, species biodiversity (trees, shrubs, herbs, pastures), forest water resources (rivers, springs), wildlife numbers, land use (degradation), livestock keeping (cattle/goats) and bee keeping,.</p><p id="Par64">The phenomenon was contrary to the norm and explained by the community having strong adaptation structure and strategies to impacts of climate change; thus, forest conservation measures were enforced. Kenya Forest Service (KFS) which manages gazetted forest were not managing Mukogodo forest apart from small portion managed by Lekuruki conservancy and proposed Kurikuri conservancy which are community based, but the bigger forested area of the Yaaku community was generally community managed. The same results of increase of forest and shrubby cover are evidenced by remote sensed.</p><p id="Par65">The indication was that although there was increase of forest cover due to reduced use of forest resources, the biodiversity of the vegetation species reduced progressively probably due to effects of climate change. There is a need to have ecological research to document the species composition of the Mukogodo ecosystem and their change over the period. The change of species diversity and degradation of scenery site of caves due to climate change has reduced tourism activity around Mukogodo forest.</p><p id="Par66">As the changes in livelihood system from hunters and gatherers of the Yaaku community to pastoral livelihood, came in with grazing and browsing which lead to ecosystem degradation, in deep discussions with focus group and key informant&#x02019;s interviews, the degradation was attributed to increase of livestock being grazed in the forested ecosystem.</p><p id="Par67">The adaptations to climate change in the Yaaku Community and in general in the county of Laikipia are addressed by the political class as development issues which are top down approach.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par68">There are main land use changes in the three decades under study.
