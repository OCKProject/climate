This region, inhabited by about 400 million, is one of the most densely populated in the world (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The rich soils in this region were formed by sedimentary deposits from the Yellow, Huai, and Hai rivers, providing excellent conditions for agriculture. The rainfall levels are relatively low compared to similar locations in South China, making irrigation necessary for supplementing soil water during the spring to early summer growing season (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This fertile plain has experienced vast expansion of irrigated agriculture which impacts significantly the surface radiation, surface energy balance, and boundary layer development in ways that impact surface humidity, and temperature.

Severe heatwaves have been experienced in China, particularly since the beginning of the twenty-first century<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The surface mean temperature averaged over China has increased by about 1.35&#x02009;&#x000b0;C during 1951&#x02013;2006, a rate of about 0.24&#x02009;&#x000b0;C/decade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, which is larger than the corresponding global rate of about 0.13&#x02009;&#x000b0;C/decade during 1956&#x02013;2005<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In July and August of 2003, extremely hot weather conditions lasting for 20&#x02013;50 days occurred at many sites over South China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. During this period, the daily maximum temperature recorded in many locations south of Yangtze River was above 38&#x02009;&#x000b0;C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Heatwaves extended across most of China in 2006, with daily maximum temperature reaching 35&#x02009;&#x000b0;C at 22 stations in Chongqing, Central China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In summer 2013, a severe heatwave event occurred in Eastern China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The daily maximum temperatures in many stations were extreme, breaking the historical records. Around Shanghai, the 141-year temperature record was exceeded, and the heatwave resulted in the death of dozens of people<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Studies on heatwaves often (but not always) focus on surface temperature as the main variable used for characterizing their intensity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However, consideration of surface humidity is as important as that of surface temperature in defining heatwaves, since humidity impacts how humans feel heat stress. Building on earlier work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> that defined a threshold for human survivability based on the magnitude of TW (an integrated measure of temperature and humidity), we have recently adopted the use of the daily TW<sub>max</sub>, computed from a 6-h moving average time series, for characterizing the intensity of heatwaves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The choice of TW is motivated by the fact that the skin of a sweating human body can be approximated by this temperature, and the choice of 6&#x02009;h is rooted in the assumption that a healthy human may not survive outdoors at a TW of 35&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for more than 6&#x02009;h. Hence, TW<sub>max</sub> of 35&#x02009;&#x000b0;C is assumed as physiologic threshold for survival of humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The choice of this variable has important implications regarding where we may expect to see severe heatwaves, since a typical TW (dry-bulb temperature) for a forest would be significantly warmer (colder) than the corresponding value for a desert along the same latitude.</p><p id="Par6">Previous studies concluded that irrigation impacts the land-surface energy balance and atmospheric boundary layer development significantly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The direct effects of irrigation are to enhance evapotranspiration, to cool the surface temperature, and to moisten the air<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The cooler surface emits significantly less long-wave radiation upward (Stephan&#x02013;Boltzmann law), and the moistened air emits significantly more long-wave radiation towards the surface (water vapor greenhouse effect). As a result, irrigation tends to enhance the net long-wave radiation available to fuel total flux of latent and sensible heat into the atmosphere. Similarly, irrigation may impact how the surface absorbs incoming solar radiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, but the sign of that effect would depend on the nature of land cover before irrigation. In addition, irrigation impacts the development of the atmospheric boundary layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Irrigation reduces the sensible heat flux resulting in lowering of the depth of the atmospheric boundary layer. Hence, irrigation enhances the total flux of heat only slightly, but results in a significantly shallower boundary layer. Considering the total energy of the surface air in the atmospheric boundary layer, including latent and sensible forms, as measured by the TW over extensively irrigated plains such as those in the NCP, we would expect an enhanced magnitude of the boundary layer energy per unit mass as measured by variables such as moist static energy or the TW.</p><p id="Par7">In two recent studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, the impact of climate change on heatwaves was investigated at the global scale, using observations and simulations of surface temperature and humidity. Although China was identified in one of these studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> as one of the impacted regions, the relatively coarse resolution and global focus of their analysis precluded identification of hotspots for heatwaves at regional and local scales within China. The same studies did not include analysis of the impact of irrigation on heatwaves. The high resolution of our simulations, including representation of irrigation processes, makes it feasible to address these two important topics.</p><p id="Par8">In this study, we project based on an ensemble of high-resolution regional climate model simulations that climate change would add significantly to the anthropogenic effects of irrigation, increasing the risk from heatwaves over the NCP region, an area with extensive irrigation development covering a relatively large fraction of the land surface.

We perform simulations for historical period (1975&#x02013;2005), as well as future climate (2070&#x02013;2100) assuming two scenarios of GHG emissions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> (BAU scenario (RCP8.5) and moderate mitigation scenario (RCP4.5)) (see Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, Supplementary Information for simulations domain, and Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). For the historical and future period, we performed six sets of simulations, with and without irrigation. By comparing the historical period simulations, with and without irrigation, we estimate the impact of irrigation on heatwaves in the historical climate period as described by the TW. The results of these simulations reveal a significant role for irrigation in enhancing the magnitude of extreme TW<sub>max</sub> and hence the intensity of heatwaves. (By &#x0201c;extreme&#x0201d; we mean maximum simulated value over this period.) Over the irrigated region and NCP, the extreme TW<sub>max</sub> over a 30-year period increases by about 0.5 and 0.3&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, respectively, as a result of irrigation during historical period. This impact of irrigation is even larger, if we consider the average TW<sub>max</sub> instead of extreme values, and more pronounced during the relatively drier months of early summer (May and June) (see Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). These are the months when irrigation has the largest impact on land surface conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Heatwaves due to climate change and irrigation</title><p id="Par10">The impacts of climate change are significantly larger than those of irrigation. The extreme TW<sub>max</sub> over irrigated area and NCP are projected to increase by an additional 3.4 and 3.3&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, respectively, assuming a BAU scenario of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with irrigation, while increases of extreme TW<sub>max</sub> are 2.9 and 3&#x02009;&#x000b0;C over irrigated area NCP, respectively, without irrigation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The spatial distribution of TW<sub>max</sub> under current and future climate features three regions with significantly warmer conditions: the NCP close to the Eastern coast, the Yangtze river valley, and the Southern coast. All these regions are characterized by relatively low elevation (lower than 50&#x02009;m) compared to the surrounding area (e.g., Yan Mountain and Yaihang Mountain (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>)), which is a major factor explaining occurrence of relatively warm conditions. Over several locations in the NCP and along the Eastern coast of China, such as the areas around Weifang, Jining, Qingdao, Rizhao, Yantai, Shanghai, and Hangzhou under the BAU scenario, TW<sub>max</sub> exceeds the critical threshold for human survival of 35&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, during several episodes over a 30-year period (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Moderate climate change mitigation efforts, represented by the RCP4.5 scenario of GHG emissions, reduce the risk of such heatwaves significantly; however, deadly heatwaves are still projected even under those conditions, though significantly less frequent (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

In comparison to the Persian Gulf and South Asia, NCP is the only region within that Asian belt that is not influenced by a warm ocean or sea next to it.

The representation of surface processes and other physical parametrizations in our model represent a significant source of uncertainty. In order to minimize that source, we have tested the model against observations of surface temperature, humidity, and TW. As shown in the Supplementary Information (see Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref> and Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>), incorporation of irrigation improves significantly the skill of the model in reproducing the observed surface climate. Another source of uncertainty is the choice of the CMIP5 Global Climate Model simulations used in specifying the lateral boundary conditions for MRCM, historically and in the future. In order to reduce this uncertainty, we carefully selected only three climate models that show satisfactory performance in simulating the climate of this region (selection criteria described in the Methods section).

However, the magnitude of the projected enhancement of the risk of deadly heatwaves in China seems larger than the projected enhancements along the coasts of the Persian Gulf or over the Ganges and Indus valleys (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p><p id="Par15">China is currently the largest emitter of carbon dioxide, and the rates of emission has increased sharply since the beginning of the twenty-first century<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.

Under the BAU scenario of greenhouse gas emissions, NCP is likely to experience deadly heatwaves with TW exceeding the threshold defining what Chinese farmers may tolerate, while working outdoors without air conditioning.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Description of MRCM</title><p id="Par17">MRCM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> used in the study is based on the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics Regional Climate Model Version 3 (RegCM3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> but with several improvements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, achieved through incorporation of new physical schemes or modification of original schemes MRCM has been rigorously tested against observations, in its ability to simulate key observed climate features, across several regions (e.g., North America<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, West Africa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, Southwest Asia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, South Asia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, Maritime Continent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>). In particular, previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> tested extensively the performance of the irrigation module used within MRCM. Hence, we use MRCM, including the irrigation module, to simulate climate over China, a region which probably has the largest irrigated area in the world<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Irrigation is simulated in the model, by replenishing the root-zone soil moisture to field capacity at the beginning of each month, whenever needed during summer (May to September), and wherever the grid point is equipped for irrigation according to the Historical Irrigation Data Set<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Simulation of the summer climate of North China Plain (NCP)</title><p id="Par18">Before making climate projections, we analyze simulations by the MRCM constrained by boundary conditions from reanalysis data and evaluate its performance against observations. The rationale for carrying these experiments is to test the model skill in reproducing observed regional climate, as well as to study the impact of land use change on the historical climate of the region. As irrigation is widely practiced in NCP (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), it is essential that we evaluate the impact of irrigation on surface climate. In this regard, additional 30 years (1982&#x02013;2011) numerical experiments consisting of control (CONT, without irrigation module) and irrigation (IRR, with irrigation module) simulations are performed using MRCM (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). The MRCM experiments adopt the same model configuration (e.g., domain coverage, spatiotemporal resolution, and physical parameters) as one used in the GCM downscaling, but are driven by the 1.5&#x000b0;&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;1.5&#x000b0; 6-hourly ERA-Interim data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> as lateral boundary conditions and the 1&#x000b0;&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;1&#x000b0; weekly NOAA optimum interpolation sea surface temperatures for the ocean surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. To evaluate the two simulations, we compare the simulated surface conditions to the Climate Research Unit (CRU)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> data, focusing on several key surface variables such as surface temperature (Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>), specific humidity (Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>), and TW (Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>). The finger print of irrigation can be seen clearly by comparing field observations of surface conditions to the results of the numerical model simulations. Without explicit representation of irrigation and its direct and indirect effects, models would consistently simulate a summer climate over the NCP that features warmer temperature, drier air, and cooler TW. These difference between simulations and observations are consistent with the finger print of irrigation. Indeed, inclusion of a reasonable representation of irrigation into the model improves the correspondence between the model results and observations in terms of surface temperature, atmospheric humidity, and surface TW, leading to statistically significant reductions of overall biases. In a recent coordinated set of numerical models&#x02019; simulations over Eastern China, a warm and dry bias in surface conditions was identified as a common deficiency in the ability of other regional climate models (without irrigation) to simulate the observed climate of this region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Regional climate change projections</title><p id="Par19">The model domain covers Eastern China including NCP, which is centered at 115&#x000b0;E and 31.5&#x000b0;N with a 25&#x02009;km grid spacing on a Lambert conformal projection (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The atmospheric lateral boundary conditions for MRCM are specified based on GCM simulations, selected from among CMIP5&#x02009;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> participant models. Since the regional climate model is constrained by atmospheric lateral boundary conditions, selection of the GCMs is important. In this study, three GCMs are carefully selected based on a screening process, including rigorous evaluation of the GCM performance in simulating key climate variables for the historical period over the target domain (see selection of GCMs section below). The selected models are the Community Climate System Model Version 4 (hereafter referred to as CCSM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator Version 1.0 (hereafter referred to as ACCESS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, and Max-Planck-Institution Earth System Model running on Medium Resolution grid (hereafter referred to as MPI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. For each selected GCM, two historical climate simulations are performed assuming historical GHG concentrations, with and without irrigation module (HIST), for the period 1975&#x02013;2005. To quantify the impact of a range of GHG concentrations, four future projection simulations, with and without irrigation module, are performed with two different RCP scenarios<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, namely, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 for the period 2070&#x02013;2100 (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). RCP8.5 is a rising concentration pathway leading to 8.5&#x02009;W&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> of radiative forcing by 2100 and can be considered a BAU scenario. RCP4.5 is a stabilization scenario after about 2060, leading to 4.5&#x02009;W&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> of radiative forcing by 2100. It represents moderate mitigation effort. In total, six sets of experiments are performed with MRCM over Eastern China. Each set of experiments consists of three ensemble members forced by three GCMs. The historical baseline period consists of 31 years from 1975 to 2005 and the projected future period covers 31 years from 2070 to 2100.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Selection of the GCMs</title><p id="Par20">The GCMs used for specifying the boundary conditions for MRCM are selected from among the many participant models in CMIP5 by applying the following criteria:</p><p id="Par21">We adopt the 19 GCMs evaluated favorably by McSweeney et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> based on their performance over Southeast Asia.

These model biases impact historical as well as future climate change projections.

In the final step, the magnitude of the bias for each day of the year is estimated by the difference between 30-day running means of the two climatologies. The daily bias is then applied to the MRCM daily values of TW<sub>max</sub> for the present-day and future climates.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Code availability</title><p id="Par24">Code from this study is available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Data availability</title><p id="Par25">The Global 30 Arc-Second Elevation (GTOPO30) used in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> is from International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) data server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clima-dods.ictp.it/data/regcm4/SURFACE">http://clima-dods.ictp.it/data/regcm4/SURFACE</ext-link>).
