Although a tropical mosquito-borne viral disease, a dengue outbreak occurred in Madeira, Portugal, in 2012; the first in Europe since 1920s. This outbreak emphasizes the potential for dengue re-emergence in Europe given changing climates. We present estimates of dengue epidemic potential using vectorial capacity (<italic>VC</italic>) based on historic and projected temperature (1901&#x02013;2099). <italic>VC</italic> indicates the vectors' ability to spread disease among humans. We calculated temperature-dependent <italic>VC</italic> for Europe, highlighting 10 European cities and three non-European reference cities. Compared with the tropics, Europe shows pronounced seasonality and geographical heterogeneity. Although low, <italic>VC</italic> during summer is currently sufficient for dengue outbreaks in Southern Europe to commence&#x02013;if sufficient vector populations (either <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>) were active and virus were introduced. Under various climate change scenarios, the seasonal peak and time window for dengue epidemic potential increases during the 21st century. Our study maps dengue epidemic potential in Europe and identifies seasonal time windows when major cities are most conducive for dengue transmission from 1901 to 2099. Our findings illustrate, that besides vector control, mitigating greenhouse gas emissions crucially reduces the future epidemic potential of dengue in Europe.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0010"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="u0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Past and present assessments of <italic>VC</italic> indicate strong seasonal patterns in temperate climates' dengue epidemic potential.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Current <italic>VC</italic> intensity could permit summer dengue epidemics in Southern Europe driven by either <italic>Aedes</italic> vector, where present.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Extent of spatial and temporal <italic>VC</italic> changes depend on vector characteristics and projected greenhouse gas emissions scenarios.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>With climate change, future <italic>VC</italic> intensifies: shifting northward and prolonging the season suitable for dengue epidemics.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>By the 21st century's end, seasonal dengue outbreaks could emerge in much more of Europe if <italic>Aedes</italic> vectors were established.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0030"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Achieving the Paris Agreement's emission reduction commitments could decelerate the increasing threat of dengue to Europe.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Globalization and climate change can increase the geographic spread of vector-borne diseases. Among those, dengue, a mosquito-transmitted viral disease, causes up to 390 million human infections annually. This study evaluates potential for dengue outbreaks in Europe based on climate conditions. Estimated suitability (1901&#x02013;2099) for dengue outbreaks is expanding presently from Southern Europe northward and lengthening seasonally up to eight months around the summer; however, the projected extent, intensity and duration depend partially on greenhouse gas emissions. We conclude that limiting emissions thereby mitigating climate change could substantially reduce the likelihood of dengue transmission events in Europe during the 21st century.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Dengue</kwd><kwd>Vectorial capacity</kwd><kwd><italic>Aedes aegypti</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Aedes albopictus</italic></kwd><kwd>Temperature</kwd><kwd>Climate change</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Globalization and climate change may increase the risk of the geographic spread of vector-borne diseases (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Hales et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">McMichael, 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Murray et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bb0325" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization (WHO), 2015</xref>). Changes in temperature variation have profound impacts on mosquito populations, and perhaps as important as changes in mean temperatures, if not more (<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Lambrechts et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">Vasseur et al., 2014</xref>). Since 1950, diurnal temperature extremes increased across the globe (<xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">Vasseur et al., 2014</xref>) and magnitudes of annual temperature cycles increased by 0.4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in temperate regions. This could result in elevated vulnerability within Europe for the introduction and re-establishment of vector-borne diseases such as dengue.</p><p>Dengue is a climate sensitive mosquito-borne viral disease that is generally found in the tropics and subtropics (<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Murray et al., 2013</xref>). According to the World Health Organization (<xref rid="bb0320" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization (WHO), 2012</xref>) and recent assessment on global burden of diseases (GBD2013) (<xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Murray et al., 2015</xref>), dengue is now the most important arboviral disease worldwide that has the largest increases among infectious diseases over the last 20&#x000a0;years. The recent estimates indicate as many as 390 million infections per year (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Bhatt et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes are the vectors for the four dengue virus serotypes: DENV 1&#x02013;4 (<xref rid="bb0320" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization (WHO), 2012</xref>). <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> is the primary vector associated with most major dengue epidemics, while <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, the secondary vector, is less efficient (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Lambrechts et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Of major concern is the geographic expansion of dengue viruses and vectors to new areas (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Lambrechts et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization (WHO), 2009</xref>). Reasons for the expansion are complex; however, main contributing factors include the introduction of <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes by shipping (<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Reiter, 1998</xref>) and increasingly importation of the dengue virus via viremic travelers (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Leder et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">Wilder-Smith and Gubler, 2008</xref>). Subsequent establishment of vectors after introduction can only be possible if suitable climate and ecological conditions exist. Having established populations of <italic>Aedes</italic> vectors and the conducive climatic conditions, in early autumn 2014, Tokyo, Japan recorded the first epidemic of dengue since the Second World War (<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Quam et al., 2016</xref>). Europe is also suitable for the establishment and re-establishment of <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes as evidenced by the following: <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> was historically present in many European countries including UK and France (1919), Spain (up to 1953), Portugal (up to 1956), and recently the Netherlands, Russia and Georgia (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), 2015</xref>). In Madeira, Portugal, <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> was documented until 1977&#x02013;79 and then was re-established in 2004 and 2005. Madeira experienced its first major dengue outbreak in 2012/2013, with more than 2000 cases (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">Wilder-Smith et al., 2014a</xref>). The rapidly expanding range of <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in Europe (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Lambrechts et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), 2013</xref>) resulted in the first known autochthonous dengue cases in southern France and Croatia in 2010 (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">La Ruche et al., 2010</xref>) in addition to an importation <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> driven outbreak of chikungunya in 2007 in Italy (<xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">Rezza et al., 2007</xref>). There are concerns that <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> could be introduced from Russia and Georgia (Abkhazia) to Western Europe via air or sea traffic, and to Eastern Europe via road and sea traffic, in addition to the vectors' projected establishment in Southern Europe (<xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Rogers, 2015</xref>). Current surveillance indicates that <italic>Aedes</italic> vectors have been introduced or established in much of the Mediterranean coast and as far north as the Netherlands (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), 2015</xref>). Therefore, it is important to assess the dengue epidemic potential (DEP) in Europe.</p><p>A few studies have projected dengue risk and epidemic potential for Europe. They have used either statistical models (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Bouzid et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">Rogers et al., 2014</xref>) or vectorial capacity (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Patz et al., 1998</xref>), a Mathematical model, however, with limited range either geographically, temporally or in terms of climate scenarios. In this study, we intend to estimate DEP for Europe using vectorial capacity with increased range of climate scenarios and temporal resolution. Although DEP depends on many factors, this study focuses on the effect of temperature &#x02013; past, present, and future &#x02013; on vectorial capacity of <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes.</p><p>Vectorial capacity (<italic>VC</italic>) describes the threshold condition for a vector's ability to spread disease among humans (<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Patz et al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Massad and Coutinho, 2012</xref>), representing the average daily number of secondary cases generated by one primary case introduced into a susceptible population (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014</xref>). It depends on six vector parameters (<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Patz et al., 1998</xref>), which are highly influenced by ambient temperature, both its mean value and diurnal temperature range (DTR) (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Lambrechts et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Carrington et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>VC</italic> has been used to model DEP globally for both <italic>Aedes</italic> vectors (<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Patz et al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Brady et al., 2014</xref>). Very few models incorporated DTR (<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Patz et al., 1998</xref>) and the temperature dependent transmission probabilities per bite to both humans and vectors (<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Lambrechts et al., 2011</xref>) when describing DEP (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014</xref>) or vector competence. Including these factors would change the projected estimates of the impacts of climate on DEP, given strong temperature dependence of transmission probabilities per bite in humans and vectors and strong association of DTR with <italic>VC</italic> and vector competence (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Lambrechts et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we modeled <italic>VC</italic> to project DEP in Europe given changes in climate.

We estimated DEP for local dengue transmission, in terms of seasonality, intensity and duration, for Europe and examined ten European metropolitan cities ranging from North to South for the period 1901&#x02013;2099 (for more details see Table S3 in the Supplementary information).</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><p>Vectorial capacity (<italic>VC</italic>) was used to estimate dengue epidemic potential (DEP).

The time unit is one day. Each of the vector parameters depends on temperature (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014</xref>). The temperature relationships for the first five vector parameters, 1)&#x02013;5), were obtained from the peer-reviewed literature for <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>; details are described elsewhere (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014</xref>). For <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, only two vector parameters, 1) and 5), were found in the literature with temperature dependent relationships: the mortality rate (<italic>&#x003bc;</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>) and the total biting rate (<italic>a</italic>), which was taken as an inverse of the duration of gonotrophic cycle (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Delatte et al., 2009</xref>). The remaining three parameters, 2)&#x02013;4), in the <italic>VC</italic> were assumed to have the same temperature relation as those for <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014</xref>). For <italic>Ae.

Due to a lack of reliable data, the female vector-to-human population ratio, <italic>m</italic>, is assumed to depend on temperature the same way as the life expectancy or inverse of the mortality rate, as used in a previous study (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Brady et al., 2014</xref>). The maximum value of <italic>m</italic> (<italic>m</italic><sub>max</sub>) is assumed to be 1.5.</p><p>The threshold cut-off for DEP was defined as <italic>VC</italic>*&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.2 (day<sup>&#x02212;&#x000a0;1</sup>).

Sensitivity analysis was performed for the effect of the range of the infectious period (4&#x02013;10&#x000a0;days) (<xref rid="bb0320" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization (WHO), 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Chan and Johansson, 2012</xref>) on the dengue transmission windows (Supplementary information Section S5.3, Fig. S5A for <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and Fig. S5B for <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>). This corresponds to a range of thresholds for DEP from 0.1 to 0.25 (day<sup>&#x02212;&#x000a0;1</sup>).

The seasonal averaged <italic>VC</italic> for the recent decade were displayed as maps for Europe for each season for both vectors and compared to a recent survey of vector distribution (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), 2015</xref>) for areas known to have <italic>Aedes</italic> activity according.</p><p>To show seasonality of <italic>VC</italic> over a year, decade averages of <italic>VC</italic> for each month was displayed as a function of the month in a year. For the recent decade, 13 cities were chosen to compare seasonality of DEP. Ten European cities were selected to represent most of the European continent with different temperature zones from the north &#x02014; Stockholm (latitude&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;59.3) to the south &#x02014; M&#x000e1;laga (latitude&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;36.7) within the continent and Madeira (latitude&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;32.7) outside the continent. Madeira is an autonomous region of Portugal having a dengue outbreak in 2012, and for convenience in this paper, we will use the name of <italic>city</italic> for all the nine cities and Madeira region. Three reference cities from tropical and sub-tropical regions outside Europe were chosen for comparison. Colombo and Singapore are located in Asia close to the equator and display high dengue endemicity (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Gubler, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Gubler and Clark, 1995</xref>) despite political and financial investment in dengue control. By contrast Miami, located in North America with a sub-tropical climate with more similarity in environmental and social economic conditions to some of Southern Europe, has reported autochthonous dengue transmission occasionally, which typically does not develop into large scale epidemics (<xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">Theiler et al., 1960</xref>).</p><p>Diurnal temperature range is known to affect the competence of dengue vector <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Lambrechts et al., 2011</xref>). Inclusion of DTR in modeling DEP for <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> using relative <italic>VC</italic> (<italic>rVC</italic>) has shown a great difference comparing without DTR (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014</xref>), especially in the cold to temperate climate zones in Northern hemisphere. This is because <italic>rVC</italic> (<italic>VC</italic>) depends on DTR strongly, both the peak intensity and the position. When DTR increases from 0&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C to 20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, the peak height of <italic>rVC</italic> reduced from 1.37 to 0.47&#x000a0;day<sup>&#x02212;&#x000a0;1</sup>; the peak position of <italic>VC</italic> reduces from 29&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C to 20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Therefore, in models including DTR, temperate climate zones with larger DTR will have greater DEP, while tropical areas with less DTR will have lesser DEP than estimated by models using mean temperature alone. This is particularly relevant to Europe, where DTR is greater than tropical areas.</p><p>From the Climate Research Unit (CRU) online database, time series (CRU-TS 3.22) of gridded (0.5&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;0.5 degrees) monthly averages of daily temperature observations (minimums, maximum, and mean) were obtained for Europe for the period January 1, 1901 to December 31, 2013 (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., n.d.</xref>). Given the importance of DTR to temperate European climate, in all the <italic>VC</italic> calculations, diurnal temperature range (DTR) was included. DTR was reconstructed using a representative daily temperature for each 30&#x000a0;min through a piece-wise sinusoidal function based on the monthly average of daily minimum, maximum, and mean observations for each location (same temperature for each day of the month in each 0.5&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;0.5 grid &#x02013; See Supplementary information S3 for details). To illustrate the combined effect of DTR and mean temperature to <italic>VC</italic>, heat maps were generated for both <italic>Aedes</italic> vectors (Fig. S2 (d) &#x00026; (d) in the Supplementary information).</p><p>To show the seasonal window and its change over time, a 30-year average was used for each monthly averaged <italic>VC</italic> at three periods &#x02013; the beginning of the 20th century (1901&#x02013;1930), at the turn from 20th to 21st century (1984&#x02013;2013), and the end of the 21st century (2070&#x02013;2099). Future <italic>VC</italic> was calculated using projected climate under four greenhouse gas emission pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5) (<xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">Weyant et al., 2009</xref>) based on CMIP5 (<xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Warszawski et al., 2014</xref>) atmosphere-ocean general circulation models. For each emission pathway, CMIP5 temperature datasets (min, max, mean resolution 0.5&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;0.5&#x000b0;) were used (<xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Warszawski et al., 2014</xref>). The <italic>VC</italic> was calculated for each of the five global models (NorESM1-M, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, IPSL-CM5A-LR, HadGEM2-ES and GFDL-ESM2M) and then averaged over the five models (<xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Warszawski et al., 2014</xref>). We used these models as an ensemble to form a multi-model mean, with the intention of providing results that are based on greater consensus. The four RCP scenarios describe the possible range of radiative forcing of greenhouse gases in the year 2100 (+&#x000a0;2.6, +&#x000a0;4.5, +&#x000a0;6.0, and +&#x000a0;8.5&#x000a0;W&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;&#x000a0;2</sup>, respectively) (<xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">Weyant et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>VC</italic> calculations were aggregated by decade to show the trends in DEP over two centuries. A selection of the outputs of these projection-based <italic>VC</italic> calculations was also mapped for RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 for both species to show the changes in DEP across Europe under scenarios of greater or lesser emission mitigation.</p><p>To calculate the intensity and duration of dengue transmission, a seasonality curve was generated by plotting the decadally averaged <italic>VC</italic> as a function of month for each of the 10 cities first and then for each decade over the two centuries. The intensity of DEP was estimated by averaging the <italic>VC</italic> over the highest three consecutive months in the seasonality curve. The duration of transmission season was estimated by the intersections of the seasonality curve with the line defining the threshold condition (<italic>VC</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.2 (day<sup>&#x02212;&#x000a0;1</sup>)). The differences between the two intersections gave the number of months that <italic>VC</italic> was over the threshold. This was repeated for each decade over the two centuries and for each of the 10 European cities. Over the two centuries decadally averaged <italic>VC</italic> were from year zero to nine for each decade except the two decades with 9-year period: 1901&#x02013;1909, 2011&#x02013;2019 due to that both CRU and CMIP5 data started from year one in the data set: 1901 and 2011.</p><p>Sensitivity analyses were carried out and the results were included in the Supplementary Information, where section and figure numbers were marked with &#x0201c;S&#x0201d;. Using Monte Carlo simulations, 95% Credible Intervals (CI) (<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Pericchi and Walley, 1991</xref>) of <italic>VC</italic> were estimated for temperatures ranging from 10&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C to 32.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. The variability in each of the six vector parameters was simulated assuming a normal random distribution. At each temperature under the random generation of parameters, <italic>VC</italic> was calculated based on Eq. <xref rid="fo0005" ref-type="disp-formula">(1)</xref>. Repeating this process 1000 times for each temperature, the 2.5th and the 97.5th percentiles of the <italic>VC</italic> were estimated to give the values of <italic>VC</italic>&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;95% CI. Using the fitting functions (<italic>VC</italic>&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;95% CI vs. temperature) as the basic equations and temperature data as input, we estimated <italic>VC</italic>&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;95% CI for the ten cities over two centuries, including DTR (Section S5.1&#x02013;5.2, Figs.

In addition, sensitivity of <italic>VC</italic> to threshold values (<italic>VC</italic>*) and the maximum value of the female vector-to-human population ratio (<italic>m</italic><sub>max</sub>) were also estimated based on Eq. <xref rid="fo0005" ref-type="disp-formula">(1)</xref>.

The threshold value of 0.2&#x000a0;day<sup>&#x02212;&#x000a0;1</sup> corresponds to yellow color (see color bar). In areas with <italic>VC</italic> above this threshold (yellow-orange to dark red) during a given time period, dengue outbreaks may commence assuming prerequisite populations of vectors, susceptible human hosts, and virus introduction coincide. Areas during time periods displayed in blue to yellow green would not be expected to be suitable for dengue outbreaks to begin even if vectors were present and importations of dengue virus were persistent. Strong seasonality is apparent: <italic>VC</italic> was not sufficiently high in Europe in the winter, spring, and autumn seasons to allow dengue epidemic transmission to commence using the threshold value of 0.2&#x000a0;day<sup>&#x02212;&#x000a0;1</sup>, except for small areas in the very southern parts of Southern Europe during spring and autumn. In the summer season, the majority of continental Europe for <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and southern and partially central parts of Europe for <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> have climate conditions and corresponding <italic>VC</italic> that could sustain seasonal dengue epidemics. Therefore, if the primary vector, <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, established in the other parts of Europe in the future, it could have greater DEP than the established and invasive secondary vector, <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>.</p><p>We compared 10 cities in Europe with three reference cities in tropical and sub-tropical regions. <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> shows <italic>VC</italic> averaged per month over the recent 10&#x000a0;years for <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (a) and <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (b).

As a result, more cities will be over the <italic>VC</italic> threshold starting from the South and progressing to the North during this century. However, the rate of the increase depends on the emission pathway for both vectors, especially toward the middle of the century. The same trend is observed even when using the lower bound of <italic>VC</italic> (95% CI) for <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (see Supplementary information, Section S6.2).

Nice stands out as having the most dramatic rise; by the 2060, Nice would surpass the intensity of the three Southern European cities; by the end of this century, during July&#x02013;August Nice would be near the current summer peak intensity in Miami. Consistent with this, Nice was the site of the first reported autochthonous European cases in 2010 (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">La Ruche et al., 2010</xref>) and Athens had a massive dengue outbreak in 1927/28 (<xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">Theiler et al., 1960</xref>).</p><p>Since 1928, there has only been one dengue epidemic in Europe&#x02013;Madeira 2012 with over 2000 cases transmitted through <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">Wilder-Smith et al., 2014b</xref>). Using local weather station temperature data for the current decade, <italic>VC</italic> for Madeira was well over the threshold from June to October (Fig. S1 in Supplementary information). Therefore, our findings are consistent with the large dengue outbreak that occurred in 2012 (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2012</xref>). The decline of new incident cases after November 9, 2012 was most likely due to declining <italic>VC</italic> because of cooler temperatures combined with enhanced vector control measures and public awareness. While our findings contribute valuable insight into the timing of the outbreak potential in Madeira, the introduction of vector predated the outbreak by years, and the climate based DEP predated both for a number of months each year. This illustrates that commencement of an actual dengue outbreak involves complex processes and more factors than what we have addressed here. Of note is that <italic>VC</italic> for Athens, Rome and M&#x000e1;laga is higher than that for Madeira even using local weather station data (<xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">UK Meteorological Office, n.d.</xref>), yet no dengue outbreaks recently occurred in those cities likely in part due to the absence of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. However, <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> may be introduced or re-introduced at any time. Our findings underpin the suitability of temperature dependent <italic>VC</italic> in countries such as Italy, Spain and Greece that could result in autochthonous dengue transmission should <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> be imported and establish. Indeed, when <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> was present in Greece in the early 20th century, a major dengue outbreak occurred in and around Athens in 1927&#x02013;28 (<xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">Theiler et al., 1960</xref>). Furthermore, over 20 epidemics of yellow fever, another flavivirus (like dengue) transmitted via <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, occurred during the 18th and 19th centuries around British, Portuguese, and Spanish harbors, with the last outbreak being in Barcelona, Spain in 1821 (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Morillon et al., 2002</xref>). With climate change, recent studies projected the re-establishment of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in the coastal zones of Europe in 2080 (<xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Rogers, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Kraemer et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p><italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> is already widely spread in much of Southern Europe, especially in the Mediterranean areas (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Kraemer et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">Reiter, 2010</xref>). Comparing to <italic>VC</italic> of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>(a)), <italic>Ae albopictus</italic> (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>(b)) had similar seasonal windows but with lower intensity such that only Southern European cities could currently have dengue epidemics. The main reason for the absence of dengue outbreaks in these cities could be one or all of the following factors: 1) Insufficient adult vector populations that are actively biting humans for an extended period to sustain a dengue outbreak (<italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> bites humans and animals (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Lambrechts et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Delatte et al., 2010</xref>)); 2) Insufficient infected humans with dengue for an extended period that could infect sufficient number of vectors to sustain a dengue outbreak (infected humans traveling back from dengue endemic areas are presumably isolated indoors or may have recovered before they traveled home); 3) <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> is a less efficient vector for dengue transmission than what we estimated. We may have overestimated the <italic>VC</italic> for <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> due to limitations in temperature dependent data and studies (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Lambrechts et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>However, <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> was responsible for the epidemic transmission of chikungunya, an alphavirus, in Italy 2007 (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Carrieri et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, it is unlikely that at that time factor 1) - insufficient <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> population - is the main reason for not having dengue outbreaks in Europe, unless <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> more effectively drives transmission of chikungunya (<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Paupy et al., 2009</xref>) than dengue such that the current <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> population are sufficient to drive chikungunya but too few to trigger dengue outbreaks (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Dubrulle et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Each year, certain European travelers return home with dengue (i.e. 1207 cases reported in 2012 reported in EU/EEA, 884 of which lived in the EU countries currently having <italic>Aedes</italic> vectors (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), 2014</xref>) and the number increased over time (<xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Quam et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">Semenza et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">Tatem et al., 2006</xref>). If factor 2) is the main reason for preventing dengue outbreaks in Europe to date, this suggests outbreaks could occur anytime in the future when the infectious person/vector is in the suitable place at a suitable time, as was the case for chikungunya in Italy in 2007. If factor 3) is true, then the main concern for Europe is the potential introduction and establishment of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, consistent with earlier studies (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Lambrechts et al., 2010</xref>). Madeira like Miami highlights the difference between DEP and actually having dengue epidemic transmission. This can be multifactorial. The temporal and geographic range of DEP is likely to be spatially and temporally broader than the actual areas of transmission events (over estimations). On the other hand, Nice had local dengue transmission reported as early as September 2010 (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">La Ruche et al., 2010</xref>), which may indicate that the <italic>VC</italic> value was close to the threshold, and the Madeira and Japan outbreaks declined as <italic>VC</italic> went below the threshold conditions (<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Quam et al., 2016</xref>). When examining the DEP for Nice, our estimate of <italic>VC</italic> for <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> was very close to the threshold as expected: July and August were over while September was under the threshold during the recent decade as shown in <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> (b). Therefore, we cannot ignore the dengue epidemic potential from <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in the Southern and Mediterranean areas of Europe as agreed by other studies (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Lambrechts et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Bouzid et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">Rogers et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0290" ref-type="bibr">Whitehorn et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Benedict et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The time variable in this study was longitudinal &#x02013; from 1901 to 2099 divided in 20 decades, in which for each decade monthly <italic>VC</italic> was estimated. All the existing models on dengue risk mapping regardless the model types &#x02013; mathematical or statistical, give one or a few cross-sectional estimations, such as, one year (<xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Rogers, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">Rogers et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Patz et al., 1998</xref>) or a few decades' averaged snapshot (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Bouzid et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Patz et al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Brady et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Louis et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Naish et al., 2014</xref>). Although statistical models (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Bouzid et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">Rogers et al., 2014</xref>) were used to estimated climate change impacts on dengue fever risk in Europe (more discussion in Supplementary information, Section S7.1), very limited information (<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Patz et al., 1998</xref>) can be found on seasonality in the current literature for European DEP or dengue risk over an extended time period under all climate change scenarios. To our knowledge, this is the only study on the European DEP communicating findings at the monthly time scale over two centuries including historical observations and four climate projections into the future. This information is important for dengue control planning and may in turn underscore the need for emissions reductions, echoing and supporting ratification of the Paris Agreement, a treaty on greenhouse gas emission reductions formed at the 2015 Paris Climate Conference (<xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">World Climate, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The limitations of this study are mainly the assumptions made and parameters/data used for estimating the DEP through <italic>VC</italic>. First, we assumed that the female vector-to-human population ratio (<italic>m</italic>) depends on temperature only. This is not exactly true in reality because vector populations change with the season due to climate including rainfall, vector ecology and control, etc. (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Hii et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Hales et al., 1996</xref>) The reason for making this assumption is that neither reliable data nor their temperature and rainfall dependent relationships are available. In addition, rainfall is known to affect the under-water stages of vector development (<xref rid="bb0330" ref-type="bibr">Yang, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">Tran et al., 2013</xref>). Once a vector population is established and abundant, temperature is the main climatic driver for dengue transmission and is included as the only climate variable in other mathematical modeling studies as well (<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Patz et al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Brady et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0330" ref-type="bibr">Yang, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">Tran et al., 2013</xref>). To compensate for the assumption made in our model, we performed sensitivity analysis of <italic>VC</italic> to <italic>m</italic><sub>max</sub> &#x02013; see Supplementary information (Section S6.4).</p><p>Second, the uncertainty in the vector and human parameters affect the value of DEP through <italic>VC</italic> and the threshold value for intensity. All six vector parameters depend on temperature. The female vector-to-human population ratio depends on temperature the same way as longevity (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Brady et al., 2014</xref>). The rest five of them with relationships obtained from field and laboratory experimental studies (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014</xref>). These relationships may vary depending on the environmental conditions of the study location/laboratory/design, vector and virus types. The uncertainty of each parameter and its temperature dependent relation were not available. Thus, a Monte Carlo simulation was used to estimate the uncertainty for each parameter and their effect on <italic>VC</italic>, from which the seasonality for the 10 European cities - see Supplementary information (Section S6.1&#x02013;S6.2) for details. In addition, although we chose the threshold value more conservatively (0.2&#x000a0;day<sup>&#x02212;&#x000a0;1</sup> within the range of 0.1&#x02013;0.25&#x000a0;day<sup>&#x02212;&#x000a0;1</sup> corresponding to infectious period of 4 to 10&#x000a0;days), the estimated intensity and duration for DEP should be viewed with caution. If different threshold values were used, the general trend and order of cities that would go over the threshold will hold, but the exact decade when the DEP goes over the threshold could change. However, using the threshold of 0.2&#x000a0;day<sup>&#x02212;&#x000a0;1</sup> in the analysis of both the outbreak in Madeira in 2012 and the 2014 dengue outbreak in Japan, we found that this threshold corresponded spatially and temporally with the novel transmission events (<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Quam et al., 2016</xref>). See Supplementary information (Section S6.3) for more discussion.</p><p>Third, for <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, only two parameters with temperature dependent relations were available in the literature (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Delatte et al., 2009</xref>). The remaining parameters were assumed to have the same temperature dependent relationships as <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, although they were adjusted to the level of <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> based on a literature review (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Lambrechts et al., 2010</xref>). This would limit the accuracy of the estimated value of DEP for <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. See Supplementary information (Section S4) for more discussion.</p><p>Finally, the temperature data used from CRU and CMIP5 are monthly averages over gridded area of 0.5&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;0.5&#x000b0;. While the daily datasets from E-OBS for the maps in <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> have finer resolution (0.25&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;0.25&#x000b0;, daily), coarser resolutions (CRU and CMIP5) may underestimate DEP during the summer and overestimate during the winter for cities located along the costal lines. This accounts for the differences observed between <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> for major cities. Much of our analyses were based on outputs from the coarser temperature data sets (CRU and CMIP5). Therefore, the conclusions drawn are more conservative for the summer and overestimates for the winter (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> intensity). See Supplementary Information (Sections S1 &#x00026; S2) for more discussion.</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>We identified past, present, and future high-risk cities and time periods for potential dengue transmission in Europe based on temperature and daily temperature variation. Compared to countries where dengue is endemic, Europe showed strong seasonality in dengue epidemic potential (DEP) without possibility of year-round epidemic transmission. Compared over two centuries, we found a slow increase in intensity and duration of dengue transmission over the past century and more rapidly changing trajectories projected in the 21st century with the rate of change depending on the level of greenhouse gas emissions. Although Europe currently does not have a sufficiently high DEP year round, increasing periods with higher temperatures and greater temperature variation in the future due to climate change could elevate DEP along a south to north gradient. By the end of this century, DEP for <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, could expand to Northern Europe (all 10 cities studied) and up to eight months in Southern Europe under the highest emission pathway (RCP 8.5). Under the lowest emission pathway (RCP 2.6), it could expand to Nice and Paris for <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> from the current three Southern European cities. For <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> DEP could expand to all of the Central Europe (7 cities) under RCP 8.5; however, it would remain nearly as it is now under RCP 2.6 (three Southern Europe cities). Therefore, climate change mitigation (or lack thereof) could have a large impact on the seasonal window and geographic range for dengue transmission potential in Europe. Under the higher emission scenarios, increasingly larger parts of Europe would have the potential for autochthonous dengue transmission should <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> be introduced and established. Such concerns were substantiated by the dengue outbreak in Madeira in 2012. The same concern extends to <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> if higher greenhouse gas emissions than RCP2.6 would be realized.</p><p>Increasing globalization in travel and trade will intensify the importation of dengue viruses and the potential for further introduction of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Gubler and Clark, 1995</xref>). If such introductions coincide with suitable vectorial capacity, those cities at the time intervals identified in this study have potential for local dengue transmission. Dengue epidemic outbreak is a complex process involving many factors, with mean temperature and diurnal temperature range just being two of many. This study based on vectorial capacity helps to identify cities and areas with high DEP and the seasonal time windows when such cities are at the highest risk currently and in the future under climate change. Our findings illustrate that besides vector control, reducing greenhouse gas emissions is very important in reducing DEP for Europe especially toward the latter half of this century.</p></sec><sec id="s0040"><title>Author contributions</title><p>JLH carried out the modeling, generated the calculations, and drafted the manuscript.
