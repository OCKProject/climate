Little is known about the role of surface water and annual flood dynamics (flood pulse) on waterborne disease and human health nor about the expected impact of climate change on surface-water-dependent populations.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and findings</title><p>Using the Chobe River in northern Botswana, a flood pulse river&#x02014;floodplain system, we applied multimodel inference approaches assessing the influence of river height, water quality (bimonthly counts of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and total suspended solids [TSS], 2011&#x02013;2017), and meteorological variability on weekly diarrheal case reports among children under 5 presenting to health facilities (<italic>n</italic> = 10 health facilities, January 2007&#x02013;June 2017). We assessed diarrheal cases by clinical characteristics and season across age groups using monthly outpatient data (January 1998&#x02013;June 2017). A strong seasonal pattern was identified, with 2 outbreaks occurring regularly in the wet and dry seasons. The timing of outbreaks diverged from that at the level of the country, where surface water is largely absent. Across age groups, the number of diarrheal cases was greater, on average, during the dry season. Demographic and clinical characteristics varied by season, underscoring the importance of environmental drivers. In the wet season, rainfall (8-week lag) had a significant influence on under-5 diarrhea, with a 10-mm increase in rainfall associated with an estimated 6.5% rise in the number of cases. Rainfall, minimum temperature, and river height were predictive of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> concentration, and increases in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> in the river were positively associated with diarrheal cases. In the dry season, river height (1-week lag) and maximum temperature (1- and 4-week lag) were significantly associated with diarrheal cases. During this period, a 1-meter drop in river height corresponded to an estimated 16.7% and 16.1% increase in reported diarrhea with a 1- and 4-week lag, respectively. In this region, as floodwaters receded from the surrounding floodplains, TSS levels increased and were positively associated with diarrheal cases (0- and 3-week lag). Populations living in this region utilized improved water sources, suggesting that hydrological variability and rapid water quality shifts in surface waters may compromise water treatment processes. Limitations include the potential influence of health beliefs and health seeking behaviors on data obtained through passive surveillance.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In flood pulse river&#x02014;floodplain systems, hydrology and water quality dynamics can be highly variable, potentially impacting conventional water treatment facilities and the production of safe drinking water. In Southern Africa, climate change is predicted to intensify hydrological variability and the frequency of extreme weather events, amplifying the public health threat of waterborne disease in surface-water-dependent populations. Water sector development should be prioritized with urgency, incorporating technologies that are robust to local environmental conditions and expected climate-driven impacts. In populations with high HIV burdens, expansion of diarrheal disease surveillance and intervention strategies may also be needed. As annual flood pulse processes are predominantly influenced by climate controls in distant regions, country-level data may be inadequate to refine predictions of climate&#x02014;health interactions in these systems.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Kathleen Alexander and colleagues determine the effects of river flood height, water quality and amount of suspended solids in river water in Botswana in response to climate change and weather variability and the resultant cases of diarrhoea in children under 5.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><sec id="sec004"><title>Why was this study done?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Diarrheal disease remains a persistent global health threat for children under 5 years of age, particularly in Africa.</p></list-item><list-item><p>In river&#x02014;floodplain systems, annual floods or flood pulses can occur, with extreme flooding and drought a common threat to local populations.

Degradation of freshwater ecosystems and declines in water quality in surface water represent a growing public health threat across Africa [<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Worldwide, degraded water quality, waterborne disease, and infectious diarrhea remain prominent and persistent concerns that are expected to worsen under future climate change projections [<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In 2015, diarrheal disease was estimated to cause 1.31 million deaths per year [<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Of these, nearly half a million deaths occurred in children under 5 years of age, with the greatest burden of disease focused in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia [<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Diarrheal disease in children can have lasting population effects, such as stunting and cognitive deficiencies [<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Chronic oral exposure to fecal contaminates is also linked to environmental enteropathy, a subclinical disorder marked by chronic gut inflammation, small bowel structural change, decreased gut permeability, and gut immune dysfunction, which can influence oral vaccine efficacy [<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The societal impact of diarrheal disease in children can be lasting, underscoring the need to advance our understanding of environmental couplings to develop effective public health strategies that will not only reduce current disease burdens but minimize future climate change impacts.</p><p>Floods are identified as the most pervasive hydrometeorological hazard (reviewed in [<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]), are expected to increase in frequency under climate change [<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and are linked strongly with the occurrence of diarrheal disease outbreaks in affected populations [<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, flood and flow regimes can vary significantly by waterway, and range from large rivers in temperate regions with more regular flow to dryland river&#x02014;floodplain systems in arid and semiarid regions where highly variable flow occurs annually (flood pulse), with extreme flooding as well as droughts a common outcome [<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In flood pulse systems, there is a predictable advance of floodwaters onto surrounding floodplains and retraction back into the river channel with flood recession, linking aquatic and terrestrial landscapes and microbial communities. These annual flood dynamics are highly variable and can change dramatically in flow volume, duration, frequency, and timing [<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These systems tend to be in a state of dynamic equilibrium, with system behavior and biota characterized by flood dynamics and the geomorphology of the river&#x02014;floodplain system [<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These interacting hydrological, geomorphological, and sedimentary processes are fundamental determinants of microbial dynamics, water quality, and waterborne pathogen exposure in humans and animals in flood-prone areas but have not yet been adequately characterized, hampering our ability to address current and climate-mediated population vulnerabilities.</p><p>Botswana provides an ideal model system to isolate the role of surface water and flood dynamics on climate&#x02014;diarrheal disease couplings. Botswana is an arid to semiarid country in Southern Africa with only 3 sources of permanent surface water throughout the country. Rainfall is limited and only occurs during a defined wet season, with little or no rainfall during the dry season. At the national level, diarrheal disease remains a persistent health threat to children and adults alike [<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Using this study system and a unique dataset, we evaluated the influence of meteorology, surface water quality, and flood pulse dynamics on diarrheal disease and discuss the implications for public health and climate preparedness needs in systems where populations are dependent on surface water resources.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Methods</title><p>To analyze the relationships between variables, we used multimodel inference, which allowed quantification of model uncertainty among different candidate models and unconditional inference across those different models [<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These methods permit inference of important predictor variables, estimation of the average effects of predictor variables on an outcome, and generation of multimodel weighted averaged predictions of that outcome.</p><sec id="sec009"><title>Study site</title><p>Botswana is a semiarid, landlocked country in Southern Africa. The country has a subtropical climate with annual wet (November&#x02014;March) and dry (April&#x02014;October) seasons. Intra- and inter-annual precipitation variability is high, resulting in frequent droughts and flooding. This study focuses on Chobe District, located in the northeastern part of Botswana (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002688.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The Chobe River floodplain system, which is the primary source of water for the district, floods annually (flood pulse), with the peak flood height occurring in the late wet season/early dry season (April). The district contains 1 primary hospital, 3 private clinics, and 12 government health clinics that serve a total population of approximately 25,000 people (Central Statistics Office of Botswana, 2011). Medical services are provided by the government, with patients paying a nominal fee for health services. Chobe District is also home to the Chobe National Park, which provides an important habitat for the largest elephant population in Africa, as well as an abundance of other wildlife species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002688.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pmed.1002688.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pmed.1002688.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>The study was conducted in northern Botswana in Southern Africa.</title><p>The Chobe River (blue line) is a transboundary waterway and 1 of only 3 perennial sources of water within Botswana, with water flow (light blue arrow) moving from the national park towards the urban areas, where the water treatment facility is located (blue X).

Surface waters are abstracted to produce drinking water through centralized water treatment facilities and distributed to the population. Circles represent buildings color coded by the type of infrastructure (agricultural, commercial, residential, or tourism related; see legend). In this system, annual floods are driven by distant and regional wet season precipitation, with the largest input arising from floodwaters that occur in association with tropical rains in the upper watersheds of the Zambian and Angolan Highlands (inset, northern aspect of the Cuando-Chobe River Basin). The peak of the flood pulse arrives in the Chobe River at the end of the wet season/beginning of the dry season, after traversing more than 1,000 km from the highland areas.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pmed.1002688.g001"/></fig><p>The Chobe River supplies all domestic water needs for the study villages (<italic>n</italic> = 8), providing a unique environment to assess the impact of surface water dynamics on the health of dependent populations.

Under-5 diarrhea case data were acquired from the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) program (January 2007&#x02013;June 2017), which collates weekly numbers of under-5 diarrhea cases presenting to district health facilities (<xref rid="pmed.1002688.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Total monthly outpatient cases of diarrhea (all ages) were also obtained from the MoH for January 1998&#x02013;June 2017. These case reports were extracted from the same 10 health facilities, stratified by diarrhea type, age (&#x0003c;1, 1&#x02013;4, 5+ years), and sex of the patient. Outpatient data include the IDSR weekly data (a subset) as all patients must access the health system through outpatient services. These data are useful as they provide information on all patients by age over and above those less than 5 years. Outpatient data were included to provide a more complete demographic and clinical picture of diarrheal disease in the district. A diarrhea case was defined as the occurrence of at least 3 loose stools in a 24-hour period within the 4 days preceding the health facility visit. The diarrhea type was characterized by the attending physician or nurse as diarrhea with no dehydration, diarrhea with some dehydration, diarrhea with severe dehydration, or bloody diarrhea. Each selected study village had a clinic, with the largest town, Kasane, having 2 clinics and a primary hospital (<italic>n</italic> = 3). For both the IDSR and outpatient datasets, data from the clinic in the village of Pandamatenga were excluded because residents in this village obtained water from boreholes and were expected to have variable exposure to surface water resources from other villages and towns in the district. Demographic statistical analyses were conducted using chi-squared tests for differences in proportions between groups.</p><p>Diagnoses were categorized according to the International Classification of Diseases&#x02013;10th Revision (ICD-10 [<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]).

Weeks with no reports (i.e., all 10 health facilities not reporting) were not included in the analysis. We used 2 approaches to correct for the missing reports for weeks where data gaps existed (i.e., data from fewer than 10 health facilities). In the first approach, we took the total number of cases reported in a given week and divided this by the number of health facilities reporting that week. This method provides a weekly estimate of the total under-5 diarrhea cases per health facility reporting but does not account for differences in patient volume. For the second method, observations were first standardized as follows:

The analyses differed only in the outcome of interest and the basic structure of the models. Since water quality variables were measured over a shorter time period, the models predicting <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and TSS included fewer observations (<italic>n</italic> = 42 [wet season], <italic>n</italic> = 54 [dry season]) than models without water quality variables (<italic>n</italic> = 164 [wet season], <italic>n</italic> = 236 [dry season]). A priori, we believed that different environmental drivers were important for the dry and wet season outbreaks of diarrhea in children under 5. Hence, analyses were performed separately for the wet and dry seasons.</p><p>Multimodel inference was carried out using groups of candidate regression models, each developed with the same structure but different predictor variables. Under-5 diarrhea observations, which are overdispersed count data, were modeled using negative binomial regression. <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and TSS concentration data were Gaussian in structure and were modeled using ordinary least squares regression. Models for under-5 diarrhea were developed using all combinations of 12 different environmental variables: minimum temperature (lagged 1, 4, and 8 weeks), maximum temperature (lagged 1, 4, and 8 weeks), rainfall (lagged 1, 4, and 8 weeks), and Chobe River height (lagged 1, 4, and 8 weeks). Models for <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> or TSS included the same environmental variables lagged 0 and 4 weeks. These lag times were chosen to represent the acute (0/1 week), short-term (4 week), and long-term (8 week) effects of environmental variability. All regressions included a dummy variable for year and an autoregressive term (diarrhea incidence lagged 1 week) as predictor variables. This resulted in 4,096 candidate models of under-5 diarrhea for both the wet and dry season, and 256 candidate models for both <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and TSS for each season. In summary, within a multimodel ensemble, every model had the same regression structure (either Gaussian or negative binomial) and included a dummy variable for year and an autoregressive term. The only differences between the models were the environmental variables included as predictors.</p><sec id="sec016"><title>Multimodel inference methods</title><p>Five different subsets of the candidate models were created by (1) retaining all models, (2) selecting models with all coefficients statistically significant at <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.20, (3) selecting models with all coefficients statistically significant at <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.10, (4) selecting models with all coefficients statistically significant at <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, and (5) selecting only the model with the lowest Akaike information criterion, corrected for the small sample size relative to the number of parameters used in each model (AICc). The Akaike weight of each model within the subset was then calculated. Akaike weights provide a relative likelihood that a specific model is the best model in a given subset [<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. &#x0201c;Top&#x0201d; model sets were then obtained by selecting the smallest combination of models with Akaike weights summing to 0.95.</p><p>These top model sets were used to calculate averaged variable coefficients and relative variable importance. The average coefficient for variable <italic>X</italic> was calculated by taking a weighted average of the coefficient estimates for variable <italic>X</italic> from each subset model. Each coefficient estimate was weighted by the Akaike weight of its respective model. Relative variable importance is a measure of how often a predictor variable is included in the best performing models. The relative importance of variable <italic>X</italic> was calculated by adding the Akaike weights of all models that included variable <italic>X</italic> as a predictor. These importance measurements do not add up to 1 because models can include multiple environmental predictors.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Multimodel averaged predictions</title><p>Multimodel averaged predictions are simply the Akaike weighted average of the subset constituent model predictions.

In addition, leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation was performed by omitting 1 year of data from model fitting and then generating and evaluating model averaged predictions for the missing year. Because our models include a dummy variable for year, which cannot be estimated for the omitted year, correlation rather than root mean square error (RMSE) was used to evaluate model predictive performance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Analysis of water quality and under-5 diarrhea</title><p>Negative binomial regressions were used to evaluate the relationships between Chobe River water quality and under-5 diarrhea case reports.

Here, as floodwaters receded from surrounding floodplains, TSS levels increased within the river channel. Differences in lagged relationships suggest that hierarchical environmental processes are occurring, where primary source exposure and secondary transmission dynamics may further contribute to variation in the observed timing of environmental&#x02014;health couplings.</p><p>In our analysis, cross-validation results reveal important heterogeneity in the ability of our environmental models to accurately predict diarrheal case reports across the 8-study villages. Diarrheal disease as a syndrome is complex, driven by a variety of pathogens, each varying in their transmission and persistence dynamics in the system, elements that will vary, together with environmental drivers, within and between years. Sociocultural influences will also shape exposures, secondary transmission, and case detection. These complexities are evident in the demographic and clinical variation seen by season in the outpatient data. However, across models, river height lagged 1 week in the dry season and rainfall lagged 8 weeks in the wet season remained consistently important across all years in predicting diarrheal disease case reports.</p></sec><sec id="sec031"><title>Flood pulse systems and microbial dynamics at the aquatic&#x02014;terrestrial interface</title><p>Waterborne pathogen dynamics are closely coupled with hydrological and ecological processes across the aquatic&#x02014;terrestrial interface and consequent human microbial exposure risk [<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In the studied system, the flood pulse played a critical role in outbreak dynamics across age groups. In such flood pulse systems, floodplain environments are periodically flooded with sediment, with fecal microbial transport occurring between the floodplain and the river channel [<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], influencing microbial community structure and movement across the aquatic&#x02014;terrestrial interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002688.g004">Fig 4</xref>) [<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The character of the flood pulse (alternating cycles of increased water flow, volume, inundation, and draining) establishes the degree of connectivity, with lateral exchange of matter and microbial organisms including waterborne pathogens moving across hydrological connectivity gradients [<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Pathogen communities are shaped by the interactions that occur at this aquatic&#x02014;terrestrial interface and influence the character of waterborne pathogen exposures in associated populations.</p><p>Typically, human health impacts are associated with the rise in water levels and advancement of floodwaters, although the timing of this relationship can be complicated [<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, in the Chobe River system, flood recession and withdrawal from the floodplains back into the river channel drives diarrheal disease outbreaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002688.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Cholera in the Bengal Delta region provides an important contrasting example. In this system, cholera outbreaks occur biannually, a pattern that is unique to this region [<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Here, the flood pulse is important in distributing the cholera pathogen, with disease outbreaks corresponding to high flood levels and water movement distributing pathogens across floodplains. This contrast suggests that differences in pathogen reservoirs (aquatic versus terrestrial) play a critical role in the timing of diarrhea&#x02014;flood relationships and human exposure dynamics. Advancing our understanding of these human&#x02014;environment couplings will provide critical insight into forecasting flood&#x02014;waterborne disease dynamics across different landscapes&#x02014;including for emerging diseases&#x02014;by pathogen type.</p></sec><sec id="sec032"><title>Public health implications</title><sec id="sec033"><title>Under-5 diarrhea surveillance focus</title><p>While significant differences were identified in diarrhea type by age, moderate and severe diarrheal disease (diarrhea with some or severe dehydration or bloody diarrhea) constituted greater than half of the reported cases for all age groups (&#x0003e;60%; &#x0003c;1, 1&#x02013;4, 5+ years; <xref rid="pmed.1002688.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).

While this is critically important, it is an intermediate solution. Many of these regions have water treatment plants that are operational, but clean water is not consistently available. In this study, households in the 8 villages had access to and reported utilizing improved water produced by centralized water processing plants (97% [<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]). This infrastructure should protect the population from in-river water quality declines and waterborne disease, yet biannual diarrheal outbreaks continue to occur, coinciding with degraded river water quality. While numerous factors may influence the ability of water treatment and distribution systems to provide clean water to a population, hydrological variability as observed in this system across seasons can create extreme shifts in TSS levels (which include natural organic material [NOM]), alkalinity, and pH, presenting a challenge to conventional water treatment processes.</p><p>Suspended solids have an important influence on bacterial survival and transport in surface waters, providing protection from UV light, predators, and grazers, and access to nutrients (reviewed in [<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]).

Conventional water treatment includes a coagulation step, which involves the application of chemicals to remove suspended solids (sediments and NOM) from the water into large floc aggregates that are subsequently eliminated through sedimentation and filtration steps [<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The effectiveness of these steps is influenced by water pH, alkalinity, and NOM levels in the water [<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This is then followed by a chemical disinfection step, most frequently through chlorination.</p><p>Many treatment facilities in Africa and elsewhere, however, rely on manual control strategies to determine the coagulation doses needed for water treatment [<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], amounts that may be grossly inadequate during periods of rapid hydrological change and shifts in upstream TSS levels and other water properties [<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Even when elevations in TSS levels are detected, calculation of the optimum coagulant dose is complex and nonlinear, further complicating successful application of manual approaches [<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].

Climate controls on hydrometeorological conditions can vary significantly across a watershed. For example, rainfall in the Angolan Highlands catchment area is driven by the Intertropical Convergence Zone and Congo Air Boundary even as more local circulation changes contribute to the increasingly arid conditions experienced in Botswana in the interior of Southern Africa. Distant meteorological events and teleconnections associated with, for instance, the Walker circulation can further influence diverging climate dynamics (reviewed in [<xref rid="pmed.1002688.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]). As these hydrometeorological processes are intimately linked with diarrheal disease incidence, we can expect shifts in diarrheal disease patterns to be responsive to both local and distant climate dynamics and associated changes under climate change. It is evident that exclusive use of local or country-level climate data would be inadequate to forecast climate impacts on diarrheal disease in this region.

Floods and rainfall variability are expected to increase under climate change across many systems and can induce dramatic shifts in surface water quality. While presenting a clear risk in populations using unsafe water sources, rapid change in suspended solids and other water quality parameters may overwhelm conventional water treatment processes, impacting the provision of safe drinking water and increasing the potential for waterborne pathogen exposure and diarrheal disease. Long-term solutions to diarrheal disease and climate preparedness should include increased national focus on water sector development using technologies that are robust to local environmental conditions but can be serviced and maintained locally. In populations with high HIV burdens, expansion of diarrheal disease surveillance and intervention strategies might be needed, engaging other at-risk sectors beyond the under-5 age group. Ultimately, the success of public health strategies across systems will depend on understanding how sociocultural and environmental factors are coupled across scales and influence waterborne disease exposure risk, transmission dynamics, and population vulnerability in the face of expected climate change.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec039"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002688.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Time series of diarrhea, environmental, and water quality data from 2007 to 2017.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002688.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002688.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Coefficient estimates for the effect of TSS and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> on under-5 diarrhea.</title><p>Each point represents the regression coefficient for the respective water quality measure at a different lag week.
