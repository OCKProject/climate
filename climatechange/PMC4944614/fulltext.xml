The current hypothesis for the extinction is that an asteroid impact in present-day Mexico formed condensed aerosols in the stratosphere, which caused the cessation of photosynthesis and global near-freezing conditions. Here, we show that the stratospheric aerosols did not induce darkness that resulted in milder cooling than previously thought. We propose a new hypothesis that latitude-dependent climate changes caused by massive stratospheric soot explain the known mortality and survival on land and in oceans at the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary. The stratospheric soot was ejected from the oil-rich area by the asteroid impact and was spread globally. The soot aerosols caused sufficiently colder climates at mid&#x02013;high latitudes and drought with milder cooling at low latitudes on land, in addition to causing limited cessation of photosynthesis in global oceans within a few months to two years after the impact, followed by surface-water cooling in global oceans in a few years. The rapid climate change induced terrestrial extinctions followed by marine extinctions over several years.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The Chicxulub impact crater in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, is the third largest known impact crater (ca. 180&#x02009;km in diameter) on Earth.

The current hypothesis for their extinction is that an asteroid impact formed condensed sulfuric acid aerosols in the stratosphere, which reflected sunlight, causing global darkness and inducing cessation of photosynthesis, global near-freezing conditions (impact winter), and acid rain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. However, if this had occurred, crocodilians and various other animals would have also gone extinct. Recent impact experiments and model calculations have demonstrated that condensed sulfuric acid aerosols cannot form and persist over long periods following asteroid impacts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. The process leading to the extinction of the dinosaurs and various marine groups such as the ammonites and most planktonic foraminifera, accompanied by the survival of mammals, birds, crocodilians, and other species, is therefore unknown.</p><p>Soot is a strong light-absorbing aerosol that can have a significant climatic influence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, and the atmospheric lifetime of soot particles is longer (on the scale of years) in the stratosphere, although they are efficiently removed from the atmosphere by precipitation (about a week) in the troposphere<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. However, the amount of soot in the stratosphere, the coincidence of the extinction and stratospheric soot, and the climatic influence are unknown. To clarify these points, we examined organic molecules and their isotopes in a proximal K/Pg section in Haiti accompanied by coarse-ejecta beds containing microspherules overlain by marlstone, including an iridium (Ir) accumulation layer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Information</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. 1</xref>), and a distal site without coarse-ejecta beds in Spain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> and then performed climate model calculations. Soot contains polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), such as coronene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, which form from the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. We estimated the total amount of soot ejected by the impact using the combusted five- to six-ring PAHs [coronene (Cor), benzo(e)pyrene (BeP), benzo(g,h,i)perylene (Bpery)] that remained in the stratosphere. There are two possible origins for the soot at the K/Pg boundary: wildfires<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> and impact target rock<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. The amount of the stratospheric soot estimated here includes the soot from both wild fires and impact target rock. We postulate that all of the stratospheric soot was sourced from the target rock in Chicxulub, Mexico in the model calculation, because (1) most soot particles from present-day wildfire emissions are injected in the troposphere but not into the stratosphere<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, and (2) the sedimentary organic molecule composition indicates the same source for the PAHs from the troposphere and stratosphere, suggesting an enormous cloud of smoke from the Chicxulub crater (see &#x0201c;Origin of soot&#x0201d; in Discussion).</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Combusted PAHs</title><p>Coronene, a six-ring PAH, is a hydrocarbon-derived geochemical diagnostic for combustion.

The presence of both coronene and glass spherules in the coarse deposits implies that the impact induced extensive combustion. The coronene content in combusted five- to six-ring PAHs is defined by the coronene/(coronene&#x02009;+&#x02009;benzo(e)pyrene&#x02009;+&#x02009;benzo(g,h,i)perylene) [Cor/(Cor&#x02009;+&#x02009;BeP&#x02009;+&#x02009;Bpery)] ratio. The Cor/(Cor&#x02009;+&#x02009;BeP&#x02009;+&#x02009;Bpery)] ratio is extremely high in the K/Pg ejecta, that is, the upper 40&#x02009;cm of the coarse-ejecta sediments (average: 0.69; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>), the Ir layer at Beloc, Haiti (0.73), and the Ir layer (0.88) and in the vicinity of the Ir layer (&#x02212;2 to&#x02009;+&#x02009;4&#x02009;cm) at Caravaca, Spain (0.87 average; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). By contrast, low coronene content (0.2&#x02013;0.4) was found in the Maastrichtian deposits at Beloc. The high Cor/(Cor&#x02009;+&#x02009;BeP&#x02009;+&#x02009;Bpery) values at the K/Pg boundary are likely due to an impact with the formation of coronene as the final product, with low values more typical of wildfires<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. The similar values of Cor/(Cor&#x02009;+&#x02009;BeP&#x02009;+&#x02009;Bpery) in the coarse-ejecta sediments, Ir layer, and at Caravaca imply the same source of coronene for the coarse-ejecta sediments and the Ir layer for the proximal and distal sites.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Carbon preference index</title><p>The carbon preference index (CPI)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> values of <italic>n</italic>-alkanes were used to distinguish between crude oil and dead organisms.

We estimated the amount of soot in the stratosphere based on the amount of soluble Cor&#x02009;+&#x02009;BeP&#x02009;+&#x02009;Bpery, which are components of soot<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, in fine sediments containing Ir at a proximal site. We estimated 500, 1500, and 2600&#x02009;Tg black carbon (BC) as the total soot ejecta (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Information</xref>). These estimates did not include rapid removal processes (within several days) in the stratosphere, probably due to coagulation between BC and other larger-sized materials (e.g., dust), and therefore, the actual BC emission from the impact could be greater. However, because we estimated the mass of the BC ejecta from soluble five- to six-ring PAHs falling from the stratosphere during the few years after the impact, the amount of stratospheric BC, which could have caused climate change over several years, did not change. The amount of burned carbon at Chicxulub was estimated to be 1800&#x02013;6000&#x02009;Tg<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, which may have decreased due to removal associated with coagulation between BC and other larger-sized materials, and is consistent with our estimate of the BC amount.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Climate change</title><p>We performed global climate model calculations to quantify the climate change caused by BC (equivalent to soot) injection for three quantities of BC (see Methods). The BC ejected into the stratosphere spread around the globe within a few months and was gradually deposited on the surface over the following five years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). BC in the stratosphere efficiently absorbs solar radiation and reduces the sunlight reaching the Earth&#x02019;s surface, which leads to heating of the stratospheric atmosphere and cooling of the tropospheric atmosphere (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. 2</xref>). The sudden cooling of the surface temperature weakened the hydrologic cycle, resulting in an abrupt and significant decrease in precipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). In the 500-Tg BC ejection scenario, the global-averaged model results indicated an abrupt decrease (by 50&#x02013;60%) in sunlight just after the impact, with shortwave radiation gradually recovering over the following 10 years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). The blocking of sunlight resulted in a decrease in temperature at Earth&#x02019;s surface, a 6&#x02013;9&#x02009;&#x000b0;C cooling that lasted for two years on land, and a 45&#x02013;70% decrease in precipitation on land over the same period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). In the 1500- and 2600-Tg BC ejection cases, abrupt decreases (by 80&#x02013;85% and 85&#x02013;90%) in sunlight led to 10&#x02013;16&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 10&#x02013;18&#x02009;&#x000b0;C cooling that lasted for three and five years on land and 55&#x02013;80% and 60&#x02013;85% decreases in precipitation on land over the same periods, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). The temperature and precipitation gradually recovered within 10 years after the impact and the recoveries decreased over the following years. We found that these climate changes strongly depended on latitude in every BC ejection scenario (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). The temperature cooling was dominant in the mid-high latitude regions due to the presence of large amounts of BC in the stratosphere in those regions. On the other hand, the cooling was milder in the low latitude regions. However, precipitation substantially decreased on land in those regions over several years after the impact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> lists the averaged lowest monthly paleotemperature and precipitation over land at 15&#x000b0; latitude intervals for January and July after the impact in the 500-, 1500-, and 2600-Tg BC ejection scenarios.

Dinosaurs and warm-mild water ammonites could have become extinct, while the crocodilians survived in the 1500-Tg soot ejection case (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">2</xref>). The diminishing photosynthesis and food-web collapse in oceans may have killed the cool-water deep-dwelling ammonites. Therefore, a soot ejection of ~1500&#x02009;Tg seems to be sufficient for the mass extinction and survival that occurred at the K-Pg boundary, as supported by the correspondence between the model results and the geological record. Our results show that the stratospheric aerosols did not induce darkness, in contrast to previous assumptions. The surface cooling was milder than previously thought. Sufficiently colder climates at mid&#x02013;high latitudes caused extinction of the dinosaurs and crocodilians at mid&#x02013;high latitudes; the drought accompanied by mild cooling at low latitudes on land led to extinction of the dinosaurs and allowed survival of the crocodilians at low latitudes. The mild cooling with diminishing photosynthesis in the oceans could have caused extinctions of marine organisms such as ammonites, inoceramids, and most planktonic foraminifera, while allowing the survival of deep-sea organisms. The sufficiently colder climates at mid&#x02013;high latitudes and drought with milder cooling at low latitudes on land, as well as the limited cessation of photosynthesis in global oceans occurred a few months to 2 years after the impact, followed by surface water cooling in global oceans within 2 to 6 years after the impact. The climate change could have led to the terrestrial extinctions within a few years, followed by the marine extinctions over several years. If darkness (no sunlight) had occurred for a few years after the impact, the resulting low temperatures would have caused extinction of the crocodilians, birds, and mammals. The cooling would have been mild to allow their survival on land. The stratospheric soot-aerosol can explain the extinction and survival pattern at the K/Pg boundary. Our results show that rapid global climate change can play a major role in driving extinction.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Sedimentary organic molecule analyses</title><p>Approximately 50&#x02013;100-g hand-sized rock specimens were powdered for each sample after the removal of any apparent surface contamination.
