Characterizing the potential future morbidity and mortality burden of EH and EP and associated costs, as well as uncertainties in the estimates, can identify areas for public health intervention and inform adaptation strategies. We demonstrate a burden of disease and uncertainty assessment using data from Michigan, USA, and provide approaches for deriving these estimates for locations lacking certain data inputs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Case-crossover analysis adapted from previous Michigan-specific modeling was used to characterize the historical EH-mortality relationship by county poverty rate and age group. Historical EH-associated hospitalization and emergency room visit risks from the literature were adapted to Michigan. In the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&#x02019;s BenMAP software, we used a novel approach, with multiple spatially-varying exposures, to estimate all non-accidental mortality and morbidity occurring on EH days (EH days; days where maximum temperature 32.2&#x02013;35 C or&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;35 C) and EP days. We did so for two time periods: the &#x0201c;historical&#x0201d; period (1971&#x02013;2000), and the &#x0201c;projected&#x0201d; period (2041&#x02013;2070), by county.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">The rate of all non-accidental mortality associated with EH days increased from 0.46/100,000 persons historically to 2.9/100,000 in the projected period, for 240 EH-attributable deaths annually. EH-associated ED visits increased from 12/100,000 persons to 68/100,000 persons, for 7800 EH-attributable emergency department visits. EP-associated ED visits increased minimally from 1.7 to 1.9/100,000 persons. Mortality and morbidity were highest among those aged 65+ (91% of all deaths). Projected health costs are dominated by EH-associated mortality ($280 million) and EH-associated emergency department visits ($14 million). A variety of sources contribute to a moderate-to-high degree of uncertainty around the point estimates, including uncertainty in the magnitude of climate change, population composition, baseline health rates, and exposure-response estimates.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">The approach applied here showed that health burden due to climate may significantly rise for all Michigan counties by midcentury. The costs to health care and uncertainties in the estimates, given the potential for substantial attributable burden, provide additional information to guide adaptation measures for EH and EP.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12940-019-0483-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Climate change</kwd><kwd>Morbidity</kwd><kwd>Mortality</kwd><kwd>Emergency department</kwd><kwd>Hospitalization</kwd><kwd>Extreme heat</kwd><kwd>Extreme precipitation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006108</institution-id><institution>National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2UL1TR000433-06</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99ES026198</award-id><award-id>P30 ES017885</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000125</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T42 OH008455-09</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005222</institution-id><institution>National Center for Environmental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EH001124</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cameron</surname><given-names>Lorraine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par22">In this changing climate, state and local health departments in the USA and elsewhere are considering how best to protect the public&#x02019;s health.

The results will help prioritize county level measures to better protect public health in a changing climate.

Firstly, these correspond to round Fahrenheit temperatures of 90&#x02009;&#x000b0;F and 95&#x02009;&#x000b0;F, and extreme caution is advised by the local Detroit National Weather Service office at temperatures over 90&#x02009;&#x000b0;F [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], which used more recent, albeit more spatially constrained, mortality time series. Secondly, time series and case-crossover study designs, on which our estimates are based, can account for mortality displacements of 1&#x02013;3&#x02009;weeks, thereby subtracting out the mortality attributable to heat that was among very frail individuals who would have died within 1&#x02013;3&#x02009;weeks anyway. Beyond 3&#x02009;weeks, we are not aware of research quantifying mortality displacement specific to cities in Michigan, although the extent of mortality displacement varies widely between countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].

It is not likely that ozone strongly mediates the EH-mortality or EH-hospitalization effects given that its inclusion in models of the association between EH and mortality and hospitalizations in Michigan did not affect the estimates of the EH effects by more than 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. We did not have projected increases in ozone concentrations and could not estimate its projected direct effect, independent of EH. However, a projection of mortality in 2041&#x02013;2050 due to ozone in 19 communities in the Southeastern U.S. found a small, 0.43&#x02009;ppb increase in average ozone concentration due to climate change as compared to concentrations in 2000 and a concomitant 0.01% increase in the mortality rate attributable to climate-change related increases in ozone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. A study of the New York City metropolitan region projected a 7.3% increase in ozone-related asthma emergency department visits among children by the 2020s as compared to 1990s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>], suggesting modest independent effects of ozone.</p><p id="Par83">In addition to potential increases in ozone, some of the historical and projected ED visits which we attributed to EH may be among individuals experiencing asthma exacerbations. Several studies have found associations between temperature and asthma symptoms or ED visits. Winquist et al. found a 6% increase in the risk of ED visits for asthma among children in Atlanta at the 75th vs. 25th percentile of daily maximum temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. In Australia, Li et al. found increased reports of wheeze/chest tightness and cough/phlegm with increasing temperatures in a cohort of 270 children with asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>], and pediatric ED visits for chronic lower respiratory diseases increased in association with high temperatures in a separate study in Brisbane, Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Hospitalizations were increased for asthma and other respiratory conditions in New York City [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. An evaluation of pediatric records from a Detroit hospital found an additional 1.8 asthma ED visits for a 10&#x02009;&#x000b0;F increase in temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. We did not quantify the specific morbidity burden of asthma attributable to EH, but given the high prevalence of asthma in the State of Michigan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>], EH-associated asthma morbidity may be of particular concern in Michigan with climate change.</p><p id="Par84">Although reviews on preterm birth and heat published prior to this project&#x02019;s scoping phase suggested that the association was unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>], several studies have been published more recently indicating an association between birth outcomes and heat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. Future burden of disease assessments in Michigan should consider birth outcomes, particularly in light of the high baseline preterm birth rate in Detroit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. Similarly, we did not identify injuries, including occupational injury not listed as heat-related, or self-inflicted injuries as EH-associated concerns in the scoping phase. Recent research indicates significant associations of non-heat-related injuries with EH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>], and future Michigan climate burden of disease assessments should consider EH-associated injuries.</p><p id="Par85">Climate change may have significant impacts on public health beyond EH and EP impacts beyond those quantified in this paper. Notably, pollen levels are expected to increase in North America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. Temperature and precipitation, as well as carbon dioxide concentrations, affect the levels of several types of tree and grass pollen, and this may lead to increases in allergic respiratory morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. Furthermore, the pollen season length is increasing with climate change, although research on pollen trends is lacking due to a lack of consistent pollen monitoring over a long timescale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. Future research should address the impacts of higher pollen levels on asthma and allergy incidence and exacerbation.</p><p id="Par86">We have only calculated the EP-attributable burden of GI illness related to ED visits. Most people experiencing GI illness do not seek treatment in EDs or medical care of any kind. Using a variety of surveillance systems, Mead et al. estimated that the average person experiences 1.05 episodes of GI illness annually characterized by diarrhea, vomiting or both [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. By this estimate, GI-related ED visits <italic>underestimate</italic> the total burden of GI-related illness by a factor of 100, and our estimate of the burden of GI illness attributable to EP is severely underestimated by our EP-attributable burden of GI-related ED visits. Furthermore, our quantitative EP estimate may not have accounted for the effects of harmful algal blooms, which may affect Michigan and Massachusetts drinking water delivery systems differently.</p><p id="Par87">We did not project increases in legionellosis with EP given the inconsistency in the literature in associations between legionellosis and precipitation. However, some of the studies suggested a greater importance of temperature and humidity than EP in legionellosis incidence, and confidence that temperature will increase with climate change is high.</p><p id="Par88">Several limitations to our estimates of the burden of future EH and EP exist, largely stemming from uncertainty surrounding various model inputs. The uncertainty analysis indicated that our mortality projections are only mildly sensitive to different population assumptions. Other inputs, including the exposure data and exposure-response function, carry greater uncertainty. A key limitation in our approach is the use of historical relationships for the estimation of future health effects without accounting for long-term adaptation to EH or EP. Physiological and behavioral adaptations have the potential to reduce the impact of extreme weather. Our results may therefore be regarded as a direr scenario where effective public health measures protecting individuals from extreme weather events have not been adopted.</p><p id="Par89">Additionally, our analysis does not fully account for uncertainty in climate models or future climate conditions. Our projections of EH days were derived using the high emissions A2 scenario, although the lower emissions scenarios are becoming statistically improbable given recent historic emissions trends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. Incorporating exposure projections derived from alternate, low emissions scenarios would likely result in lower mortality estimates. On the other hand, evidence from other studies suggests that mortality and morbidity increase at less extreme temperatures in temperate climates such as Michigan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This would imply that our results underestimate the total number of deaths and ED visits associated with this climate scenario.</p></sec><sec id="Sec47"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par90">Under a dire climate change scenario, we estimated a Michigan-wide increase in EH-associated mortality from 0.46/100,000 persons historically to 2.9/100,000 in the projected period for $280 million in costs. We estimated a more substantial increase in EH-associated ED visits from 12/100,000 persons to 68/100,000 persons, for 7800 EH-attributable emergency department visits and $14 million in costs. EP-associated ED visits increased minimally from 1.7 to 1.9/100,000 persons, although this quantitative estimate did not include self-treated gastroenteritis or sufficiently represent the range of health problems from harmful algal blooms, flooding, and legionellosis. With the use of a high-emissions climate scenario and the exclusion of adaptation in the model we may over-estimate the future burden due to extreme temperatures in Michigan, but the exclusion of health effects from moderate heat, pollen, and precipitation-associated respiratory effects as well as any non-emergent health effects may result in substantial underestimation of both the present and future burden of climate in Michigan. Further research should investigate the association between moderate heat, precipitation, pollen, and health to gain a more complete picture of Michigan&#x02019;s climate-related disease burden. Our finding of a notable burden of mortality and morbidity attributable to EH, without assumptions about adaptation, stresses the importance of actions to protect health against the adverse health effects of EH. Additionally, although the uncertainty in the GI-illness projections is high, the health risks of poor public drinking water quality that can result from harmful algal blooms and storm-related emergencies are clear. In these emergencies, access to clean water for drinking and bathing can become challenges, and preparations for increases in EP events should focus on distribution of clean, potable water in emergencies to affected residents to avoid waterborne illnesses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec48"><p>
