To keep them fit under climate change, their management needs to be adapted to address related direct and indirect changes. In our study we focus on the adaptation of conservation management planning, evaluating management plans of 60 protected areas throughout Germany with regard to their climate change-robustness. First, climate change-robust conservation management was defined using 11 principles and 44 criteria, which followed an approach similar to sustainability standards. We then evaluated the performance of individual management plans concerning the climate change-robustness framework. We found that climate change-robustness of protected areas hardly exceeded 50 percent of the potential performance, with most plans ranking in the lower quarter. Most Natura 2000 protected areas, established under conservation legislation of the European Union, belong to the sites with especially poor performance, with lower values in smaller areas. In general, the individual principles showed very different rates of accordance with our principles, but similarly low intensity. Principles with generally higher performance values included holistic knowledge management, public accountability and acceptance as well as systemic and strategic coherence. Deficiencies were connected to dealing with the future and uncertainty. Lastly, we recommended the presented principles and criteria as essential guideposts that can be used as a checklist for working towards more climate change-robust planning.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research has been funded by contributions of several funders: Faculty of Forest and Environment of the Eberswalde University for Sustainable Development, German Academic Scholarship Foundation, Potsdam University, Lincoln University (New Zealand), German Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety through German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation, German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (project INKA BB).

Protected areas are considered the cornerstones of conservation strategies and must also adapt to climate change while continuing to conserve biodiversity [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. On one hand, protected areas are vulnerable to climate change because they are often conceptualised statically, despite the spatially and temporally dynamic nature of their conservation objects (e.g. individual species, communities or ecosystems) [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Nonetheless, they provide an insurance policy for biodiversity as refuges for ecosystem recovery and for preserving systems that are sensitive to disturbance [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Protected areas can also promote the adaptive capacity of ecosystems by providing a buffer against the rate and intensity of environmental change, or providing habitat corridors to facilitate species range- or ecosystem regime- shifts [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In general, major conservation organizations argue that protected areas are the best means of addressing climate change since they play a significant role in both mitigation and adaptation [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Additionally, they are supposed to be places of high ecological integrity and functionality, which more or less embrace sustainable, organized and effective land use management [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>It is due to this particular standing that protected areas, especially large-scale conservation sites, should take up a leading role not only for traditional biodiversity conservation but also as potential cores for the crystallization of integrative conservation in the wider landscape [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Thus, they may serve as catalysts for the implementation of the principles of ecosystem-based management and ecosystem-based adaptation (e.g., the Ecosystem Approach [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] in [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]). However, protected areas can only take up this role if their vulnerability to climate change can effectively be reduced. A considerable number of publications with general recommendations on how to integrate climate change into conservation management and planning are now available [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Some studies and reports provide specific practical guidance for protected areas with real world examples [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>There are different lines of action for conservation, and for protected areas in particular, to face climate change and reduce vulnerability. One is to tackle the vulnerability of conservation targets or biodiversity objects, i.e. reduce the biotic vulnerability [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This approach is prevalent in existing literature (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]). The majority of conservation action associated with this approach depends on the regional or local specifics of the conservation system and its influencing factors. Nevertheless, it is possible to extract generally valid principles. These include reducing threats not related to climate change, ecological restoration, assisted migration or enhancing connectivity, e.g. by the expansion of the reserve network [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Thus, most recommendations found in the existing literature focus more or less on direct interventions with biodiversity. However, one part of the vulnerability of protected areas is also caused by human interactions within and with the protected area and its human non-human parts [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Nevertheless, options to reduce the vulnerability of conservation management on the levels of planning and implementation procedures are less often considered. A more holistic approach will therefore include all decisions and actions that directly or indirectly influence goal achievement of a conservation site [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Many of those planning and procedural options can be considered climate change-robust (or no-regret) adaptation options [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This means they will strengthen conservation with regard to climate change irrespectively of the exact manifestation of change, or with regard to other environmental or political changes. These robust strategies may also improve the performance and effectiveness of conservation management even if no changes occur [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>A considerable number of evaluations of protected area management effectiveness in general have been conducted applying various methods, most of which are based on the IUCN Management Effectiveness Framework (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]) but also other approaches [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The contemporary evaluation criteria for protected area management effectiveness [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] consider climate change merely as one out of many factors that need to be considered, for instance as a threat to biodiversity [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, unlike many other conventional threats, climate change is an overarching multifaceted element affecting all parts of any conservation system unprecedentedly, including other threats and their underlying drivers, [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] as well as the management itself. Therefore, all components of a management system contribute to conservation effectiveness under climate change and need to be tailored specifically to this effect. This has been rarely reflected by research on protected area management. Evaluations of local climate change adaptation plans have been conducted without a specific focus on conservation, for example in the USA [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], in Australia [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], Canada [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and India [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. One recent study in Germany assessed to what degree conservation plans at the county level addressed potential impacts of climate change [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In a study on the vulnerability of German protected areas to climate change, Kreft et al. [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] also included, among others, some aspects of conservation management itself. They found that management-related issues were the most significant contributing factor influencing the vulnerability of protected areas to climate change in Germany.</p><p>Because of these findings, and to fill the knowledge gap regarding suitable evaluation criteria for climate change adaptation in protected areas, we present principles of climate change-robust management. Our objectives are to guide conservation planning and to provide a framework for assessing the quality and effectiveness of those plans. We define climate change-robustness in protected area management as conservation management that is effective in sustaining the functionality of a protected area despite the myriad of potential impacts associated with climate change. Climate change-robustness heavily builds upon a sturdy fundament of effective management combined with add-ons specifically tailored to tackling climate change. The presented principles hence elaborate on, rather than contradict, existing criteria for evaluating management effectiveness in addressing issues related to climate change. We use our proposed set of principles for climate change-robust conservation management in building an evaluation framework for assessing climate change-robustness of protected area management plans, focussing on a case study in Germany. Further, we analyse the accordance of protected areas and the respective management plans with individual robustness principles. Specifically, we address the following research questions:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>How does management planning of protected areas perform with regard to climate change-robustness? How do different protected areas in Germany compare in their robustness?</p></list-item><list-item><p>How do individual principles and criteria of climate change-robustness perform across German protected areas?

In cases where only short versions were available, we requested full versions from the responsible administration unit. Pre-versions or partially accomplished versions were excluded from the analysis. For BR and NLP we contacted the administrations separately if management plan status could not be determined. To acquire the management plans of the NP and Natura 2000 sites, we contacted several responsible institutions. However, the number of replies was very low, particularly for the latter sites. This resulted in unequal representation among federal states. We tried to choose plans of varying ages for each federal state. In the case of NP we pursued the guideline of one park per federal state as far as the availability and rate of reply allowed.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Developing the evaluation protocol</title><p>We developed a protocol for the evaluation of the selected management plans in accordance with sustainability certification where principles and subordinated criteria are used to define sustainable practice (e.g., FSC [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] or RSPO [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]). The evaluation framework for our analysis was based on three types of sources regarding climate change adaptation strategies: 1) fixed standards for holistic, sustainable, and equitable natural resource and conservation management (such as the Ecosystem Approach), 2) scientific publications on options and recommendations for adapting conservation to climate change and 3) experience from project activities on management planning integrating climate change. From these, the most common and most conclusive recommendations were extracted (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0185972.t002">Table 2</xref>). Finally, we defined eleven principles of climate change-robust conservation management, and identified 44 guiding criteria (four for each principle) to enable assessment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0185972.t003">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0185972.s002">S1 Table</xref>). The majority of principles and criteria resemble those of best practice conservation management, with a new and/or stronger significance with regard to climate change. A more detailed description of the principles and their contribution to climate change-robustness of conservation management can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0185972.s002">S1 Table</xref>. We applied an equal weighting approach to the criteria, which is the standard approach among the plan quality evaluation literature [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].

The three research assistants were thoroughly introduced to the protocol and instructed in the manner of scoring. In order to ensure scoring consistency, the coders test-coded several trial-plans prior to the evaluation. Based on the tests the protocol was revised and adapted to make it more robust to scoring by different coders. The final protocol was then used to conduct the evaluation of the 60 management plans. Each coder coded a different set of plans individually first, followed by a process of review by the lead author and open discussion among evaluators until a consensus on the scores was reached.</p><p>The degree of accordance of the eleven principles in the management plans was evaluated by scoring the plans against each of the respective four criteria of each principle on a 0&#x02013;2 scale similar to the analytical approaches of previous studies on plan quality (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]). In the present study a score of 0 was given if the criterion was not at all met by the plan or 1 if the criterion was only implicitly acknowledged or partly reflected in the plan without thorough explanation. The highest possible score of 2 was given if the criterion had been fully and comprehensively addressed by the plan. For example, considering criterion 1.1 <italic>Climate change in situation analysis</italic>, a management plan would get a score of 0 if climate change was not mentioned at all in the situation analysis. The plan would receive a score of 1 if it mentioned climate change as a factor influencing conservation objects without further explanation, or if it elaborated on climate change for only a small fraction of the situation analysis while neglecting most parts of it. A score of 2 could be reached if climate change was comprehensively included, elaborating on the impact on biodiversity as well as other factors, such as land use or infrastructure development.

First, we calculated the general climate change-robustness index for each management plan by summing the actual scores of each of the 44 criteria (max. score 88). This index represents the overall performance of the 60 plans against the criteria of the evaluation framework. For an easier assessment, we additionally standardised and normalized the original plan score in percent, and used descriptive statistics to assess overall performance. In the second stage, we tested for statistical significance for the contribution of individual site characteristics of the protected areas to climate change-robustness in &#x0201c;R&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] using the package &#x0201c;ggplot2&#x0201d; applying a Pairwise Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test for protected area category and the Spearman&#x02019;s Rank Correlation for area size in case of Natura 2000 sites.

We assessed and compared the performance of the eleven principles and the 44 criteria across all management plans of the sample from three perspectives: their rate of accordance (item breadth score), the quality or degree of their accordance (item depth score) and their total performance (total item score). The three item scores were calculated as follows:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Item breadth score: number of plans that address the item/number of plans in sample (score 0&#x02013;1)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Item depth score: total score of all plans that addressed an item/ number of plans that addressed the issue (standardised score 0&#x02013;1)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Total item score: item breadth score + standardised item depth score</p></list-item></list><p>We used the breadth analysis to measure the extent to which each of the principles and criteria was addressed across all management plans, i.e. the proportion of plans that addressed the individual principle or criterion. The score was given on a 0&#x02013;1 scale for all items. The depth score measures to what extent each individual principle and criterion was addressed by the plans, meaning the level or intensity of accordance for each principle. The depth score for principles reaches a value between 0 and 8 and was standardised to a 0&#x02013;1 scale (where 0.125 is the lowest achievable value if at least one plan adopted the principle; the value 0 is assigned to principles that were not reflected at all in the plans). With regard to the criteria, the depth score results in a 0&#x02013;2 scale that was standardised to a 0&#x02013;1 scale (where the lowest achievable value is 0.5 if at least one plan adopted the criterion, and the value of 0 is reached if none of the plans adopted the criterion).

Our findings suggest the climate change-robustness of management plans of German protected areas is rather low. The majority of plans scored below 25% of the maximum score, lacked concreteness and neglected the issue of climate change adaptation. Our results underpin those of Kreft et al. [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. According to their climate change vulnerability index applied to German protected areas, most of the 121 assessed protected areas in Germany can be categorised as highly vulnerable against climate change; none of the sites showed low vulnerability [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The only two sites we found scoring above 50% of the possible score showed great differences in their individual site characteristics. One area was a NLP in Bavaria with a prevalence of forests and mountainous terrain; the plan was accomplished by the park administration in 2010. The other area was a BR in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania with an open landscape in the northern plains and a management plan prepared by an external contractor in 2003. Our results indicate that it is not individual site characteristics per se that affect climate change-robustness, but primarily the protected area category. BR and NLP seem to be most robust, while NP and Natura 2000 sites are particularly deficient concerning climate change. Reasons could include the differences in guidelines, requirements and the administration of different protected area categories, but also differently structured competences and resources available.</p><p>The higher robustness performance of BR and NLP is not surprising, since their definition and legislation inherently provide much better for climate change-robustness than do NP and Natura 2000 sites. The underlying concepts of BR and NLP foster greater motivation to meet principles of the Ecosystem Approach. However, the relatively high robustness scores among BR and NLP were still rather low in absolute terms. This should give cause for concern since a large part of the principles and their criteria can be considered best practice conservation, as they have already been adopted in other concepts such as the Ecosystem Approach. Even after one and a half decades, the Ecosystem Approach still appears to remain &#x02018;stuck in the clouds&#x02019; [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Similarly, NP per definition&#x02013;as large landscape-scale protected areas&#x02013;also have an appropriate fundament theoretically favouring climate change-robust management, but many of them exhibit weaker enforcement, administration and implementation of that definition.</p><p>Our results underline the deficiencies of the Natura 2000 complex regarding climate change (adaptation) that have been previously identified and discussed elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. One important problem is the static conceptualisation of Natura 2000 protection goals, which require a fixed list of annex species and habitats to be conserved on-site [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. In addition, Natura 2000 implementation follows country-specific idiosyncrasies. In the case of Germany, the sheer number of over 5,000 Natura 2000 sites makes it a tantalising effort for the conservation administrations to provide every site with a management plan, even if it was a simple one. The quality of the plans thus has become second priority. The guidelines for Natura 2000 management planning generally do not develop instructions for climate change robustness, which is another factor. For instance, the newest version of the handbook for management planning of sites protected under the Habitats Directive of the EU in the German federal state of Brandenburg does not refer to climate change at all [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. The previous version covered this topic in several contexts, although only superficially. It must be concluded that innovations towards climate change-robustness have not only been lacking but even regressing. This is also reflected by our results: most of the younger plans in our sample belong to Natura 2000 sites, which attained lower robustness scores relative to large, national protected areas. This stands in contrast to the intuitive assumption that knowledge increases over time and is in turn incorporated into management guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. It is noteworthy that the most vulnerable conservation sites in Germany (i.e. the Natura 2000 sites as also identified by Kreft et al. [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]) have the least climate change-robust conservation management planning. Moreover, as we have indicated, among the Natura 2000 sites management planning of the smaller areas tends to be less climate change-robust than that of larger Natura 2000 sites. This seems quite maladaptive as smaller areas are inherently more vulnerable to climate change and other threats, and thus are areas that would require a more robust management planning.</p><p>The protected area management plans evaluated in our study differed enormously in their quality and contents (and assumingly in their function in actual management). Nolte et al. [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] found management planning to be one of the weak elements with regard to protected area management effectiveness. The present study does not account for unofficial or non-published internal management documents which might in fact play an important role with regard to climate change adaptation efforts [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. For instance, the management framework <italic>(Rahmenkonzept)</italic> of Schaalsee Biosphere Reserve was published in 2003 [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] and remains the official guiding document. Climate change is only scarcely considered in this document. Since 2007 the BR has engaged very actively in climate change mitigation and adaptation with several projects, cooperative partnerships and studies (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]) which are mainly presented on the website of the BR [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. At the same time, it is questionable in how far the contents of even well-composed management plans find actual implementation. Judging from our experience, we would argue that an evaluation of actual management performance and effectiveness might produce even lower climate change-robustness scores. In many cases, in Germany, Natura 2000 sites have assigned neither staff exclusively in charge nor regular resources for implementation. Often the areas are very small and do not have appropriate buffer zones. Due to the lack of demarcation they are often not even recognizable for visitors or land users. There is a clear risk that management plans might not actually be used as the basic and guiding instruments for management. The low values of climate change-robustness might represent the tip of an iceberg of management deficiencies. If management plans constitute a key element of adaptation to climate change, their quality, functional role, preparation and implementation need to be improved.</p><p>We found the principles of climate change-robustness were reflected very differently in the plans. This confirms the notion that standards in conservation planning are lacking&#x02013;which was also concluded from a study on German county-level conservation plans (<italic>Landschaftsrahmenpl&#x000e4;ne</italic>, regulating conservation on the county level) [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. A similar finding applies to many climate change adaptation plans beyond nature conservation [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Therefore, existing adaptation guidance is used inconsistently. This does not preclude quality plans, but it certainly increases the risk of failure [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Principles of climate change-robustness</title><sec id="sec019"><title>Achievements</title><p>The strongest accordance with the principles of climate change-robust conservation management was achieved in terms of <italic>holistic knowledge management (P5)</italic>, <italic>public accountability &#x00026; acceptance (P10)</italic> as well as <italic>systemic &#x00026; strategic coherence (P6)</italic>. We presume that the strength of principles with higher performance partially arises from other discourses and discussions in connection with conservation than that of climate change adaptation. Public participation and acceptance as well as the connectivity of ecosystems are topics that find attention in many other contexts. Nonetheless, they support climate change-robustness of protected areas and should even be more promoted in the light of adapting to climatic or any kind of change. The high performance of the principle of <italic>holistic knowledge management (P5)</italic> is possibly grounded on the high motivation of administrations in Germany to compile and document knowledge about protected areas, which for many of them&#x02013;in our experience&#x02013;is appreciated as the most important planning outcome. Gathering, analysing and discussing knowledge indeed generates new understanding and awareness. However, translation into practical management, i.e. implementation, might turn out to be deficient, making knowledge accumulation of little use. This knowing-doing gap is a common problem in conservation [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Deficiencies</title><p>The most serious deficiencies we encountered were associated with principles dealing with the future and uncertainty in particular: planning with <italic>adequate time dimension (P4)</italic>, <italic>addressing climate change (P1)</italic> and <italic>proactive risk management (P8</italic>). This corresponds with the most prominent climate change adaptation deficiencies identified in other studies and contexts [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Additionally we concluded that NP showed the greatest deficiencies in terms of those three principles. Management units in charge of Natura 2000 sites exhibited very low degrees of accordance for all of the principles (most depth scores below 0.25) with very different rates of acknowledgement of their importance.</p><p>The encountered deficiencies appear to be tightly connected with the total lack of capacity building strategies for protected area staff with regard to research abilities and methodological training for climate change adaptation across all evaluated plans. The wish and perceived need to increase the knowledge base before acting prevails. This issue was also encountered in 57 climate change adaptation plans in developed countries [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Because of uncertainty and the lack of a culture dealing with non-knowledge and mistakes, managers seem to feel not strong enough and legitimated to ground management decisions on projections or scenarios. In conversations (in Brandenburg) they often insist in the judgement that current threats to biodiversity are more pressing than future changes. They seem to be more comfortable with reactive management, which is easier to justify, even when it is clearly coming too late and likely to fail. From many discussions we know that the reason could be even more trivial, but still alarming: Managers are simply overwhelmed by day-to-day management and have no resources for thinking about a more complex and future-oriented management. However, this greatly inhibits climate change adaptation. Also Geyer et al. [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] identified a serious lack of confidence in proactive and future-oriented thinking. Other obstacles associated with the most deficient principles identified in other studies include a lack of resources and manpower, established management habits that conflict with a systematic learning process, static and incoherent legislation as well as restrictive policies and terms of reference for certain protected areas [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Not questioning the changeability of such barriers (however difficult they might appear to overcome) may itself be considered an obstacle to the adaptation process [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Recommendations for practical applications</title><sec id="sec022"><title>Improving conservation management planning</title><p>Undoubtedly, there is the need for better management plans in conservation [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Besides the quality of plans and their applicability, the process of planning also needs to be improved. It is inevitable to make conservation planning more systematic, strategic, adaptive, iterative and target-oriented. The <italic>Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation</italic> are in use at many conservation sites all over the world and have proven a valuable methodology for strategic adaptive conservation planning. This methodology makes management leaner, easier, more transparent and participatory in terms of both design and implementation [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. MARISCO, an approach derived from the <italic>Open Standards</italic>, facilitates ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change and embraces risk management. It has been tested in numerous conservation projects all over the world [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Such management planning instruments address many shortcomings of current conservation management and take up on the presented principles of climate change-robustness. They are applicable on all planning levels regardless their size and organisational structure and represent a promising tool to bridge current planning and communication gaps in conservation planning [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Their standard terminologies typically ensure high comparability between planning levels and different sites and can thus facilitate better coherence in target setting as well as in aligning strategies across different institutional levels [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Experience has also shown that those approaches are very useful to foster mutual learning. Further, guidelines on management planning, the participation in quality programmes (such as the German nature park quality campaign [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]) and international networks (like the Natura 2000 network or the UNESCO MAB Programme) as well as effectiveness evaluation programmes exert an additional influence on the quality of protected area management and its climate change-robustness. Protected areas would be well advised to comply with such guidelines and programmes and recognise them as chances to make management more (climate change-) robust.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Adopting principles of climate change-robustness in conservation management</title><p>If protected areas shall maintain their functions such as conserving biodiversity in times of (climate) change, their management will have to become more robust against such change. Our evaluation framework provides eleven principles and 44 criteria for climate change-robust conservation management. These principles and criteria are designed to serve as guidance on different planning and management levels. Protected area managers may use these principles in their planning activities, their daily work, for identifying area-specific shortcomings and strengths and thus enhance robustness of the site they are responsible for. Conservation policy might equally be guided by these principles. Drawing on principles and criteria identified as most deficient we consider it acutely necessary</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>to consider future changes in general and climate change in particular in all steps of conservation management planning,</p></list-item><list-item><p>to enhance cooperation between protected areas and to align their management,</p></list-item><list-item><p>to take particular responsibility for ecosystem-based adaptation and climate management in protected areas and also their surroundings involving all relevant stakeholders,</p></list-item><list-item><p>to build strong and systematic monitoring systems to measure goal achievement and management effectiveness and inform management planning,</p></list-item><list-item><p>to build capacity for climate change management and install persons or larger management units that are commissioned to particularly deal with climate change and with climate change mitigation and adaptation,</p></list-item><list-item><p>to accomplish with the information and education mission of protected areas in terms of climate change and its implications on local, regional, national and international level, and thus</p></list-item><list-item><p>to inform and educate about options of mitigation and adaptation to climate change, ecosystem-based adaptation and climate management.</p></list-item></list><p>In addition, or as an alternative to new climate change-specific guidelines, existing guidelines for protected area management should be revised with regard to climate change adaption. Specific checklists for climate change-robust management need to be compiled, using, for example, the principles presented in this study or similar guidelines elaborated for conservation in Brandenburg, Germany [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Sites protected within the Natura 2000 complex in particular would benefit greatly from such guidelines. This would not only increase climate change-robustness, but also improve management planning in general, which in many cases is currently suffering from substantial deficiencies. Surely, the process of climate change adaptation needs to be tailored to the site and to local needs [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Nevertheless, general guidelines on climate change adaptation and specific principles for climate change-robust management can provide a framework into which protected area managers can fit their site-specific planning and actions.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Identifying and overcoming barriers for climate change adaptation</title><p>An analysis of obstacles to a successful adaptation of conservation management to climate change is essential. Specific frameworks for diagnosing barriers are available (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]). Many perceived limits in fact turn out to be barriers that, once identified as such, can be overcome with pertinent effort. For example, the application of adaptive and risk management methodologies is often seen difficult in the frame of existing legal regulations. However, in many cases the reservation, insecurity and entrenched habits of planners and managers can be stronger impediments to climate change-robust management than those generated by existing legislation.</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Fostering communication, collective learning and knowledge exchange</title><p>Collective experiential knowledge plays an important role in conservation [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>] and might be particularly useful for climate change adaptation. It has been suggested that the establishment of open-access databases of management plans might facilitate collaborative learning, knowledge exchange and communication between conservation actors [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Such exchange could include protected areas managers and other conservation actors as well as experts and researchers. It might benefit evaluation and revision of management plans, for example with regard to the principles of climate change-robustness. Different protected areas might have different competences regarding those principles. Thus, an exchange of knowledge and experiences might be useful to increase the intensity of their adoption. This holds especially for those principles that are already widely acknowledged and mostly lack adequate depth for satisfactory performance. Such cooperation might also make the identification of common barriers easier and facilitate the joint development of overarching solutions.</p></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>Linking planning, implementation and evaluation</title><p>The linkage between planning, implementation, evaluation and learning is the essence of adaptive management. It should be consolidated much more [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], both by practitioners on site level as well as on other levels of conservation management. The evaluation of management effectiveness needs to be understood as a learning process. It may improve management by facilitating individual and institutional learning as well as the exchange between conservation managers and other actors, by lending credibility to all actors of protected area governance, by raising awareness of importance of protected areas and also by contributing to reporting obligations [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185972.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Moreover, protected area management effectiveness evaluations should account for climate change-robustness more explicitly, as the IUCN Green List of Protected and Conserved Areas Standard already demonstrates [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. One may envision a kind of certificate for climate change-robust conservation management.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>Study limitations and future research opportunities</title><p>The most critical limitation of our study was that only the content of management plans, but not their actual implementation, was evaluated. However, addressing implementation would have gone beyond the scope of this study, or would have limited the sample of scrutinised protected areas to a low number.</p><p>Future research might apply different weights on individual principles and criteria according to their perceived influence and importance. Our study might provide some indication which principles could get assigned more weight in correspondence to their primary and immediate importance (e.g. addressing climate change, risk management, adaptive management, time dimension, managing for ecosystem functionality and resilience) and which ones might have less direct importance for climate change-robustness (e.g. individual criteria in terms of participation and acceptance, matrix management). In this case the overall climate change-robustness scores would probably even be much lower. Disadvantages of weighting are at least twofold. First, direct comparison of the performance of principles becomes more difficult. Second, unequal weighting means a loss in transparency of the principles and criteria framework.</p><p>It would be fruitful to extend and diversify the study sample for a more thorough assessment of climate change-robustness of conservation management. Thus, protected areas with less accessible management plans or different protection status could be included. In addition, the focus could be widened beyond protected areas and include plans and policies of other means of conservation management on varying levels (e.g., county-level plans, national biodiversity strategies). Finally, a comparison of protected areas in other countries with those in Germany is without doubt essential to reach a good understanding of the existing range of adaptation approaches to climate change.</p><p>In order to make conservation management more climate change-robust it would be beneficial to further explore factors that might explain variation in robustness. A closer link to local planning settings and processes might give valuable insight into causes for success and failures of climate change adaptation in conservation. Apart from basic resource capacities of protected area administrations, more delicate factors such as climate change risk perception of conservation managers, their planning capacities as well as personal values and beliefs can also play a role [<xref rid="pone.0185972.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Details of the planning process (e.g., degree of public participation, consultation of external experts, available resources, responsibilities and mandates) as well as the governance context can also strongly influence planning, the quality of the plan and its implementation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec028"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study gives valuable insight into current deficiencies of accounting for climate change in protected area management planning. Although climate change adaptation in conservation has long been a focus of discussions and studies, this study sets a signal that its practical application to date has been slow and has not been conducted with enough rigor. By suggesting eleven principles with according criteria, we hope it may spark a discussion on (unused) options for making protected areas more climate change-robust. A good starting point is provided for further development towards climate change-robust protected area management since most principles were reflected by most of the plans suggesting that they are generally acknowledged as important. The lack of appropriate depth in addressing the principles of climate change-robust conservation management might imply that the necessary competence are still deficient in many protected area administrations and need to be developed. Existing and evolving competences and approaches might yield fruitful guidance for adapting to climate change.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec029"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0185972.s001"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Description of the four protected area categories sampled in the study: Biosphere reserves, national parks, nature parks and Natura 2000 sites.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0185972.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0185972.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Description and rationale of the principles and criteria of climate change-robust conservation management.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0185972.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0185972.s003"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>References of the 60 management plans analysed in the study on climate change-robustness of protected area management plans in Germany.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0185972.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0185972.s004"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Evaluation scores of the 60 protected area management plans as assigned in the plan quality evaluation process.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0185972.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0185972.s005"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Breadth, depth and total quality scores for the 11 principles and 44 criteria of the climate change-robustness index.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0185972.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study is one output of the cooperative graduate programme &#x0201c;Adaptive Nature Conservation under Climate Change&#x0201d; of the Eberswalde University for Sustainable Development, Potsdam University and Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK).
