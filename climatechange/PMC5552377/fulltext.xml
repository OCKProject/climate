We've stopped the question at "is the earth warming" when there are so many more- how much is caused by man (it's certainly not 100%), what can we do about it?

I feel the market is more than capable of responding to any threats from climate change and we should let our technology continue to develop so we can counter any ill effects we come across.</td></tr><tr><td>What confuses me is how people can deny the fact that whether or not the earth is warming, it is definitely changing.

Plants need carbon dioxide to survive. So, now CO2 is a poison responsible for warming the planet to the point that human survival is at risk? Also, the sea level was already supposed to have risen several feet (according to media from a decade ago). Sea levels seem to be the same to me.</td></tr><tr><td>The politicizing of facts.

Too many assumptions, and not enough actual science.</td></tr><tr><td>I don't understand why we don't use more nuclear power.</td></tr><tr><td>denial by our government</td></tr><tr><td>Migration patterns.</td></tr><tr><td>the most troubling aspect of it all is that not everyone is doing all they can to reduce their carbon footprint to reduce global warming</td></tr><tr><td>All countries view global warming differently. There is no one solution.</td></tr><tr><td>Nothing about global warming is confusing or troubling to me. We have nothing to worry about.</td></tr><tr><td>It is troubling that we do not have enough data to perfectly predict the changes that will occur not only by our current human behavior but also any behavior we might exhibit to counteract global warming and climate change.</td></tr><tr><td>I fear that it will take collective action from every major nation, making it difficult to solve</td></tr><tr><td>Viruses and diseases stored in ice for which we have minimal resistance to.</td></tr><tr><td>I think this a plan to increase government control over society.</td></tr><tr><td>There is too much politics involved in what is supposed to be a scientific endeavor. Too difficult to determine if data are unbiased.</td></tr><tr><td>I feel there isn't one.</td></tr><tr><td>It is how exactly global warming effects temperatures</td></tr><tr><td>What I find most troubling is how the whole thing has devolved into a political weapon and we're left arguing is very existence instead of how to mitigate the worst effects of it.</td></tr><tr><td>All the hustlers trying to make a buck off of whatever public opinion they feel they can leverage for the most money.</td></tr><tr><td>Other planets also warming up</td></tr><tr><td>it is far too politically motivated. All the media focuses on the political side, and not the science side. And even the science side is confused and cant come to an agreement on the reality of the situation.</td></tr><tr><td>There are too many opinions about it, and it is difficult to know which one to trust/believe.</td></tr><tr><td>How much it is caused by each factor.</td></tr><tr><td>Global Warming Denial</td></tr><tr><td>Making vehicle inspections over reaching and hard to pass for people with emissions lights on. It's a big fat money grab, a way to push already poor people further in to misery in the name of "climate change"Like George Carlin said, we are arrogant to think we affect the billions year old planet. The earth will shake us off like a bad case of fleas when it is ready to.</td></tr><tr><td>The most troubling aspect is the lack of belief its most proud commenters have. Of course, there are those like the No Impact Man, who I am convinced by, but people like Al Gore, or even the average Greenpeace hippie celebrity shouting about climate change on social media- these who still use iphones, home internet, gasoline powered cars, aircraft, and boats are hypocrites and liars. We will never make environmental gains while still expecting our lives to remain the same.</td></tr><tr><td>That each side is to busy pushing an agenda for money that it is hard for average people to see the big picture. The whole solar system has been heating up, Mars is also having a " heat wave" the same period of time we have.</td></tr><tr><td>All of the research looks biased. There is obvious evidence for arguments going both ways, but the facts of the matter are that no one presents both sides of the facts and shows everything rolled up into one. I believe we do not know enough about the past weather changes and weather cycles to determine if humans are having any type of true negative effect on the Earth and its atmosphere with our chemicals and their byproducts.</td></tr><tr><td>The consistency with which the temperatures seem to rise.</td></tr><tr><td>No one can agree on anything about it.</td></tr><tr><td>Most troubling is how some people can deny science based on some idiotic political view.</td></tr><tr><td>the most troubling aspect to me is the fear that has been conjured about the topic. I'm not convinced one way or the other about global warming, and if it is in fact happening I think it could be completely natural, or that humans could've influenced it. There were obviously drastic climate change events in the earths history long before humans.</td></tr><tr><td>Combating misinformation.</td></tr><tr><td>Misinformation from conservative news media and groups.</td></tr><tr><td>that nobody seems to be taking the aerosol approach to reducing global temperatures seriously - I have seen very little mention of this in the news</td></tr><tr><td>The flip-flopping of specific "well respected" scientists over a 30 year course.</td></tr><tr><td>The most troubling aspect is the continued collapse of ice shelves in Antarctica which may lead to rising global sea levels, endangering many people.</td></tr><tr><td>The aerosols</td></tr><tr><td>The fact that people hold themselves in such high regard, they think they can stop the Earth from doing what it has done by itself for billions of years.</td></tr><tr><td>I don't think there is a whole lot of evidence behind it.</td></tr><tr><td>Earth's temperature is going to change no matter what.</td></tr><tr><td>people are the main cause of global warming and part of that is the destruction of plant material to add more buildings and paved surfaces and removing trees and other plant material that absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen for human use.</td></tr><tr><td>The avg Earth temperature fluctuates from year to year.</td></tr><tr><td>varying weather predictions</td></tr><tr><td>The effect of aerosols and geo-engineering</td></tr><tr><td>The fact that so many people, especially in America, still think it's just a left-wing political conspiracy with no evidentiary basis</td></tr><tr><td>The fact that so many people (especially in America) still think global warming is a left-wing conspiracy with no evidentiary support</td></tr><tr><td>The rise in ocean levels due to ice/glacier melting as a result of global warming, and why water displacement can't be controlled through man-induced evaporation.</td></tr><tr><td>The denial of man's role through use of selective data or misconstrued arguments</td></tr><tr><td>global warming misinformation spread by corporations to make people think global warming is not real.</td></tr><tr><td>I find hard to believe that political and economical interests are entangling this studies.</td></tr><tr><td>The most worrying thing is that we try to counteract it but it continues, I think we should do much more for our earth.</td></tr><tr><td>The amount of information that is contradictory, it is necessary to reach a consensus to work together in order to obtain the answer we need to create to transform our reality into a better one.</td></tr><tr><td>I think the way it's explained to the common public, using many technical terms or trying to explain it in ways people simply doesn't take it as a serious matter. When you see dead bodies due to a traffic accident, you take it seriously, you can see and almost feel the consequences of irresponsible driving, but regarding "global warming", people see the consequences, but they simply can't associate them to this problem.</td></tr><tr><td>There are too many interests at stake, international policy decisions are needed to address, not global warming, but the new ice age ahead.</td></tr><tr><td>The uncontrolled human contamination that to continue like this will destroy our planet</td></tr><tr><td>Despite of all the things are happening in the world, there are still humans who don't care about the environment or how to reduce global warming. In a few years earth won't be the same</td></tr><tr><td>Melting icebergs</td></tr><tr><td>Studies coming up with drastically different results and the lack of governance in the world</td></tr><tr><td>The fact some people deny it.</td></tr><tr><td>Well president Donald Trump doesn't even believe in it.But I didn't vote for him.</td></tr><tr><td>The fact that people do not care or think that its an issue.

The scientific evidence for global warming is overwhelming, but the political debate continues. Part of the reason for the continuing debate is that climate science is a complex subject. Climate itself is the result of the interaction among dozens of factors. Because of that, you can't just observe changes in one element and connect them to a specific climatic effect -- which makes explaining global warming a challenge.</td></tr><tr><td>Global warming, the phenomenon of increasing average air temperatures near the surface of Earth over the past one to two centuries. Climate scientists have since the mid-20th century gathered detailed observations of various weather phenomena (such as temperatures, precipitation, and storms) and of related influences on climate (such as ocean currents and the atmosphere's chemical composition). These data indicate that Earth's climate has changed over almost every conceivable timescale since the beginning of geologic time and that the influence of human activities since at least the beginning of the Industrial Revolution has been deeply woven into the very fabric of climate change.</td></tr><tr><td>Earth's surface is becoming less reflective</td></tr><tr><td>change in temperature and drought</td></tr><tr><td>Pollution is the main thing</td></tr><tr><td>Global warming are caused by we human beings only.</td></tr><tr><td>global warming leads to secure</td></tr><tr><td>which are the main causes for global warming and how to avoid it.

The change in monsoon patterns in my state make me feel it could be true. But I do not see any Government feel that sustainable development may be a better approach than industrial development. It is a very helpless feeling! Can't those human beings who live a very luxurious life think that they are destroying the earth for their own descendants?</td></tr><tr><td>The pushback from those in denial.</td></tr><tr><td>I don't have enough knowledge about this matter.</td></tr><tr><td>The whole aspect is very confusing. I cannot answer this. You wish scientists would explain it in lay mans turns</td></tr><tr><td>Humans from the beginning of time breath out carbon dioxide so how and why is it now causing a problem?</td></tr><tr><td>The most confusing part is why is it so expensive to purchase items that can help save the environment</td></tr><tr><td>Is it true or not?</td></tr><tr><td>That there seems to be no alternative to slow down the process</td></tr><tr><td>Possible solutions as well as possible sources.</td></tr><tr><td>How to control it</td></tr><tr><td>The fact that the government wont do anything about it.</td></tr><tr><td>Differing opinions on what is causing global warming.</td></tr><tr><td>The main cause of global warming and how to deplete it.</td></tr><tr><td>The scientific process is often not explained in detail in school, leading many to be confused about it and also its validity.</td></tr><tr><td>I am not really sure as to how much of the global warming is contributed by the humans and how much if it is caused by nature itself.</td></tr><tr><td>GOOD</td></tr><tr><td>no one cares</td></tr><tr><td>Disruption of thermohaline circulation</td></tr><tr><td>The money behind it.</td></tr><tr><td>chem trails</td></tr><tr><td>Why people are so reluctant to acknowledge the problem or take any steps to help solve it.</td></tr><tr><td>How significant is human act related to global warming compared with natural cycle.</td></tr><tr><td>that we don't hear enough about it</td></tr><tr><td>what is the main cause</td></tr><tr><td>YOU DO NOT KNOW WHICH TYPE OF MEDIA TO BELIEVE</td></tr><tr><td>Spray from the can increase the heat in atmosphere</td></tr><tr><td>increased temperature trends</td></tr><tr><td>Preventative measures should be taken now and no one is doing anything.</td></tr><tr><td>Pollution from factories</td></tr><tr><td>The lack of consensus between scientists and political media. I usually expect testable data to speak for itself, but there seems to be much debate about global warming.</td></tr><tr><td>It is very difficult to determine what is fact and what is only opinion.</td></tr><tr><td>Whether small individual changes like driving hybrid cars can actually make any impact or whether the climate is going to warm anyway</td></tr><tr><td>The most troubling is that some people still do not get it.</td></tr><tr><td>How politicized it is - people who stand to profit off of fossilized fuels are deliberately sowing confusion and doubt in order to influence policy in the US, to the detriment of public and environmental health.</td></tr><tr><td>The use of scientific terms specific to atmospheric science with which I am not familiar and of which I have little understanding can be very confusing. I think this can cause some misunderstandings among people who are not able to grasp what scientists are talking about when they speak about climate change. It is easier for people to dismiss that which they do not understand and climate change is one of the things that most people do not understand.</td></tr><tr><td>The multifaceted cause of global warming. It seems as though news outlets try and simplify the topic but that can cause confusion when intaking other information on the topic.</td></tr><tr><td>Climate change deniers in high powered positions along with little scientist representation in Congress</td></tr><tr><td>idiots who won't listen to scientists</td></tr><tr><td>The fact that there are government officials that think global warming isn't real. They try to prevent research into the subject. They say that 97% of the worlds scientist are apart of a hoax to convince people that global warming is a thing.</td></tr><tr><td>Probably the mis-information the media puts out.</td></tr><tr><td>The most troubling aspect is that we have such limited data - we don't have hundreds of years of daily high and low temps across all parts of the globe on which to base our conclusions. So we are making broad assumptions based on limited information. I also find it troubling that whether we blame it on cows or aerosol sprays, our climate is changing and we want to protect our home. The world must be protected for future generations because this is the only home we have.</td></tr><tr><td>I think that just looking at history, we may have records of the temperatures in the last several years, but how do we know the temperatures from thousands of years ago and how can we positively say that since the year 2000 has been the highest temperatures? I guess I would just need to study the subject more to really thoroughly give my opinion.</td></tr><tr><td>Although I don't agree with the statement, I have heard many argue that because there is still snow we aren't really having a 'global warming crisis.'</td></tr><tr><td>False data being used and the length of recorded data versus the existence of the earth</td></tr><tr><td>weather prediction is still so far off the mark / temperatures keep getting higher</td></tr><tr><td>There seem to be many components that tie into global warming, yet not all of them are discussed. I feel that it is important to show all of the information, not just a sliver of it so that the population has a better idea of what causes global warming and how we can reverse the effects of it.</td></tr><tr><td>Climate Deniers or Consumer Apathy and the Political Implications of Island Nations Losing their Islands</td></tr><tr><td>The idea that humans are ignoring the affect we have on the earth.</td></tr><tr><td>The severity of the problem, and yet the lack of concern from people with political power especially in the federal government.</td></tr><tr><td>When uneducated people are so staunch in their unfounded opinions in the face of real facts generated by thousands of climate scientists who have dedicated their life's work to figuring this problem out.</td></tr><tr><td>The fact that some people still don't believe global warming is a problem is terrifying.</td></tr><tr><td>I think the most troubling aspect of the global warming phenomenon is that it is a very serious issue that most people don't take seriously because it happens very gradually, and they don't understand the impacts of global warming. I'll be honest, I don't really understand the ins and outs of global warming, but, from what I understand, it effects our resources. I can be wrong, but I'm pretty sure desertification is either caused or exacerbated by global warming and this negatively impacts the ability to grow crops. And, whenever there is limited resources, people will be willing to fight or go to war over them if need be.</td></tr><tr><td>I am troubled that so many people do not realize the urgency of making lifestyle and business changes to prevent and reverse global warming.</td></tr><tr><td>I am not familiar with aerosols or I cannot remember previous lectures over the factor.</td></tr><tr><td>The percentage of scientist that people often quote that believe in global warming seems to be an odd sample to pull from.</td></tr><tr><td>How much is human caused and what we can do about it.</td></tr><tr><td>The lack of belief in the presence of evidence.</td></tr><tr><td>Carbon tax</td></tr><tr><td>It seems like scientists do not look at the earth's climate over a very long extended period of time. Also, the concept of the conservation of energy states that nothing small can change the temperature of an entire reservoir such as earth's atmosphere.</td></tr><tr><td>The surface will get more heat</td></tr><tr><td>Global warming is being further fueled by geoengineering methods that have already been in place for several decades. Geoengineering is not a proposal that is being considered. It is a current practice that is causing severe climate damage and the threat of global extinction.</td></tr><tr><td>The weather pattern is off with the month.</td></tr><tr><td>There is just so much rhetoric on the subject by politicians using the topic as a means to an end. They use scientists who are nothing more than political puppets to support their claims. The scientific community needs to be reaching voters who believe what the media especially the quasi-media tells them.</td></tr><tr><td>It is troubling that the climate is becoming more unpredictable and that the topography is being affected.</td></tr><tr><td>Whether it is true or not needs to be stated so even the dumbest person can understand it.</td></tr><tr><td>The actual process and what is occurring</td></tr><tr><td>the fact that some people still refuse to believe in science</td></tr><tr><td>to be honest, all of it.</td></tr><tr><td>what we can do.</td></tr><tr><td>There are too many conflicting reports and inconsistencies. During the last weekend of April, 2007 North Carolina was experiencing record highs while The Plains and Midwest were under Blizzard conditions. In March of 2017, Pennsylvania experienced one of the worst storms they have had in the past 10 years. How is that 'global warming'?</td></tr><tr><td>The fact that it is always being stated that climate change is not true. This is troubling because it is happening.</td></tr><tr><td>There is a lot of conflicting information and it is unknown how much is caused by humans and how much is environmental.</td></tr><tr><td>I am troubled by what the long-term consequences of our inaction will be.</td></tr><tr><td>We have no real answers as to have to stop it</td></tr><tr><td>CONFUSING? NOTHIING IS CONFUSING IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT WE ALL HAVE THE PART OF MAKING IT WORSE</td></tr><tr><td>That is the greenhouse effect. I still do not understand the mechanism because the polar meteor is not melting with the current temperature</td></tr><tr><td>Reducing smog in big cities</td></tr><tr><td>How people can think climate change is a partisan issue is the most confusing part of the whole thing.</td></tr><tr><td>The media portraying it as a hoax is troubling.</td></tr><tr><td>I am unsure</td></tr><tr><td>There's so much information with global warming that I never feel I know enough to form a real opinion.</td></tr><tr><td>Prior to this, I was not aware of aerosols and would like to learn more about it because after taking this survey, it seems quite confusing.</td></tr><tr><td>Global warming is very confusion because there are so many different viewpoint on it. Some scientists say it doesn't exists and some say it is a huge issue.</td></tr><tr><td>Facts</td></tr><tr><td>the fact that there continue to be flat earthers. Why is it that people in power do not believe science even when it is hitting them over the head!</td></tr><tr><td>most confusing is the multiplicity of ways it occurs</td></tr><tr><td>The Global Warming Aspects and Polar Ice Caps Melting.</td></tr><tr><td>People talk about it but to get people to actually change their behavior to help reduce human contribution to global warming is very difficult to accomplish.</td></tr><tr><td>earths atmosphere seems to be hotter than years past</td></tr><tr><td>whether it is caused by humans or if it is a natural process</td></tr><tr><td>why some people don't believe in it</td></tr><tr><td>Many Pros &#x00026; Cons &#x02026; from different sources on the issue</td></tr><tr><td>That the Earth has gone through periods of cooling and warming for millions of years.</td></tr><tr><td>Rising sea levels will cause mass disruption in population settlements. This will probably cause major conflicts to erupt as people seek out new places to live.</td></tr><tr><td>Company using coals</td></tr><tr><td>All the different things that can be contributing to it. Its also not talked about enough for people like me to completely understand whats going on</td></tr><tr><td>The sea level is rising due to global warming.</td></tr><tr><td>That we need more information</td></tr><tr><td>I'm deeply troubled by the rate at which humans are consuming resources. Our resources are not infinite.Clear cutting rain forests for more paper&#x02026;.trading lungs for trash&#x02026;.creating a need for more landfills. And on and on it goes</td></tr><tr><td>It is confusing regarding if is really happening. There are too many conflicting viewpoints even though there is proof it is happening.</td></tr><tr><td>That so many people don't seem to realize that the Earth goes through cycles of varying climates. You can't just say that humans are the cause of global warming - contributors, probably, but that's most likely not all that's going on.</td></tr><tr><td>I don't know much about it</td></tr><tr><td>Not having enough evidence</td></tr><tr><td>How to stop it</td></tr><tr><td>All of the technical terms used to explain the issues.</td></tr><tr><td>Figuring out how to stop it effectively</td></tr><tr><td>How many people don't believe it's humans at fault for this problem, only living beings need to worry about the state of the environment, the planet earth will keep spinning whether it has life or not. We need to care or life on earth will not be sustainable.</td></tr><tr><td>Trying to ascertain which answer would be the best choice to combat this issue.</td></tr><tr><td>How we can change what we are doing to reverse it</td></tr><tr><td>There is so much conflicting information that it is difficult to wade through fact and fiction</td></tr><tr><td>How much human contribution affects global warming.</td></tr><tr><td>none</td></tr><tr><td>people that make you feel stupid for believing it</td></tr><tr><td>The most troubling aspect is that people are confusing science with politics. Science is science. Facts are facts. It is a FACT that climate change is real. It is a FACT that humans have contributed to the warming of the Earth. It's disturbing that people know the truth but lie for their own personal gain.</td></tr><tr><td>I am most confused by accredited scientists on the subject releasing opinions that drastically oppose each other in terms of the causes of global warming or if it is even occurring.</td></tr><tr><td>Everything was very clear!!!</td></tr><tr><td>Humans not properly taking care of their trash.</td></tr><tr><td>It seems like no 2 people have the same idea of how to solve the problem. Many feel that there is a problem but the blame game goes on and on.</td></tr><tr><td>The relatively few number of years that humans have been tracking the Earth's temperature, weather, and climate leaves room for doubt. The Earth is very old and based on our limited data, I am unconvinced that we fully understand changes in the Earth's climate and can attribute the causes with accuracy.</td></tr><tr><td>Hard to find non-biased sources for the general public. public opinion heavily swayed by opinionated news media and social media.</td></tr><tr><td>Certain arenas have made the term politicized and therefore certain populations won't believe the ample science.</td></tr><tr><td>God controls it all and many do not believe/understand</td></tr><tr><td>total carbon output and reduction in carbon filtering mechanisms</td></tr><tr><td>Multiple contributors to global warming and how each contributor actuates global warming.</td></tr><tr><td>That a large number of people either don't "believe" in it or refuse to accept it because it would require altering certain aspects of their lifestyles/sources of income.</td></tr><tr><td>Conflicting information and heated debates that do not address the same issues.</td></tr><tr><td>It's most troubling to me how so many people still continue to deny its existence.</td></tr><tr><td>A troubling aspect is how scientists can't come together more on the subject.</td></tr><tr><td>some of this is confusing</td></tr><tr><td>That some idiots don't believe it existed</td></tr><tr><td>Don't know if it's really happening. Yes, it's hot; but it's been that way before.</td></tr><tr><td>I honestly don't know that much about specifics, but I know that scientists at several agencies are concerned and have documented changes in temperature, weather patterns, and melting of ice. I wish I had time to learn more of the details, but I trust those scientific concerns. I'm not sure why people make such a big deal about whether humans are the direct cause or not - we are playing a role (if not the sole driver) in change, so why not do things to slow down the progression?</td></tr><tr><td>not sure</td></tr><tr><td>the humidity and high temperatures we have been having</td></tr><tr><td>Honestly, everything about global warming is confusing to me and a little hard to comprehend.</td></tr><tr><td>The earth is getting warmer and there is nothing we can do about it because people won't listen</td></tr><tr><td>WHAT ARE THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF GLOBAL WARMING IF NOTHING IS DONE ABOUT IT?</td></tr><tr><td>That much of the global warming is caused by humans.</td></tr><tr><td>Usually warm weather</td></tr><tr><td>Extreme Weather</td></tr><tr><td>how we can combat it</td></tr><tr><td>Lack of education!</td></tr><tr><td>We only have data for such a short period of time, the earth has been alive for so long it's hard to say our data is meaningful.</td></tr><tr><td>What is actually the true cause, and will we ever know?</td></tr><tr><td>That people do not believe it.</td></tr><tr><td>Not sure if this is a true phenomenon or not</td></tr><tr><td>Too much differing data out there and dishonest and uninformed people claiming to be experts.</td></tr><tr><td>why is this happening now</td></tr><tr><td>The changes in the ocean levels</td></tr><tr><td>That they don't push the issue enough about whats going on and how it should be fix. They let it go until something major happens.</td></tr><tr><td>It seems to be the inevitable.

This earth has gone through global ice and heat for millions and millions of years, and humans had nothing to do with it.A part of me believes that this earth will do whatever it wants. We have only been keeping records for what the last 150 years? out of the billions that this universe has been around</td></tr><tr><td>Social media and other venues spreading false information which sadly most people believe. The study and reading of educational journals and papers are not common practice. We are like sheep, a group mentality. Information is being force fed to us and we believe it. There is also not enough people that care.</td></tr><tr><td>well not sure about confusing but troubling is the melting of polar ice caps</td></tr><tr><td>That a non-zero percentage of people think it isn't real or caused by humans, or not a threat.</td></tr><tr><td>no one can seem to agree on it.</td></tr><tr><td>I remember in the mid 1970s these same scientists went on TV claiming we were headed for a second ice age. They are full of shit.</td></tr><tr><td>Rising sea levels.</td></tr><tr><td>none</td></tr><tr><td>Everything! There are so many factors, so it makes it hard to know what to target.</td></tr><tr><td>need be</td></tr><tr><td>The resultant rise in sea levels from melting of ice floes and glaciers.</td></tr><tr><td>What seems to be most confusing is the variety of proposed causes. There is no question that there is global warming, but scientists and politicians argue over the cause(s.)</td></tr><tr><td>All of it</td></tr><tr><td>There is a lot of information about global warming that is explained in scientific jargon, which can make it difficult for a layperson, so to speak, as myself to fully appreciate the scientific elements involved and the complexity of this topic.</td></tr><tr><td>I AM CONFUSED BY THE MULTITUDE OF SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO HELP SOLVE THE PROBLEM. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD WORK OR WHAT WOULD HURT.</td></tr><tr><td>That many believe it to be a myth, and thus do not wish to do anything about it.</td></tr><tr><td>That humans are at fault</td></tr><tr><td>TOO MANY PEOPLE WITH TOO MANY EXCUSES AND REASONS</td></tr><tr><td>I believe people are twisting the facts to make them agree with their thoughts and agenda.</td></tr><tr><td>It is affecting the earth's atmosphere</td></tr><tr><td>I don't understand a lot of the things in these questions, and I don't think a lot of people would either. Explaining why is the most difficult part, especially since it is probably a combination of many things. When you can't explain or pinpoint exactly why, it's hard to get people to believe it's happening. I think one of the most troubling aspects is the ice melting and pictures of starving polar bears. I think these pictures could make people see the damage being done.</td></tr><tr><td>So many varying opinions. Is it just the natural curve in temperature.</td></tr><tr><td>The confusion between "global warming" and "climate change"</td></tr><tr><td>Differing theories</td></tr><tr><td>We don't know what's causing it</td></tr><tr><td>That people don't believe it's real.</td></tr><tr><td>prevention</td></tr><tr><td>HOW MUCH OCCURS NATURALLY VS HOW MUCH HUMANS CAUSE</td></tr><tr><td>The most confusing part is if to much or too little affects the earth.</td></tr><tr><td>It troubles me that it has become "political". It makes the news untrustworthy.</td></tr><tr><td>Hot the weather keeps getting hotter and we barely had a winter this year.</td></tr><tr><td>that people make it a bigger deal then need be</td></tr><tr><td>I may not understand all the science of global warming, but I realize the importance of addressing it. I fail to understand what possible motive climate change scientists and supporters could have to push a false idea of global warming. Climate change deniers don't make any sense to me. I understand why rich people deny climate change, but how do they convince so many poor people to support them when the poor people have nothing to gain and so much to lose? As far as the science is concerned, I don't really know enough about it to comment on what confuses me. I know what behaviors are harmful to Earth and it makes total sense to me that a decent person would just abide by the simple guidelines scientists have proposed for every day people to help out.</td></tr><tr><td>I dont know much about it so I would say just about all of it. Its not that I don't, I have 3 children so keeping up with stuff outside of school related things is not always possible</td></tr><tr><td>How there is an entire school of thought that truly believes there is no such thing as global warming and it is all a hoax perpetuated by environmental conservationists. And the result is that these powerful and influential "non-believers" are turning average people with little education or information on the subject into non-believers as well. It is baffling and terrifying.</td></tr><tr><td>It is a large effect on the earth.</td></tr><tr><td>Lies and poisons being fed to confuse people. TRUTH laid out with no secrets is much easier to comprehend and fix issues.</td></tr><tr><td>It is very complex, and I have not taken any science classes beyond high school, so it is just generally difficult and complicated to understand.</td></tr><tr><td>it's implications for future generations</td></tr><tr><td>Not a lot of people believe in it</td></tr><tr><td>There seems to not be enough definitive information for/against global warming theory to convince everyone.</td></tr><tr><td>The confusing part is that there are so many sides to be taken about something that should be a true or false situation. There are so many different possible causes and people so often fixate on one issue. A lot of people aren't sure what to believe because there are so many opinions and so little agreement or convincing facts shared.</td></tr><tr><td>The most trouble aspect is how few people understand (or "believe") in it and feel that action needs to be taken.</td></tr><tr><td>The most troubling aspect to global warming to me is that people listen to political spin on it instead of getting facts and educating themselves on it.</td></tr><tr><td>It bothers me that the whole global warming issue is politically motivated. It is hard to believe the global warming rhetoric when it is spouted by leftist celebrities who do not practice what they preach.</td></tr><tr><td>How to fix the damage that has already been caused</td></tr><tr><td>There seems to be some uncertainty if it is caused entirely by humans or is a natural cycle of the Earth's climate, since we have limited historical data.</td></tr><tr><td>melting of glaciers and change in oceanic temperature</td></tr><tr><td>I think global warming is caused by geo-engineering.</td></tr><tr><td>The whole concept of it.</td></tr><tr><td>the terms used are confusing</td></tr><tr><td>Rising sea levels are the most troubling aspect, as this would affect many coastal cities all over the world.</td></tr><tr><td>There isn't US leadership supporting science and global warming.</td></tr><tr><td>No one trusts the news media anymore so very hard to get facts relating to this</td></tr><tr><td>Not sure.</td></tr><tr><td>It is all very confusing to me. I have not followed global warming so I do not know very much about it at all.</td></tr><tr><td>The most confusing and troubling aspect is that most Republicans don't believe in it. How can they not take this issue seriously?</td></tr><tr><td>most troubling is that the earth may become uninhabitable for my species</td></tr><tr><td>How to explain it clearly and efficiently to people who don't understand the concept.</td></tr><tr><td>Although I believe that global warming is mostly caused by humans, I also believe that a portion of global warming is a natural progression.</td></tr><tr><td>How to help fix it as a community/</td></tr><tr><td>I don't feel we have enough long term information to identify any real global warming.</td></tr><tr><td>Living in a coastal.state (Florida), I'm most troubled by the implications of rising ocean levels and beach erosion.</td></tr><tr><td>How to truly get a change to happen to decrease the global warming</td></tr><tr><td>How they can determine what it causing it.</td></tr><tr><td>How nobody believes that global warming is actually happening.</td></tr><tr><td>That everyone seems to have an agenda with global warming so it's hard to know what is true</td></tr><tr><td>The people who deny it is happening</td></tr><tr><td>how some people still claim it doesn't exist.</td></tr><tr><td>Though loss of life, the most troubling thing is the intense division among people to believe in (or deny) and rectify (or not) the situation. We're THE ONLY ONES who can save the planet&#x02026;which basically makes us superheroes. But we're stuck vacillating over whether a threat exists&#x02026;and treating each other horribly because of it. I think even most global warming deniers can agree that we should take care of the Earth. I wish we could just see climate change efforts as taking care of the Earth instead getting bogged down in why we're saving the Earth. It's the freakin' Earth!</td></tr><tr><td>I would have to say, the fear of the possibility of icebergs melting, causing the sea levels to rise.</td></tr><tr><td>The lack of data on potential solutions -- the problem seems to be very well characterized, but the general public has very little idea what to do about it.</td></tr><tr><td>Determining fact or fiction from media and politicians.</td></tr><tr><td>They say global warming, then it's the coldest winter ever&#x02026;then they change it to "climate change". Climate always changes, we can't do anything about it.</td></tr><tr><td>I have never heard of greenhouse gases or aerosol effects. They are slightly confusing to me.</td></tr><tr><td>What I personally can do about it.</td></tr><tr><td>That people don't believe it is happening.</td></tr><tr><td>What or who is responsible</td></tr><tr><td>Mixed Information</td></tr><tr><td>That Western countries, that have stronger control over emissions are penalized for pollution, but 3rd World countries, such as China, India and Russia, major contributors of pollution that don't have strict control over emissions, are not penalized for pollution</td></tr><tr><td>How it's not accepted as valid science by many</td></tr><tr><td>It troubles me that the cattle industry causes an enormous output of greenhouse gases and yet this fact is largely hidden from the American public due to the monetary influence of special interest groups.</td></tr><tr><td>I am confused as to why governments are spending millions of dollars on global warming. I feel like global warming is going to occur with the advancement of technology</td></tr><tr><td>The most troubling aspect is that so many people refuse to acknowledge something that such a high percentage of scientists agree on that is so dangerous for the entire planet, including themselves.</td></tr><tr><td>I am not confused, but I am concerned about global climate change.</td></tr><tr><td>We know what things contribute to it but not what exactly what it will cause to happen in the future to Earth.</td></tr><tr><td>What really causes it</td></tr><tr><td>I haven't read too much into this subject</td></tr><tr><td>That people are solely responsible for climate change and global warming.</td></tr><tr><td>fear tactics</td></tr><tr><td>Humans</td></tr><tr><td>how did climate change- able to stop</td></tr><tr><td>The earth's delicate ecosystem</td></tr><tr><td>How it started.</td></tr><tr><td>That the politicians don't care about Global Warming and are not looking for solutions.</td></tr><tr><td>Our extinction</td></tr><tr><td>Mixed message and historical data on previous ice ages</td></tr><tr><td>ocean levels rising</td></tr><tr><td>The most troubling aspect related to global warming is the simplistic ease which writers on the internet, or on the mainstream media news loudly declare daily that the care of the planet Earth is the only thing that people should care about, sacrifice for, and pay for; these writers/pontificators ASSUME that all of their information is correct and use no in-depth fact checking at all. The old phrase "The sky is falling&#x02026;.prepare to die" springs to mind. Sad.</td></tr><tr><td>how it is causing extreme weather disasters</td></tr><tr><td>smog carbon dioxide cause a lot killing of the vegetation on the earth.</td></tr><tr><td>That it could kill us</td></tr><tr><td>So many different researchers given different answers and predictions</td></tr><tr><td>What to do about it.</td></tr><tr><td>very</td></tr><tr><td>What is causing and how it can be slowed</td></tr><tr><td>The most troubling aspect of global warming for me, is the melting of polar ice-caps. Rising water levels and salinity changes may have negative effects on the environment for humans and wildlife. While the earth naturally goes through changes, it is those that disrupt human survival that is the most scary for us.</td></tr><tr><td>I hear news about the global temperature increasing, but have never seen the hard data for the global data.</td></tr><tr><td>The most troubling is the fact that although we as a people know that global warming exists, we still have not done enough to stop it. The human footprint on the earth is destroying the earth. We as a people have been the most destructive to the planet&#x02026;. and won't do anything about it until its too late.</td></tr><tr><td>How we affect our environment and the best way to fix the issue. There are so many studies and opinions it's hard to decipher.</td></tr><tr><td>what is most confusing and/or troubling is the fact that no one can seem to clearly identify specifically what is cause our earth to become more and more uninhabitable and by no means can any of our scientists seem to agree on anything together.</td></tr><tr><td>I feel that there is not enough research out there on this subject and those that are researching from both sides are not coming together to help each other in this problem that we have created.</td></tr><tr><td>How it began is not clear or when.</td></tr><tr><td>THE MOST CONFUSING PART FOR ME IS THAT EVERYTHING THAT IS BEING ECPLAINED I CANNOT SEE SO IS VERY HARD TO BELIEVE</td></tr><tr><td>I'm not sure if It's actually, "global warming" Too many other factors in place.</td></tr><tr><td>Mars is warming, and you can't blame that on human activity. The NOAA and NASA are altering real world data and historic data to fit their models instead of altering the models to fit the "pause". Climate change was the new name of global warming when we stopped warming, and right now, its main purpose is to justify totalitarian control of resources and population because it covers everyone instead of "for the children" when a fifth don't have children. It is modern Lysenkoism, liberals using politicized science to justify political policy.</td></tr><tr><td>what can be done to decrease the global temp</td></tr><tr><td>it seems very politically driven and is hard to decipher the truth</td></tr><tr><td>The uncertainty of what kind of planet we are leaving to our children</td></tr><tr><td>Why it is happening</td></tr><tr><td>How to correct it or make it better</td></tr><tr><td>Propaganda</td></tr><tr><td>none</td></tr><tr><td>Who and what do we believe. The answers and cause and effect seem to change every so often. It is very confusing if we are not given the correct information to stay on top of it.</td></tr><tr><td>All the different opinions, so that you don't know who to believe</td></tr><tr><td>rising sea levels; changing habitat of microbes and the animals that carry them</td></tr><tr><td>It's killing a lot of wild life and other living things.</td></tr><tr><td>The fact that people like Al Gore and other politicians and others got millions of dollars from this big lie.</td></tr><tr><td>whether it is a naturally occurring phenomenon or if humans are causing it</td></tr><tr><td>That people don't believe it's happing and don't want to make things better.</td></tr><tr><td>going to get to hot to live on earth</td></tr><tr><td>All the conflicting stories and "facts" are confusing.</td></tr><tr><td>Ignorance of others. There is nothing confusing about it, it's just other people don't understand basic science so they refute things because they don't/ can't understand them.</td></tr><tr><td>Anthropogenic causes mixing with the Earth's natural cooling and warming cycle, are humans fully to blame? Or just mostly?</td></tr><tr><td>all chemicals in air</td></tr><tr><td>people who don't believe it's an issue</td></tr><tr><td>livestock is killing our resources</td></tr><tr><td>How little things make such a big impact</td></tr><tr><td>There is no real consensus within the Scientific community. The theories seem to change every so often to reflect the political climate of the time. It also changes as theories from 10&#x02013;20 years ago are proven false.</td></tr><tr><td>Some people provide "facts" that it isn't real and others provide "facts" that it is real. So what is the hard, science-based truth?</td></tr><tr><td>I read many different articles from credible sources that we have entered the point of no return in regards to climate change.</td></tr><tr><td>What's troubling is human's need to burn so much oil and generate so much pollution.</td></tr><tr><td>The most troubling aspect is that there are still people out there that do not believe that global warming is happening. I think the scientific community needs to put out more reader friendly information about their findings for the general community.</td></tr><tr><td>How to control it</td></tr><tr><td>The name "global warming is misleading. I find the term climate change is more accurate</td></tr><tr><td>Why are the winters so cold if global warming is an issue? Would the earth still be warming without global warming? Is it realistic to reduce human impact on earth? How long will it be before real problems happen? Years from now or millions of years from now? How does stopping global warming affect the economy? Is trying to stop global warming a real thing?</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Experimental design, materials and methods</title><p>The 20-question survey was composed by the author of this report and submitted to the Texas Tech Institutional Review Board for approval to be implemented. Such approval was granted on March 21, 2017 for IRB2017-282 &#x0201c;Online Survey to Collect Opinions about Factors Influencing Global Warming.&#x0201d; The online survey instrument was created within Google forms and is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://goo.gl/forms/rfuRKw5jT37raWmf1" id="ir0005">https://goo.gl/forms/rfuRKw5jT37raWmf1</ext-link>. Participants were recruited by three methods. First social media (Facebook) posts and ads were used to encourage survey completions with no monetary reward to participants. Secondly, a Texas Tech University daily announcement email (TechAnnounce) was used to recruit members of the University community. Lastly, Amazon Mechanical Turk was used to recruit participants. Individuals who completed the survey through Mechanical Turk were rewarded with $0.05&#x02013;0.10 per survey completion. Recruiting participants through Mechanical Turk was by far the most effective means, and roughly 600 of the surveys 746 respondents replied via Mechanical Turk. At the completion of the polling period, data was downloaded from the Google forms site for reporting.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s0020" sec-type="supplementary-material"><label>Transparency document</label><title>Supplementary material</title><p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ec0005"><caption><p>Supplementary material</p></caption><media xlink:href="mmc1.docx"/></supplementary-material>.</p></sec><fn-group><fn id="s0015" fn-type="supplementary-material"><label>Transparency document</label><p>Transparency data associated with this article can be found in the online version at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2017.07.060" id="ir0010">doi:10.1016/j.dib.2017.07.060</ext-link>.</p></fn></fn-group></back></article>
