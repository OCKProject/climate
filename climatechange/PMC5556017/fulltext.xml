To address this, we investigated the response of a temperate habitat influenced by global climate change in a key glacial refuge, Lake Ohrid (Albania, Macedonia). We applied independent geochemical and palynological proxies to a sedimentary archive from the lake over the penultimate glacial-interglacial transition (MIS 6&#x02013;5) and the following interglacial (MIS 5e-c), targeting lake surface temperature as an indicator of regional climatic development and the supply of pollen and biomarkers from the vegetation and soil OM pools to determine local habitat response. Climate fluctuations strongly influenced the ecosystem, however, lake level controls the extent of terrace surfaces between the shoreline and mountain slopes and hence local vegetation, soil development and OM export to the lake sediments. There were two phases of transgressional soil erosion from terrace surfaces during lake-level rise in the MIS 6&#x02013;5 transition that led to habitat loss for the locally dominant pine vegetation as the terraces drowned. Our observations confirm that catchment morphology plays a key role in providing refuges with low groundwater depth and stable soils during variable climate.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Lake sediment records are important environmental archives that record the response of terrestrial habitats to global climate change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.

The lake is surrounded by mountain ranges (1500&#x02013;2200&#x02009;m.a.s.l.) and, with no large river entering the basin, its direct catchment is small (1310 km<sup>2</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Hence, processes occurring in the immediate surroundings of the basin control the inputs of terrestrial OM to the lake sediments as well as nutrient supply for aquatic biomass production.</p><p id="Par5">Lake level fluctuated substantially over the course of MIS 6 and 5, with evidence for phases of regression and transgression exposing or flooding subaquatic terraces at 12, 30 and 60&#x02009;m below present-day water depth (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.

While Co1202 remained at substantial water depth (currently 145&#x02009;m) over the course of MIS 6 and 5, parts of the shoreline would have moved closer to the study site, exposing relatively flat surfaces between the lake and the mountain slopes.

This can be regarded as the regional expression and culmination of the pronounced cooling trend and associated aridification starting at about 115 ka. Overall, the climatic development in the Ohrid Basin appears in agreement with the general pattern of climatic development recorded in the Northeast Atlantic domain and in central Europe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> (see also Supplementary Material).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Pollen supply</title><p id="Par9">Trends in the pollen profile of Co1202 are generally consistent with pollen records from the south<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> and centre<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> of Lake Ohrid, showing an increase in arboreal pollen (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> in Supplementary Materials; total aboreal pollen excludes <italic>Pinus</italic>, <italic>Betula and Juniperus</italic> species) during the warm moist Eemian, relative to the cool, dry MIS-6 as seen in numerous other palynological records documenting the adjustment of the continental biomes over Central and Southern Europe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. However, between 140 and 135 ka, (MIS 6), the relative amount of pine pollen is higher (80&#x02013;90%) at Co1202 than reported from the basin centre (40&#x02013;80%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> or the southern margin (pine&#x02009;+&#x02009;juniper: 20&#x02013;70%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. At the latter, pollen from steppic species and grasses was substantially more abundant (20&#x02013;40% vs. &#x0003c;10% at Co1202). Thus, the local vegetation cover across the basin seems to have differed; in the southern basin, close to low-lying hills to the southeast (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>) and south, there may have been areas suitable for steppic vegetation, while the catchment of Co1202 in the northeast featured steep mountain slopes as well as low-lying plains (terrace surfaces/flood plains, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B,C</xref>) that apparently supported a larger stock of pine.</p><p id="Par10">At Co1202, the amount of deciduous and evergreen oak pollen started to rise from about 135 ka (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), with the evergreen species averaging at 5% of the total oak pollen. The onset of this vegetation change was marked by a short-term increase in fir pollen of almost 20%, which caused an equivalent drop in the relative amount of pine pollen, while grass and steppic pollen were absent (sample &#x0201c;x&#x0201d; in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This &#x0201c;event&#x0201d; is characterised by the supply of highly degraded OM (very low FA/OH<sub>25&#x02013;30</sub>; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; see following chapter) and a distinct peak in the pollen accumulation rate (PAR) and likely results from the re-activation of parts of the drainage system due to higher rainfall, including influx of soil-stored fir pollen. This first significant change in pollen composition led the temperature change as indicated by the LST proxy records (CaCO<sub>3</sub>, TEX<sub>86</sub>) by almost 2,000 years, but is consistent with recent sedimentological evidence for changes in hydrology and associated lake-level rise occurring throughout the later stages of MIS 6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par11">At 133 and 131 ka, two distinct peaks in steppic pollen supply (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) appear out of phase with the general climatic and basin-wide vegetation development, as they occur during the transition towards warmer and more humid climatic conditions. The first peak appears driven mainly by the reduction in pine pollen supply, as is the concomitant shift towards higher amounts of oak pollen, and coincides with the onset of temperature increase and supply of soil OM (phase 1 in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The second peak occurs mid-way through the MIS 6&#x02013;5 transition, where there is clear evidence for substantial soil erosion as indicated by biomarker proxies and the input of siliciclastic material diluting the carbonate (see following chapter). The steppic pollen is therefore likely to be part of the soil fraction re-suspended from an upper terrace surface during lacustrine transgression, while oak and pine pollen derived from the contemporary vegetation cover. The high-amplitude shift in the biomarker and CaCO<sub>3</sub> records at 129&#x02009;ka that indicates a sharp reduction in the supply of degraded soil-derived material coincided with a further drop in pine pollen supply, implying that another source area for the latter had disappeared. It seems, therefore, that <italic>Pinus</italic> spp. habitats were successively removed from low-lying terrace surfaces close to Co1202 through the rise in lake level during the late MIS 6 and into MIS 5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. This led to relatively increased contributions first from steppic vegetation and oaks as the lowermost terrace drowned, with steppic vegetation remaining on the upper terraces and slopes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; phase 1), and then from expanding arboreal vegetation, including pine, and steppic pollen stored in eroding soils as a higher terrace drowned (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; phase 2). Similar sharp changes in pollen composition are associated with phases of lower-amplitude climatic change in the younger record, for example, at the termination of the C23 cold event. This may also be explained by lake-level controlled modifications of the terrestrial habitat that altered the proportion of terrace and floodplain surface area relative to the mountain slopes and, hence, the distribution and relative proportions of associated vegetation. Lake-level change does not appear a factor in the modification of the terrestrial habitat in the Co1202 catchment during the mid and late Eemian, i.e. from 123 to 117&#x02009;ka, where a gradual decline in oak and increase in pine pollen is apparent, or after ~103&#x02009;ka (MIS 5c) during the gradual expansion of fir. In both cases, the gradual trends in the pollen records reflect the response of the vegetation towards gradual cooling as indicated by the LST proxies.</p><p id="Par12">The onset of accelerated cooling at the end of the Eemian (116&#x02009;ka) is marked by abrupt changes in pine and fir pollen supply (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) initially favouring pine, followed by a 30% increase in fir pollen supply which maximised at this time. Whether or not temporarily enhanced PAR at 118&#x02013;117&#x02009;ka, which coincides with a drop in fir pollen and enhanced pine pollen supply, are related to an earlier deterioration of the montane habitat is unclear. The onset of a similar change to the one observed at 116&#x02009;ka, with accelerating cooling and a pulse in pine peak pollen, appears at the end of the record at 99&#x02009;ka.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Organic matter pools and interpretation of the sediment record</title><p id="Par13">The locally calibrated proxies ACL FA<sub>22&#x02013;26</sub> and FA/OH<sub>25&#x02013;30</sub> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) reflect changes in the quality of terrestrial OM supplied to site Co1202, with lower values indicating enhanced contributions from soil relative to plant litter and more degraded relative to less degraded OM, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. They show a seesaw-type pattern and bear little resemblance to the LST records, but rather imply abrupt changes in lipid supply from strongly to less degraded soil OM and plant litter followed by gradual increases in the contribution of degraded OM (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This pattern suggests a threshold-controlled depositional system that nevertheless responds to continuous climate development, since the abrupt changes in OM supply are, in nearly all cases, associated with either major (MIS 6&#x02013;5 transition) or minor (C23&#x02013;25) climate events. Considering the terraced morphology within the catchment of Co1202, lake-level rise would have provided a mechanism for such a pattern of change in OM sources, equivalent to some of the abrupt changes in pollen supply. For example, one of the most pronounced changes in OM quality at phase 2 in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, as observed in the ACL FA<sub>22&#x02013;26</sub> and FA/OH<sub>25&#x02013;30</sub> profiles, is associated with the beginning and end of the episode of decreased CaCO<sub>3</sub> deposition, reflecting dilution with siliciclastic material derived from soil erosion (the concentration of biogenic silica over the whole record never exceeds 8%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>). The end of phase 2 (~129&#x02009;ka) is characterised by a switch towards the supply of more litter-type OM, with low amounts of root-derived material (higher ACL FA<sub>22&#x02013;26</sub>) and less degraded fatty acids (high FA/OH<sub>25&#x02013;30</sub>).</p><p id="Par14">Given these observations of changing OM quality as indicators of soil erosion, it is possible to synthesise the palynological and geochemical proxy records across the MIS 6&#x02013;5 transition and to interpret the sediment record. From 140&#x02013;135.2 ky B.P., pine dominated the catchment of Co1202, perhaps with grassy undergrowth or open grasslands, while steppic vegetation remained in the background (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, inset A). At 135.2 ka, oak habitats began to expand, accompanied by an initial activation of the drainage system as indicated by the pulse of highly degraded soil OM (minimum in FA/OH<sub>25&#x02013;30</sub>) and a stand-alone peak in fir pollen (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This is consistent with the continual hydrological change during this period<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> and precedes the rapid rise in temperature starting at 133 ka, at the earliest (increase in CaCO<sub>3</sub>). At 133 ka, the pine-dominated habitat on the lowest exposed terrace was drowned (drop in pine pollen), accompanied by transgressive erosion of soils (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>: phase &#x0201c;1&#x0201d;, minimum in ACL FA<sub>22&#x02013;26</sub>) and resulting in a relative increase in oak, grass and steppic pollen supply. The supply of soil OM and steppic pollen then reduced for about 1,000 years around 129 ka due to a slow-down in transgressive soil erosion (increased CaCO<sub>3</sub>, ACL<sub>22&#x02013;26</sub> FA, FA/OH<sub>25&#x02013;30</sub>) while lake-level rose across the slope of the next higher terrace and pine successively replaced steppic vegetation (increase in pine pollen, substantial decrease in steppic pollen, small relative decrease in oak pollen). Between 131 and 129 ka, transgressive erosion of more degraded soils from the upper terrace is evident (phase &#x0201c;2&#x0201d;, minima in biomarker proxies and CaCO<sub>3</sub>; see inset B in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) that apparently also supplied significant amounts of soil-stored pollen from the former steppic vegetation. By 127.8&#x02009;ka, the lake level had maximised with all terraces drowned, so plant litter from the slopes became the main source of OM (inset C in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). At this stage, a substantial soil pool on the slopes had not yet developed.</p><p id="Par15">Over the following 10,000 years, the supply of degraded soil OM (FA/OH<sub>25&#x02013;30</sub>) and subsurface biomass (ACL FA<sub>22&#x02013;26</sub>) steadily increased as soils accumulated under forest vegetation. This is illustrated by the decreasing trends in FA/OH<sub>25&#x02013;30</sub> and ACL FA<sub>22&#x02013;26</sub> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). There was a gradual decline in oak and increase in pine pollen supply between 128 and 116 ka suggesting vegetation change in response to steady Eemian cooling, as observed in several southern and central European Eemain pollen records<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, which was potentially disrupted by the Intra-Eemian 122 ka cold climate anomaly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. With more severe climate deterioration setting in at 116&#x02009;ka BP, a significant vegetation change is first indicated by a pulse in pine pollen supply followed by a shift towards substantially higher fir and an equivalent drop in pine pollen supply. From 114.9&#x02009;ka, soil erosion appeared to increase and substantial amounts of soil OM reached site Co1202 by 113 ka (minimum in ACL FA<sub>22&#x02013;26</sub>). This is consistent with a significant drop in lake level (inset D in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) bringing the shoreline closer to the site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> as indicated by the supply of sandy material and eroded former lake sediments from the terrace surfaces that apparently also contributed GDGTs carrying an elevated LST signal from the preceding lake-level highstand (increased TEX<sub>86</sub>). This episode probably relates to the C25 cold event and marks the end of MIS 5e, or the &#x0201c;Eemian&#x0201d;, in our record.</p><p id="Par16">Following this highly dynamic change, the ecosystem briefly stabilised, with reduced soil erosion (switch to higher ACL FA<sub>22&#x02013;26</sub> and FA/OH<sub>25&#x02013;30</sub>) and vegetation establishing on the lowest terrace exposed at the time. There were only minor fluctuations in pollen supply between 115 ka and the onset of the C24 cold event after 111 ka even though soil OM supply had changed dramatically during C25, suggesting that soil OM and pollen derived from the same habitats and that the relative proportions of these did not change significantly. The proportions did change over the course of the C24 event and coincided with the supply of slightly more degraded OM, suggesting that a pine-dominated habitat is destabilised. Between C24 and C23, the carbonate record suggests warming towards MIS 5c, while the pollen records and FA/OH<sub>25&#x02013;30</sub> show a similar pattern as in phase 2 in the MIS 6&#x02013;5 transition, with a small peak in steppic pollen supply coinciding with a drop in pine pollen supply and an increase in OM degradation. Assuming that lake level was rising, following the lowstand at 113&#x02009;ka, these fluctuations probably resulted from lake-level controlled habitat modifications. At the end of C23, another rapid change in OM quality and LST is recorded, in a similar way to the development of the MIS 6&#x02013;5 transition, albeit with lower amplitude and without disruption, which suggests that from 113 to 105&#x02009;ka lake-level rise may have drowned only one terrace level.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par17">Records of carbonate precipitation and biomarker-based lake surface water temperature (TEX<sub>86</sub>) reflect the climatic development during the last glacial-interglacial transition and marine isotope stages (MIS) 5c-e (140&#x02013;99&#x02009;ka B.P.) at Lake Ohrid and reveal a strong relation to NE Atlantic climate (see Supplementary Material for NE Atlantic isotope record). By contrast, due to the location of sediment core Co1202 and its vicinity to a sequence of extended terrace systems, the records of biomarker composition and pollen supply are to a significant extent shaped by local terrestrial habitat dynamics in the catchment, specifically, the exposure and drowning of terrace surfaces. The distributions of different types of soil cover appear crucial in the supply of OM as reflected in the biomarker records. It appears that the terrace surfaces of the Ohrid Basin allowed forest vegetation to persist through periods of falling lake level in areas with low groundwater depth and stable soil cover, in contrast to the basin as a whole where steppic vegetation expanded to much larger extent during arid climatic conditions. Our approach demonstrates that combining proxies sensitive to vegetation as well as soil pool changes enables detailed reconstruction of terrestrial habitat dynamics and underlines the importance of soils as OM sources to environmental archives.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>The sedimentary archive of site Co1202</title><p id="Par18">The sediment sequence of site Co1202 is a 15&#x02009;m composite record of piston cores taken in 2007 from 145&#x02009;m water depth in the north-eastern part of Lake Ohrid (41&#x000b0; 5&#x02032;36.91&#x02033;N; 20&#x000b0;46&#x02032;2.93&#x02033;E) about 2.5&#x02009;km from the shoreline.
