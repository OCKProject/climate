We explored the influence of climate on demographic parameters (i.e., changes in the probabilities of survival and recruitment) using 31 datasets from temperate zone amphibian populations (North America and Europe) with more than a decade of observations each. There was evidence for an influence of climate on population demographic rates, but the direction and magnitude of responses to climate drivers was highly variable among taxa and among populations within taxa. These results reveal that climate drivers interact with variation in life-history traits and population-specific attributes resulting in a diversity of responses. This heterogeneity complicates the identification of conservation &#x02018;rules of thumb&#x02019; for these taxa, and supports the notion of local focus as the most effective approach to overcome global-scale conservation challenges.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Amphibian decline | demography | populations | climate</title><p id="Par3">The response of biodiversity to climate change is often examined at macroecological and temporal scales, treating demographic mechanisms implicitly (e.g.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, but see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>). Demographic rates describe changes in abundance and distribution for populations, but reflect abilities of individual animals to respond to changing conditions and local environments. This implies that environmental variation is a powerful determinant of natural selection and ultimately determines individual fitness, and the dynamics and viability of populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Thus, a better understanding of the extent to which climate forces changes to population demographic rates, and how this affects the synchronicity of population responses to large-scale environmental fluctuations is critical to understanding the scope of potential losses, predicting future population viability, and developing strategies to preserve biodiversity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. For example, if a common, and predictable, demographic response (e.g., increasing or decreasing synchrony) to climate change could be identified, global conservation strategies, or &#x0201c;rules of thumb&#x0201d; might also be identified to combat declines.</p><p id="Par4">While large-scale climate conditions can synchronize population dynamics, local environmental conditions often mediate the effects of regional drivers, such that local populations vary asynchronously and are thus more resilient to large-scale climate variation (e.g.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>). Conversely, if demographic rates of populations are synchronized by large-scale environmental forcing, then adverse change in regional conditions may lead to large-scale population declines. Synchronous responses to climate drivers have been identified for populations of different species over large regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, suggesting that the potential exists for a single dominant driver to force synchrony in population dynamics by affecting one or more demographic rates. Furthermore, there is evidence that climatic fluctuations contribute to shifts in demographic processes of populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, and that climate-mediated declines in animal populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> occur. The geographic extent of amphibian decline contributes to the appeal of this phenomenon as a model system to understand the effects of climate on populations and persistence, and widespread declines in amphibian populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> suggest that a single dominant driver may be forcing regional synchrony in amphibian population dynamics by affecting one or more demographic rates.</p><p id="Par5">Demographic rates that characterize the response of animals to change may respond to variation occurring at two scales<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>: landscape, where over-arching processes produce similarity in demographic rates (e.g., alignment across populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, and local, where over-arching processes manifest differently and produce differences in demographic rates (e.g., increased local variation). Directional changes in climate, such as long-term shifts in mean precipitation and timing, can act at a landscape scale and influence populations across a large area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, whereas outcomes of such shifts (e.g., amount of snowpack or hydroperiod length) can act at local scales and affect only individual populations because the shifts are mediated by other factors that vary locally (e.g., soil type). For example, a broad scale effect is illustrated by the link between climate change and the collapse of population cycles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, and a local effect is illustrated by the influence of snow depth as a consequence of the weather on the synchrony in population growth rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">While climate can influence vertebrate populations at large scales<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, most taxa evaluated have either large ranges or are migratory. Amphibians have relatively small ranges and may not track climate changes as well as more mobile taxa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, and thus be more sensitive. Climate change is expected to affect both mean and variance of environmental temperature and water availability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, and this shift is accelerating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. As ectotherms with permeable skin, amphibians are sensitive to environmental temperature and moisture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, and we expect that demographic rates in amphibians are especially sensitive to a changing climate, especially to increases in the frequency or intensity of extreme conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Typically, local conditions, unrelated to weather, buffer against climatic fluctuations. However, the current magnitude and rate of climate change suggest that forcing of regional water availability (i.e., drought) and temperature has the potential to over-ride local variation in these characteristics, leading to an alignment in among-population demographic rates. For example, many temperate amphibian species exist as metapopulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, but demography in populations fluctuates in response to local conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, suggesting that large metapopulations are maintained when regional synchrony (due to broad-scale environmental variation) is low.</p><p id="Par7">Current knowledge about the response of amphibian populations to climate is based largely on analyses of single-population datasets. Furthermore, when large-scale drivers are filtered through local site and population characteristics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, it is difficult to identify common factors driving demographic trends. The identification of common population responses to changes in climate can be improved by articulating and testing hypotheses about responses of demographic rates to environmental covariates using long-term data from multiple species within single taxa. This information will improve understanding of the relative contribution of regional and local drivers which are critical for estimating adaptive capacity and choosing conservation actions.</p><p id="Par8">Based on evidence of the substantial magnitude and increasing rate of climate change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, and the knowledge that weather affects demographic rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, we quantified survival and recruitment in relation to locally derived climate variables to gain a mechanistic understanding of amphibian demographic responses across a range of species and locations. We used long-term (&#x02265;10 or more consecutive years), individual-based, information from 31 populations of amphibians from four countries in Europe and North America representing three climatic &#x0201c;zones&#x0201d;: montane, Mediterranean, and maritime (Canada [n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1], France [n&#x02009;=&#x02009;5], Germany [n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2], and USA [n&#x02009;=&#x02009;23]) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>) with which to estimate the effect of climate forcing on demography. Capture-mark-recapture data are uniquely rich and provide the most detailed information on free-ranging populations. Our depth of data allows consideration of hypotheses that relate demographic parameters to broad-scale climate, as represented by specific local climate variables. We selected covariates representing local environmental conditions that are driven by broad-scale climatic changes in temperature and water availability. We predicted demographic responses in a suite of <italic>a priori</italic> hypotheses (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) iteratively developed by expert amphibian researchers with specific knowledge of local populations and habitats &#x02013; collectively representing &#x0003e;300 years of field expertise. We expected that the demography of species with similar life histories (i.e., terrestrial vs aquatic hibernation), and those inhabiting similar environments (i.e., maritime, Mediterranean, and montane zones) would have similar associations with climate drivers. We also expected that survival, recruitment (i.e., the per capita number of individuals recruited into the breeding populations per year) and population growth rate (i.e., survival&#x02009;+&#x02009;recruitment) might each be influenced in a common manner across populations of amphibian species when they experience similar changes in abiotic conditions. While the magnitude of effect is not expected to be identical among all species and populations, we expected that the direction of the effect would be consistent. Although commonalities among demographic rates or characteristics can exist without synchrony in environmental conditions, synchronous relationships may be an early indicator of population collapse as the buffering that diversity provides is weakened.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Location of study sites.

<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>To assess survival, we hypothesized that: 1) adult survival is reduced by lack of water during active non-breeding season (H1) because of potential for physiological stress (Bartelt <italic>et al</italic>. 2004), lower food availability (Williams 1951) and general habitat degradation (pond drying, Amburgey <italic>et al</italic>. 2012, Hossack <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, Pilliod and Scherer 2015); 2) Unusually high temperatures can influence survival negatively due to desiccation and related lack of water (Rittenhouse <italic>et al</italic>. 2015) (H2); 3) Longer winters decrease time available for an individual to be active and reduce survival (e.g., emerging from long hibernation in weakened state; or reduced opportunities for foraging) (Carey <italic>et al</italic>. 2005,) (H3); 4) In montane habitats, exposure to cold temperatures reduce survival (H4). However, cold experienced by hibernating animals is buffered by snowpack; in low snowpack years, cold temperatures may have greater impact. Thus, snowpack (as represented by a measure of snow water equivalent [SWE]) was accounted for in developing covariate H4 (O&#x02019;Connor and Rittenhouse 2016); 5) Bouts of unseasonably warm temperatures during hibernation (i.e., winter) cause physiological arousal (Sinclair <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>), interrupt hibernation, waste energy, and reduce survival (H5). Snowpack also buffers against warm temperatures so we accounted for the effect of snowpack during the bouts of warm weather in winter. To assess recruitment we hypothesized that: 1) Recruitment is reduced by lack of water due to increased desiccation risk to small bodied juveniles, and reduced food and habitat (H6); 2) Longer and colder winters decrease the amount of time available for an individual to be active and will reduce survival and thus recruitment (H7); 3) Cold temperatures in spring that result in damage or destruction of eggs will reduce recruitment (H&#x000e5;kansson and Loman 2004) (H8); and 4) Freezing events in the autumn before metamorphic animals have successfully left the breeding site will reduce recruitment; in other words, if the onset of winter (i.e., freezing events) is later, recruitment will be influenced positively (H9).</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Hypothesis</th><th>Species</th><th>Prediction</th><th>Season</th><th>Covariate and Formulation*</th><th>Mechanism</th><th>Mathematical model</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="5">Survival</td><td>H1</td><td>All</td><td>Survival decreases in drier conditions</td><td>Active non-breeding season - breeding activity in spring through the onset of hibernation</td><td>DROUGHT: Number of drought days (i.e., no precipitation) during the active, non-breeding season in a given year.

In 18 of 31 datasets, the top candidate models were strongly supported with AIC<sub>c</sub> wts of &#x0003e;0.40; in nine of those 18, AIC<sub>c</sub> wts were &#x0003e;0.90.

Thus, our analysis provides empirical support for the effect of climate variables on demographic processes across multiple amphibian taxa and across multiple localities.

Although we might expect winter covariates to occur in top models 60% of the time by chance alone, a range of previous work highlights the importance of winter covariates. For example a synthesis of organismal responses to winter climate change reports that community composition, ecological interactions, and individual performance are affected by winter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.

Contrary to our hypothesis, we identified a variety of responses both within and among amphibian species, suggesting that response to climate is highly context-dependent and that conservation planning will require a local approach despite the expected magnitude of climate change and potential for climate forcing. For example, there is a need to better determine how context-dependency can mediate the effect of climate on local populations and promote their resilience. Local contexts may include geographic, biotic and abiotic factors that differ in importance (e.g., climate forcing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>; range position<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>; phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>; geography<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>; habitat characteristics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>).

Models including the recurrence of warm events during winter (H5) had the most support, but affected survival as predicted (negatively) in only one population (at the highest elevation). High snowpack provides insulation during winter and lack of insulation can precipitate inappropriate rousing and waste of energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. The criticality of this insulation, and thus the response in survival rate, likely depends on the elevation and physiogeography of local sites.</p><p id="Par21">Results from great crested newts in France supported the importance of winter-related covariates (H5 and H4), but might also represent differences in demography related to the position of populations within the species&#x02019; range.
