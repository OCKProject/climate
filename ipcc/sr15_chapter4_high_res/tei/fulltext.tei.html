    <div class="head">Executive Summary</div>
    <p>Limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels would require transformative systemic change, integrated with sustainable development. Such change would require the upscaling and acceleration of the implementation of farreaching, multilevel and cross-sectoral climate mitigation and addressing barriers. Such systemic change would need to be linked to complementary adaptation actions, including transformational adaptation, especially for pathways that temporarily overshoot 1.5°C (medium evidence, high agreement) {Chapter 2, Chapter 3, 4.2.1, 4.4.5, 4.5}. Current national pledges on mitigation and adaptation are not enough to stay below the Paris Agreement temperature limits and achieve its adaptation goals. While transitions in energy efficiency, carbon intensity of fuels, electrification and land-use change are underway in various countries, limiting warming to 1.5°C will require a greater scale and pace of change to transform energy, land, urban and industrial systems globally. {4.</p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <div class="head">3, 4.4, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in this Chapter}</div>
    <p>Although multiple communities around the world are demonstrating the possibility of implementation consistent with 1.5°C pathways {Boxes 4.1-4.10}, very few countries, regions, cities, communities or businesses can currently make such a claim (high confidence). To strengthen the global response, almost all countries would need to significantly raise their level of ambition. Implementation of this raised ambition would require enhanced institutional capabilities in all countries, including building the capability to utilize indigenous and local knowledge (medium evidence, high agreement). In developing countries and for poor and vulnerable people, implementing the response would require financial, technological and other forms of support to build capacity, for which additional local, national and international resources would need to be mobilized (high confidence). However, public, financial, institutional and innovation capabilities currently fall short of implementing far-reaching measures at scale in all countries (high confidence). </p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <div class="head">System Transitions</div>
    <p>The energy system transition that would be required to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial conditions is underway in many sectors and regions around the world (medium evidence, high agreement). The political, economic, social and technical feasibility of solar energy, wind energy and electricity storage technologies has improved dramatically over the past few years, while that of nuclear energy and carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) in the electricity sector have not shown similar improvements. {4.3.1}</p>
    <p>Electrification, hydrogen, bio-based feedstocks and substitution, and, in several cases, carbon dioxide capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) would lead to the deep emissions reductions required in energy-intensive industries to limit warming to 1.5°C. However, those options are limited by institutional, economic and technical constraints, which increase financial risks to many incumbent firms (medium evidence, high agreement). Energy efficiency in industry is more economically feasible and helps enable industrial system transitions but would have to be complemented with greenhouse gas (GHG)-neutral processes or carbon dioxide removal (CDR) to make energy-intensive industries consistent with 1.5°C (high confidence).</p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <div class="head">{4.3.1, 4.3.4}</div>
    <p>Global and regional land-use and ecosystems transitions and associated changes in behaviour that would be required to limit warming to 1.5°C can enhance future adaptation and land-based agricultural and forestry mitigation potential. Such transitions could, however, carry consequences for livelihoods that depend on agriculture and natural resources {4.3.2, CrossChapter Box 6 in Chapter 3}. Alterations of agriculture and forest systems to achieve mitigation goals could affect current ecosystems and their services and potentially threaten food, water and livelihood security. While this could limit the social and environmental feasibility of land-based mitigation options, careful design and implementation could enhance their acceptability and support sustainable development objectives (medium evidence, medium agreement). {4.3.2, 4.5.3}</p>
    <p>Changing agricultural practices can be an effective climate adaptation strategy. A diversity of adaptation options exists, including mixed crop-livestock production systems which can be a cost-effective adaptation strategy in many global agriculture systems (robust evidence, medium agreement). Improving irrigation efficiency could effectively deal with changing global water endowments, especially if achieved via farmers adopting new behaviours and waterefficient practices rather than through large-scale infrastructural interventions (medium evidence, medium agreement). Well-designed adaptation processes such as community-based adaptation can be effective depending upon context and levels of vulnerability. {4.3.2, 4.5.3}</p>
    <p>Improving the efficiency of food production and closing yield gaps have the potential to reduce emissions from agriculture, reduce pressure on land, and enhance food security and future mitigation potential (high confidence). Improving productivity of existing agricultural systems generally reduces the emissions intensity of food production and offers strong synergies with rural development, poverty reduction and food security objectives, but options to reduce absolute emissions are limited unless paired with demand-side measures. Technological innovation including biotechnology, with adequate safeguards, could contribute to resolving current feasibility constraints and expand the future mitigation potential of agriculture.</p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <div class="head">{4.3.2, 4.4.4}</div>
    <p>Shifts in dietary choices towards foods with lower emissions and requirements for land, along with reduced food loss and waste, could reduce emissions and increase adaptation options (high confidence). Decreasing food loss and waste and changing dietary behaviour could result in mitigation and adaptation (high confidence) by reducing both emissions and pressure on land, with significant co-benefits for food security, human health and sustainable development {4.3.2, 4.4.5, 4.5.2, 4.5.3, 5.4.2}, but evidence of successful policies to modify dietary choices remains limited.</p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <div class="head">Mitigation and Adaptation Options and Other Measures</div>
    <p>A mix of mitigation and adaptation options implemented in a participatory and integrated manner can enable rapid, systemic transitions -in urban and rural areas -that are necessary elements of an accelerated transition consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Such options and changes are most effective when aligned with economic and sustainable development, and when local and regional governments are supported by national governments {4.3.3, 4.4.1, 4.4.3}. Various mitigation options are expanding rapidly across many geographies. Although many have development synergies, not all income groups have so far benefited from them. Electrification, end-use energy efficiency and increased share of renewables, amongst other options, are lowering energy use and decarbonizing energy supply in the built environment, especially in buildings. Other rapid changes needed in urban environments include demotorization and decarbonization of transport, including the expansion of electric vehicles, and greater use of energy-efficient appliances (medium evidence, high agreement). Technological and social innovations can contribute to limiting warming to 1.5°C, for example, by enabling the use of smart grids, energy storage technologies and general-purpose technologies, such as information and communication technology (ICT) that can be deployed to help reduce emissions. Feasible adaptation options include green infrastructure, resilient water and urban ecosystem services, urban and peri-urban agriculture, and adapting buildings and land use through regulation and planning (medium evidence, medium to high agreement). {4.3.3, 4.4.3, 4.4.4}</p>
    <p>Synergies can be achieved across systemic transitions through several overarching adaptation options in rural and urban areas.</p>
    <p>Investments in health, social security and risk sharing and spreading are cost-effective adaptation measures with high potential for scaling up (medium evidence, medium to high agreement). Disaster risk management and education-based adaptation have lower prospects of scalability and cost-effectiveness (medium evidence, high agreement) but are critical for building adaptive capacity. {4.3.5, 4.5.3}</p>
    <p>Converging adaptation and mitigation options can lead to synergies and potentially increase cost-effectiveness, but multiple trade-offs can limit the speed of and potential for scaling up. Many examples of synergies and trade-offs exist in all sectors and system transitions. For instance, sustainable water management (high evidence, medium agreement) and investment in green infrastructure (medium evidence, high agreement) to deliver sustainable water and environmental services and to support urban agriculture are less cost-effective than other adaptation options but can help build climate resilience. Achieving the governance, finance and social support required to enable these synergies and to avoid trade-offs is often challenging, especially when addressing multiple objectives, and attempting appropriate sequencing and timing of interventions. {4.3.2, 4.3.4, 4.4.1, 4.5.2, 4.5.3, 4.5.4}</p>
    <p>Though CO 2 dominates long-term warming, the reduction of warming short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs), such as methane and black carbon, can in the short term contribute significantly to limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Reductions of black carbon and methane would have substantial co-benefits (high confidence), including improved health due to reduced air pollution. This, in turn, enhances the institutional and sociocultural feasibility of such actions. Reductions of several warming SLCFs are constrained by economic and social feasibility (low evidence, high agreement). As they are often co-emitted with CO 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="4,501.68,346.02,2.66,6.53" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">2</ref> , achieving the energy, land and urban transitions necessary to limit warming to 1.5°C would see emissions of warming SLCFs greatly reduced. {2.3.3.2, 4.3.6}
    </p>
    <p>Most CDR options face multiple feasibility constraints, which differ between options, limiting the potential for any single option to sustainably achieve the large-scale deployment required in the 1.5°C-consistent pathways described in Chapter 2 (high confidence). Those 1.5°C pathways typically rely on bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), afforestation and reforestation (AR), or both, to neutralize emissions that are expensive to avoid, or to draw down CO 2 emissions in excess of the carbon budget {Chapter 2}. Though BECCS and AR may be technically and geophysically feasible, they face partially overlapping yet different constraints related to land use. The land footprint per tonne of CO 2 removed is higher for AR than for BECCS, but given the low levels of current deployment, the speed and scales required for limiting warming to 1.5°C pose a considerable implementation challenge, even if the issues of public acceptance and absence of economic incentives were to be resolved (high agreement, medium evidence). The large potential of afforestation and the co-benefits if implemented appropriately (e.g., on biodiversity and soil quality) will diminish over time, as forests saturate (high confidence). The energy requirements and economic costs of direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS) and enhanced weathering remain high (medium evidence, medium agreement). At the local scale, soil carbon sequestration has co-benefits with agriculture and is cost-effective even without climate policy (high confidence). Its potential feasibility and cost-effectiveness at the global scale appears to be more limited. {4.3.7}</p>
    <p>Uncertainties surrounding solar radiation modification (SRM) measures constrain their potential deployment. These uncertainties include: technological immaturity; limited physical 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="5,547.72,755.52,13.26,10.12" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">317</ref>

    <p>Strengthening and Implementing the Global Response Chapter 4 understanding about their effectiveness to limit global warming; and a weak capacity to govern, legitimize, and scale such measures. Some recent model-based analysis suggests SRM would be effective but that it is too early to evaluate its feasibility. Even in the uncertain case that the most adverse side-effects of SRM can be avoided, public resistance, ethical concerns and potential impacts on sustainable development could render SRM economically, socially and institutionally undesirable (low agreement, medium evidence).</p>

    <div class="head">{4.3.8, Cross-Chapter Box 10 in this chapter}</div>
    <p>Enabling Rapid and Far-Reaching Change</p>
    <p>The speed of transitions and of technological change required to limit warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels has been observed in the past within specific sectors and technologies {4.2.2.1}. But the geographical and economic scales at which the required rates of change in the energy, land, urban, infrastructure and industrial systems would need to take place are larger and have no documented historic precedent (limited evidence, medium agreement). To reduce inequality and alleviate poverty, such transformations would require more planning and stronger institutions (including inclusive markets) than observed in the past, as well as stronger coordination and disruptive innovation across actors and scales of governance. {4.3, 4.4}</p>
    <p>Governance consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C and the political economy of adaptation and mitigation can enable and accelerate systems transitions, behavioural change, innovation and technology deployment (medium evidence, medium agreement). For 1.5°C-consistent actions, an effective governance framework would include: accountable multilevel governance that includes nonstate actors, such as industry, civil society and scientific institutions; coordinated sectoral and cross-sectoral policies that enable collaborative multi-stakeholder partnerships; strengthened global-to-local financial architecture that enables greater access to finance and technology; addressing climate-related trade barriers; improved climate education and greater public awareness; arrangements to enable accelerated behaviour change; strengthened climate monitoring and evaluation systems; and reciprocal international agreements that are sensitive to equity and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). System transitions can be enabled by enhancing the capacities of public, private and financial institutions to accelerate climate change policy planning and implementation, along with accelerated technological innovation, deployment and upkeep. {4.4.1, 4.4.2, 4.4.3, 4.4.4}</p>
    <p>Behaviour change and demand-side management can significantly reduce emissions, substantially limiting the reliance on CDR to limit warming to 1.5°C {Chapter 2, 4.4.3}. Political and financial stakeholders may find climate actions more costeffective and socially acceptable if multiple factors affecting behaviour are considered, including aligning these actions with people's core values (medium evidence, high agreement). Behaviour-and lifestylerelated measures and demand-side management have already led to emission reductions around the world and can enable significant future reductions (high confidence). Social innovation through bottomup initiatives can result in greater participation in the governance of systems transitions and increase support for technologies, practices and policies that are part of the global response to limit warming to 1.5°C . {Chapter 2, 4.4.1, 4.4.3, 
     <ref type="figure" coords="5,425.85,87.10,27.04,11.20" target="#fig_6" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Figure 4</ref>.3}
    </p>
    <p>This rapid and far-reaching response required to keep warming below 1.5°C and enhance the capacity to adapt to climate risks would require large increases of investments in low-emission infrastructure and buildings, along with a redirection of financial flows towards low-emission investments (robust evidence, high agreement). An estimated mean annual incremental investment of around 1.5% of global gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) for the energy sector is indicated between 2016 and 2035, as well as about 2.5% of global GFCF for other development infrastructure that could also address SDG implementation. Though quality policy design and effective implementation may enhance efficiency, they cannot fully substitute for these investments. {2.5.2, 4.2.1, 4.4.5}</p>
    <p>Enabling this investment requires the mobilization and better integration of a range of policy instruments that include the reduction of socially inefficient fossil fuel subsidy regimes and innovative price and non-price national and international policy instruments. These would need to be complemented by de-risking financial instruments and the emergence of long-term low-emission assets. These instruments would aim to reduce the demand for carbon-intensive services and shift market preferences away from fossil fuel-based technology. Evidence and theory suggest that carbon pricing alone, in the absence of sufficient transfers to compensate their unintended distributional crosssector, cross-nation effects, cannot reach the incentive levels needed to trigger system transitions (robust evidence, medium agreement). But, embedded in consistent policy packages, they can help mobilize incremental resources and provide flexible mechanisms that help reduce the social and economic costs of the triggering phase of the transition (robust evidence, medium agreement). {4.4.3, 4.4.4, 4.4.5}</p>
    <p>Increasing evidence suggests that a climate-sensitive realignment of savings and expenditure towards low-emission, climate-resilient infrastructure and services requires an evolution of global and national financial systems. Estimates suggest that, in addition to climate-friendly allocation of public investments, a potential redirection of 5% to 10% of the annual capital revenues 1 is necessary for limiting warming to 1.5°C {4.4.5, 
     <ref type="table" coords="5,315.21,555.17,25.39,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Table 1</ref> in Box 4.8}. This could be facilitated by a change of incentives for private day-to-day expenditure and the redirection of savings from speculative and precautionary investments towards longterm productive low-emission assets and services. This implies the mobilization of institutional investors and mainstreaming of climate finance within financial and banking system regulation. Access by developing countries to low-risk and low-interest finance through multilateral and national development banks would have to be facilitated (medium evidence, high agreement). New forms of publicprivate partnerships may be needed with multilateral, sovereign and sub-sovereign guarantees to de-risk climate-friendly investments, support new business models for small-scale enterprises and help households with limited access to capital. Ultimately, the aim is to 1 Annual capital revenues are paid interests plus an increase of asset value.

    <div class="head">Accelerating the Global Response to Climate Change</div>
    <p>This chapter discusses how the global economy and socio-technical and socio-ecological systems can transition to 1.5°C-consistent pathways and adapt to warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.</p>
    <p>In the context of systemic transitions, the chapter assesses adaptation and mitigation options, including carbon dioxide removal (CDR), and potential solar radiation modification (SRM) remediative measures (Section 4.3), as well as the enabling conditions that would be required for implementing the rapid and far-reaching global response of limiting warming to 1.5°C (Section 4.4), and render the options more or less feasible (Section 4.5).</p>
    <p>The impacts of a 1.5°C-warmer world, while less than in a 2°C-warmer world, would require complementary adaptation and development action, typically at local and national scale. From a mitigation perspective, 1.5°C-consistent pathways require immediate action on a greater and global scale so as to achieve net zero emissions by midcentury, or earlier (Chapter 2). This chapter and Chapter 5 highlight the potential that combined mitigation, development and poverty reduction offer for accelerated decarbonization.</p>
    <p>The global context is an increasingly interconnected world, with the human population growing from the current 7.6 billion to over 9 billion by mid-century (

There has been a consistent growth of global economic output, wealth and trade with a significant reduction in extreme poverty. These trends could continue for the next few decades (

    <p>The aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis generated a challenging environment in which leading economists have issued repeated alerts about the 'discontents of globalisation'

    </p>
    <p>The range of mitigation and adaptation actions that can be deployed in the short run are well-known: for example, low-emission technologies, new infrastructure, and energy efficiency measures in buildings, industry and transport; transformation of fiscal structures; reallocation of investments and human resources towards low-emission assets; sustainable land and water management; ecosystem restoration; enhancement of adaptive capacities to climate risks and impacts; disaster risk management; research and development; and mobilization of new, traditional and indigenous knowledge.</p>

The issue is whether aligning 1.5°C-consistent pathways with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will secure support for accelerated change and a new growth cycle 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="7,475.05,123.09,41.41,11.20" target="#b1720" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Stern, 2013</ref>

    </p>
    <p>Unless affordable and environmentally and socially acceptable CDR becomes feasible and available at scale well before 2050, 1.5°C-consistent pathways will be difficult to realize, especially in overshoot scenarios. The social costs and benefits of 1.5°C-consistent pathways depend on the depth and timing of policy responses and their alignment with short term and long-term development objectives, through policy packages that bring together a diversity of policy instruments, including public investment ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="7,465.92,279.07,66.04,11.20" target="#b695" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Grubb et al., 2014;</ref>

    </p>
    <p>Whatever its potential long-term benefits, a transition to a 1.5°C world may suffer from a lack of broad political and public support, if it exacerbates existing short-term economic and social tensions, including unemployment, poverty, inequality, financial tensions, competitiveness issues and the loss of economic value of carbonintensive assets

The challenge is therefore how to strengthen climate policies without inducing economic collapse or hardship, and to make them contribute to reducing some of the 'fault lines' of the world economy

    <p>As the transitions associated with 1.5°C-consistent pathways require accelerated and coordinated action, in multiple systems across all world regions, they are inherently exposed to risks of freeriding and moral hazards.

    <div class="head">Implications for Implementation of 1.5°C-Consistent Pathways</div>
    <p>The 1.5°C-consistent pathways assessed in Chapter 2 form the basis for the feasibility assessment in section 4.5. A wide range of 1.5°C-consistent pathways from integrated assessment modelling (IAM), supplemented by other literature, are assessed in Chapter 2 (Sections 2.1, 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5). The most common feature shared by these pathways is their requirement for faster and more radical changes compared to 2°C and higher warming pathways.</p>
    <p>A variety of 1.5°C-consistent technological options and policy targets is identified in the assessed modelling literature (Sections 2.3, 2.4, 2.5). These technology and policy options include energy demand reduction, greater penetration of low-emission and carbon-free technologies as well as electrification of transport and industry, and reduction of land-use change. Both the detailed integrated modelling pathway literature and a number of broader sectoral and bottom-up studies provide examples of how these sectoral technological and policy characteristics can be broken down sectorally for 1.5°C-consistent pathways (see

    </p>
    <p>Both the integrated pathway literature and the sectoral studies agree on the need for rapid transitions in the production and use of energy across various sectors, to be consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C. The pace of these transitions is particularly significant for the supply mix and electrification

    <p>Greater scale, speed and change in investment patterns. There is agreement in the literature reviewed by Chapter 2 that staying below 1.5°C would entail significantly greater transformation in terms of energy systems, lifestyles and investments patterns compared to 2°C-consistent pathways. Yet there is limited evidence and low agreement regarding the magnitudes and costs of the investments (Sections 2.5.1, 2.5.2 and 4.4.5). Based on the IAM literature reviewed in Chapter 2, climate policies in line with limiting warming to 1.5°C would require a marked upscaling of supply-side energy system investments between now and mid-century, reaching levels of between 1.6-3.8 trillion USD yr −1 globally with an average of about 3.5 trillion USD yr −1 over 2016-2050 (see 
     <ref type="figure" coords="9,167.91,219.17,27.61,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Figure 2</ref>.27). This can be compared to an average of about 3.0 trillion USD yr −1 over the same period for 2°C-consistent pathways (also in 
     <ref type="figure" coords="9,173.77,243.17,27.00,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Figure 2</ref>.27).
    </p>
    <p>Not only the level of investment but also the type and speed of sectoral transformation would be impacted by the transitions associated with 1.5°C-consistent pathways. IAM literature projects that investments in low-emission energy would overtake fossil fuel investments globally by 2025 in 1.5°C-consistent pathways (Chapter 2, Section 2.5.2). The projected low-emission investments in electricity generation allocations over the period 2016-2050 are: solar (0.09-1.0 trillion USD yr −1 ), wind (0.1-0.35 trillion USD yr −1 ), nuclear (0.1-0.25 trillion USD yr −1 ), and transmission, distribution, and storage (0.3-1.3 trillion USD yr −1 ). In contrast, investments in fossil fuel extraction and unabated fossil electricity generation along a 1.5°C-consistent pathway are projected to drop by 0.3-0.85 trillion USD yr −1 over the period 2016-2050, with investments in unabated coal generation projected to halt by 2030 in most 1.5°C-consistent pathways (Chapter 2, Section 2.5.2). Estimates of investments in other infrastructure are currently unavailable, but they could be considerably larger in volume than solely those in the energy sector (Section 4.4.5).</p>
    <p>Greater policy design and decision-making implications. The 1.5°C-consistent pathways raise multiple challenges for effective policy design and responses to address the scale, speed, and pace of mitigation technology, finance and capacity building needs. These policies and responses would also need to deal with their distributional implications while addressing adaptation to residual climate impacts (see Chapter 5). The available literature indicates that 1.5°C-consistent pathways would require robust, stringent and urgent transformative policy interventions targeting the decarbonization of energy supply, electrification, fuel switching, energy efficiency, land-use change, and lifestyles (Chapter 2, Section 2.5, 4.4.2, 4.4.3). Examples of effective approaches to integrate mitigation with adaptation in the context of sustainable development and to deal with distributional implications proposed in the literature include the utilization of dynamic adaptive policy pathways

Yet, even with good policy design and effective implementation, 1.5°C-consistent pathways would incur higher costs. Projections of the magnitudes of global economic costs associated with 1.5°C-consistent pathways and their sectoral and regional distributions from the currently assessed literature are scant, yet suggestive. For example, IAM simulations assessed in Chapter 2 project (with a probability greater than 50%) that marginal abatement costs, typically represented in IAMs through a carbon price, would increase by about 3-4 times by 2050 under a 1.5°C-consistent pathway compared to a 2°C-consistent pathway (Chapter 2, Section 2.5.2,

Managing these costs and distributional effects would require an approach that takes account of unintended cross-sector, cross-nation, and cross-policy trade-offs during the transition (

Nonetheless, literature on potential synergies and trade-offs between 1.5°C-consistent mitigation pathways and sustainable development dimensions is emerging (Chapter 2, Section 2.5.3, Chapter 5, Section 5.4). Areas of potential trade-offs include reduction in final energy demand in relation to SDG 7 (the universal clean energy access goal) and increase of biomass production in relation to land use, water resources, food production, biodiversity and air quality (Chapter 2, Sections 2.4.3, 2.5.3). Strengthening the institutional and policy responses to deal with these challenges is discussed in Section 4.4 together with the linkage between disruptive changes in the energy sector and structural changes in other infrastructure (transport, building, water and telecommunication) sectors. A more in-depth assessment of the complexity and interfaces between 1.5°C-consistent pathways and sustainable development is presented in Chapter 5.

    <div class="head">Implications for Adaptation Along the Reviewed Pathways</div>
    <p>Climate variability and uncertainties in the underlying assumptions in Chapter 2's IAMs as well as in model comparisons complicate discerning the implications for climate impacts, adaptation options and avoided adaptation investments at the global level of 2°C compared to 1.5°C warming ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="9,374.42,495.17,63.30,11.20" target="#b876" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">James et al., 2017;</ref>

    </p>
    <p>Incremental warming from 1.5°C to 2°C would lead to significant increases in temperature and precipitation extremes in many regions (Chapter 3, Section 3.3.2, 3.3.3). Those projected changes in climate extremes under both warming levels, however, depend on the emissions pathways, as they have different greenhouse gas (GHG)/ aerosol forcing ratios. Impacts are sector-, system-and region-specific, as described in Chapter 3. For example, precipitation-related impacts reveal distinct regional differences (Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.3, 3.3.4, 3.3.5, 3.4.2). Similarly, regional reduction in water availability and the lengthening of regional dry spells have negative implications for agricultural yields depending on crop types and world regions (see for example Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.4, 3.4.2, 3.4.6).</p>
    <p>Adaptation helps reduce impacts and risks. However, adaptation has limits. Not all systems can adapt, and not all impacts can be reversed (Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5). For example, tropical coral reefs are projected to be at risk of severe degradation due to temperatureinduced bleaching (Chapter 3, Box 3.4).</p>

   <div>
    <div class="head">System Transitions and Rates of Change</div>
    <p>Society-wide transformation involves socio-technical transitions and social-ecological resilience (

Transitional adaptation pathways would need to respond to low-emission energy and economic systems, and the socio-technical transitions for mitigation involve removing barriers in social and institutional processes that could also benefit adaptation ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="10,215.84,135.17,59.21,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Pant et al., 2015;</ref>

In this chapter, transformative change is framed in mitigation around socio-technical transitions, and in adaptation around socio-ecological transitions. In both instances, emphasis is placed on the enabling role of institutions (including markets, and formal and informal regulation). 1.5°C-consistent pathways and adaptation needs associated with warming of 1.5°C imply both incremental and rapid, disruptive and transformative changes.

    <p>Realizing 1.5°C-consistent pathways would require rapid and systemic changes on unprecedented scales (see Chapter 2 and Section 4.2.1). This section examines whether the needed rates of change have historical precedents and are underway.</p>
    <p>Some studies conduct a de-facto validation of IAM projections. For CO 2 emission intensity over 1990-2010, this resulted in the IAMs projecting declining emission intensities while actual observations showed an increase. For individual technologies (in particular solar energy), IAM projections have been conservative regarding deployment rates and cost reductions (

When metrics are normalized to gross domestic product (GDP; as opposed to other normalization metrics such as primary energy), low-emission technology deployment rates used by IAMs over the course of the coming century are shown to be broadly consistent with past trends, but rates of change in emission intensity are typically overestimated (

This bias is consistent with the findings from the 'validation' studies cited above, suggesting that IAMs may underreport the potential for supply-side technological change assumed in 1.5°-consistent pathways, but may be more optimistic about the systemic ability to realize incremental changes in reduction of emission intensity as a consequence of favourable energy efficiency payback times (

    <p>One barrier to a greater rate of change in energy systems is that economic growth in the past has been coupled to the use of fossil fuels. Disruptive innovation and socio-technical changes could enable the decoupling of economic growth from a range of environmental drivers, including the consumption of fossil fuels, as represented by 1.5°C-consistent pathways

Instead, they are now opening stores, hotels, and tea shops. In another case, the arrival of an oil pipeline altered traditional Alaskan communities' livelihoods. With growth of oil production, investments were made for rural development. A later drop in oil production decreased these investments. Alaskan indigenous populations are also dealing with impacts of climate change, such as sea level rise, which is altering their livelihood sources. Transformational adaptation is taking place by changing the energy matrix to renewable energy, in which indigenous people apply their knowledge to achieve environmental, economic, and social benefits

    <p>Disruptive innovation and technological change may play a role in mitigation and in adaptation. The next section assesses mitigation and adaptation options in energy, land and ecosystem, urban and infrastructure and industrial systems.</p>

   <div>
    <div class="head">Systemic Changes for 1.5°C-Consistent Pathways</div>
    <p>Section 4.2 emphasizes the importance of systemic change for 1.5°C-consistent pathways. This section translates this into four main system transitions: energy, land and ecosystem, urban and infrastructure, and industrial system transitions. This section assesses the mitigation, adaptation and carbon dioxide removal options that offer the potential for such change within those systems, based on options identified by Chapter 2 and risks and impacts in Chapter 3.</p>
    <p>The section puts more emphasis on those adaptation options (Sections 4.3.1-4.3.5) and mitigation options (Sections 4.3.1-4.3.4, 4.3.6 and 4.3.7) that are 1.5°C-relevant and have developed considerably since AR5. They also form the basis for the mitigation and adaptation feasibility assessments in Section 4.5. Section 4.3.8 discusses solar radiation modification methods.</p>
    <p>This section emphasizes that no single solution or option can enable a global transition to 1.5°C-consistent pathways or adapting to projected impacts. Rather, accelerating change, much of which is already starting or underway, in multiple global systems, simultaneously and at different scales, could provide the impetus for these system transitions. The feasibility of individual options as well as the potential for synergies and reducing trade-offs will vary according to context and the local enabling conditions. These are explored at a high level in Section 4.5. Policy packages that bring together multiple enabling conditions can provide building blocks for a strategy to scale up implementation and intervention impacts.</p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <div class="head">Energy System Transitions</div>
    <p>This section discusses the feasibility of mitigation and adaptation options related to the energy system transition. Only options relevant to 1.5°C and with significant changes since AR5 are discussed, which means that for options like hydropower and geothermal energy, the chapter refers to AR5 and does not provide a discussion. Sociotechnical inertia of energy options for 1.5°C-consistent pathways are increasingly being surmounted as fossil fuels start to be phased out. Supply-side mitigation and adaptation options and energy demandside options, including energy efficiency in buildings and transportation, are discussed in Section 4.3.3; options around energy use in industry are discussed in Section 4.3.4.</p>
    <p>Section 4.5 assesses the feasibility in a systematic manner based on the approach outlined in Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1.</p>

    <p>The largest growth driver for renewable energy since AR5 has been the dramatic reduction in the cost of solar photovoltaics (PV)

    <p>The feasibility of renewable energy options depends to a large extent on geophysical characteristics of the area where the option is implemented. However, technological advances and policy instruments make renewable energy options increasingly attractive in other areas. For example, solar PV is deployed commercially in areas with low solar insolation, like northwest Europe (

    <div class="head">Bioenergy and biofuels</div>
    <p>Bioenergy is renewable energy from biomass. Biofuel is biomass-based energy used in transport. Chapter 2 suggests that pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C would enable supply of 67-310 (median 150) EJ yr −1 (see 
     <ref type="table" coords="12,348.41,339.18,23.64,11.20" target="#tab_29" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Table 2</ref>.8) from biomass. Most scenarios find that bioenergy is combined with carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS, BECCS) if it is available but also find robust deployment of bioenergy independent of the availability of CCS (see Chapter 2, Section 2.3.4.2 and Section 4.3.7 for a discussion of BECCS). Detailed assessments indicate that deployment is similar for pathways limiting global warming to below 2°C (Chum et al., 2011; P.

Some of the disagreement on the sustainable capacity for bioenergy stems from global versus local assessments. Global assessments may mask local dynamics that exacerbate negative impacts and shortages while at the same time niche contexts for deployment may avoid trade-offs and exploit co-benefits more effectively. In some regions of the world (e.g., the case of Brazilian ethanol, see Box 4.7, where land may be less of a constraint, the use of bioenergy is mature and the industry is well developed), land transitions could be balanced with food production and biodiversity to enable a global impact on CO 2 emissions (Jaiswal et al., 2017).

    <p>Costs of nuclear power have increased over time in some developed nations, principally due to market conditions where increased investment risks of high-capital expenditure technologies have become significant.

For instance, the United Kingdom works with public guarantees covering part of the upfront investment costs of newly planned nuclear capacity. This dynamic differs in countries such as China and South Korea, where monopolistic conditions in the electric system allow for reducing investment risks, deploying series effects and enhancing the engineering capacities of users due to stable relations between the security authorities and builders (

    <p>4.3.1.6 Carbon dioxide capture and storage in the power sector</p>
    <p>The AR5 (IPCC, 2014b) as well as Chapter 2, Section 2.4.2, assign significant emission reductions over the course of this century to CO 2 capture and storage (CCS) in the power sector. This section focuses on CCS in the fossil-fuelled power sector; Section 4.3.4 discusses CCS in non-power industry, and Section 4.3.7 discusses bioenergy with CCS (BECCS). Section 2.4.2 puts the cumulative CO 2 stored from fossil-fuelled power at 410 (199-470 interquartile range) GtCO 2 over this century. Such modelling suggests that CCS in the power sector can contribute to cost-effective achievement of emission reduction requirements for limiting warming to 1.5°C. CCS may also offer employment and political advantages for fossil fuel-dependent economies ( , but may entail more limited co-benefits than other mitigation options (that, e.g., generate power) and therefore relies on climate policy incentives for its business case and economic feasibility. Since 2017, two CCS projects in the power sector capture 2.4 MtCO 2 annually, while 30 MtCO 2 is captured annually in all CCS projects (Global CCS Institute, 2017).</p>
    <p>The technological maturity of CO 2 capture options in the power sectors has improved considerably (

Regional availability of this may not be sufficient, and it requires efforts to have this storage and the corresponding infrastructure available at the necessary rates and times

The technology itself mattered less than the social context of the project. Though insights on communication of CCS projects to the general public and inhabitants of the area around the CO 2 storage sites have been documented over the years, project stakeholders are not consistently implementing these lessons, although some projects have observed good practices (

    </p>
    <p>CCS in the power sector is hardly being realized at scale, mainly because the incremental costs of capture, and the development of transport and storage infrastructures are not sufficiently compensated by market or government incentives

EOR is a technique that uses CO 2 to mobilize more oil out of depleting oil fields, leading to additional CO 2 emissions by combusting the additionally recovered oil (Cooney et al., 2015).

Some high-latitude regions may benefit from the combined effects of elevated CO 2 and temperature because their average temperatures are below optimal temperature for crops. In both cases there are consequences for food production and quality (CrossChapter Box 6 in Chapter 3 on Food Security), conservation agriculture, irrigation, food wastage, bioenergy and the use of novel technologies.

    <p>Meta-analyses of the effects of drought, elevated CO 2 , and temperature conclude that at 2°C local warming and above, aggregate production of wheat, maize, and rice are expected to decrease in both temperate and tropical areas

     <ref type="bibr" coords="15,208.19,555.17,68.91,11.20" target="#b317" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Challinor et al., 2014</ref>), such as developing varieties better adapted to changing climate conditions. Adaptation options can help ensure access to sufficient, quality food. Such options include conservation agriculture, improved livestock management, increasing irrigation efficiency, agroforestry and management of food loss and waste. Complementary adaptation and mitigation options, for example, the use of climate services (Section 4.3.5), bioenergy (Section 4.3.1) and biotechnology (Section 4.4.4) can also serve to reduce emissions intensity and the carbon footprint of food production.
    </p>
    <p>Conservation agriculture (CA) is a soil management approach that reduces the disruption of soil structure and biotic processes by minimising tillage. A recent meta-analysis showed that no-till practices work well in water-limited agroecosystems when implemented jointly with residue retention and crop rotation, but when used independently, may decrease yields in other situations (

    <p>Livestock management. Livestock are responsible for more GHG emissions than all other food sources. Emissions are caused by feed production, enteric fermentation, animal waste, land-use change and livestock transport and processing. Some estimates indicate that livestock supply chains could account for 7.1 GtCO 2 per year, equivalent to 14.5% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (

Cattle (beef, milk) are responsible for about two-thirds of that total, largely due to methane emissions resulting from rumen fermentation (

    <p>Despite ongoing gains in livestock productivity and volumes, the increase of animal products in global diets is restricting overall agricultural efficiency gains because of inefficiencies in the conversion of agricultural primary production (e.g., crops) in the feed-animal products pathway

    <p>There is increasing agreement that overall emissions from food systems could be reduced by targeting the demand for meat and other livestock products, particularly where consumption is higher than suggested by human health guidelines. Adjusting diets to meet nutritional targets could bring large co-benefits, through GHG mitigation and improvements in the overall efficiency of food systems (

Whether such reductions in emission intensity result in lower or higher absolute GHG emissions depends on overall demand for livestock products, indicating the relevance of integrating supply-side with demand-side measures within food security objectives (

Shifting towards mixed crop-livestock systems is estimated to reduce agricultural adaptation costs to 0.3% of total production costs while abating deforestation by 76 Mha globally, making it a highly costeffective adaptation option with mitigation co-benefits (

In Australia, some farmers have successfully shifted to crop-livestock systems where, each year, they allocate land and forage resources in response to climate and price trends ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="16,261.22,435.13,35.89,11.20;16,51.02,447.13,16.40,11.20" target="#b145" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Bell et al., 2014</ref>) . However, there can be some unintended negative impacts of such integration, including increased burdens on women, higher requirements of capital, competing uses of crop residues (e.g., feed vs. mulching vs. carbon sequestration) and higher requirements of management skills, which can be a challenge across several low income countries (

Finally, the feasibility of improving livestock efficiency is dependent on socio-cultural context and acceptability: there remain significant issues around widespread adoption of crossbred animals, especially by smallholders (

    <p>Irrigation efficiency. Irrigation efficiency is especially critical since water endowments are expected to change, with 20-60 Mha of global cropland being projected to revert from irrigated to rain-fed land, while other areas will receive higher precipitation in shorter time spans, thus affecting irrigation demand ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="16,202.13,627.10,63.84,11.20" target="#b504" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Elliott et al., 2014</ref>). While increasing irrigation system efficiency is necessary, there is mixed evidence on how to enact efficiency improvements

Physical and technical strategies include building large-scale reservoirs or dams, renovating or deepening irrigation channels, building on-farm rainwater harvesting structures, lining ponds, channels and tanks to reduce losses through percolation and evaporation, and investing in small infrastructure such as sprinkler or drip irrigation sets

    </p>
    <p>Each strategy has differing costs and benefits relating to unique biophysical, social, and economic contexts. Also, increasing irrigation efficiency may foster higher dependency on irrigation, resulting in a heightened sensitivity to climate that may be maladaptive in the long term (

    <p>Improvements in irrigation efficiency would need to be supplemented with ancillary activities, such as shifting to crops that require less water and improving soil and moisture conservation

    <p>Growing evidence suggests that investing in behavioural shifts towards using irrigation technology such as micro-sprinklers or drip irrigation, is an effective and quick adaptation strategy Agroforestry.

    <p>Managing food loss and waste. The way food is produced, processed and transported strongly influences GHG emissions. Around one-third of the food produced on the planet is not consumed

Food wastage is a combination of food loss -the decrease in mass and nutritional value of food due to poor infrastructure, logistics, and lack of storage technologies and management -and food waste that derives from inappropriate human consumption that leads to food spoilage associated with inferior quality or overproduction. Food wastage could lead to an increase in emissions estimated to 1.9-2.5 GtCO 2 -eq yr −1 (

    <p>The strategy of reducing enteric methane emissions by ruminants through the development of inhibitors or vaccines has already been attempted with some successes, although the potential for application at scale and in different situations remains uncertain. A methane inhibitor has been demonstrated to reduce methane from feedlot systems by 30% over a 12-week period (Hristov et al., 2015) with some productivity benefits, but the ability to apply it in grazing systems will depend on further technological developments as well as costs and incentives. A vaccine could potentially modify the microbiota of the rumen and be applicable even in extensive grazing systems by reducing the presence of methanogenic micro-organisms (Wedlock et al., 2013) but has not yet been successfully demonstrated to reduce emissions in live animals. Selective breeding for lower-emitting ruminants is becoming rapidly feasible, offering small but cumulative emissions reductions without requiring substantial changes in farm systems (

    <p>Technological innovation could assist in increased agricultural efficiency (e.g., via precision agriculture), decrease food wastage and genetics that enhance plant adaptation traits (Section 4.4.4).

    <p>4.3.4.5 CO 2 capture, utilization and storage in industry CO 2 capture in industry is generally considered more feasible than CCS in the power sector (Section 4.3.1) or from bioenergy sources (Section 4.3.7), although CCS in industry faces similar barriers. Almost all of the current full-scale (&gt;1MtCO 2 yr −1 ) CCS projects capture CO 2 from industrial sources, including the Sleipner project in Norway, which has been injecting CO 2 from a gas facility in an offshore saline formation since 1996 (Global CCS Institute, 2017). Compared to the power sector, retrofitting CCS on existing industrial plants would leave the production process of materials relatively untouched (

Some industries, in particular cement, emit CO 2 as inherent process emissions and can therefore not reduce emissions to zero without CC(U)S. CO 2 stacks in some industries have a high economic and technical feasibility for CO 2 capture as the CO 2 concentration in the exhaust gases is relatively high

The heterogeneity of industrial production processes might point to the need for specific institutional arrangements to incentivize industrial CCS (

    <p>Whether carbon dioxide utilization (CCU) can contribute to limiting warming to 1.5°C depends on the origin of the CO 2 (fossil, biogenic or atmospheric), the source of electricity for converting the CO 2 or regenerating catalysts, and the lifetime of the product. Review studies indicate that CO 2 utilization in industry has a small role to play in limiting warming to 1.5°C because of the limited potential of reusing CO 2 with currently available technologies and the re-emission of CO 2 when used as a fuel 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="24,412.85,207.17,48.79,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(IPCC, 2005b;</ref>

However, new developments could make CCU more feasible, in particular in CO 2 use as a feedstock for carbon-based materials that would isolate CO 2 from the atmosphere for a long time, and in lowcost, low-emission electricity that would make the energy use of CO 2 capture more sustainable. The conversion of CO 2 to fuels using zeroemission electricity has a lower technical, economic and environmental feasibility than direct CO 2 capture and storage from industry (

    <p>Extreme weather, linked to tropical storms and hurricanes, represent one of the largest risks facing Caribbean island nations (Chapter 3, Section 3.4.5.3). Non-economic damages include detrimental health impacts, forced displacement and destruction of cultural heritages. Projections of increased frequency of the most intense storms at 1.5°C and higher warming levels (Wehner et al., 2018; Chapter 3, Section 3.3.6; Box 3.5) are a significant cause for concern, making adaptation a matter of survival (

    <p>The main short-lived climate forcer (SLCF) emissions that cause warming are methane (CH 4 ), other precursors of tropospheric ozone (i.e., carbon monoxide (CO), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), black carbon (BC) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs);

SLCFs also include emissions that lead to cooling, such as sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ) and organic carbon (OC Mitigation options for warming SLCFs often overlap with other mitigation options, especially since many warming SLCFs are co-emitted with CO 2 . SLCFs are generally mitigated in 1.5°C-or 2°C-consistent pathways as an integral part of an overall mitigation strategy (Chapter 2). For example, Section 2.3 indicates that most verylow-emissions pathways include a transition away from the use of coal and natural gas in the energy sector and oil in transportation, which coincides with emission-reduction strategies related to methane from the fossil fuel sector and BC from the transportation sector. Much SLCF emission reduction aims at BC-rich sectors and considers the impacts of several co-emitted SLCFs (

This could sequester at least 3.7 GtCO 2 yr −1 for decades. The full literature range gives 2050 potentials of 1-7 GtCO 2 yr −1 (low evidence, medium agreement), narrowed down to 0.5-3.6 GtCO 2 yr −1 based on a number of constraints (

In all such limited adaptive deployment scenarios, deployment of SRM only commences under conditions in which CO 2 emissions have already fallen substantially below their peak level and are continuing to fall. In order to hold warming to 1.5°C, a hypothetical SRM deployment could span from one to several decades, with the earliest possible threshold exceedance occurring before mid-century. Over this duration, SRM has to compensate for warming that exceeds 1.5°C (displayed with hatching on panel a) with a decrease in radiative forcing (panel b) which could be achieved with a rate of SAI varying between 0-5.9 MtSO 2 yr −1 (panel c) (

    <p>Despite the large uncertainties in the simulated climate response to SRM, current model simulations suggest that SRM would lead to altered carbon budgets compatible with 1.5°C or 2°C. The 6 CMIP5 models investigated simulated an increase of natural carbon uptake by land biosphere and, to a smaller extent, by the oceans (high agreement). The multimodel mean of this response suggests an increase of the RCP4.5 carbon budget of about 150 GtCO 2 after 50 years of SO 2 injection with a rate of 4 TgS yr −1 , which represents about 4 years of CO 2 emissions at the current rate (36 GtCO 2 yr −1 ). However, there is uncertainty around quantitative determination of the effects that SRM or its cessation has on the carbon budget due to a lack of understanding of the radiative processes driving the global carbon cycle response to SRM (

    <p>Given the political unwillingness to continue with the Kyoto Protocol approach a new approach was introduced in the Copenhagen Accord, the Cancun Agreements, and finally in the Paris Agreement.

These governance mechanisms are based on accountability and transparency rules and participation and coordination across and within these levels.</p>

The Covenant of Mayors (CoM) is an initiative in which municipalities voluntarily commit to CO 2 emission reduction. The participation of small municipalities has been facilitated by the development and testing of a new multilevel governance model involving Covenant Territorial Coordinators (CTCs), i.e., provinces and regions, which commit to providing strategic guidance and financial and technical support to municipalities in their territories. Results from the 315 monitoring inventories submitted show an achievement of 23% reduction in emissions (compared to an average year 2005) for more than half of the cities under a CTC schema (

The local Chamber of Commerce also had a key role in the implementation of these projects by the municipalities . The Chapter 5, Section 5.6.4 case studies of climate-resilient development pathways, at state and community scales, show that participation, social learning and iterative decision-making are governance features of strategies that deliver mitigation, adaptation, and sustainable development in a fair and equitable manner.

National governments, for example, have been associated with enhancing adaptive capacity through building awareness of climate impacts, encouraging economic growth, providing incentives, establishing legislative frameworks conducive to adaptation, and communicating climate change information

Countries can include domestic adaptation goals in their NDCs, which together with national adaptation plans (NAPs) give countries flexibility to design and adjust their adaptation trajectories as their needs evolve and as progress is evaluated over time. A challenge for assessing progress on adaptation globally is the aggregation of many national adaptation actions and approaches. Knowledge gaps still remain about how to design measurement frameworks that generate and integrate national adaptation data without placing undue burdens on countries (UNEP, 2017a).
    </p>
    <p>The Paris Agreement stipulates that adaptation communications shall be submitted as a component of or in conjunction with other communications, such as an NDC, a NAP, or a national communication. Of the 197 Parties to the UNFCCC, 140 NDCs have an adaptation component, almost exclusively from developing countries. NDC adaptation components could be an opportunity for enhancing adaptation planning and implementation by highlighting priorities and goals

    <p>The implementation of sound responses and strategies to enable a transition to 1.5°C world would require strengthening governance and scaling up institutional capacities, particularly in developing countries (

Building on the characterization of governance in Section 4.4.1, this section examines the necessary institutional capacity to implement actions to limit warming to 1.5°C and adapt to the consequences. This takes into account a plurality of regional and local responses, as institutional capacity is highly context-dependent

    </p>
    <p>The goal for strengthening implementation is to ensure that these rules and regulations embrace equity, equality and poverty alleviation along 1.5°C-consistent pathways (mitigation) and enables the building of adaptive capacity that together, will enable sustainable development and poverty reduction.</p>

    <p>The enhancement of institutional capacity for integrated policy design and implementation has long been among the top items on the UN agenda of addressing global environmental problems and sustainable development (see Chapter 5, Section 5.5) (UNEP, 2005).</p>
    <p>Political stability, an effective regulatory and enforcement framework (e.g., institutions to impose sanctions, collect taxes and to verify building codes), access to a knowledge base and the availability of resources, would be needed at various governance levels to address a wide range of stakeholders and their concerns. The strengthening of the global response would need to support these with different interventions, in the context of sustainable development (Chapter 5, Section 5.5.1) (

    </p>
    <p>Given the scale of change needed to limit warming to 1.5°C, strengthening the response capacity of relevant institutions is best addressed in ways that take advantage of existing decision-making processes in local and regional governments and within cities and communities

As an example, current rates of urbanization occurring in cities with a lack of institutional capacity for effective land-use planning, zoning and infrastructure development result in unplanned, informal urban settlements which are vulnerable to climate impacts. It is common for 30-50% of urban populations in low-income nations to live in informal settlements with no regulatory infrastructure (

    <p>Internationally, the Paris Agreement process has aimed at enhancing the capacity of decision-making institutions in developing countries to support effective implementation. These efforts are particularly reflected in Article 11 of the Paris Agreement on capacity building (the creation of the Paris Committee on Capacity Building), Article 13 (the creation of the Capacity Building Initiative on Transparency), and Article 15 on compliance (UNFCCC, 2016).</p>

    <div class="head">Box 4.4 | Manizales, Colombia: Supportive National Government and Localized Planning and Integration as an Enabling Condition for Managing Climate and Development Risks</div>
    <p>Institutional reform in the city of Manizales, Colombia, helps identify three important features of an enabling environment: integrating climate change adaptation, mitigation and disaster risk management at the city-scale; the importance of decentralized planning and policy formulation within a supportive national policy environment; and the role of a multi-sectoral framework in mainstreaming climate action in development activities.</p>
    <p>Manizales is exposed to risks caused by rapid development and expansion in a mountainous terrain exposed to seismic activity and periodic wet and dry spells. Local assessments expect climate change to amplify the risk of disasters ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="49,439.97,171.17,66.81,11.20" target="#b300" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Carreño et al., 2017</ref>). The city is widely recognized for its longstanding urban environmental policy (Biomanizales) and local environmental action plan (Bioplan), and has been integrating environmental planning in its development agenda for nearly two decades 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="49,449.96,195.16,93.77,11.20" target="#b1851" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Velásquez Barrero, 1998;</ref>

When the city's environmental agenda was updated in 2014 to reflect climate change risks, assessments were conducted in a participatory manner at the street and neighbourhood level (Hardoy and Velásquez 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="49,490.48,219.16,49.33,11.20" target="#b729" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Barrero, 2016)</ref>.
    </p>
    <p>The creation of a new Environmental Secretariat assisted in coordination and integration of environmental policies, disaster risk management, development and climate change ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="49,250.43,255.16,82.79,11.20" target="#b1041" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Leck and Roberts, 2015)</ref>. Planning in Manizales remains mindful of steep gradients through its longstanding Slope Guardian programme that trains women and keeps records of vulnerable households. Planning also looks to include mitigation opportunities and enhance local capacity through participatory engagement (Hardoy and Velásquez 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="49,74.69,291.15,45.86,11.20" target="#b729" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Barrero, 2016</ref>).
    </p>
    <p>Manizales' mayors were identified as important champions for much of these early integration and innovation efforts. Their role may have been enabled by Colombia's history of decentralized approaches to planning and policy formulation, including establishing environmental observatories (for continuous environmental assessment) and participatory tracking of environmental indicators. Multi-stakeholder involvement has both enabled and driven progress, and has enabled the integration of climate risks in development planning (Hardoy and Velásquez Barrero, 2016).</p>

    <div class="head">Monitoring, reporting, and review institutions</div>
    <p>One of the novel features of the new climate governance architecture emerging from the 2015 Paris Agreement is the transparency framework in Article 13 committing countries, based on capacity, to provide regular progress reports on national pledges to address climate change 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="49,114.55,483.17,56.93,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(UNFCCC, 2016)</ref>. Many countries will rely on public policies and existing national reporting channels to deliver on their NDCs under the Paris Agreement. Scaling up the mitigation and adaptation efforts in these countries to be consistent with 1.5°C would put significant pressure on the need to develop, enhance and streamline local, national and international climate change reporting and monitoring methodologies and institutional capacity in relation to mitigation, adaptation, finance, and GHG inventories (

The availability of independent private and public reporting and statistical institutions are integral to oversight, effective monitoring, reporting and review.

    <div class="head">Financial institutions</div>
    <p>IPCC AR5 assessed that in order to enable a transition to a 2°C pathway, the volume of climate investments would need to be transformed along with changes in the pattern of general investment behaviour towards low emissions. The report argued that, compared to 2012, annually up to a trillion dollars in additional investment in low-emission energy and energy efficiency measures may be required until 2050 ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="49,516.39,495.17,44.97,11.20;49,315.21,507.17,19.76,11.20" target="#b189" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Blanco et al., 2014;</ref>

Financing of 1.5°C would present an even greater challenge, addressing financing of both existing and new assets, which would require significant transitions to the type and structure of financial institutions as well as to the method of financing ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="49,489.56,543.16,71.79,11.20" target="#b359" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Cochrani et al., 2014;</ref>

Both public and private financial institutions would be needed to contribute to the large resource mobilization needed for 1.5°C, yet, in the ordinary course of business, these transitions may not be expected.
    </p>
    <p>On the one hand, private financial institutions could face scale-up risk, for example, the risks associated with commercialization and scaling up of renewable technologies to accelerate mitigation

In contrast, traditional public financial institutions are limited by both structure and instruments, while concessional financing would require taxpayer support for subsidization. Special efforts and innovative approaches would be needed to address these challenges, for example the creation of special institutions that underwrite the value of emission reductions using auctioned price floors (

The development and enhancement of microfinance institutions to ensure social resilience and smooth transitions in the adaptation to climate change impacts could be an important local institutional innovation (

    <p>Effective cooperative institutions and social safety nets may help address energy access and adaptation, as well as distributional impacts during the transition to 1.5°C-consistent pathways and enabling sustainable development. Not all countries have the institutional capabilities to design and manage these. Social capital for adaptation in the form of bonding, bridging, and linking social institutions has proved to be effective in dealing with climate crises at the local, regional and national levels (

    </p>
    <p>The shift towards sustainable energy systems in transitioning economies could impact the livelihoods of large populations in traditional and legacy employment sectors. The transition of selected EU Member States to biofuels, for example, caused anxiety among farmers, who lacked confidence in the biofuel crop market. Enabling contracts between farmers and energy companies, involving local governments, helped create an atmosphere of confidence during the transition

    </p>
    <p>How do broader socio-economic processes influence urban vulnerabilities and thereby underpin climate change adaptation? This is a systemic challenge originating from a lack of collective societal ownership of the responsibility for climate risk management. Explanations for this situation include competing time-horizons due to self-interest of stakeholders to a more 'rational' conception of risk assessment, measured across a risk-tolerance spectrum

    <p>Self-governing and self-organ¬ised institutional settings, where equipment and resource systems are commonly owned and managed, can poten¬tially generate a much higher diversity of administration solutions, than other institutional arrangements, where energy technology and resource systems are either owned and administered individually in market settings or via a central authority (e.g., the state).

    <div class="head">Box 4.5 | How Pricing Policy has Reduced Car Use in Singapore, Stockholm and London</div>
    <p>In Singapore, Stockholm and London, car ownership, car use, and GHG emissions have reduced because of pricing and regulatory policies and policies facilitating behaviour change. Notably, acceptability of these policies has increased as people experienced their positive effects.</p>
    <p>Singapore implemented electronic road pricing in the central business district and at major expressways, a vehicle quota and registration fee system, and investments in mass transit. In the vehicle quota system introduced in 1990, registration of new vehicles is conditional upon a successful bid (via auctioning) 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="54,260.55,447.17,40.87,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Chu, 2015)</ref>, costing about 50,000 USD in 2014

The registration tax incentivizes purchases of low-emission vehicles via a feebate system. As a result, per capita transport emissions (approximately 1.25 tCO 2 yr −1 ) and car ownership (107 vehicles per 1000 capita) (LTA, 2017) are substantially lower than in cities with comparable income levels. Modal share of public transport was 63% during peak hours in 2013

    <p>The Stockholm congestion charge implemented in 2007 (after a trial in 2006) reduced kilometres driven in the inner city by 16%, and outside the city by 5%; traffic volumes reduced by 20% and remained constant over time despite economic and population growth

Vehicles entering or leaving the city centre were charged during weekdays (except for holidays). Charges were 1-2€ (maximum 6€ per day), being higher during peak hours; taxis, emergency vehicles and buses were exempted. Before introducing the charge, public transport and parking places near mass transit stations were extended. The aim and effects of the charge were extensively communicated to the public. Acceptability of the congestion charge was initially low, but the scheme gained support of about two-thirds of the population and all political parties after it was implemented

After the trial, people believed that the charge had more positive effects on environmental, congestion and parking problems while costs increased less than they anticipated beforehand (

    </p>
    <p>In 2003, a congestion charge was implemented in the Greater London area, with an enforcement and compliance scheme and an information campaign on the functioning of the scheme. Vehicles entering, leaving, driving or parking on a public road in the zone at weekdays at daytime pay a congestion charge of 8£ (until 2005, 5£), with some exemptions. Revenues were invested in London's bus network (80%), cycling facilities, and road safety measures

For example, communicating the impacts of climate change is more effective when provided right before adaptation decisions are taken (e.g., before the agricultural season) and when bundled with information on potential actions to ameliorate impacts, rather than just providing information on climate projections with little meaning to end users (e.g., weather forecasts, seasonal forecasts, decadal climate trends) (

    <p>In the Philippines, seismic activity has caused some islands to flood during high tide. While the municipal government offered affected island communities the possibility to relocate to the mainland, residents preferred to stay and implement measures themselves in their local community to reduce flood damage

Instead, these island communities have adapted to flooding by constructing stilted houses and raising floors, furniture, and roads to prevent water damage (Laurice Jamero et al., 2017). While inundation was in this case caused by seismic activity, this example indicates how island-based communities may respond to rising sea levels caused by climate change.

    <p>Adaptation initiatives by individuals may temporarily reduce the impacts of climate change and enable residents to cope with changing environmental circumstances. However, they may not be sufficient to sustain communities' way of life in the long term. For instance, in Fiji and Kiribati, freshwater and food are projected to become even scarcer in the future, rendering individual adaptations ineffective. Moreover, individuals can sometimes engage in behaviour that may be maladaptive over larger spatio-temporal scales. For example, in the Philippines, many islanders adapt to flooding by elevating their floors using coral stone

In Maharashtra, India, on-farm ponds are promoted as rainwater harvesting structures to adapt to dry spells during the monsoon season. However, some individuals fill these ponds with groundwater, leading to depletion of water tables and potentially maladaptive outcomes in the long run

To illustrate such a process of co-evolution: the progress of computer simulation enables us to better understand climate, agriculture, and material sciences, contributing to upgrading food production and quality, microscale manufacturing techniques, and leading to much faster computing technologies, resulting, for instance, in better performing photovoltaic (PV) cells.

    <div class="head">Technologies as enablers of climate action</div>
    <p>Since AR5, literature has emerged as to how much future GHG emission reductions can be enabled by the rapid progress of general purpose technologies (GPTs), consisting of information and communication technologies (ICT), including artificial intelligence (AI) and the internet of things (IoT), nanotechnologies, biotechnologies, robotics, and so forth 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="57,315.21,339.17,41.60,11.20" target="#b1907" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(WEF, 2015;</ref>

    </p>
    <p>Rapid improvement of performance and cost reduction is observed for many GPTs. They include AI, sensors, internet, memory storage and microelectromechanical systems. The latter GPTs are not usually categorized as climate technologies, but they can impact GHG emissions.</p>
    <p>Progress of GPT could help reduce GHG emissions more costeffectively. Examples are shown in

It may however, result in more emissions by increasing the volume of economic activities, with unintended negative consequence on sustainable development. While ICT increases electricity consumption

It is also possible that GHG emissions increase due to an incentive to car use. Appropriate policies such as urban planning and efficiency regulations could contain such rebound effects (

    <p>The use of sugarcane as a bioenergy source started in Brazil in the 1970s.

After a transition period in which both ethanol-only and gasoline-only cars were used, the flex-fuel era started in 2003, when all gasoline was blended with 25% ethanol (de Freitas and Kaneko, 2011). By 2010, around 80% of the car fleet in Brazil had been converted to use flex-fuel

    <p>Brazil and the European Union have tried to replicate Brazil's bioethanol experience in climatically suitable African countries. Although such technology transfer achieved relative success in Angola and Sudan, the attempts to set up bioethanol value chains did not pass the phase of political deliberations and feasibility studies elsewhere in Africa. Lessons learned include the need for political and economic stability of the donor country (Brazil) and the necessity for market creation to attract investments in firstgeneration biofuels alongside a safe legal and policy environment for improved technologies (

    <p>Funding for R&amp;D could come from various sources, including the general budget, energy or resource taxation, or emission trading schemes (see Section 4.4.5).

    <div class="head">Technology transfer in the Paris Agreement</div>
    <p>Technology development and transfer is recognized as an enabler of both mitigation and adaptation in Article 10 in the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC, 2016) as well as in Article 4.5 of the original text of the UNFCCC 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="59,526.77,195.17,34.58,11.20;59,315.21,207.17,18.63,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(UNFCCC, 1992)</ref>. As previous sections have focused on technology development and diffusion, this section focuses on technology transfer. Technology transfer can adapt technologies to local circumstances, reduce financing costs, develop indigenous technology, and build capabilities to operate, maintain, adapt and innovate on technology globally ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="59,511.60,255.16,49.76,11.20;59,315.21,267.16,19.87,11.20" target="#b1327" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Ockwell et al., 2015;</ref>

    </p>
    <p>The international institutional landscape around technology development and transfer includes the UNFCCC (via its technology framework and Technology Mechanism including the Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN)), the United Nations (a technology facilitation mechanism for the SDGs) and a variety of non-UN multilateral and bilateral cooperation initiatives such as the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR, founded in the 1970s), and numerous initiatives of companies, foundations, governments and non-governmental and academic organizations. Moreover, in 2015, twenty countries launched an initiative called 'Mission Innovation', seeking to double their energy R&amp;D funding. At this point it is difficult to evaluate whether Mission Innovation achieved its objective (

    </p>
    <p>Most technology transfer is driven by through markets by the interests of technology seekers and technology holders, particularly in regions with well-developed institutional and technological capabilities such as developed and emerging nations

However, the current international technology transfer landscape has gaps, in particular in reaching out to leastdeveloped countries, where institutional and technology capabilities are limited (

    </p>
    <p>On the one hand, literature suggests that the management or even monitoring of all these UN, bilateral, private and public initiatives may fail to lead to better results. On the other hand, it is probably more cost-effective to adopt a strategy of 'letting a thousand flowers bloom', by challenging and enticing researchers in the public and the private sector to direct innovation towards low-emission and adaptation options (

    <p>At COP 21, the UNFCCC requested the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) to initiate the elaboration of the technology framework established under the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC, 2016). Among other things, the technology framework would 'provide overarching guidance for the work of the Technology Mechanism in promoting and facilitating enhanced action on technology development and transfer in order to support the implementation of this Agreement' (this Agreement being the Paris Agreement). An enhanced guidance issued by the Technology Executive Committee (TEC) for preparing a technology action plan (TAP) supports the new technology framework as well as the Parties' long-term vision on technology development and transfer, reflected in the Paris Agreement (TEC, 2016).</p>

    <div class="head">Strengthening Policy Instruments and Enabling Climate Finance</div>
    <p>Triggering rapid and far-reaching change in technical choices and institutional arrangements, consumption and lifestyles, infrastructure, land use, and spatial patterns implies the ability to scale up policy signals to enable the decoupling of GHGs emission, and economic growth and development (Section 4.2.2.3). Such a scale-up would also imply that potential short-term negative responses by populations and interest groups, which could block these changes from the outset, would need to be prevented or overcome. This section describes the size and nature of investment needs and the financial challenge over the coming two decades in the context of 1.5°C warmer worlds, assesses the potential and constraints of three categories of policy instruments that respond to the challenge, and explains the conditions for using them synergistically. The policy and finance instruments discussed in this section relate to Section 4.4.1 (on governance) and other Sections in 4.4.</p>
    <p>4.4.5.1 The core challenge: cost-efficiency, coordination of expectations and distributive effects 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="60,309.54,303.18,27.26,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Box 4.8</ref> shows that the average estimate by seven models of annual investment needs in the energy system is around 2.38 trillion USD2010 (1.38 to 3.25) between 2016 and 2035. This represents between 2.53% (1.6-4%) of the world GDP in market exchange rates (MER) and 1.7% of the world GDP in purchasing power parity (PPP). OECD investment assessments for a 2°C-consistent transition suggest that including investments in transportation and in other infrastructure would increase the investment needs by a factor of three. Other studies not included in Box 4.8, in particular by the World Economic Forum (WEF, 2013) and the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="60,480.35,411.16,42.43,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(GCEC, 2014</ref>) confirm these orders of magnitude of investment.
    </p>
    <p>The average increase of investment in the energy sector resulting from Box 4.8 represents a mean value of 1.5% of the total world investment compared with the baselines scenario in MER and a little over 1% in PPP. Including infrastructure investments would raise this to 2.5% and 1.7% respectively. 9</p>
    <p>These incremental investments could be funded through a drain on consumption ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="60,361.98,531.17,66.51,11.20" target="#b213" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Bowen et al., 2017)</ref>, which would necessitate between 0.68% and 0.45% lower global consumption than in the baseline. But, consumption at a constant savings/consumption ratio can alternatively be funded by shifting savings towards productive adaptation and mitigation investments, instead of real-estate sector and liquid financial products. This response depends upon whether it is possible to close the global investment funding gap for infrastructure that potentially inhibits growth, through structural changes in the global economy. In this case, investing more in infrastructure would not be an incremental cost in terms of development and welfare 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="60,430.90,639.16,38.46,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(IMF, 2014;</ref>

The difference between the value of two currencies in PPP and MER should vanish as the gap of the income levels of the two concerned countries decreases. Accounting for this trend in modelling is challenging.

    <div class="head">Box 4.8 | Investment Needs and the Financial Challenge of Limiting Warming to 1.5°C</div>
    <p>Peer-reviewed literature that estimates the investment needs over the next two decades to scale up the response to limit warming to 1.5°C is very limited (see Section 4.6). This box attempts to bring together available estimates of the order of magnitude of these investments, after consultation with the makers of those estimates, to provide the context for global and national financial mobilization policy and related institutional arrangements. 
     <ref type="table" coords="61,74.69,147.17,25.03,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Table 1</ref> in this box presents mean annual investments up to 2035, based on three studies (after clarifying their scope and harmonizing their metrics): an ensemble of four integrated assessment models (here denoted IAM, see Chapter 2), an Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) scenario for a 2°C limit (OECD, 2017a) and scenarios from the International Energy Agency (IEA, 2016c). All three sources provide estimates for the energy sector for various mitigation scenarios. They give a mean value of 2.38 trillion USD of yearly investments in the energy sector over the period, with minimum and maximum values of 1.38 and 3.25 respectively. We also report the OECD estimate for 2°C because it also covers transportation and other infrastructure (water, sanitation, and telecommunication), which are essential to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 7 on clean energy access, and enhance the adaptive capacity to climate change.
    </p>
    <p>The mean incremental share of annual energy investments to stay well below 2°C is 0.36% (between 0.2-1%) of global GDP between 2016 and 2035. Since total world investment (also called gross fixed capital formation (GFCF)) is about 24% of global GDP, the estimated incremental energy investments between a baseline and a 1.5°C transition would be approximately 1.5% (between 0.8-4.2%) of projected total world investments. As the higher ends of these ranges reflect pessimistic assumptions in 1.5°C-consistent pathways on technological change, the implementation of policies to accelerate technical change (see the remainder of Section 4.4.5) could lower the probability of higher incremental investment.</p>
    <p>If we assume the amounts of investments given by the OECD for transportation and other infrastructure for warming of 2°C to be a lower limit for an 1.5°C pathway, then total incremental investments for all sectors for a 1.5°C-consistent pathway would be estimated at 2.4% of total world investments. This total incremental investment reaches 2.53% if the investments in transportation are scaled up proportionally with the investments in the energy sector and if all other investments are kept constant. Comparing this 2.4% or 2.53% number for all sectors to the 1.5% number for energy only (see previous paragraph) suggests that the investments in sectors other than energy contribute significantly to incremental world investments, even though a comprehensive study or estimate of these investments for a 1.5°C limit is not available.</p>
    <p>The issue, from a macroeconomic perspective, is whether these investments would be funded by higher savings at the costs of lower consumption. This would mean a 0.5% reduction in consumption for the energy sector for 1.5°C. Note that for a 2°C scenario, this reduction would be 0.8% if we account for the investment needs of all infrastructure sectors. Assuming conversely a constant savings ratio, this would necessitate reallocating existing capital flows towards infrastructure. In addition to these incremental investments, the amount of redirected investments is relevant from a financial perspective. In the reported IAM energy sector scenarios, about three times the incremental investments is redirected. There is no such assessment for the other sectors. The OECD report suggests that these ratios might be higher.</p>
    <p>These orders of magnitude of investment can be compared to the available statistics of the global stock of 386 trillion USD of financial capital, which consists of 100 trillion USD in bonds 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="62,288.11,159.16,49.80,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(SIFMA, 2017)</ref>, around 60 trillion USD in equity (World Bank, 2018b), and 226 trillion USD of loans managed by the banking system 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="62,293.90,171.16,34.81,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(IIF, 2017;</ref>
     <ref type="bibr" coords="62,330.13,171.16,65.80,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">World Bank, 2018a</ref>). The long-term rate of return (interest plus increase of shareholder value) is about 3% on bonds, 5% on bank lending and 7% on equity, leading to a weighted mean return on capital of 3.4% in real terms (5.4% in nominal terms). Using 3.4% as a lower bound and 5% as a higher bound (following 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="62,511.48,195.16,26.53,11.20;62,69.02,207.16,16.70,11.20" target="#b1412" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Piketty, 2014</ref>) and taking a conservative assumption that global financial capital grows at the same rate as global GDP, the estimated yearly financial capital revenues would be between 16.8 and 25.4 trillion USD.
    </p>
    <p>Assuming that a quarter of these investments comes from public funds (as estimated by the World Bank; World Bank, 2018a), the amount of private resources needed to enable an energy sector transition is between 3.3% and 5.3% of annual capital income and between 5.6% and 8.3% of these revenues for all infrastructure to meet the 2°C limit and the SDGs.</p>
    <p>Since the financial system has limited fungibility across budget lines, changing the partitioning of investments is not a zero-sum game. An effective policy regime could encourage investment managers to change their asset allocation. Part of the challenge may lie in increasing the pace of financing of low-emission assets to compensate for a possible 38% decrease, by 2035, in the value of fossil fuel assets (energy sector and indirect holdings in downstream uses like automobiles) ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="62,402.93,327.14,67.82,11.20" target="#b1194" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Mercure et al., 2018</ref>). Investments in other (non-energy system) infrastructure to meet development and poverty-reduction goals can strengthen the adaptive capacity to address climate change, and are difficult to separate from overall sustainable development and poverty-alleviation investments . The magnitude of potential climate change damages is related to pre-existing fragility of impacted societies ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="62,86.62,447.17,77.20,11.20" target="#b717" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Hallegatte et al., 2007)</ref>. Enhancing infrastructure and service provision would lower this fragility, for example, through the provision of universal (water, sanitation, telecommunication) service access ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="62,54.53,483.16,59.30,11.20" target="#b84" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Arezki et al., 2016</ref>).
    </p>
    <p>The main challenge is thus not just a lack of mobilization of aggregate resources but of redirection of savings towards infrastructure, and the further redirection of these infrastructure investments towards low-emission options. If emission-free assets emerge fast enough to compensate for the devaluation of high-emission assets, the sum of the required incremental and redirected investments in the energy sector would (up to 2035) be equivalent to between 3.3% and 5.3% of the average annual revenues of the private capital stock (see 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="62,283.22,591.15,13.56,11.20;62,51.02,603.15,14.04,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Box 4.8)</ref> and to between 5.6% and 8.3%, including all infrastructure investments.
    </p>
    <p>The interplay between mechanisms of financial intermediation and the private risk-return calculus is a major barrier to realizing these investments ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="62,120.97,663.14,62.28,11.20" target="#b1665" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Sirkis et al., 2015)</ref>. This obstacle is not specific to climate mitigation investments but also affects infrastructure and has been characterised as the gap between the 'propensity to save' and the 'propensity to invest' 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="62,159.23,699.13,58.33,11.20" target="#b1748" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Summers, 2016)</ref>. The issue is whether new financial instruments could close this gap and inject liquidity into the low-emission transition, thereby unlocking new economic opportunities

    </p>
    <p>This uncertain but potentially positive outcome might be constrained by the higher energy costs of low-emission options in the energy and transportation sectors. The envelope of worldwide marginal abatement costs for 1.5°C-consistent pathways reported in Chapter 2 is 135-5500 in 2050, which is between three to four times higher than for a 2°C limit.</p>
    <div class="formula">USD2010</div>
    <p>These figures are consistent with the dramatic reduction in the unit costs of some low-emission technical options (for example solar PV, LED lighting) over the past decade (see Section 4.3.1) 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="62,530.95,591.17,24.69,11.20;62,309.55,603.17,18.78,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(OECD, 2017c</ref>). Yet there are multiple constraints to a system-wide energy transition. Lower costs of some supply-and demand-side options do not always result in a proportional decrease in energy system costs. The adoption of alternative options can be slowed down by increasing costs of decommissioning existing infrastructure, the inertia of market structures, cultural habits and risk-adverse user behaviour (see Sections 4.4.1 to 4.4.3). Learning-by-doing processes and R&amp;D can accelerate the cost-efficiency of low-emission technology but often imply higher early-phase costs. The German energy transition resulted in high consumer prices for electricity in Germany ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="62,462.92,711.15,92.36,11.20" target="#b993" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Kreuz and Müsgens, 2017)</ref> and needed strong accompanying measures to succeed.
    </p>
    <p>One key issue is that energy costs can propagate across sectors and amplify overall production costs. During the early stage of a lowemission transition, an increase in the prices of non-energy goods could reduce consumer purchasing power and final demand. A rise in energy prices has a proportionally greater impact in developing countries that are in a catch-up phase, as they have a stronger dependence on energy-intensive sectors

    </p>
    <p>First, in the absence of countervailing policies, higher energy costs have an adverse effect on the distribution of welfare (see also Chapter 5). The negative impact is inversely correlated with the level of income 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="63,117.00,243.15,63.54,11.20" target="#b726" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Harberger, 1984;</ref>

Moreover, climatic conditions and the geographical conditions of human settlements matter for heating and mobility needs (see Chapter 5). Medium-income populations in the suburbs, in remote areas, and in low-density regions can be as vulnerable as residents of low-income urban areas. Poor households with low levels of energy consumption are also impacted by price increases of non-energy goods caused by the propagation of energy costs 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="63,173.47,375.13,75.48,11.20" target="#b369" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Combet et al., 2010;</ref>

    </p>
    <p>A second matter of concern is the distortion of international competition and employment implications in the case of uneven carbon constraints, especially for energy-intensive industries 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="63,200.08,447.13,98.95,11.20" target="#b437" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Demailly and Quirion, 2008)</ref>. Some of these industries are not highly exposed to international competition because of their very high transportation costs per unit value added

    </p>
    <p>A third challenge is the depreciation of assets whose value is based on the valuation of fossil energy resources, of which future revenues may decline precipitously with higher carbon prices (

This raises issues of changes in industrial structure, adaptation of worker skills, and of stability of financial, insurance and social security systems. These systems are in part based on current holdings of carbon-based assets whose value might decrease by about 38% by the mid-2030s ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="63,150.00,663.10,75.17,11.20" target="#b1194" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Mercure et al., 2018)</ref>. This stranded asset challenge may be exacerbated by a decline of export revenues of fossil fuel producing countries and regions ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="63,191.39,687.10,73.92,11.20" target="#b1881" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Waisman et al., 2013;</ref>

    </p>
    <p>These distributional issues, if addressed carefully and expeditiously, could affect popular sensitivity towards climate policies. Addressing them could mitigate adverse macroeconomic effects on economic growth and employment that could undermine the potential benefits of a redirection of savings and investments towards 1.5°C-consistent pathways.</p>
    <p>Strengthening policy instruments for a low-emission transition would thus need to reconcile three objectives: (i) handling the short-term frictions inherent to this transition in an equitable way, (ii) minimizing these frictions by lowering the cost of avoided GHGs emissions, and (iii) coordinating expectations of multiple stakeholders at various decisionmaking levels to accelerate the decline in costs of emission reduction, efficiency and decoupling options and maximizing their co-benefits (see the practical example of lowering car use in cities in Box 4.9).</p>
    <p>Three categories of policy tools would be available to meet the distributional challenges: carbon pricing, regulatory instruments and information and financial tools. Each of them has its own strengths and weaknesses, from a 1.5°C perspective, policy tools would have to be both scaled up and better coordinated in packages in a synergistic manner.</p>

    <div class="head">Carbon pricing: necessity and constraints</div>
    <p>Economic literature has long argued that climate and energy policy grounded only in regulation, standards and public funding of R&amp;D is at risk of being influenced by political and administrative arbitrariness, which could raise the costs of implementation. This literature has argued that it may be more efficient to make these costs explicit through carbon taxes and carbon trading, securing the abatement of emissions in places and sectors where it is cheapest

    <p>In a frictionless world, a uniform world carbon price could minimize the social costs of the low-carbon transition by equating the marginal costs of abatement across all sources of emissions. This implies that investors will be able to make the right choices under perfect foresight and that domestic and international compensatory transfers offset the adverse distributional impacts of higher energy prices and their consequences on economic activity. In the absence of such transfers, carbon prices would have to be differentiated by jurisdiction

    </p>
    <p>Obstacles to enforcing a uniform world carbon price in the short run would not necessarily crowd out explicit national carbon pricing, for three reasons. First, a uniform carbon price would limit an emissions rebound resulting from a higher consumption of energy services enabled by efficiency gains, if energy prices do not change (

    <p>For energy efficiency, these instruments include end-use standards and labelling for domestic appliances, lighting, electric motors, water heaters and air-conditioners. They are often complemented by mandatory efficiency labels to attract consumers' attention and stimulate the manufacture of more efficient products (

    </p>
    <p>In every country the design of carbon pricing policy implies a balance between incentivizing low-carbon behaviour and mitigating the adverse distributional consequences of higher energy prices 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="65,272.27,75.12,30.21,11.20;65,56.69,87.12,42.21,11.20" target="#b369" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Combet et al., 2010)</ref>. Carbon taxes can offset these effects if their revenues are redistributed through rebates to poor households. Other options include the reduction of value-added taxes for basic products or direct benefit transfers to enable poverty reduction (see for South Africa and 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="65,131.60,135.11,75.71,11.20" target="#b692" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Grottera et al. (2016)</ref> for Brazil). This is possible because higher-income households pay more in absolute terms, even though their carbon tax burden is a relatively smaller share of their income (Arze del

    </p>
    <p>Ultimately, the pace of increase of carbon prices would depend on the pace at which they can be embedded in a consistent set of fiscal and social policies. This is specifically critical in the context of the 1.5°C limit ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="65,78.98,231.10,84.72,11.20" target="#b1202" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Michaelowa et al., 2018)</ref>. This is why, after a quarter century of academic debate and experimentation (see IPCC WGIII reports since the SAR), a gap persists with respect to 'switching carbon prices' needed to trigger rapid changes. In 2016, only 15% of global emissions are covered by carbon pricing, three-quarters of which with prices below 10 USD tCO 2 −1 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="65,133.85,291.18,66.92,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(World Bank, 2016)</ref>. This is too low to outweigh the 'noise' from the volatility of oil markets (in the range of 100 USD tCO 2 −1 over the past decade), of other price dynamics (interest rates, currency exchange rates and real estate prices) and of regulatory policies in energy, transportation and industry. For example, the dynamics of mobility depend upon a trade-off between housing prices and transportation costs in which the price of real estate and the inert endowments in public transport play as important a role as liquid fuel prices (

    <p>Explicit carbon prices remain a necessary condition of ambitious climate policies, and some authors highlight the potential benefit brought by coordination among groups of countries (

They are a necessary 'lubricant' through fiscal reforms or direct compensating transfers to accommodate the general equilibrium effects of higher energy prices but may not suffice to trigger the low-carbon transition because of a persistent 'implementation gap' between the aspirational carbon prices and those that can practically be enforced. When systemic changes, such as those needed for 1.5°C-consistent pathways, are at play on many dimensions of development, price levels 'depend on the path and the path depends on political decisions'

    <p>In combination with the funding of public research institutes, grants or subsidies also support R&amp;D, where risk and the uncertainty about long-term perspectives can reduce the private sector's willingness to invest in low-emission innovation (see also Section 4.4.4). Subsidies can take the form of rebates on value-added tax (VAT), of direct support to investments (e.g., renewable energy or refurbishment of buildings) or feed-in tariffs

They can be provided by the public budget, via consumption levies, or via the revenues of carbon taxes or pricing. Fee-bates, introduced in some countries (e.g., for cars), have had a neutral impact on public budgets by incentivizing low-emission products and penalizing high-emission ones

    <p>All policy instruments can benefit from information campaigns (e.g., TV ads) tailored to specific end-users. A vast majority of public campaigns on energy and climate have been delivered through mass-media channels and advertising-based approaches (

Hence, decarbonizing an investment portfolio is not synonymous with investing massively in low-emission infrastructure. Scaling up climate-friendly financial products may depend upon a business context conducive to the reduction of the riskweighted capital costs of low-emission projects. The typical leverage of public funding mechanisms for low-emission investment is low (2 to 4) compared with other sectors (10 to 15) (

    <div class="head">Financial challenge for basic needs and adaptation finance</div>
    <p>Adaptation finance is difficult to quantify for two reasons. The first is that it is very difficult to isolate specific investment needs to enhance climate resilience from the provision of basic infrastructure that are currently underinvested 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="67,144.04,531.17,40.40,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(IMF, 2014;</ref>

The UNEP (2016) estimate of investment needs on adaptation in developing countries between 140-300 billion USD yr −1 in 2030, a major part being investment expenditures that are complementary with SDGrelated investments focused on universal access to infrastructure and services and meeting basic needs. Many climate-adaptation-centric financial incentives are relevant to non-market services, offering fewer opportunities for market revenues while they contribute to creating resilience to climate impacts.
    </p>
    <p>Hence, adaptation investments and the provision of basic needs would typically have to be supported by national and sub-national government budgets together with support from overseas development assistance and multilateral development banks

    <div class="head">Towards integrated policy packages and innovative forms of financial cooperation</div>
    <p>Carbon prices, regulation and standards, improved information and appropriate financial instruments can work synergistically to meet the challenge of 'making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development', as in Article 2 in the Paris Agreement.</p>
    <p>There is growing attention to the combination of policy instruments that address three domains of action: behavioural changes, economic optimization and long-term strategies ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="67,451.25,507.16,57.23,11.20" target="#b695" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Grubb et al., 2014</ref>). For example, de-risking low-emission investments would result in higher volumes of low-emission investments, and would in turn lead to a lower switching price for the same climate ambition 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="67,446.74,543.16,82.81,11.20" target="#b772" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Hirth and Steckel, 2016</ref>). In the reverse direction, higher explicit carbon prices may generate more low-emission projects for a given quantum of de-risking. For example, efficiency standards for housing can increase the efficacy of carbon prices and overcome the barriers coming from the high discount rates used by households ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="67,359.85,603.15,53.53,11.20" target="#b1372" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Parry et al., 2014</ref>), while explicit and notional carbon prices can lower the risk of arbitrary standards. The calibration of innovative financial instruments to notional carbon prices could encourage large multinational companies to increase their level of internal carbon prices 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="67,315.21,651.14,43.55,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(UNEP, 2016)</ref>. These notional prices could be higher than explicit carbon prices because they redirect new hardware investments without an immediate impact on existing capital stocks and associated interests.
    </p>
    <p>Literature, however, shows that conflicts between poorly articulated policy instruments can undermine their efficiency ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="67,516.08,711.14,44.92,11.20;67,315.21,723.14,50.69,11.20" target="#b1043" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Lecuyer and Quirion, 2013;</ref>

    </p>
    <p>As has been illustrated in Europe, commitment uncertainty and lack of credibility of regulation have consistently led to low carbon prices in the case of the EU Emission Trading System ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="68,207.44,75.17,54.55,11.20" target="#b971" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Koch et al., 2014</ref>

A comparative study shows how these conflicts can be avoided by policy packages that integrate many dimensions of public policies and are designed to match institutional and social context of each country and region ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="68,78.72,123.17,63.98,11.20" target="#b131" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Bataille et al., 2015</ref>).
    </p>
    <p>Even though policy packages depend upon domestic political processes, they might not reinforce the NDCs at a level consistent with the 1.5°C transition without a conducive international setting where international development finance plays a critical role. Section 4.4.1 explores the means of mainstreaming climate finance in the current evolution of the lending practices of national and multilateral banks 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="68,51.02,219.15,46.36,11.20" target="#b109" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Badré, 2018)</ref>. This could facilitate the access of developing countries to loans via bond markets at low interest rates, encouragement of the emergence of new business models for infrastructure, and encouragement of financial markets to support small-scale investments ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="68,100.22,267.15,74.76,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Déau and Touati, 2017</ref>).
    </p>
    <p>These financial innovations may involve non-state public actors like cities and regional public authorities that govern infrastructure investment, enable energy and food systems transitions and manage urban dynamics

    </p>
    <p>The evolution of global climate financial cooperation may involve central banks, financial regulatory authorities, and multilateral and commercial banks. There are still knowledge gaps about the form, structure and potential of these arrangements. They could be viewed as a form of a burden-sharing between high-, medium-and lowincome countries to enhance the deployment of ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and new forms of 'common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities'

    <div class="head">Assessing Feasibility of Options for Accelerated Transitions</div>
    <p>Chapter 2 shows that 1.5°C-consistent pathways involve rapid, global climate responses to reach net zero emissions by mid-century or earlier. Chapter 3 identifies climate change risks and impacts to which the world would need to adapt during these transitions and additional risks and impacts during potential 1.5°C overshoot pathways. The feasibility of these pathways is contingent upon systemic change (Section 4.3) and enabling conditions (Section 4.4), including policy packages. This section assesses the feasibility of options (technologies, actions and measures) that form part of global systems under transition that make up 1.5°C-consistent pathways.</p>
    <p>Following the assessment framework developed in Chapter 1, economic and technological, institutional and socio-cultural, and environmental and geophysical feasibility are considered and applied to system transitions (Sections 4.3.1-4.3.4), overarching adaptation options (Section 4.3.5) and carbon dioxide removal (CDR) options (Section 4.3.7). This is done to assess the multidimensional feasibility of mitigation and adaptation options that have seen considerable development and change since AR5. In the case of adaptation, the assessed AR5 options are typically clustered. For example, all options related to energy infrastructure resilience, independently of the generation source, are categorized as 'resilience of power infrastructure'. 
     <ref type="table" coords="68,309.55,195.14,23.33,11.20" target="#tab_8" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Table 4</ref>.10 presents sets of indicators against which the multidimensional feasibility of individual adaptation options relevant to warming of 1.5°C, and mitigation options along 1.5°C-consistent pathways, is assessed.
    </p>
    <p>The feasibility assessment takes the following steps. First, each of the mitigation and adaptation options is assessed along the relevant indicators grouped around six feasibility dimensions: economic, technological, institutional, socio-cultural, environmental/ecological and geophysical. Three types of feasibility groupings were assessed from the underlying literature: first, if the indicator could block the feasibility of this option; second, if the indicator has neither a positive nor a negative effect on the feasibility of the option or the evidence is mixed; and third, if the indicator does not pose any barrier to the feasibility of this option. The full assessment of each option under each indicator, including the literature references on which the assessment is based, can be found in supplementary materials 4.SM.4.2 and 4.SM.4.3. When appropriate, it is indicated that there is no evidence (NE), limited evidence (LE) or that the indicator is not applicable to the option (NA).</p>
    <p>Next, for each feasibility dimension and option, the overall feasibility for a given dimension is assessed as the mean of combined scores of the relevant underlying indicators and classified into 'insignificant barriers' (2.5 to 3), 'mixed or moderate but still existent barriers' (1.5 to 2.5) or 'significant barriers' (below 1.5) to feasibility. Indicators assessed as NA, LE or NE are not included in this overall assessment (see supplementary material 4.SM.4.1 for the averaging and weighing guidance).</p>
    <p>The results are summarized in

    <p>A three-step process of independent validation and discussion by authors was undertaken to make this assessment as robust as possible within the scope of this Special Report. It must, however, be recognized that this is an indicative assessment at global scale, and both policy and implementation at regional, national and local level would need to adapt and build on this knowledge, within the particular local context and constraints. Some contextual factors are indicated in the rightmost column in

    <p>An assessment of the degree to which examples of 1.5°C-relevant mitigation options face barriers to implementation, and on which contexts this depends, is summarized in 
     <ref type="table" coords="69,198.98,531.17,27.93,11.20" target="#tab_8" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Table 4.</ref>11. An explanation of the approach is given in Section 4.5.1 and in supplementary material 4.SM.4.1. Selected options were mapped onto system transitions and clustered through an iterative process of literature review, expert feedback, and responses to reviewer comments. The detailed assessment and the literature underpinning the assessment can be found in supplementary material 4.SM.4.2.
    </p>
    <p>The feasibility framework in Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1 highlights that the feasibility of mitigation and adaptation options depends on many factors. Many of those are captured in the indicators in 
     <ref type="table" coords="69,265.21,651.16,23.46,11.20" target="#tab_8" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Table 4</ref>.10, but many depend on the specific context in which an option features. This Special Report did not have the mandate, space or the literature base to undertake a regionally specific assessment. Hence the assessment is caveated as providing a broad indication of the likely global barriers, ignoring significant regional diversity. Regional and context-specific literature is also just emerging as is noted in the knowledge gaps

The 'context' column indicates which contextual factors may affect the feasibility of an option, including regional differences. For instance, solar irradiation in an area impacts the cost-effectiveness of solar photovoltaic energy, so solar irradiation is mentioned in this column.

    <p>The feasibility assessment highlights six dimensions that could help inform an agenda that could be addressed by the areas discussed in Section 4.4: governance, behaviour and lifestyles, innovation, enhancing institutional capacities, policy and finance. For instance, Section 4.4.3 on behaviour offers strategies for addressing public acceptance problems, and how changes can be more effective when communication and actions relate to people's values. This section synthesizes the findings in Section 4.4 in an attempt to link them to the assessment in 
     <ref type="table" coords="69,523.24,591.16,23.95,11.20" target="#tab_8" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Table 4</ref>.11. The literature on which the discussion is based is found in Section 4.4.
    </p>
    <p>From Section 4.4, including the case studies presented in the Boxes 4.1 to 4.10, several main messages can be constructed. For instance, governance would have to be multilevel and engaging different actors, while being efficient, and choosing the form of cooperation based on the specific systemic challenge or option at hand. If institutional capacity for financing and governing the various transitions is not urgently built, many countries would lack the ability to change pathways from a high-emission scenario to a low-or zero-emission scenario. 
     <ref type="table" coords="70,70.73,49.50,3.64,9.52" target="#tab_8" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">4</ref>.11 | Feasibility assessment of examples of 1.5°C-relevant mitigation options, with dark shading signifying the absence of barriers in the feasibility dimension, moderate shading indicating that, on average, the dimension does not have a positive or negative effect on the feasibility of the option, or the evidence is mixed, and faint shading the presence of potentially blocking barriers. No shading means that the literature found was not sufficient to make an assessment. Evidence and agreement assessment is undertaken at the option level. The context column on the far right indicates how the assessment might change if contextual factors were different. For the methodology and literature basis, see supplementary material 4.SM.4.1 and 4.SM.4.2. Abbreviations used: Ec: Economic -Tec: Technological -Inst: Institutional -Soc: Socio-cultural -Env: Environmental/Ecological -Geo: Geophysical to applying general-purpose technologies to mitigation purposes. If this is not managed, some reduction in emissions could happen autonomously, but it may not lead to a 1.5°C-consistent pathway. International cooperation on technology, including technology transfer where this does not happen autonomously, is needed and can help create innovation capabilities in all countries that allow them to operate, maintain, adapt and regulate a portfolio of mitigation technologies. Case studies in the various subsections highlight the opportunities and challenges of doing this in practice. They indicate that it can be done in specific circumstances, which can be created.
    </p>
    <p>A combination of behaviour-oriented pricing policies and financing options can help change technologies and social behaviour as it would challenge the existing, high-emission socio-technical regime on multiple levels across feasibility characteristics. For instance, for dietary change, combining supply-side measures with value-driven communication and economic instruments may help make a lasting transition, while an economic instrument, such as enhanced prices or taxation, on its own may not be as robust.</p>
    <p>Governments could benefit from enhanced carbon prices, as a price and innovation incentive and also a source of additional revenue to correct distributional effects and subsidize the development of new, costeffective negative-emission technology and infrastructure. However, there is high evidence and medium agreement that pricing alone is insufficient. Even if prices rise significantly, they typically incentivize incremental change, but typically fail to provide the impetus for private actors to take the risk of engaging in the transformational changes that would be needed to limit warming to 1.5°C. Apart from the incentives to change behaviour and technology, financial systems are an indispensable element of a systemic transition. If financial markets do not acknowledge climate risk and the risk of transitions, regulatory financial institutions, such as central banks, could intervene.</p>
    <p>Strengthening implementation revolves around more than addressing barriers to feasibility. A system transition, be it in energy, industry, land or a city, requires changing the core parameters of a system. These relate, as introduced in Section 4.2 and further elaborated in Section 4.4, to how actors cooperate, how technologies are embedded, how resources are linked, how cultures relate and what values people associate with the transition and the current regime.</p>

    <div class="head">Implementing Adaptation</div>
    <p>Article 7 of the Paris Agreement provides an aspirational global goal for adaptation, of 'enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience, and reducing vulnerability' 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="71,406.80,591.17,54.22,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(UNFCCC, 2016)</ref>. Adaptation implementation is gathering momentum in many regions, guided by national NDC's and national adaptation plans (see Cross-Chapter Box 11 in this Chapter).
    </p>
    <p>Operationalizing adaptation in a set of regional environments on pathways to a 1.5°C world requires strengthened global and differentiated regional and local capacities. It also needs rapid and decisive adaptation actions to reduce the costs and magnitude of potential climate impacts ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="71,318.87,687.16,62.58,11.20" target="#b1858" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Vergara et al., 2015</ref>).
    </p>
    <p>This could be facilitated by: (i) enabling conditions, especially improved governance, economic measures and financing (Section 4.4); (ii) enhanced clarity on adaptation options to help identify strategic priorities, sequencing and timing of implementation (Section 4.3); (iii) robust monitoring and evaluation frameworks; and (iv) political leadership (

    <p>This section summarizes the feasibility (defined in Cross-Chapter Box 3,

     <ref type="table" coords="72,236.79,183.17,27.88,11.20" target="#tab_8" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Table 4</ref>.12). The options assessed respond to risks and impacts identified in Chapter 3. They were selected based on options identified in AR5 ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="72,254.40,207.17,42.72,11.20;72,51.02,219.17,14.97,11.20" target="#b1301" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Noble et al., 2014</ref>), focusing on those relevant to 1.5°C-compatible pathways, where sufficient literature exists. Selected options were mapped onto system transitions and clustered through an iterative process of literature review, expert feedback, and responses to reviewer comments.
    </p>
    <p>Besides gaps in the literature around crucial adaptation questions on the transition to a 1.5°C world (Section 4.6), there is inadequate current literature to undertake a spatially differentiated assessment (Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1). There are also limited baselines for exposure, vulnerability and risk to help policy and implementation prioritization. Hence, the compiled results can at best provide a broad framework to inform policymaking. Given the bottom-up nature of most adaptation implementation evidence, care needs to be taken in generalizing these findings.</p>
    <p>Options are considered as part of a systemic approach, recognizing that no single solution exists to limit warming to 1.5°C and adapting to its impacts. To respond to the local and regional context -and to synergies and trade-offs between adaptation, mitigation and sustainable development -packages of options suited to local enabling conditions can be implemented. 
     <ref type="table" coords="72,51.02,483.13,27.28,11.20" target="#tab_8" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Table 4</ref>.12 summarizes the feasibility assessment through its six dimensions with levels of evidence and agreement and indicates how the feasibility of an adaptation option may be differentiated by certain contextual factors (last column).
    </p>
    <p>When considered jointly, the description of adaptation options (Section 4.3), the feasibility assessment (summarized in 
     <ref type="table" coords="72,234.50,555.12,27.04,11.20" target="#tab_8" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Table 4</ref>.12), and discussion of enabling conditions (Section 4.4) show us how options can be implemented and lead towards transformational adaptation if and when needed.
    </p>
    <p>The adaptation options for energy system transitions focus on existing power infrastructure resilience and water management, when required, for any type of generation source. These options are not sufficient for the far-reaching transformations required in the energy sector, which have tended to focus on technologies to shift from a fossil-based to a renewable energy system

There is also need for integration of such energy system transitions with social-ecological systems transformations to increase the resilience of the energy sector, for which appropriate enabling conditions, such as for technological innovations, are fundamentally important. Institutional capacities can be enhanced by expanding the role of actors as transformation catalysts

Strengthening policy instruments and regulatory frameworks and enhancing multilevel governance that focuses on resilience components can help secure these transitions

    </p>
    <p>For land and ecosystem transitions, the options of conservation agriculture, efficient irrigation, agroforestry, ecosystem restoration and avoided deforestation, and coastal defence and hardening have between medium and robust evidence with medium to high agreement. The other options assessed have limited or no evidence across one or more of the feasibility dimensions. Community-based adaptation is assessed as having medium evidence and high agreement to face scaling barriers. Scaling community-based adaptation may require structural changes, implying the need for transformational adaptation in some regions. This would involve enhanced multilevel governance and institutional capacities by enabling anticipatory and flexible decisionmaking systems that access and develop collaborative networks (

    <div class="head">Synergies and Trade-Offs between Adaptation and Mitigation</div>
    <p>Implementing a particular mitigation or adaptation option may affect the feasibility and effectiveness of other mitigation and adaptation options. Supplementary Material 4.SM.5.1 provides examples of possible positive impacts (synergies) and negative impacts (trade-offs) of mitigation options for adaptation. For example, renewable energy sources such as wind energy and solar PV combined with electricity storage can increase resilience due to distributed grids, thereby enhancing both mitigation and adaptation. Yet, as another example, urban densification may reduce GHG emissions, enhancing mitigation, but can also intensify heat island effects and inhibit restoration of local ecosystems if not accounted for, thereby increasing adaptation challenges.</p>
    <p>The Maladaptive actions could increase the risk of adverse climate-related outcomes. For example, biofuel targets could lead to indirect land use change and influence local food security, through a shift in land use abroad in response to increased domestic biofuel demand, increasing global GHG emissions rather than decreasing them.</p>
    <p>Various options enhance both climate change mitigation and adaptation, and would hence serve two 1.5°C-related goals: reducing emissions while adapting to the associated climate change. Examples of such options are reforestation, urban and spatial planning, and land and water management.</p>
    <p>Synergies between mitigation and adaptation may be enhanced, and trade-offs reduced, by considering enabling conditions (Section 4.4), while trade-offs can be amplified when enabling conditions are not considered (C.A.

For example, information that is tailored to the personal situation of individuals and communities, including climate services that are credible and targeted at the point of decision-making, can enable and promote both mitigation and adaptation actions (Section 4.4.3). Similarly, multilevel governance and community participation, respectively, can enable and promote both adaptation and mitigation actions (Section 4.4.1).

    <div class="head">FAQ 4.1 | What Transitions could Enable Limiting Global Warming to 1.5°C?</div>
    <p>Summary: In order to limit warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, the world would need to transform in a number of complex and connected ways. While transitions towards lower greenhouse gas emissions are underway in some cities, regions, countries, businesses and communities, there are few that are currently consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Meeting this challenge would require a rapid escalation in the current scale and pace of change, particularly in the coming decades. There are many factors that affect the feasibility of different adaptation and mitigation options that could help limit warming to 1.5°C and with adapting to the consequences.</p>
    <p>There are actions across all sectors that can substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This Special Report assesses energy, land and ecosystems, urban and infrastructure, and industry in developed and developing nations to see how they would need to be transformed to limit warming to 1.5°C. Examples of actions include shifting to low-or zero-emission power generation, such as renewables; changing food systems, such as diet changes away from land-intensive animal products; electrifying transport and developing 'green infrastructure', such as building green roofs, or improving energy efficiency by smart urban planning, which will change the layout of many cities.</p>
    <p>Because these different actions are connected, a 'whole systems' approach would be needed for the type of transformations that could limit warming to 1.5°C. This means that all relevant companies, industries and stakeholders would need to be involved to increase the support and chance of successful implementation. As an illustration, the deployment of low-emission technology (e.g., renewable energy projects or a bio-based chemical plants) would depend upon economic conditions (e.g., employment generation or capacity to mobilize investment), but also on social/cultural conditions (e.g., awareness and acceptability) and institutional conditions (e.g., political support and understanding).</p>
    <p>To limit warming to1.5°C, mitigation would have to be large-scale and rapid. Transitions can be transformative or incremental, and they often, but not always, go hand in hand. Transformative change can arise from growth in demand for a new product or market, such that it displaces an existing one. This is sometimes called 'disruptive innovation'. For example, high demand for LED lighting is now making more energy-intensive, incandescent lighting near-obsolete, with the support of policy action that spurred rapid industry innovation. Similarly, smart phones have become global in use within ten years. But electric cars, which were released around the same time, have not been adopted so quickly because the bigger, more connected transport and energy systems are harder to change. Renewable energy, especially solar and wind, is considered to be disruptive by some as it is rapidly being adopted and is transitioning faster than predicted. But its demand is not yet uniform. Urban systems that are moving towards transformation are coupling solar and wind with battery storage and electric vehicles in a more incremental transition, though this would still require changes in regulations, tax incentives, new standards, demonstration projects and education programmes to enable markets for this system to work.</p>
    <p>Transitional changes are already underway in many systems, but limiting warming to 1.5°C would require a rapid escalation in the scale and pace of transition, particularly in the next 10-20 years. While limiting warming to 1.5°C would involve many of the same types of transitions as limiting warming to 2°C, the pace of change would need to be much faster. While the pace of change that would be required to limit warming to 1.5°C can be found in the past, there is no historical precedent for the scale of the necessary transitions, in particular in a socially and economically sustainable way. Resolving such speed and scale issues would require people's support, public-sector interventions and private-sector cooperation.</p>
    <p>Different types of transitions carry with them different associated costs and requirements for institutional or governmental support. Some are also easier to scale up than others, and some need more government support than others. Transitions between, and within, these systems are connected and none would be sufficient on its own to limit warming to 1.5°C.</p>
    <p>The 'feasibility' of adaptation and mitigation options or actions within each system that together can limit warming to 1.5°C within the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty requires careful consideration of multiple different factors. These factors include: (i) whether sufficient natural systems and resources are available to support the various options for transitioning (known as environmental feasibility); (ii) the degree to which the required technologies are developed and available (known as technological feasibility);</p>
    <p>(iii) the economic conditions and implications (known as economic feasibility); (iv) what are the implications for human behaviour and health (known as social/cultural feasibility); and (v) what type of institutional support would be needed, such as governance, institutional capacity and political support (known as institutional feasibility). An additional factor (vi -known as the geophysical feasibility) addresses the capacity of physical systems to carry the option, for example, whether it is geophysically possible to implement large-scale afforestation consistent with 1.5°C.</p>
    <p>Promoting enabling conditions, such as finance, innovation and behaviour change, would reduce barriers to the options, make the required speed and scale of the system transitions more likely, and therefore would increase the overall feasibility limiting warming to 1.5°C.</p>

    <div class="head">FAQ 4.2 | What are Carbon Dioxide Removal and Negative Emissions?</div>
    <p>Summary: Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) refers to the process of removing CO 2 from the atmosphere. Since this is the opposite of emissions, practices or technologies that remove CO 2 are often described as achieving 'negative emissions'. The process is sometimes referred to more broadly as greenhouse gas removal if it involves removing gases other than CO 2 . There are two main types of CDR: either enhancing existing natural processes that remove carbon from the atmosphere (e.g., by increasing its uptake by trees, soil, or other 'carbon sinks') or using chemical processes to, for example, capture CO 2 directly from the ambient air and store it elsewhere (e.g., underground). All CDR methods are at different stages of development and some are more conceptual than others, as they have not been tested at scale.</p>
    <p>Limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels would require unprecedented rates of transformation in many areas, including in the energy and industrial sectors, for example. Conceptually, it is possible that techniques to draw CO 2 out of the atmosphere (known as carbon dioxide removal, or CDR) could contribute to limiting warming to 1.5°C. One use of CDR could be to compensate for greenhouse gas emissions from sectors that cannot completely decarbonize, or which may take a long time to do so.</p>
    <p>If global temperature temporarily overshoots 1.5°C, CDR would be required to reduce the atmospheric concentration of CO 2 to bring global temperature back down. To achieve this temperature reduction, the amount of CO 2 drawn out of the atmosphere would need to be greater than the amount entering the atmosphere, resulting in 'net negative emissions'. This would involve a greater amount of CDR than stabilizing atmospheric CO 2 concentration -and, therefore, global temperature -at a certain level. The larger and longer an overshoot, the greater the reliance on practices that remove CO 2 from the atmosphere.</p>
    <p>There are a number of CDR methods, each with different potentials for achieving negative emissions, as well as different associated costs and side effects. They are also at differing levels of development, with some more conceptual than others. One example of a CDR method in the demonstration phase is a process known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), in which atmospheric CO 2 is absorbed by plants and trees as they grow, and then the plant material (biomass) is burned to produce bioenergy. The CO 2 released in the production of bioenergy is captured before it reaches the atmosphere and stored in geological formations deep underground on very long time scales. Since the plants absorb CO 2 as they grow and the process does not emit CO 2 , the overall effect can be to reduce atmospheric CO 2 .</p>
    <p>Afforestation (planting new trees) and reforestation (replanting trees where they previously existed) are also considered forms of CDR because they enhance natural CO 2 'sinks'. Another category of CDR techniques uses chemical processes to capture CO 2 from the air and store it away on very long time scales. In a process known as direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), CO 2 is extracted directly from the air and stored in geological formations deep underground. Converting waste plant material into a charcoal-like substance called biochar and burying it in soil can also be used to store carbon away from the atmosphere for decades to centuries.</p>
    <p>There can be beneficial side effects of some types of CDR, other than removing CO 2 from the atmosphere. For example, restoring forests or mangroves can enhance biodiversity and protect against flooding and storms. But there could also be risks involved with some CDR methods. For example, deploying BECCS at large scale would require a large amount of land to cultivate the biomass required for bioenergy. This could have consequences for sustainable development if the use of land competes with producing food to support a growing population, biodiversity conservation or land rights. There are also other considerations. For example, there are uncertainties about how much it would cost to deploy DACCS as a CDR technique, given that removing CO 2 from the air requires considerable energy. </p>

    <div class="head">FAQ 4.3 | Why is Adaptation Important in a 1.5°C-Warmer World?</div>
    <p>Summary: Adaptation is the process of adjusting to current or expected changes in climate and its effects. Even though climate change is a global problem, its impacts are experienced differently across the world. This means that responses are often specific to the local context, and so people in different regions are adapting in different ways. A rise in global temperature from the current 1°C above pre-industrial levels to 1.5°C, and beyond, increases the need for adaptation. Therefore, stabilizing global temperatures at 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels would require a smaller adaptation effort than at 2°C. Despite many successful examples around the world, progress in adaptation is, in many regions, in its infancy and unevenly distributed globally.</p>
    <p>Adaptation refers to the process of adjustment to actual or expected changes in climate and its effects. Since different parts of the world are experiencing the impacts of climate change differently, there is similar diversity in how people in a given region are adapting to those impacts.</p>
    <p>The world is already experiencing the impacts from 1°C of global warming above pre-industrial levels, and there are many examples of adaptation to impacts associated with this warming. Examples of adaptation efforts taking place around the world include investing in flood defences such as building sea walls or restoring mangroves, efforts to guide development away from high risk areas, modifying crops to avoid yield reductions, and using social learning (social interactions that change understanding on the community level) to modify agricultural practices, amongst many others. Adaptation also involves building capacity to respond better to climate change impacts, including making governance more flexible and strengthening financing mechanisms, such as by providing different types of insurance.</p>
    <p>In general, an increase in global temperature from present day to 1.5°C or 2°C (or higher) above pre-industrial temperatures would increase the need for adaptation. Stabilizing global temperature increase at 1.5°C would require a smaller adaptation effort than for 2°C.</p>
    <p>Since adaptation is still in early stages in many regions, there are questions about the capacity of vulnerable communities to cope with any amount of further warming. Successful adaptation can be supported at the national and sub-national levels, with national governments playing an important role in coordination, planning, determining policy priorities, and distributing resources and support. However, given that the need for adaptation can be very different from one community to the next, the kinds of measures that can successfully reduce climate risks will also depend heavily on the local context.</p>
    <p>When done successfully, adaptation can allow individuals to adjust to the impacts of climate change in ways that minimize negative consequences and to maintain their livelihoods. This could involve, for example, a farmer switching to drought-tolerant crops to deal with increasing occurrences of heatwaves. In some cases, however, the impacts of climate change could result in entire systems changing significantly, such as moving to an entirely new agricultural system in areas where the climate is no longer suitable for current practices. Constructing sea walls to stop flooding due to sea level rise from climate change is another example of adaptation, but developing city planning to change how flood water is managed throughout the city would be an example of transformational adaptation. These actions require significantly more institutional, structural, and financial support. While this kind of transformational adaptation would not be needed everywhere in a 1.5°C world, the scale of change needed would be challenging to implement, as it requires additional support, such as through financial assistance and behavioural change. Few empirical examples exist to date.</p>
    <p>Examples from around the world show that adaptation is an iterative process. Adaptation pathways describe how communities can make decisions about adaptation in an ongoing and flexible way. Such pathways allow for pausing, evaluating the outcomes of specific adaptation actions, and modifying the strategy as appropriate. Due to their flexible nature, adaptation pathways can help to identify the most effective ways to minimise the impacts of present and future climate change for a given local context. This is important since adaptation can sometimes exacerbate vulnerabilities and existing inequalities if poorly designed. The unintended negative consequences of adaptation that can sometimes occur are known as 'maladaptation'. Maladaptation can be seen if a particular adaptation option has negative consequences for some (e.g., rainwater harvesting upstream might reduce water availability downstream) or if an adaptation intervention in the present has trade-offs in the future (e.g., desalination plants may improve water availability in the present but have large energy demands over time).</p>
    <p>While adaptation is important to reduce the negative impacts from climate change, adaptation measures on their own are not enough to prevent climate change impacts entirely. The more global temperature rises, the more frequent, severe, and erratic the impacts will be, and adaptation may not protect against all risks. Examples of where limits may be reached include substantial loss of coral reefs, massive range losses for terrestrial species, more human deaths from extreme heat, and losses of coastal-dependent livelihoods in low lying islands and coasts. Adapting to further warming requires action at national and sub-national levels and can mean different things to different people in different contexts. While transformational adaptation would not be needed everywhere in a world limited to 1.5°C warming, the scale of change needed would be challenging to implement. </p>

Institutional limitations, lack of human and financial resources, and limited long-term planning are identified as barriers to adaptation (Forster et al., 2011).</div>
   <div class="figure">Around 360 million people reside in urban coastal areas where precipitation variability is exposing inadequacies of urban infrastructure and governance, with the poor being especially vulnerable (Reckien et al., 2017) (Cross-Chapter Box 13 in Chapter 5). Urban systems have seen growing adaptation action (Revi et al., 2014b; Araos et al., 2016b; Amundsen et al., 2018). Developing cities spend more on health and agriculture-related adaptation options while developed cities spend more on energy and water (Georgeson et al., 2016). Current adaptation activities are lagging in emerging economies, which are major centres of population growth facing complex interrelated pressures on investment in health, housing and education (Georgeson et al., 2016; Reckien et al., 2017). New York, United States: Adaptation plans are undertaken across government levels, sectors and departments (NYC Parks, 2010; Vision 2020 Project Team, 2011; PlaNYC, 2013), and have been advanced by an expert science panel that is obligated by local city law to provide regular updates on policy-relevant climate science (NPCC, 2015). Federal initiatives include 2013's Rebuild By Design competition to promote resilience through infrastructural projects (HSRTF, 2013). In 2013 the Mayor's office, in response to Hurricane Sandy, published the city's adaptation strategy (PlaNYC, 2013). In 2015, the OneNYC Plan for a Strong and Just City (OneNYC Team, 2015) laid out a strategy for urban planning through a justice and equity lens. In 2017, new climate resiliency guidelines proposed that new construction must include sea level rise projections into planning and development</div>

   <div class="figure">Some of the literature on SRM appears in the forms of commentaries, policy briefs, viewpoints and opinions (e.g., (Horton et al., 2016; Keith et al., 2017; Parson, 2017). This assessment covers original research rather than viewpoints, even if the latter appear in peer-reviewed journals. SRM could reduce some of the global risks of climate change related to temperature rise (Izrael et al., 2014; MacMartin et al., 2014), rate of sea level rise (Moore et al., 2010), sea-ice loss (Berdahl et al., 2014) and frequency of extreme storms in the North Atlantic and heatwaves in Europe (Jones et al., 2018). SRM also holds risks of changing precipitation and ozone concentrations and potentially reductions in biodiversity (Pitari et al., 2014; Visioni et al., 2017a; Trisos et al., 2018). Literature only supports SRM as a supplement to deep mitigation, for example in overshoot scenarios (Smith and Rasch, 2013; MacMartin et al., 2018).</div>
   <div class="figure">-Chapter Box 10 | Solar Radiation Modification in the Context of 1 .1The general public can be characterized as oblivious to and worried about SRM (Carr et al., 2013; Parkhill et al., 2013; Wibeck et al., 2017). An emerging literature discusses public perception of SRM, showing a lack of knowledge and unstable opinions (Scheer and Renn, 2014). The perception of controllability affects legitimacy and public acceptability of SRM experiments (Bellamy et al., 2017). In Germany, laboratory work on SRM is generally approved of, field research much less so, and immediate deployment is largely rejected (Merk et al., 2015; Braun et al., 2017). Various factors could explain variations in the degree of rejection of SRM between Canada, China, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States (Visschers et al., 2017).Cross5°C Mitigation Pathways Contributing Authors: Anastasia Revokatova (Russian Federation), Heleen de Coninck (Netherlands/EU), Piers Forster (UK), Veronika Ginzburg (Russian Federation), Jatin Kala (Australia), Diana Liverman (USA), Maxime Plazzotta (France), Roland Séférian (France), Sonia I.

The inherent variability of the climate system would make it difficult to detect the efficacy or side-effects of SRM intervention when deployed in such a temporary scenario (Jackson et al., 2015).</div>

The response of global temperature to SO 2 injection, however, is uncertain and varies depending on the model parametrization and emission scenarios (Jones et al., 2011; Kravitz et al., 2011; Izrael et al., 2014; Crook et al., 2015; Niemeier and Timmreck, 2015; Tilmes et al., 2016; Kashimura et al., 2017).

It also includes interdisciplinary actions, combined adaptation and mitigation action (Göpfert et al., 2018), and science-policy partnerships (Vogel et al., 2007; Hering et al., 2014; Roberts, 2016; Figueres et al., 2017; Leal Filho et al., 2018). These partnerships are difficult to establish and sustain, but can generate trust (Cole, 2015; Jordan et al., 2015) and inclusivity that ultimately can provide durability and the realization of co-benefits for sustained rapid change (Blanchet, 2015; Ziervogel et al., 2016a).</div>
   <div class="figure">4. 4 .41.1 Institutions and their capacity to invoke far-reaching and rapid change Institutions -the rules and norms that guide human interactions (Section 4.4.2) -enable or impede the structures, mechanisms and measures that guide mitigation and adaptation. Institutions, understood as the 'rules of the game' (North, 1990), exert direct and indirect influence over the viability of 1.5°C-consistent pathways (Munck et al., 2014; Willis, 2017). Governance would be needed to support wide-scale and effective adoption of mitigation and adaptation options. Institutions and governance structures are strengthened when the principle of the 'commons' is explored as a way of sharing management and responsibilities (Ostrom et al., 1999; Chaffin et al., 2014; Young, 2016). Institutions would need to be strengthened to interact amongst themselves, and to share responsibilities for the development and implementation of rules, regulations and policies (Ostrom et al., 1999; Wejs et al., 2014; Craig et al., 2017), with the goal of ensuring that these embrace equity, justice, poverty alleviation and sustainable development, enabling a 1.5°C world (Reckien et al., 2017; Wood et al., 2017). Several authors have identified different modes of cross-stakeholder interaction in climate policy, including the role played by large multinational corporations, small enterprises, civil society and non- state actors. Ciplet et al. (2015) argue that civil society is to a great extent the only reliable motor for driving institutions to change at the pace required. Kern and Alber (2009) recognize different forms of collaboration relevant to successful climate policies beyond the local level. Horizontal collaboration (e.g., transnational city networks) and vertical collaboration within nation-states can play an enabling role (Ringel, 2017). Vertical and horizontal collaboration requires synergistic relationships between stakeholders (Ingold and Fischer, 2014; Hsu et al., 2017). The importance of community participation is emphasized in literature, and in particular the need to take into account equity and gender considerations (Chapter 5) (Graham et al., 2015; Bryan et al., 2017; Wangui and Smucker, 2017). Participation often faces implementation challenges and may not always result in better policy outcomes. Stakeholders, for example, may not view climate change as a priority and may not share the same preferences, potentially creating a policy deadlock (Preston et al., 2013, 2015; Ford et al., 2016).</div>
   <div class="figure">) (Cross-Chapter Box 11 in this chapter). Beyond a general consensus on the necessity of measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) mechanisms as a key element of a climate regime (Ford et al., 2015b; van Asselt et al., 2015), some authors emphasize different governance approaches to implement the Paris Agreement. Through the new proposed sustainable development mechanism in Article 6, the Paris Agreement allows the space to harness the lowest cost mitigation options worldwide. This may incentivize policymakers to enhance mitigation ambition by speeding up climate action as part of a 'climate regime complex' (Keohane and Victor, 2011) of loosely interrelated global governance institutions. In the Paris Agreement, the 'common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities' (CBDR-RC) principle could be expanded and revisited under a 'sharing the pie' paradigm (Ji and Sha, 2015) as a tool to open innovation processes towards alternative development pathways (Chapter 5).</div>
   <div class="figure">Adaptation policy has seen growth in some areas (Massey et al., 2014 ;2014Lesnikowski et al., 2016), although efforts to track adaptation progress are constrained by an absence of data sources on adaptation (Berrang-Ford et al., 2011; Ford and Berrang-Ford, 2016; Magnan, 2016; Magnan and Ribera, 2016). Many developing countries have made progress in formulating national policies, plans and strategies on responding to climate change. The NDCs have been identified as one such institutional mechanism (Cross-Chapter Box 11 in this Chapter) (Magnan et al., 2015; Kato and Ellis, 2016; Peters et al., 2017).</div>
   <div class="figure">(Lombardi et al., 2016). The joint action by the province and the municipalities in collaboration with the local business community could be seen as an example of multilevel governance (Lombardi et al., 2016). Researchers have investigated local forms of collaboration within local government, with the active involvement of citizens and stakeholders, and acknowledge that public acceptance is key to the successful implementation of policies (Larsen and Gunnarsson- Östling, 2009; Musall and Kuik, 2011; Pollak et al., 2011; Christoforidis et al., 2013; Pasimeni et al., 2014; Lee and Painter, 2015). Achieving ambitious targets would need leadership, enhanced multilevel governance, vision and widespread participation in transformative change (Castán Broto and Bulkeley, 2013; Rosenzweig et al., 2015; Castán Broto, 2017; Fazey et al., 2017; Wamsler, 2017; Romero-Lankao et al., 2018)</div>
   <div class="figure">There is high agreement that Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are important for the global response to climate change and represent an innovative bottom-up instrument in climate change governance (Section 4.4.1), with contributions from all signatory countries (den Elzen et al., 2016; Rogelj et al., 2016; Vandyck et al., 2016; Luderer et al., 2018; Vrontisi et al., 2018). The global emission projections resulting from full implementation of the NDCs represent an improvement compared to business as usual (Rogelj et al., 2016) and current policies scenarios to 2030 (den Elzen et al., 2016; Vrontisi et al., 2018). Most G20 economies would require new policies and actions to achieve their NDC targets (den Elzen et al., 2016; Vandyck et al., 2016; UNEP, 2017b; Kuramochi et al., 2018). 2. The effect of NDCs on global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions Several studies estimate global emission levels that would be achieved under the NDCs (e.g., den Elzen et al., 2016; Luderer et al., 2016; Rogelj et al., 2016, 2017; Vandyck et al., 2016; Rose et al., 2017; Vrontisi et al., 2018). Rogelj et al. (2016) and UNEP (2017b) concluded that the full implementation of the unconditional and conditional NDCs are expected to result in global GHG emissions of about 55 (52-58) and 53 (50-54) GtCO 2 -eq yr −1 , respectively (Cross-Chapter Box 11, Figure 1 below).</div>

   <div class="figure">Table 4 .45 provides an overview of three warming SLCFs and their emission sources, with examples of options for emission reductions and associated co-benefits. A wide range of options to reduce SLCF emissions was extensively discussed in AR5 (IPCC, 2014b). Fossil fuel and waste sector methane mitigation options have high cost-effectiveness, producing a net profit over a few years, considering market costs only. Moreover, reducing roughly one-third to one-half of all human-caused emissions has societal benefits greater than mitigation costs when considering environmental impacts only (UNEP, 2011; Höglund-Isaksson, 2012; IEA, 2017b; Shindell et al., 2017a). Since AR5, new options for methane, such as those related to shale gas, have been included in mitigation portfolios (e.g., Shindell et al., 2017a). Reducing BC emissions and co-emissions has sustainable development co-benefits, especially around human health (Stohl et al., 2015; Haines et al., 2017; Aakre et al., 2018), avoiding premature deaths and increasing crop yields (Scovronick et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2016). Additional benefits include lower likelihood of non-linear climate changes and feedbacks (Shindell et al., 2017b) and temporarily slowing down the rate of sea level rise (Hu et al., 2013). Interventions to reduce BC offer tangible local air quality benefits, increasing the likelihood of local public support (Eliasson, 2014; Venkataraman et al., 2016) (see Chapter 5, Section 5.4.2.1).

(2016b) estimate a land-use intensity of 0.3-0.5 ha tCO 2 -eq −1 yr −1 using forest residues, 0.16 ha CO 2 -eq −1 yr −1 for agricultural residues, and 0.03-0.1 ha tCO 2 -eq −1 yr −1 for purpose-grown energy crops. The average amount of BECCS in these pathways requires 25-46% of arable and permanent crop area in 2100. Land area estimates differ in scale and are not necessarily a good indicator of competition with, for example, food production, because requiring a smaller land area for the same potential could indicate that high-productivity agricultural land is used. In general, the literature shows low agreement on the availability of land (Fritz et al., 2011; see Erb et al., 2016b for recent advances). Productivity, food production and competition with other ecosystem services and land use by local communities are important factors for designing regulation. These potentials and trade-offs are not homogenously distributed across regions. However, Robledo-Abad et al. (2017) find that regions with higher potentials are understudied, given their potential contribution. Researchers have expressed the need to complement global assessments with regional, geographically explicit bottom-up studies of biomass potentials and socio-economic impacts (e.g., de Wit and Faaij, 2010; Kraxner et al., 2014; Baik et al., 2018). Energy production and land and water footprints show wide ranges in bottom-up assessments due to differences in technology, feedstock and other parameters (−1-150 EJ yr −1 of energy, 109-990 Mha, 6-79 MtN, 218-4758 km 3 yr −1 of water per GtCO 2 yr −1 ; Smith and Torn, 2013; Smith et al., 2016b; Fajardy and Mac Dowell, 2017) and are not comparable to IAM pathways which consider system effects (Bauer et al., 2018). Global impacts on nutrients and albedo are difficult to quantify (Smith et al., 2016b). BECCS competes with other land-based CDR and mitigation measures for resources (Chapter 2). There is uncertainty about the feasibility of timely upscaling (Nemet et al., 2018). CCS (see Section 4.3.1) is largely absent from the Nationally Determined Contributions (Spencer et al., 2015) and lowly ranked in investment priorities (Fridahl, 2017). Although there are dozens of small- scale BECCS demonstrations (Kemper, 2015) and a full-scale project capturing 1 MtCO 2 exists (Finley, 2014), this is well below the numbers associated with 1.5°C or 2°C-compatible pathways (IEA, 2016a; Peters et al., 2017).

Some have suggested that the governance of research and field experimentation can help clarify uncertainties surrounding deployment of SRM (Long and Shepherd, 2014; Parker, 2014; NRC, 2015c; Caldeira and Bala, 2017; Lawrence and Crutzen, 2017), and that SRM is compatible with democratic processes (Horton et al., 2018) or not (Szerszynski et al., 2013; Owen, 2014). Several possible institutional arrangements have been considered for SRM governance: under the UNFCCC (in particular under the Subsidiary Body on Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA)) or the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (UNCBD) (Honegger et al., 2013; Nicholson et al., 2018), or through a consortium of states (Bodansky, 2013; Sandler, 2017). Reasons for states to join an international governance framework for SRM include having a voice in SRM diplomacy, prevention of unilateral action by others and benefits from research collaboration (Lloyd and Oppenheimer, 2014). Alongside SBSTA, the WMO, UNESCO and UN Environment could play a role in governance of SRM (Nicholson et al., 2018). Each of these organizations has relevance with respect to the regulatory framework (Bodle et al., 2012; Williamson and Bodle, 2016). The UNCBD gives guidance that 'that no climate-related geo-engineering activities that may affect biodiversity take place' (CBD, 2010). 4.3.8.2 Economic and technological feasibility The literature on the engineering costs of SRM is limited and may be unreliable in the absence of testing or deployment. There is high agreement that costs of SAI (not taking into account indirect and social costs, research and development costs and monitoring expenses) may be in the range of 1-10 billion USD yr −1 for injection of 1-5 MtS to achieve cooling of 1-2 W m −2 (Robock et al., 2009; McClellan et al., 2012; Ryaboshapko and Revokatova, 2015; Moriyama et al., 2016), suggesting that cost-effectiveness may be high if side-effects are low </div>

It shows, for example, that conservation agriculture can reduce some GHG emissions and thus enhance mitigation, but at the same time can increase other GHG emissions, thereby reducing mitigation potential. As another example, agroforestry can reduce GHG emissions through reduced deforestation and fossil fuel consumption but has a lower carbon sequestration potential compared with natural and secondary forest. </div>
