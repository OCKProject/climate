<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengthening and Implementing the Global Response</head><p>Chapter 4</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Executive Summary</head><p>Limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels would require transformative systemic change, integrated with sustainable development. Such change would require the upscaling and acceleration of the implementation of farreaching, multilevel and cross-sectoral climate mitigation and addressing barriers. Such systemic change would need to be linked to complementary adaptation actions, including transformational adaptation, especially for pathways that temporarily overshoot 1.5°C (medium evidence, high agreement) {Chapter 2, Chapter 3, 4.2.1, 4.4.5, 4.5}. Current national pledges on mitigation and adaptation are not enough to stay below the Paris Agreement temperature limits and achieve its adaptation goals. While transitions in energy efficiency, carbon intensity of fuels, electrification and land-use change are underway in various countries, limiting warming to 1.5°C will require a greater scale and pace of change to transform energy, land, urban and industrial systems globally. {4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3, 4.4, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in this Chapter}</head><p>Although multiple communities around the world are demonstrating the possibility of implementation consistent with 1.5°C pathways {Boxes 4.1-4.10}, very few countries, regions, cities, communities or businesses can currently make such a claim (high confidence). To strengthen the global response, almost all countries would need to significantly raise their level of ambition. Implementation of this raised ambition would require enhanced institutional capabilities in all countries, including building the capability to utilize indigenous and local knowledge (medium evidence, high agreement). In developing countries and for poor and vulnerable people, implementing the response would require financial, technological and other forms of support to build capacity, for which additional local, national and international resources would need to be mobilized (high confidence). However, public, financial, institutional and innovation capabilities currently fall short of implementing far-reaching measures at scale in all countries (high confidence). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>System Transitions</head><p>The energy system transition that would be required to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial conditions is underway in many sectors and regions around the world (medium evidence, high agreement). The political, economic, social and technical feasibility of solar energy, wind energy and electricity storage technologies has improved dramatically over the past few years, while that of nuclear energy and carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) in the electricity sector have not shown similar improvements. {4.3.1}</p><p>Electrification, hydrogen, bio-based feedstocks and substitution, and, in several cases, carbon dioxide capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) would lead to the deep emissions reductions required in energy-intensive industries to limit warming to 1.5°C. However, those options are limited by institutional, economic and technical constraints, which increase financial risks to many incumbent firms (medium evidence, high agreement). Energy efficiency in industry is more economically feasible and helps enable industrial system transitions but would have to be complemented with greenhouse gas (GHG)-neutral processes or carbon dioxide removal (CDR) to make energy-intensive industries consistent with 1.5°C (high confidence).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>{4.3.1, 4.3.4}</head><p>Global and regional land-use and ecosystems transitions and associated changes in behaviour that would be required to limit warming to 1.5°C can enhance future adaptation and land-based agricultural and forestry mitigation potential. Such transitions could, however, carry consequences for livelihoods that depend on agriculture and natural resources {4.3.2, CrossChapter Box 6 in Chapter 3}. Alterations of agriculture and forest systems to achieve mitigation goals could affect current ecosystems and their services and potentially threaten food, water and livelihood security. While this could limit the social and environmental feasibility of land-based mitigation options, careful design and implementation could enhance their acceptability and support sustainable development objectives (medium evidence, medium agreement). {4.3.2, 4.5.3}</p><p>Changing agricultural practices can be an effective climate adaptation strategy. A diversity of adaptation options exists, including mixed crop-livestock production systems which can be a cost-effective adaptation strategy in many global agriculture systems (robust evidence, medium agreement). Improving irrigation efficiency could effectively deal with changing global water endowments, especially if achieved via farmers adopting new behaviours and waterefficient practices rather than through large-scale infrastructural interventions (medium evidence, medium agreement). Well-designed adaptation processes such as community-based adaptation can be effective depending upon context and levels of vulnerability. {4.3.2, 4.5.3}</p><p>Improving the efficiency of food production and closing yield gaps have the potential to reduce emissions from agriculture, reduce pressure on land, and enhance food security and future mitigation potential (high confidence). Improving productivity of existing agricultural systems generally reduces the emissions intensity of food production and offers strong synergies with rural development, poverty reduction and food security objectives, but options to reduce absolute emissions are limited unless paired with demand-side measures. Technological innovation including biotechnology, with adequate safeguards, could contribute to resolving current feasibility constraints and expand the future mitigation potential of agriculture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>{4.3.2, 4.4.4}</head><p>Shifts in dietary choices towards foods with lower emissions and requirements for land, along with reduced food loss and waste, could reduce emissions and increase adaptation options (high confidence). Decreasing food loss and waste and changing dietary behaviour could result in mitigation and adaptation (high confidence) by reducing both emissions and pressure on land, with significant co-benefits for food security, human health and sustainable development {4.3.2, 4.4.5, 4.5.2, 4.5.3, 5.4.2}, but evidence of successful policies to modify dietary choices remains limited.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mitigation and Adaptation Options and Other Measures</head><p>A mix of mitigation and adaptation options implemented in a participatory and integrated manner can enable rapid, systemic transitions -in urban and rural areas -that are necessary elements of an accelerated transition consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Such options and changes are most effective when aligned with economic and sustainable development, and when local and regional governments are supported by national governments {4.3.3, 4.4.1, 4.4.3}. Various mitigation options are expanding rapidly across many geographies. Although many have development synergies, not all income groups have so far benefited from them. Electrification, end-use energy efficiency and increased share of renewables, amongst other options, are lowering energy use and decarbonizing energy supply in the built environment, especially in buildings. Other rapid changes needed in urban environments include demotorization and decarbonization of transport, including the expansion of electric vehicles, and greater use of energy-efficient appliances (medium evidence, high agreement). Technological and social innovations can contribute to limiting warming to 1.5°C, for example, by enabling the use of smart grids, energy storage technologies and general-purpose technologies, such as information and communication technology (ICT) that can be deployed to help reduce emissions. Feasible adaptation options include green infrastructure, resilient water and urban ecosystem services, urban and peri-urban agriculture, and adapting buildings and land use through regulation and planning (medium evidence, medium to high agreement). {4.3.3, 4.4.3, 4.4.4}</p><p>Synergies can be achieved across systemic transitions through several overarching adaptation options in rural and urban areas.</p><p>Investments in health, social security and risk sharing and spreading are cost-effective adaptation measures with high potential for scaling up (medium evidence, medium to high agreement). Disaster risk management and education-based adaptation have lower prospects of scalability and cost-effectiveness (medium evidence, high agreement) but are critical for building adaptive capacity. {4.3.5, 4.5.3}</p><p>Converging adaptation and mitigation options can lead to synergies and potentially increase cost-effectiveness, but multiple trade-offs can limit the speed of and potential for scaling up. Many examples of synergies and trade-offs exist in all sectors and system transitions. For instance, sustainable water management (high evidence, medium agreement) and investment in green infrastructure (medium evidence, high agreement) to deliver sustainable water and environmental services and to support urban agriculture are less cost-effective than other adaptation options but can help build climate resilience. Achieving the governance, finance and social support required to enable these synergies and to avoid trade-offs is often challenging, especially when addressing multiple objectives, and attempting appropriate sequencing and timing of interventions. {4.3.2, 4.3.4, 4.4.1, 4.5.2, 4.5.3, 4.5.4}</p><p>Though CO 2 dominates long-term warming, the reduction of warming short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs), such as methane and black carbon, can in the short term contribute significantly to limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Reductions of black carbon and methane would have substantial co-benefits (high confidence), including improved health due to reduced air pollution. This, in turn, enhances the institutional and sociocultural feasibility of such actions. Reductions of several warming SLCFs are constrained by economic and social feasibility (low evidence, high agreement). As they are often co-emitted with CO <ref type="bibr" coords="4,501.68,346.02,2.66,6.53">2</ref> , achieving the energy, land and urban transitions necessary to limit warming to 1.5°C would see emissions of warming SLCFs greatly reduced. {2.3.3.2, 4.3.6}</p><p>Most CDR options face multiple feasibility constraints, which differ between options, limiting the potential for any single option to sustainably achieve the large-scale deployment required in the 1.5°C-consistent pathways described in Chapter 2 (high confidence). Those 1.5°C pathways typically rely on bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), afforestation and reforestation (AR), or both, to neutralize emissions that are expensive to avoid, or to draw down CO 2 emissions in excess of the carbon budget {Chapter 2}. Though BECCS and AR may be technically and geophysically feasible, they face partially overlapping yet different constraints related to land use. The land footprint per tonne of CO 2 removed is higher for AR than for BECCS, but given the low levels of current deployment, the speed and scales required for limiting warming to 1.5°C pose a considerable implementation challenge, even if the issues of public acceptance and absence of economic incentives were to be resolved (high agreement, medium evidence). The large potential of afforestation and the co-benefits if implemented appropriately (e.g., on biodiversity and soil quality) will diminish over time, as forests saturate (high confidence). The energy requirements and economic costs of direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS) and enhanced weathering remain high (medium evidence, medium agreement). At the local scale, soil carbon sequestration has co-benefits with agriculture and is cost-effective even without climate policy (high confidence). Its potential feasibility and cost-effectiveness at the global scale appears to be more limited. {4.3.7}</p><p>Uncertainties surrounding solar radiation modification (SRM) measures constrain their potential deployment. These uncertainties include: technological immaturity; limited physical <ref type="bibr" coords="5,547.72,755.52,13.26,10.12">317</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4</head><p>Strengthening and Implementing the Global Response Chapter 4 understanding about their effectiveness to limit global warming; and a weak capacity to govern, legitimize, and scale such measures. Some recent model-based analysis suggests SRM would be effective but that it is too early to evaluate its feasibility. Even in the uncertain case that the most adverse side-effects of SRM can be avoided, public resistance, ethical concerns and potential impacts on sustainable development could render SRM economically, socially and institutionally undesirable (low agreement, medium evidence).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>{4.3.8, Cross-Chapter Box 10 in this chapter}</head><p>Enabling Rapid and Far-Reaching Change</p><p>The speed of transitions and of technological change required to limit warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels has been observed in the past within specific sectors and technologies {4.2.2.1}. But the geographical and economic scales at which the required rates of change in the energy, land, urban, infrastructure and industrial systems would need to take place are larger and have no documented historic precedent (limited evidence, medium agreement). To reduce inequality and alleviate poverty, such transformations would require more planning and stronger institutions (including inclusive markets) than observed in the past, as well as stronger coordination and disruptive innovation across actors and scales of governance. {4.3, 4.4}</p><p>Governance consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C and the political economy of adaptation and mitigation can enable and accelerate systems transitions, behavioural change, innovation and technology deployment (medium evidence, medium agreement). For 1.5°C-consistent actions, an effective governance framework would include: accountable multilevel governance that includes nonstate actors, such as industry, civil society and scientific institutions; coordinated sectoral and cross-sectoral policies that enable collaborative multi-stakeholder partnerships; strengthened global-to-local financial architecture that enables greater access to finance and technology; addressing climate-related trade barriers; improved climate education and greater public awareness; arrangements to enable accelerated behaviour change; strengthened climate monitoring and evaluation systems; and reciprocal international agreements that are sensitive to equity and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). System transitions can be enabled by enhancing the capacities of public, private and financial institutions to accelerate climate change policy planning and implementation, along with accelerated technological innovation, deployment and upkeep. {4.4.1, 4.4.2, 4.4.3, 4.4.4}</p><p>Behaviour change and demand-side management can significantly reduce emissions, substantially limiting the reliance on CDR to limit warming to 1.5°C {Chapter 2, 4.4.3}. Political and financial stakeholders may find climate actions more costeffective and socially acceptable if multiple factors affecting behaviour are considered, including aligning these actions with people's core values (medium evidence, high agreement). Behaviour-and lifestylerelated measures and demand-side management have already led to emission reductions around the world and can enable significant future reductions (high confidence). Social innovation through bottomup initiatives can result in greater participation in the governance of systems transitions and increase support for technologies, practices and policies that are part of the global response to limit warming to 1.5°C . {Chapter 2, 4.4.1, 4.4.3, <ref type="figure" coords="5,425.85,87.10,27.04,11.20" target="#fig_6">Figure 4</ref>.3}</p><p>This rapid and far-reaching response required to keep warming below 1.5°C and enhance the capacity to adapt to climate risks would require large increases of investments in low-emission infrastructure and buildings, along with a redirection of financial flows towards low-emission investments (robust evidence, high agreement). An estimated mean annual incremental investment of around 1.5% of global gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) for the energy sector is indicated between 2016 and 2035, as well as about 2.5% of global GFCF for other development infrastructure that could also address SDG implementation. Though quality policy design and effective implementation may enhance efficiency, they cannot fully substitute for these investments. {2.5.2, 4.2.1, 4.4.5}</p><p>Enabling this investment requires the mobilization and better integration of a range of policy instruments that include the reduction of socially inefficient fossil fuel subsidy regimes and innovative price and non-price national and international policy instruments. These would need to be complemented by de-risking financial instruments and the emergence of long-term low-emission assets. These instruments would aim to reduce the demand for carbon-intensive services and shift market preferences away from fossil fuel-based technology. Evidence and theory suggest that carbon pricing alone, in the absence of sufficient transfers to compensate their unintended distributional crosssector, cross-nation effects, cannot reach the incentive levels needed to trigger system transitions (robust evidence, medium agreement). But, embedded in consistent policy packages, they can help mobilize incremental resources and provide flexible mechanisms that help reduce the social and economic costs of the triggering phase of the transition (robust evidence, medium agreement). {4.4.3, 4.4.4, 4.4.5}</p><p>Increasing evidence suggests that a climate-sensitive realignment of savings and expenditure towards low-emission, climate-resilient infrastructure and services requires an evolution of global and national financial systems. Estimates suggest that, in addition to climate-friendly allocation of public investments, a potential redirection of 5% to 10% of the annual capital revenues 1 is necessary for limiting warming to 1.5°C {4.4.5, <ref type="table" coords="5,315.21,555.17,25.39,11.20">Table 1</ref> in Box 4.8}. This could be facilitated by a change of incentives for private day-to-day expenditure and the redirection of savings from speculative and precautionary investments towards longterm productive low-emission assets and services. This implies the mobilization of institutional investors and mainstreaming of climate finance within financial and banking system regulation. Access by developing countries to low-risk and low-interest finance through multilateral and national development banks would have to be facilitated (medium evidence, high agreement). New forms of publicprivate partnerships may be needed with multilateral, sovereign and sub-sovereign guarantees to de-risk climate-friendly investments, support new business models for small-scale enterprises and help households with limited access to capital. Ultimately, the aim is to 1 Annual capital revenues are paid interests plus an increase of asset value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Accelerating the Global Response to Climate Change</head><p>This chapter discusses how the global economy and socio-technical and socio-ecological systems can transition to 1.5°C-consistent pathways and adapt to warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>In the context of systemic transitions, the chapter assesses adaptation and mitigation options, including carbon dioxide removal (CDR), and potential solar radiation modification (SRM) remediative measures (Section 4.3), as well as the enabling conditions that would be required for implementing the rapid and far-reaching global response of limiting warming to 1.5°C (Section 4.4), and render the options more or less feasible (Section 4.5).</p><p>The impacts of a 1.5°C-warmer world, while less than in a 2°C-warmer world, would require complementary adaptation and development action, typically at local and national scale. From a mitigation perspective, 1.5°C-consistent pathways require immediate action on a greater and global scale so as to achieve net zero emissions by midcentury, or earlier (Chapter 2). This chapter and Chapter 5 highlight the potential that combined mitigation, development and poverty reduction offer for accelerated decarbonization.</p><p>The global context is an increasingly interconnected world, with the human population growing from the current 7.6 billion to over 9 billion by mid-century ( <ref type="bibr" coords="7,114.78,363.14,52.39,11.20" target="#b1818">UN DESA, 2017)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Implications for Implementation of 1.5°C-Consistent Pathways</head><p>The 1.5°C-consistent pathways assessed in Chapter 2 form the basis for the feasibility assessment in section 4.5. A wide range of 1.5°C-consistent pathways from integrated assessment modelling (IAM), supplemented by other literature, are assessed in Chapter 2 (Sections 2.1, 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5). The most common feature shared by these pathways is their requirement for faster and more radical changes compared to 2°C and higher warming pathways.</p><p>A variety of 1.5°C-consistent technological options and policy targets is identified in the assessed modelling literature (Sections 2.3, 2.4, 2.5). These technology and policy options include energy demand reduction, greater penetration of low-emission and carbon-free technologies as well as electrification of transport and industry, and reduction of land-use change. Both the detailed integrated modelling pathway literature and a number of broader sectoral and bottom-up studies provide examples of how these sectoral technological and policy characteristics can be broken down sectorally for 1.5°C-consistent pathways (see <ref type="table" coords="8,361.32,183.15,23.70,11.20" target="#tab_8">Table 4</ref>.1).</p><p>Both the integrated pathway literature and the sectoral studies agree on the need for rapid transitions in the production and use of energy across various sectors, to be consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1.1">Challenges and Opportunities for Mitigation Along the Reviewed Pathways</head><p>Greater scale, speed and change in investment patterns. There is agreement in the literature reviewed by Chapter 2 that staying below 1.5°C would entail significantly greater transformation in terms of energy systems, lifestyles and investments patterns compared to 2°C-consistent pathways. Yet there is limited evidence and low agreement regarding the magnitudes and costs of the investments (Sections 2.5.1, 2.5.2 and 4.4.5). Based on the IAM literature reviewed in Chapter 2, climate policies in line with limiting warming to 1.5°C would require a marked upscaling of supply-side energy system investments between now and mid-century, reaching levels of between 1.6-3.8 trillion USD yr −1 globally with an average of about 3.5 trillion USD yr −1 over 2016-2050 (see <ref type="figure" coords="9,167.91,219.17,27.61,11.20">Figure 2</ref>.27). This can be compared to an average of about 3.0 trillion USD yr −1 over the same period for 2°C-consistent pathways (also in <ref type="figure" coords="9,173.77,243.17,27.00,11.20">Figure 2</ref>.27).</p><p>Not only the level of investment but also the type and speed of sectoral transformation would be impacted by the transitions associated with 1.5°C-consistent pathways. IAM literature projects that investments in low-emission energy would overtake fossil fuel investments globally by 2025 in 1.5°C-consistent pathways (Chapter 2, Section 2.5.2). The projected low-emission investments in electricity generation allocations over the period 2016-2050 are: solar (0.09-1.0 trillion USD yr −1 ), wind (0.1-0.35 trillion USD yr −1 ), nuclear (0.1-0.25 trillion USD yr −1 ), and transmission, distribution, and storage (0.3-1.3 trillion USD yr −1 ). In contrast, investments in fossil fuel extraction and unabated fossil electricity generation along a 1.5°C-consistent pathway are projected to drop by 0.3-0.85 trillion USD yr −1 over the period 2016-2050, with investments in unabated coal generation projected to halt by 2030 in most 1.5°C-consistent pathways (Chapter 2, Section 2.5.2). Estimates of investments in other infrastructure are currently unavailable, but they could be considerably larger in volume than solely those in the energy sector (Section 4.4.5).</p><p>Greater policy design and decision-making implications. The 1.5°C-consistent pathways raise multiple challenges for effective policy design and responses to address the scale, speed, and pace of mitigation technology, finance and capacity building needs. These policies and responses would also need to deal with their distributional implications while addressing adaptation to residual climate impacts (see Chapter 5). The available literature indicates that 1.5°C-consistent pathways would require robust, stringent and urgent transformative policy interventions targeting the decarbonization of energy supply, electrification, fuel switching, energy efficiency, land-use change, and lifestyles (Chapter 2, Section 2.5, 4.4.2, 4.4.3). Examples of effective approaches to integrate mitigation with adaptation in the context of sustainable development and to deal with distributional implications proposed in the literature include the utilization of dynamic adaptive policy pathways <ref type="bibr" coords="9,120.02,663.14,86.77,11.20" target="#b707">(Haasnoot et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,210.97,663.14,73.61,11.20" target="#b1160">Mathy et al., 2016)</ref> and transdisciplinary knowledge systems ( <ref type="bibr" coords="9,190.26,675.14,86.87,11.20" target="#b152">Bendito and Barrios, 2016</ref>). Yet, even with good policy design and effective implementation, 1.5°C-consistent pathways would incur higher costs. Projections of the magnitudes of global economic costs associated with 1.5°C-consistent pathways and their sectoral and regional distributions from the currently assessed literature are scant, yet suggestive. For example, IAM simulations assessed in Chapter 2 project (with a probability greater than 50%) that marginal abatement costs, typically represented in IAMs through a carbon price, would increase by about 3-4 times by 2050 under a 1.5°C-consistent pathway compared to a 2°C-consistent pathway (Chapter 2, Section 2.5.2, <ref type="figure" coords="9,450.74,111.13,29.50,11.20">Figure 2</ref>.26). Managing these costs and distributional effects would require an approach that takes account of unintended cross-sector, cross-nation, and cross-policy trade-offs during the transition ( <ref type="bibr" coords="9,428.43,147.12,64.68,11.20" target="#b477">Droste et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,494.72,147.12,66.62,11.20" target="#b1731">Stiglitz et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,315.21,159.12,44.24,11.20" target="#b1432">Pollitt, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,361.19,159.12,44.61,11.20">Sands, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,407.54,159.12,72.81,11.20" target="#b1654">Siegmeier et al., 2018</ref>).</p><p>Greater sustainable development implications.

Nonetheless, literature on potential synergies and trade-offs between 1.5°C-consistent mitigation pathways and sustainable development dimensions is emerging (Chapter 2, Section 2.5.3, Chapter 5, Section 5.4). Areas of potential trade-offs include reduction in final energy demand in relation to SDG 7 (the universal clean energy access goal) and increase of biomass production in relation to land use, water resources, food production, biodiversity and air quality (Chapter 2, Sections 2.4.3, 2.5.3). Strengthening the institutional and policy responses to deal with these challenges is discussed in Section 4.4 together with the linkage between disruptive changes in the energy sector and structural changes in other infrastructure (transport, building, water and telecommunication) sectors. A more in-depth assessment of the complexity and interfaces between 1.5°C-consistent pathways and sustainable development is presented in Chapter 5.</p></div>

Those projected changes in climate extremes under both warming levels, however, depend on the emissions pathways, as they have different greenhouse gas (GHG)/ aerosol forcing ratios. Impacts are sector-, system-and region-specific, as described in Chapter 3. For example, precipitation-related impacts reveal distinct regional differences (Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.3, 3.3.4, 3.3.5, 3.4.2). Similarly, regional reduction in water availability and the lengthening of regional dry spells have negative implications for agricultural yields depending on crop types and world regions (see for example Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.4, 3.4.2, 3.4.6).</p><p>Adaptation helps reduce impacts and risks. However, adaptation has limits. Not all systems can adapt, and not all impacts can be reversed (Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5). For example, tropical coral reefs are projected to be at risk of severe degradation due to temperatureinduced bleaching (Chapter 3, Box 3.4).</p></div>

They also form the basis for the mitigation and adaptation feasibility assessments in Section 4.5. Section 4.3.8 discusses solar radiation modification methods.</p><p>This section emphasizes that no single solution or option can enable a global transition to 1.5°C-consistent pathways or adapting to projected impacts. Rather, accelerating change, much of which is already starting or underway, in multiple global systems, simultaneously and at different scales, could provide the impetus for these system transitions. The feasibility of individual options as well as the potential for synergies and reducing trade-offs will vary according to context and the local enabling conditions. These are explored at a high level in Section 4.5. Policy packages that bring together multiple enabling conditions can provide building blocks for a strategy to scale up implementation and intervention impacts.</p></div>

This section focuses on CCS in the fossil-fuelled power sector; Section 4.3.4 discusses CCS in non-power industry, and Section 4.3.7 discusses bioenergy with CCS (BECCS). Section 2.4.2 puts the cumulative CO 2 stored from fossil-fuelled power at 410 (199-470 interquartile range) GtCO 2 over this century. Such modelling suggests that CCS in the power sector can contribute to cost-effective achievement of emission reduction requirements for limiting warming to 1.5°C. CCS may also offer employment and political advantages for fossil fuel-dependent economies ( , but may entail more limited co-benefits than other mitigation options (that, e.g., generate power) and therefore relies on climate policy incentives for its business case and economic feasibility.

Such a scale-up would also imply that potential short-term negative responses by populations and interest groups, which could block these changes from the outset, would need to be prevented or overcome. This section describes the size and nature of investment needs and the financial challenge over the coming two decades in the context of 1.5°C warmer worlds, assesses the potential and constraints of three categories of policy instruments that respond to the challenge, and explains the conditions for using them synergistically. The policy and finance instruments discussed in this section relate to Section 4.4.1 (on governance) and other Sections in 4.4.</p><p>4.4.5.1 The core challenge: cost-efficiency, coordination of expectations and distributive effects <ref type="bibr" coords="60,309.54,303.18,27.26,11.20">Box 4.8</ref> shows that the average estimate by seven models of annual investment needs in the energy system is around 2.38 trillion USD2010 (1.38 to 3.25) between 2016 and 2035. This represents between 2.53% (1.6-4%) of the world GDP in market exchange rates (MER) and 1.7% of the world GDP in purchasing power parity (PPP). OECD investment assessments for a 2°C-consistent transition suggest that including investments in transportation and in other infrastructure would increase the investment needs by a factor of three. Other studies not included in Box 4.8, in particular by the World Economic Forum (WEF, 2013) and the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate <ref type="bibr" coords="60,480.35,411.16,42.43,11.20">(GCEC, 2014</ref>) confirm these orders of magnitude of investment.</p><p>The average increase of investment in the energy sector resulting from Box 4.8 represents a mean value of 1.5% of the total world investment compared with the baselines scenario in MER and a little over 1% in PPP.

But, consumption at a constant savings/consumption ratio can alternatively be funded by shifting savings towards productive adaptation and mitigation investments, instead of real-estate sector and liquid financial products. This response depends upon whether it is possible to close the global investment funding gap for infrastructure that potentially inhibits growth, through structural changes in the global economy. In this case, investing more in infrastructure would not be an incremental cost in terms of development and welfare <ref type="bibr" coords="60,430.90,639.16,38.46,11.20">(IMF, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="60,471.00,639.16,67.05,11.20" target="#b703">Gurara et al., 2017)</ref> 9 A calculation in MER tends indeed to underestimate the world GDP and its growth by giving a lower weight to fast-growing developing countries, whereas a calculation in PPP tends to overestimate it.

Accounting for this trend in modelling is challenging.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Box 4.8 | Investment Needs and the Financial Challenge of Limiting Warming to 1.5°C</head><p>Peer-reviewed literature that estimates the investment needs over the next two decades to scale up the response to limit warming to 1.5°C is very limited (see Section 4.6). This box attempts to bring together available estimates of the order of magnitude of these investments, after consultation with the makers of those estimates, to provide the context for global and national financial mobilization policy and related institutional arrangements. <ref type="table" coords="61,74.69,147.17,25.03,11.20">Table 1</ref> in this box presents mean annual investments up to 2035, based on three studies (after clarifying their scope and harmonizing their metrics): an ensemble of four integrated assessment models (here denoted IAM, see Chapter 2), an Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) scenario for a 2°C limit (OECD, 2017a) and scenarios from the International Energy Agency (IEA, 2016c). All three sources provide estimates for the energy sector for various mitigation scenarios. They give a mean value of 2.38 trillion USD of yearly investments in the energy sector over the period, with minimum and maximum values of 1.38 and 3.25 respectively. We also report the OECD estimate for 2°C because it also covers transportation and other infrastructure (water, sanitation, and telecommunication), which are essential to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 7 on clean energy access, and enhance the adaptive capacity to climate change.</p><p>The mean incremental share of annual energy investments to stay well below 2°C is 0.36% (between 0.2-1%) of global GDP between 2016 and 2035. Since total world investment (also called gross fixed capital formation (GFCF)) is about 24% of global GDP, the estimated incremental energy investments between a baseline and a 1.5°C transition would be approximately 1.5% (between 0.8-4.2%) of projected total world investments. As the higher ends of these ranges reflect pessimistic assumptions in 1.5°C-consistent pathways on technological change, the implementation of policies to accelerate technical change (see the remainder of Section 4.4.5) could lower the probability of higher incremental investment.</p><p>If we assume the amounts of investments given by the OECD for transportation and other infrastructure for warming of 2°C to be a lower limit for an 1.5°C pathway, then total incremental investments for all sectors for a 1.5°C-consistent pathway would be estimated at 2.4% of total world investments. This total incremental investment reaches 2.53% if the investments in transportation are scaled up proportionally with the investments in the energy sector and if all other investments are kept constant. Comparing this 2.4% or 2.53% number for all sectors to the 1.5% number for energy only (see previous paragraph) suggests that the investments in sectors other than energy contribute significantly to incremental world investments, even though a comprehensive study or estimate of these investments for a 1.5°C limit is not available.</p><p>The issue, from a macroeconomic perspective, is whether these investments would be funded by higher savings at the costs of lower consumption. This would mean a 0.5% reduction in consumption for the energy sector for 1.5°C. Note that for a 2°C scenario, this  reduction would be 0.8% if we account for the investment needs of all infrastructure sectors. Assuming conversely a constant savings ratio, this would necessitate reallocating existing capital flows towards infrastructure. In addition to these incremental investments, the amount of redirected investments is relevant from a financial perspective. In the reported IAM energy sector scenarios, about three times the incremental investments is redirected. There is no such assessment for the other sectors. The OECD report suggests that these ratios might be higher.</p><p>These orders of magnitude of investment can be compared to the available statistics of the global stock of 386 trillion USD of financial capital, which consists of 100 trillion USD in bonds <ref type="bibr" coords="62,288.11,159.16,49.80,11.20">(SIFMA, 2017)</ref>, around 60 trillion USD in equity (World Bank, 2018b), and 226 trillion USD of loans managed by the banking system <ref type="bibr" coords="62,293.90,171.16,34.81,11.20">(IIF, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="62,330.13,171.16,65.80,11.20">World Bank, 2018a</ref>). The long-term rate of return (interest plus increase of shareholder value) is about 3% on bonds, 5% on bank lending and 7% on equity, leading to a weighted mean return on capital of 3.4% in real terms (5.4% in nominal terms). Using 3.4% as a lower bound and 5% as a higher bound (following <ref type="bibr" coords="62,511.48,195.16,26.53,11.20;62,69.02,207.16,16.70,11.20" target="#b1412">Piketty, 2014</ref>) and taking a conservative assumption that global financial capital grows at the same rate as global GDP, the estimated yearly financial capital revenues would be between 16.8 and 25.4 trillion USD.</p><p>Assuming that a quarter of these investments comes from public funds (as estimated by the World Bank; World Bank, 2018a), the amount of private resources needed to enable an energy sector transition is between 3.3% and 5.3% of annual capital income and between 5.6% and 8.3% of these revenues for all infrastructure to meet the 2°C limit and the SDGs.</p><p>Since the financial system has limited fungibility across budget lines, changing the partitioning of investments is not a zero-sum game. An effective policy regime could encourage investment managers to change their asset allocation. Part of the challenge may lie in increasing the pace of financing of low-emission assets to compensate for a possible 38% decrease, by 2035, in the value of fossil fuel assets (energy sector and indirect holdings in downstream uses like automobiles) ( <ref type="bibr" coords="62,402.93,327.14,67.82,11.20" target="#b1194">Mercure et al., 2018</ref>). Investments in other (non-energy system) infrastructure to meet development and poverty-reduction goals can strengthen the adaptive capacity to address climate change, and are difficult to separate from overall sustainable development and poverty-alleviation investments . The magnitude of potential climate change damages is related to pre-existing fragility of impacted societies ( <ref type="bibr" coords="62,86.62,447.17,77.20,11.20" target="#b717">Hallegatte et al., 2007)</ref>.

If emission-free assets emerge fast enough to compensate for the devaluation of high-emission assets, the sum of the required incremental and redirected investments in the energy sector would (up to 2035) be equivalent to between 3.3% and 5.3% of the average annual revenues of the private capital stock (see <ref type="bibr" coords="62,283.22,591.15,13.56,11.20;62,51.02,603.15,14.04,11.20">Box 4.8)</ref> and to between 5.6% and 8.3%, including all infrastructure investments.</p><p>The interplay between mechanisms of financial intermediation and the private risk-return calculus is a major barrier to realizing these investments ( <ref type="bibr" coords="62,120.97,663.14,62.28,11.20" target="#b1665">Sirkis et al., 2015)</ref>.

Yet there are multiple constraints to a system-wide energy transition. Lower costs of some supply-and demand-side options do not always result in a proportional decrease in energy system costs. The adoption of alternative options can be slowed down by increasing costs of decommissioning existing infrastructure, the inertia of market structures, cultural habits and risk-adverse user behaviour (see Sections 4.4.1 to 4.4.3). Learning-by-doing processes and R&amp;D can accelerate the cost-efficiency of low-emission technology but often imply higher early-phase costs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.1">Assessing Feasibility of Options for Accelerated Transitions</head><p>Chapter 2 shows that 1.5°C-consistent pathways involve rapid, global climate responses to reach net zero emissions by mid-century or earlier. Chapter 3 identifies climate change risks and impacts to which the world would need to adapt during these transitions and additional risks and impacts during potential 1.5°C overshoot pathways. The feasibility of these pathways is contingent upon systemic change (Section 4.3) and enabling conditions (Section 4.4), including policy packages. This section assesses the feasibility of options (technologies, actions and measures) that form part of global systems under transition that make up 1.5°C-consistent pathways.</p><p>Following the assessment framework developed in Chapter 1, economic and technological, institutional and socio-cultural, and environmental and geophysical feasibility are considered and applied to system transitions (Sections 4.3.1-4.3.4), overarching adaptation options (Section 4.3.5) and carbon dioxide removal (CDR) options (Section 4.3.7). This is done to assess the multidimensional feasibility of mitigation and adaptation options that have seen considerable development and change since AR5. In the case of adaptation, the assessed AR5 options are typically clustered. For example, all options related to energy infrastructure resilience, independently of the generation source, are categorized as 'resilience of power infrastructure'. <ref type="table" coords="68,309.55,195.14,23.33,11.20" target="#tab_8">Table 4</ref>.10 presents sets of indicators against which the multidimensional feasibility of individual adaptation options relevant to warming of 1.5°C, and mitigation options along 1.5°C-consistent pathways, is assessed.</p><p>The feasibility assessment takes the following steps. First, each of the mitigation and adaptation options is assessed along the relevant indicators grouped around six feasibility dimensions: economic, technological, institutional, socio-cultural, environmental/ecological and geophysical. Three types of feasibility groupings were assessed from the underlying literature: first, if the indicator could block the feasibility of this option; second, if the indicator has neither a positive nor a negative effect on the feasibility of the option or the evidence is mixed; and third, if the indicator does not pose any barrier to the feasibility of this option. The full assessment of each option under each indicator, including the literature references on which the assessment is based, can be found in supplementary materials 4.SM.4.2 and 4.SM.4.3. When appropriate, it is indicated that there is no evidence (NE), limited evidence (LE) or that the indicator is not applicable to the option (NA).</p><p>Next, for each feasibility dimension and option, the overall feasibility for a given dimension is assessed as the mean of combined scores of the relevant underlying indicators and classified into 'insignificant barriers' (2.5 to 3), 'mixed or moderate but still existent barriers' (1.5 to 2.5) or 'significant barriers' (below 1.5) to feasibility. Indicators assessed as NA, LE or NE are not included in this overall assessment (see supplementary material 4.SM.4.1 for the averaging and weighing guidance).</p><p>The results are summarized in <ref type="table" coords="68,426.74,543.10,26.67,11.20" target="#tab_8">Table 4</ref>.11 (for mitigation options) and <ref type="table" coords="68,325.23,555.10,25.19,11.20" target="#tab_8">Table 4</ref>.12 (for adaptation options) for each of the six feasibility dimensions: where dark shading indicates few feasibility barriers; moderate shading indicates that there are mixed or moderate but still existent barriers, and light shading indicates that multiple barriers, in this dimension, may block implementation.</p><p>A three-step process of independent validation and discussion by authors was undertaken to make this assessment as robust as possible within the scope of this Special Report. It must, however, be recognized that this is an indicative assessment at global scale, and both policy and implementation at regional, national and local level would need to adapt and build on this knowledge, within the particular local context and constraints.

The detailed assessment and the literature underpinning the assessment can be found in supplementary material 4.SM.4.2.</p><p>The feasibility framework in Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1 highlights that the feasibility of mitigation and adaptation options depends on many factors. Many of those are captured in the indicators in <ref type="table" coords="69,265.21,651.16,23.46,11.20" target="#tab_8">Table 4</ref>.10, but many depend on the specific context in which an option features.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.2.2">Enabling conditions for implementation of mitigation options towards 1.5˚C</head><p>The feasibility assessment highlights six dimensions that could help inform an agenda that could be addressed by the areas discussed in Section 4.4: governance, behaviour and lifestyles, innovation, enhancing institutional capacities, policy and finance. For instance, Section 4.4.3 on behaviour offers strategies for addressing public acceptance problems, and how changes can be more effective when communication and actions relate to people's values. This section synthesizes the findings in Section 4.4 in an attempt to link them to the assessment in <ref type="table" coords="69,523.24,591.16,23.95,11.20" target="#tab_8">Table 4</ref>.11. The literature on which the discussion is based is found in Section 4.4.</p><p>From Section 4.4, including the case studies presented in the Boxes 4.1 to 4.10, several main messages can be constructed. For instance, governance would have to be multilevel and engaging different actors, while being efficient, and choosing the form of cooperation based on the specific systemic challenge or option at hand. If institutional capacity for financing and governing the various transitions is not urgently built, many countries would lack the ability to change pathways from a high-emission scenario to a low-or zero-emission scenario.   <ref type="table" coords="70,70.73,49.50,3.64,9.52" target="#tab_8">4</ref>.11 | Feasibility assessment of examples of 1.5°C-relevant mitigation options, with dark shading signifying the absence of barriers in the feasibility dimension, moderate shading indicating that, on average, the dimension does not have a positive or negative effect on the feasibility of the option, or the evidence is mixed, and faint shading the presence of potentially blocking barriers. No shading means that the literature found was not sufficient to make an assessment. Evidence and agreement assessment is undertaken at the option level. The context column on the far right indicates how the assessment might change if contextual factors were different. For the methodology and literature basis, see supplementary material 4.SM.4.1 and 4.SM.4.2. Abbreviations used: Ec: Economic -Tec: Technological -Inst: Institutional -Soc: Socio-cultural -Env: Environmental/Ecological -Geo: Geophysical  to applying general-purpose technologies to mitigation purposes. If this is not managed, some reduction in emissions could happen autonomously, but it may not lead to a 1.5°C-consistent pathway. International cooperation on technology, including technology transfer where this does not happen autonomously, is needed and can help create innovation capabilities in all countries that allow them to operate, maintain, adapt and regulate a portfolio of mitigation technologies. Case studies in the various subsections highlight the opportunities and challenges of doing this in practice. They indicate that it can be done in specific circumstances, which can be created.</p><p>A combination of behaviour-oriented pricing policies and financing options can help change technologies and social behaviour as it would challenge the existing, high-emission socio-technical regime on multiple levels across feasibility characteristics. For instance, for dietary change, combining supply-side measures with value-driven communication and economic instruments may help make a lasting transition, while an economic instrument, such as enhanced prices or taxation, on its own may not be as robust.</p><p>Governments could benefit from enhanced carbon prices, as a price and innovation incentive and also a source of additional revenue to correct distributional effects and subsidize the development of new, costeffective negative-emission technology and infrastructure. However, there is high evidence and medium agreement that pricing alone is insufficient. Even if prices rise significantly, they typically incentivize incremental change, but typically fail to provide the impetus for private actors to take the risk of engaging in the transformational changes that would be needed to limit warming to 1.5°C. Apart from the incentives to change behaviour and technology, financial systems are an indispensable element of a systemic transition. If financial markets do not acknowledge climate risk and the risk of transitions, regulatory financial institutions, such as central banks, could intervene.</p><p>Strengthening implementation revolves around more than addressing barriers to feasibility. A system transition, be it in energy, industry, land or a city, requires changing the core parameters of a system. These relate, as introduced in Section 4.2 and further elaborated in Section 4.4, to how actors cooperate, how technologies are embedded, how resources are linked, how cultures relate and what values people associate with the transition and the current regime.</p></div>

For example, renewable energy sources such as wind energy and solar PV combined with electricity storage can increase resilience due to distributed grids, thereby enhancing both mitigation and adaptation. Yet, as another example, urban densification may reduce GHG emissions, enhancing mitigation, but can also intensify heat island effects and inhibit restoration of local ecosystems if not accounted for, thereby increasing adaptation challenges.</p><p>The Maladaptive actions could increase the risk of adverse climate-related outcomes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FAQ 4.1 | What Transitions could Enable Limiting Global Warming to 1.5°C?</head><p>Summary: In order to limit warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, the world would need to transform in a number of complex and connected ways. While transitions towards lower greenhouse gas emissions are underway in some cities, regions, countries, businesses and communities, there are few that are currently consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Meeting this challenge would require a rapid escalation in the current scale and pace of change, particularly in the coming decades. There are many factors that affect the feasibility of different adaptation and mitigation options that could help limit warming to 1.5°C and with adapting to the consequences.</p><p>There are actions across all sectors that can substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This Special Report assesses energy, land and ecosystems, urban and infrastructure, and industry in developed and developing nations to see how they would need to be transformed to limit warming to 1.5°C. Examples of actions include shifting to low-or zero-emission power generation, such as renewables; changing food systems, such as diet changes away from land-intensive animal products; electrifying transport and developing 'green infrastructure', such as building green roofs, or improving energy efficiency by smart urban planning, which will change the layout of many cities.</p><p>Because these different actions are connected, a 'whole systems' approach would be needed for the type of transformations that could limit warming to 1.5°C. This means that all relevant companies, industries and stakeholders would need to be involved to increase the support and chance of successful implementation. As an illustration, the deployment of low-emission technology (e.g., renewable energy projects or a bio-based chemical plants) would depend upon economic conditions (e.g., employment generation or capacity to mobilize investment), but also on social/cultural conditions (e.g., awareness and acceptability) and institutional conditions (e.g., political support and understanding).</p><p>To limit warming to1.5°C, mitigation would have to be large-scale and rapid. Transitions can be transformative or incremental, and they often, but not always, go hand in hand. Transformative change can arise from growth in demand for a new product or market, such that it displaces an existing one. This is sometimes called 'disruptive innovation'. For example, high demand for LED lighting is now making more energy-intensive, incandescent lighting near-obsolete, with the support of policy action that spurred rapid industry innovation. Similarly, smart phones have become global in use within ten years. But electric cars, which were released around the same time, have not been adopted so quickly because the bigger, more connected transport and energy systems are harder to change. Renewable energy, especially solar and wind, is considered to be disruptive by some as it is rapidly being adopted and is transitioning faster than predicted. But its demand is not yet uniform. Urban systems that are moving towards transformation are coupling solar and wind with battery storage and electric vehicles in a more incremental transition, though this would still require changes in regulations, tax incentives, new standards, demonstration projects and education programmes to enable markets for this system to work.</p><p>Transitional changes are already underway in many systems, but limiting warming to 1.5°C would require a rapid escalation in the scale and pace of transition, particularly in the next 10-20 years. While limiting warming to 1.5°C would involve many of the same types of transitions as limiting warming to 2°C, the pace of change would need to be much faster. While the pace of change that would be required to limit warming to 1.5°C can be found in the past, there is no historical precedent for the scale of the necessary transitions, in particular in a socially and economically sustainable way. Resolving such speed and scale issues would require people's support, public-sector interventions and private-sector cooperation.</p><p>Different types of transitions carry with them different associated costs and requirements for institutional or governmental support. Some are also easier to scale up than others, and some need more government support than others. Transitions between, and within, these systems are connected and none would be sufficient on its own to limit warming to 1.5°C.</p><p>The 'feasibility' of adaptation and mitigation options or actions within each system that together can limit warming to 1.5°C within the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty requires careful consideration of multiple different factors. These factors include: (i) whether sufficient natural systems and resources are available to support the various options for transitioning (known as environmental feasibility); (ii) the degree to which the required technologies are developed and available (known as technological feasibility);</p><p>(iii) the economic conditions and implications (known as economic feasibility); (iv) what are the implications for human behaviour and health (known as social/cultural feasibility); and (v) what type of institutional support would be needed, such as governance, institutional capacity and political support (known as institutional feasibility). An additional factor (vi -known as the geophysical feasibility) addresses the capacity of physical systems to carry the option, for example, whether it is geophysically possible to implement large-scale afforestation consistent with 1.5°C.</p><p>Promoting enabling conditions, such as finance, innovation and behaviour change, would reduce barriers to the options, make the required speed and scale of the system transitions more likely, and therefore would increase the overall feasibility limiting warming to 1.5°C.</p><p>FAQ 4.1, <ref type="figure" coords="81,103.81,553.36,26.70,9.52" target="#fig_10">Figure 1</ref> | The different dimensions to consider when assessing the 'feasibility' of adaptation and mitigation options or actions within each system that can help to limit warming to 1.5°C.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FAQ 4.2 | What are Carbon Dioxide Removal and Negative Emissions?</head><p>Summary: Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) refers to the process of removing CO 2 from the atmosphere. Since this is the opposite of emissions, practices or technologies that remove CO 2 are often described as achieving 'negative emissions'. The process is sometimes referred to more broadly as greenhouse gas removal if it involves removing gases other than CO 2 . There are two main types of CDR: either enhancing existing natural processes that remove carbon from the atmosphere (e.g., by increasing its uptake by trees, soil, or other 'carbon sinks') or using chemical processes to, for example, capture CO 2 directly from the ambient air and store it elsewhere (e.g., underground). All CDR methods are at different stages of development and some are more conceptual than others, as they have not been tested at scale.</p><p>Limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels would require unprecedented rates of transformation in many areas, including in the energy and industrial sectors, for example. Conceptually, it is possible that techniques to draw CO 2 out of the atmosphere (known as carbon dioxide removal, or CDR) could contribute to limiting warming to 1.5°C. One use of CDR could be to compensate for greenhouse gas emissions from sectors that cannot completely decarbonize, or which may take a long time to do so.</p><p>If global temperature temporarily overshoots 1.5°C, CDR would be required to reduce the atmospheric concentration of CO 2 to bring global temperature back down. To achieve this temperature reduction, the amount of CO 2 drawn out of the atmosphere would need to be greater than the amount entering the atmosphere, resulting in 'net negative emissions'. This would involve a greater amount of CDR than stabilizing atmospheric CO 2 concentration -and, therefore, global temperature -at a certain level. The larger and longer an overshoot, the greater the reliance on practices that remove CO 2 from the atmosphere.</p><p>There are a number of CDR methods, each with different potentials for achieving negative emissions, as well as different associated costs and side effects. They are also at differing levels of development, with some more conceptual than others. One example of a CDR method in the demonstration phase is a process known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), in which atmospheric CO 2 is absorbed by plants and trees as they grow, and then the plant material (biomass) is burned to produce bioenergy. The CO 2 released in the production of bioenergy is captured before it reaches the atmosphere and stored in geological formations deep underground on very long time scales. Since the plants absorb CO 2 as they grow and the process does not emit CO 2 , the overall effect can be to reduce atmospheric CO 2 .</p><p>Afforestation (planting new trees) and reforestation (replanting trees where they previously existed) are also considered forms of CDR because they enhance natural CO 2 'sinks'. Another category of CDR techniques uses chemical processes to capture CO 2 from the air and store it away on very long time scales. In a process known as direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), CO 2 is extracted directly from the air and stored in geological formations deep underground. Converting waste plant material into a charcoal-like substance called biochar and burying it in soil can also be used to store carbon away from the atmosphere for decades to centuries.</p><p>There can be beneficial side effects of some types of CDR, other than removing CO 2 from the atmosphere. For example, restoring forests or mangroves can enhance biodiversity and protect against flooding and storms. But there could also be risks involved with some CDR methods. For example, deploying BECCS at large scale would require a large amount of land to cultivate the biomass required for bioenergy. This could have consequences for sustainable development if the use of land competes with producing food to support a growing population, biodiversity conservation or land rights. There are also other considerations. For example, there are uncertainties about how much it would cost to deploy DACCS as a CDR technique, given that removing CO 2 from the air requires considerable energy.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FAQ 4.3 | Why is Adaptation Important in a 1.5°C-Warmer World?</head><p>Summary: Adaptation is the process of adjusting to current or expected changes in climate and its effects. Even though climate change is a global problem, its impacts are experienced differently across the world. This means that responses are often specific to the local context, and so people in different regions are adapting in different ways. A rise in global temperature from the current 1°C above pre-industrial levels to 1.5°C, and beyond, increases the need for adaptation. Therefore, stabilizing global temperatures at 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels would require a smaller adaptation effort than at 2°C. Despite many successful examples around the world, progress in adaptation is, in many regions, in its infancy and unevenly distributed globally.</p><p>Adaptation refers to the process of adjustment to actual or expected changes in climate and its effects. Since different parts of the world are experiencing the impacts of climate change differently, there is similar diversity in how people in a given region are adapting to those impacts.</p><p>The world is already experiencing the impacts from 1°C of global warming above pre-industrial levels, and there are many examples of adaptation to impacts associated with this warming. Examples of adaptation efforts taking place around the world include investing in flood defences such as building sea walls or restoring mangroves, efforts to guide development away from high risk areas, modifying crops to avoid yield reductions, and using social learning (social interactions that change understanding on the community level) to modify agricultural practices, amongst many others. Adaptation also involves building capacity to respond better to climate change impacts, including making governance more flexible and strengthening financing mechanisms, such as by providing different types of insurance.</p><p>In general, an increase in global temperature from present day to 1.5°C or 2°C (or higher) above pre-industrial temperatures would increase the need for adaptation. Stabilizing global temperature increase at 1.5°C would require a smaller adaptation effort than for 2°C.</p><p>Since adaptation is still in early stages in many regions, there are questions about the capacity of vulnerable communities to cope with any amount of further warming. Successful adaptation can be supported at the national and sub-national levels, with national governments playing an important role in coordination, planning, determining policy priorities, and distributing resources and support. However, given that the need for adaptation can be very different from one community to the next, the kinds of measures that can successfully reduce climate risks will also depend heavily on the local context.</p><p>When done successfully, adaptation can allow individuals to adjust to the impacts of climate change in ways that minimize negative consequences and to maintain their livelihoods. This could involve, for example, a farmer switching to drought-tolerant crops to deal with increasing occurrences of heatwaves. In some cases, however, the impacts of climate change could result in entire systems changing significantly, such as moving to an entirely new agricultural system in areas where the climate is no longer suitable for current practices. Constructing sea walls to stop flooding due to sea level rise from climate change is another example of adaptation, but developing city planning to change how flood water is managed throughout the city would be an example of transformational adaptation. These actions require significantly more institutional, structural, and financial support. While this kind of transformational adaptation would not be needed everywhere in a 1.5°C world, the scale of change needed would be challenging to implement, as it requires additional support, such as through financial assistance and behavioural change. Few empirical examples exist to date.</p><p>Examples from around the world show that adaptation is an iterative process. Adaptation pathways describe how communities can make decisions about adaptation in an ongoing and flexible way. Such pathways allow for pausing, evaluating the outcomes of specific adaptation actions, and modifying the strategy as appropriate. Due to their flexible nature, adaptation pathways can help to identify the most effective ways to minimise the impacts of present and future climate change for a given local context. This is important since adaptation can sometimes exacerbate vulnerabilities and existing inequalities if poorly designed. The unintended negative consequences of adaptation that can sometimes occur are known as 'maladaptation'. Maladaptation can be seen if a particular adaptation option has negative consequences for some (e.g., rainwater harvesting upstream might reduce water availability downstream) or if an adaptation intervention in the present has trade-offs in the future (e.g., desalination plants may improve water availability in the present but have large energy demands over time).</p><p>While adaptation is important to reduce the negative impacts from climate change, adaptation measures on their own are not enough to prevent climate change impacts entirely. The more global temperature rises, the more frequent, severe, and erratic the impacts will be, and adaptation may not protect against all risks. Examples of where limits may be reached include substantial loss of coral reefs, massive range losses for terrestrial species, more human deaths from extreme heat, and losses of coastal-dependent livelihoods in low lying islands and coasts. Adapting to further warming requires action at national and sub-national levels and can mean different things to different people in different contexts. While transformational adaptation would not be needed everywhere in a world limited to 1.5°C warming, the scale of change needed would be challenging to implement. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="16,503.78,255.06,51.53,11.20;16,309.55,267.06,245.76,11.20;16,309.55,279.06,245.77,11.20;16,309.55,291.06,245.77,11.20;16,309.55,303.06,245.78,11.20;16,309.55,315.06,246.12,11.20;16,309.55,327.05,245.78,11.20;16,309.55,339.05,245.77,11.20;16,309.55,351.05,95.29,11.20"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>(Varela-Ortega et al., 2016; Herwehe and Scott, 2018; Sikka et al., 2018) as opposed to large dams which have high financial, ecological and social costs (Varela-Ortega et al., 2016).

Institutions, understood as the 'rules of the game' (North, 1990), exert direct and indirect influence over the viability of 1.5°C-consistent pathways (Munck et al., 2014; Willis, 2017). Governance would be needed to support wide-scale and effective adoption of mitigation and adaptation options. Institutions and governance structures are strengthened when the principle of the 'commons' is explored as a way of sharing management and responsibilities (Ostrom et al., 1999; Chaffin et al., 2014; Young, 2016). Institutions would need to be strengthened to interact amongst themselves, and to share responsibilities for the development and implementation of rules, regulations and policies (Ostrom et al., 1999; Wejs et al., 2014; Craig et al., 2017), with the goal of ensuring that these embrace equity, justice, poverty alleviation and sustainable development, enabling a 1.5°C world (Reckien et al., 2017; Wood et al., 2017). Several authors have identified different modes of cross-stakeholder interaction in climate policy, including the role played by large multinational corporations, small enterprises, civil society and non- state actors. Ciplet et al. (2015) argue that civil society is to a great extent the only reliable motor for driving institutions to change at the pace required. Kern and Alber (2009) recognize different forms of collaboration relevant to successful climate policies beyond the local level. Horizontal collaboration (e.g., transnational city networks) and vertical collaboration within nation-states can play an enabling role (Ringel, 2017). Vertical and horizontal collaboration requires synergistic relationships between stakeholders (Ingold and Fischer, 2014; Hsu et al., 2017). The importance of community participation is emphasized in literature, and in particular the need to take into account equity and gender considerations (Chapter 5) (Graham et al., 2015; Bryan et al., 2017; Wangui and Smucker, 2017). Participation often faces implementation challenges and may not always result in better policy outcomes. Stakeholders, for example, may not view climate change as a priority and may not share the same preferences, potentially creating a policy deadlock (Preston et al., 2013, 2015; Ford et al., 2016).</figDesc></figure>

Beyond a general consensus on the necessity of measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) mechanisms as a key element of a climate regime (Ford et al., 2015b; van Asselt et al., 2015), some authors emphasize different governance approaches to implement the Paris Agreement. Through the new proposed sustainable development mechanism in Article 6, the Paris Agreement allows the space to harness the lowest cost mitigation options worldwide. This may incentivize policymakers to enhance mitigation ambition by speeding up climate action as part of a 'climate regime complex' (Keohane and Victor, 2011) of loosely interrelated global governance institutions. In the Paris Agreement, the 'common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities' (CBDR-RC) principle could be expanded and revisited under a 'sharing the pie' paradigm (Ji and Sha, 2015) as a tool to open innovation processes towards alternative development pathways (Chapter 5).</figDesc></figure>

Many developing countries have made progress in formulating national policies, plans and strategies on responding to climate change.

The global emission projections resulting from full implementation of the NDCs represent an improvement compared to business as usual (Rogelj et al., 2016) and current policies scenarios to 2030 (den Elzen et al., 2016; Vrontisi et al., 2018). Most G20 economies would require new policies and actions to achieve their NDC targets (den Elzen et al., 2016; Vandyck et al., 2016; UNEP, 2017b; Kuramochi et al., 2018). 2. The effect of NDCs on global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions Several studies estimate global emission levels that would be achieved under the NDCs (e.g., den Elzen et al., 2016; Luderer et al., 2016; Rogelj et al., 2016, 2017; Vandyck et al., 2016; Rose et al., 2017; Vrontisi et al., 2018). Rogelj et al. (2016) and UNEP (2017b) concluded that the full implementation of the unconditional and conditional NDCs are expected to result in global GHG emissions of about 55 (52-58) and 53 (50-54) GtCO 2 -eq yr −1 , respectively (Cross-Chapter Box 11, Figure 1 below).</figDesc></figure>

emission sources, with examples of options for emission reductions 
and associated co-benefits. 

A wide range of options to reduce SLCF emissions was extensively 
discussed in AR5 (IPCC, 2014b). Fossil fuel and waste sector methane 
mitigation options have high cost-effectiveness, producing a net profit 
over a few years, considering market costs only. Moreover, reducing 
roughly one-third to one-half of all human-caused emissions has 
societal benefits greater than mitigation costs when considering 
environmental impacts only (UNEP, 2011; Höglund-Isaksson, 2012; IEA, 
2017b; Shindell et al., 2017a). Since AR5, new options for methane, 
such as those related to shale gas, have been included in mitigation 
portfolios (e.g., Shindell et al., 2017a). 

Reducing BC emissions and co-emissions has sustainable development 
co-benefits, especially around human health (Stohl et al., 2015; 
Haines et al., 2017; Aakre et al., 2018), avoiding premature deaths 
and increasing crop yields (Scovronick et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2016). 
Additional benefits include lower likelihood of non-linear climate 
changes and feedbacks (Shindell et al., 2017b) and temporarily slowing 
down the rate of sea level rise (Hu et al., 2013). Interventions to reduce 
BC offer tangible local air quality benefits, increasing the likelihood of 
local public support (Eliasson, 2014; Venkataraman et al., 2016) (see 
Chapter 5, Section 5.4.2.1). Limited interagency co-ordination, poor 
science-policy interactions (Zusman et al., 2015), and weak policy and </table></figure>

GtCO 2 -eq yr −1 by 2100, considered as a conservative deployment 
estimate for BECCS-accepting pathways consistent with 1.5°C), Smith 
et al. (2016b) estimate a land-use intensity of 0.3-0.5 ha tCO 2 -eq −1 yr −1 
using forest residues, 0.16 ha CO 2 -eq −1 yr −1 for agricultural residues, 
and 0.03-0.1 ha tCO 2 -eq −1 yr −1 for purpose-grown energy crops. The 
average amount of BECCS in these pathways requires 25-46% of 
arable and permanent crop area in 2100. Land area estimates differ 
in scale and are not necessarily a good indicator of competition with, 
for example, food production, because requiring a smaller land area for 
the same potential could indicate that high-productivity agricultural 
land is used. In general, the literature shows low agreement on the 
availability of land (Fritz et al., 2011; see Erb et al., 2016b for recent 
advances). Productivity, food production and competition with other 
ecosystem services and land use by local communities are important 
factors for designing regulation. These potentials and trade-offs are not 
homogenously distributed across regions. However, Robledo-Abad et 
al. (2017) find that regions with higher potentials are understudied, 
given their potential contribution. Researchers have expressed the 
need to complement global assessments with regional, geographically 
explicit bottom-up studies of biomass potentials and socio-economic 
impacts (e.g., de Wit and Faaij, 2010; Kraxner et al., 2014; Baik et al., 
2018). 

Energy production and land and water footprints show wide ranges 
in bottom-up assessments due to differences in technology, feedstock 
and other parameters (−1-150 EJ yr −1 of energy, 109-990 Mha, 6-79 
MtN, 218-4758 km 3 yr −1 of water per GtCO 2 yr −1 ; Smith and Torn, 
2013; Smith et al., 2016b; Fajardy and Mac Dowell, 2017) and are not 
comparable to IAM pathways which consider system effects (Bauer 
et al., 2018). Global impacts on nutrients and albedo are difficult to 
quantify (Smith et al., 2016b). BECCS competes with other land-based 
CDR and mitigation measures for resources (Chapter 2). 

There is uncertainty about the feasibility of timely upscaling (Nemet et 
al., 2018). CCS (see Section 4.3.1) is largely absent from the Nationally 
Determined Contributions (Spencer et al., 2015) and lowly ranked in 
investment priorities (Fridahl, 2017). Although there are dozens of small-
scale BECCS demonstrations (Kemper, 2015) and a full-scale project 
capturing 1 MtCO 2 exists (Finley, 2014), this is well below the numbers 
associated with 1.5°C or 2°C-compatible pathways (IEA, 2016a; 
Peters et al., 2017). Although the majority of BECCS cost estimates are

Some have 
suggested that the governance of research and field experimentation 
can help clarify uncertainties surrounding deployment of SRM (Long 
and Shepherd, 2014; Parker, 2014; NRC, 2015c; Caldeira and Bala, 
2017; Lawrence and Crutzen, 2017), and that SRM is compatible with 
democratic processes (Horton et al., 2018) or not (Szerszynski et al., 
2013; Owen, 2014). 

Several possible institutional arrangements have been considered 
for SRM governance: under the UNFCCC (in particular under the 
Subsidiary Body on Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA)) or the 
United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (UNCBD) (Honegger 
et al., 2013; Nicholson et al., 2018), or through a consortium of 
states (Bodansky, 2013; Sandler, 2017). Reasons for states to join an 
international governance framework for SRM include having a voice in 
SRM diplomacy, prevention of unilateral action by others and benefits 
from research collaboration (Lloyd and Oppenheimer, 2014). 

Alongside SBSTA, the WMO, UNESCO and UN Environment could play 
a role in governance of SRM (Nicholson et al., 2018). Each of these 
organizations has relevance with respect to the regulatory framework 
(Bodle et al., 2012; Williamson and Bodle, 2016). The UNCBD gives 
guidance that 'that no climate-related geo-engineering activities that 
may affect biodiversity take place' (CBD, 2010). 

4.3.8.2 Economic and technological feasibility 

The literature on the engineering costs of SRM is limited and may 
be unreliable in the absence of testing or deployment. There is high 
agreement that costs of SAI (not taking into account indirect and social 
costs, research and development costs and monitoring expenses) may 
be in the range of 1-10 billion USD yr −1 for injection of 1-5 MtS to 
achieve cooling of 1-2 W m −2 (Robock et al., 2009; McClellan et al., 
2012; Ryaboshapko and Revokatova, 2015; Moriyama et al., 2016),

of synergies and trade-offs of adaptation options for mitigation. It 
shows, for example, that conservation agriculture can reduce some 
GHG emissions and thus enhance mitigation, but at the same time can 
increase other GHG emissions, thereby reducing mitigation potential. 
As another example, agroforestry can reduce GHG emissions through 
reduced deforestation and fossil fuel consumption but has a lower 
carbon sequestration potential compared with natural and secondary 
forest.
