    <p>2.SM.1.1.1 Reduced-complexity climate models</p>
    <p>The 'Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change' (MAGICC6, 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="3,137.12,147.17,104.40,11.20" target="#b85" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Meinshausen et al., 2011a)</ref>, is a reducedcomplexity carbon cycle, atmospheric composition and climate model that has been widely used in prior IPCC Assessments and policy literature. This model is used with its parameter set as identical to that employed in AR5 for backwards compatibility. This model has been shown to match temperature trends very well compared to CMIP5 models ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="3,114.37,219.16,67.98,11.20" target="#b21" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Collins et al., 2013;</ref>

    </p>
    <p>The 'Finite Amplitude Impulse Response' (FAIRv1.3, 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="3,238.64,243.16,63.84,11.20" target="#b122" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Smith et al., 2018)</ref> model is similar to MAGICC but has even simpler representations of the carbon cycle and some atmospheric chemistry. Its parameter sets are based on AR5 physics with updated methane radiative forcing ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="3,88.50,291.16,69.31,11.20" target="#b33" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Etminan et al., 2016</ref>). The FAIR model is a reasonable fit to CMIP5 models for lower emissions pathways but underestimates the temperature response compared to CMIP5 models for RCP8. 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="3,272.73,315.15,29.72,11.20;3,56.69,327.15,40.25,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">5 (Smith et al., 2018)</ref>. It has been argued that its near-term temperature trends are more realistic than MAGICC ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="3,177.02,339.15,59.00,11.20" target="#b70" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Leach et al., 2018</ref>).
    </p>
    <p>The MAGICC model is used in this report to classify the different pathways in terms of temperature thresholds and its results are averaged with the FAIR model to support the evaluation of the non-CO 2 forcing contribution to the remaining carbon budget. The FAIR model is less established in the literature but can be seen as being more up to date in regards to its radiative forcing treatment. It is used in this report to help assess uncertainty in the pathway classification approach and to support the carbon budget evaluation (Chapter 2, Section 2.2 and 2.SM.1.1.2).</p>
    <p>This section analyses geophysical differences between FAIR and MAGICC to help provide confidence in the assessed climate response findings of the main report (Sections 2.2 and 2.3).</p>
    <p>There are structural choices in how the models relate emissions to concentrations and effective radiative forcing. There are also differences in their ranges of climate sensitivity, their choice of carbon cycle parameters, and how they are constrained, even though both models are consistent with AR5 ranges. Overall, their temperature trends are similar for the range of emission trajectories ( 
     <ref type="figure" coords="3,60.21,603.15,28.36,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Figure 2</ref>.1 of the main report). However, differences exist in their near-term trends, with MAGICC exhibiting stronger warming trends than FAIR (see 
     <ref type="figure" coords="3,115.34,627.15,29.59,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Figure 2</ref>.SM.1). 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="3,174.84,627.15,70.71,11.20" target="#b70" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Leach et al. (2018)</ref> also note that that MAGICC warms more strongly than current warming rates. By adjusting FAIR parameters to match those in MAGICC, more than half the difference in mean near-term warming trends can be traced to parameter choices. The remaining differences are due to choices regarding model structure 
     <ref type="figure" coords="3,152.34,687.14,30.68,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Figure 2</ref>.SM.1).
    </p>
    <p>A structural difference exists in the way the models transfer from the historical period to the future. The setup of MAGICC used for AR5 uses a parametrization that is constrained by observations of hemispheric temperatures and ocean heat uptake, as well as assessed ranges of radiative forcing consistent with AR4 ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="3,492.38,75.13,68.95,11.20;3,315.22,87.13,19.30,11.20" target="#b86" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Meinshausen et al., 2009)</ref>. From 1765 to 2005 the setup used for AR5 bases forcing on observed concentrations and uses emissions from 2006. It also ramps down the magnitude of volcanic forcing from 1995 to 2000 to give zero forcing in future scenarios, and solar forcing is fixed at 2009 values in the future. In contrast, FAIR produces a constrained set of parameters from emissions runs over the historic period using both natural and anthropogenic forcings, and then uses this set to run the emissions model with only anthropogenic emissions for the full period of analysis . Structural choices in how aerosol, CH 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="3,356.80,202.02,2.66,6.53" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">4</ref> and N 2 O are implemented in the model are apparent (see 
     <ref type="figure" coords="3,331.99,207.17,27.94,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Figure 2</ref>.SM.2). MAGICC has a weaker CH 4 radiative forcing, but a stronger total aerosol effective radiative forcing that is close to the AR4 best estimate of −1.2 Wm −2 for the total aerosol radiative forcing ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="3,347.12,243.17,70.85,11.20" target="#b35" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Forster et al., 2007)</ref>. As a result, its forcing is larger than either FAIR or the AR5 best estimate 
     <ref type="figure" coords="3,455.58,255.17,31.82,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Figure 2</ref>.SM.2), although its median aerosol forcing is well within the IPCC range ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="3,516.59,267.17,44.76,11.20;3,315.21,279.17,19.30,11.20" target="#b93" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Myhre et al., 2013)</ref>. The difference in N 2 O forcings between the models result both from a slightly downwards-revised radiative forcing estimate for N 2 O in 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="3,323.70,303.17,73.59,11.20" target="#b33" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Etminan et al. (2016)</ref> and the treatment of how the models account for natural emissions and atmospheric lifetime of N 2 O. The stronger aerosol forcing and its stronger recovery in MAGICC has the largest effect on near-term trends, with CH 4 and N 2 O also contributing to stronger warming trends in the MAGICC model.
    </p>
    <p>The transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions (TCRE) differences between the models are an informative illustration of their parametric differences 
     <ref type="figure" coords="3,430.66,399.17,31.85,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Figure 2</ref>.SM.3). In the setups used in this report, FAIR has a TCRE median of 0.38°C (5-95% range of 0.25°C to 0.57°C) per 1000 GtO 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="3,436.55,430.02,2.66,6.53" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">2</ref> and MAGICC a TCRE median of 0.47°C (5-95% range of 0.13°C to 1.02°C) per 1000 GtCO 2 . When directly used for the estimation of carbon budgets, this would make the remaining carbon budgets considerably larger in FAIR compared to MAGICC. As a result, rather than to use their budgets directly, this report bases its budget estimate on the AR5 TCRE likely (greater than 16-84%) range of 0.2°C to 0.7°C per 1000 GtCO 2 ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="3,516.32,495.18,45.02,11.20;3,315.21,507.17,16.70,11.20" target="#b21" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Collins et al., 2013</ref>) (see Section 2.SM.1.1.2).
    </p>
    <p>The summary assessment is that both models exhibit plausible temperature responses to emissions. It is too premature to say that either model may be biased. As MAGICC is more established in the literature than FAIR and has been tested against CMIP5 models, the classification of scenarios used in this report is based on MAGICC temperature projections. There is medium confidence in this classification and the likelihoods used at the boundaries could prove to underestimate the probability of staying below given temperatures thresholds if near-term temperatures in the applied setup of MAGICC turn out to be warming too strongly. However, neither model accounts for possible permafrost melting in their setup used for this report (although MAGICC does have a setting that would allow this to be included ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="3,433.64,675.15,123.56,11.20" target="#b116" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Schneider von Deimling et al., 2012</ref>), so biases in MAGICC could cancel in terms of their effect on long-term temperature targets. The veracity of these reducedcomplexity climate models is a substantial knowledge gap in the overall assessment of pathways and their temperature thresholds.
    </p>
    <p>The differences between FAIR and MAGICC have a substantial effect on their remaining carbon budgets (see 
     <ref type="figure" coords="5,212.55,63.17,30.07,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Figure 2</ref>.SM.3), and the strong near-term warming in the specific MAGICC setup applied here ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="5,60.59,87.17,59.98,11.20" target="#b70" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Leach et al., 2018</ref>) may bias its results to smaller remaining budgets (green line on 
     <ref type="figure" coords="5,110.48,99.17,28.62,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Figure 2</ref>.SM.3). Likewise, the relatively small TCRE in FAIR (compared to AR5) might bias its results to higher remaining budgets (orange line on 
     <ref type="figure" coords="5,403.33,63.16,28.09,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Figure 2</ref>.SM.3). Rather than using the entire model response, only the contribution of non-CO 2 warming from each model is used, using the method discussed next. 2.SM.1.

    <div class="head">Methods for Assessing Remaining Carbon Budgets</div>
    <p>First, the basis for the median remaining carbon budget estimate is described based on MAGICC and FAIR non-CO 2 warming contributions. This is then compared to a simple analysis approach. Lastly, the uncertainty analysis is detailed.</p>
    <p>2.SM. In WG1 AR5, TCRE was assessed to have a likely range of 0.22°C to 0.68°C per 1000 GtCO 2 . The middle of this range (0.45°C per 1000 GtCO 2 ) is taken to be the best estimate, although no best estimate was explicitly defined ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="5,139.67,723.17,67.98,11.20" target="#b21" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Collins et al., 2013;</ref>

    </p>
    <p>TCRE is diagnosed from integrations of climate models forced with CO 2 emissions only. However, the influence of other climate forcers on global temperatures should also be taken into account (see 
     <ref type="figure" coords="5,538.96,483.17,21.98,11.20;5,315.21,495.17,4.56,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Figure 3</ref> in

    </p>
    <p>The reference non-CO 2 temperature contribution (RNCTC) is defined as the median future warming due to non-CO 2 radiative forcing until the time of net zero CO 2 emissions. The RNCTC is then removed from predefined levels of future peak warming (ΔT peak ) between 0.3°C and 1.2°C. The CO 2 -only carbon budget is subsequently computed for this revised set of warming levels (ΔT peak −RNCTC).</p>
    <p>In FAIR, the RNCTC is defined as the difference in temperature between two experiments, one where all anthropogenic emissions are included and one where only CO 2 emissions are included, using the constrained parameter set. 
     <ref type="figure" coords="5,461.84,723.17,30.86,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Figure 2</ref>.SM.4). The RNCTC acts to reduce the ΔT peak by an amount of warming caused by non-CO 2 agents, which also takes into account warming effects of

The budgets are taken with respect to the 2006-2015 baseline for temperature and from 1 January 2018 for cumulative emissions. In the main report (Section 2.2), as well as in 
     <ref type="table" coords="6,248.80,567.16,24.67,11.20" target="#tab_4" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Table 2</ref>.SM.1, the estimates account for cumulative CO 2 emissions between the start of 2011 and the end of 2017 of about 290 GtCO 2 .
    </p>
    <p>2.SM.1.1.2.2 Checks on approach A simple approach to infer the carbon budget contribution from non-CO 2 forcers has been proposed based on global warming potential and is found to hold for a wide range of mitigation scenarios 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="6,275.71,663.17,21.11,11.20;6,51.02,675.17,44.68,11.20" target="#b2" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Allen et al., 2018)</ref>. This is based on an empirical relationship between peak temperature, TCRE, cumulative CO 2 emissions (G CO2 ), non-CO 2 forcing (ΔF non-CO2 ) and the Absolute Global Warming Potential of CO 2 (AGWP H (CO 2 )) over time horizon H, taken to be 100 years:
    </p>
    <div class="formula">ΔT peak ≈TCRE × (G CO2 +ΔF non-CO2 × (H/AGWP H (CO 2 )) (2.SM.1)</div>
    <p>This method reduces the budget by an amount proportional to the change in non-CO 2 forcing. To determine this non-CO 2 forcing contribution, a reference non-CO 2 forcing contribution (RNCFC) is estimated from the MAGICC and FAIR runs. The RNCFC is defined as ΔF non-CO2 in Equation 2.SM.1, which is a watts-per-metre-squared difference in the non-CO 2 effective radiative forcing between the 20 years before peak temperature is reached and 1996-2015. This provides an estimate of the non-CO 2 forcing contribution to the change in carbon budget. A similar calculation was performed for aerosol forcing in isolation (ΔF aer ) and the results showed that the weakening aerosol forcing is the largest contributor to the smaller carbon budget, compared to the CO 2 -only budget. AGWP 100 values are taken from AR5 (

Expert judgement is used to estimate the overall uncertainty and to estimate the amount of 100 GtCO 2 that is removed to account for possible missing permafrost and wetlands feedbacks (see Section 2.2)</ref>. Irrespective of the metric used to estimate global warming, the uncertainty in global warming since pre-industrial levels up to the 2006-2015 reference period as estimated in Chapter 1 is of the order of ±0.1°C (likely range). This uncertainty affects how close warming since pre-industrial levels is to the 1.5°C and 2°C limits. To illustrate this impact, the remaining carbon budgets for a range of future warming thresholds between 0.3°C and 1.2°C above present-day are analysed. The uncertainty in 2006-2015 warming compared to 1850-1900 relates to a ±250 GtCO 2 uncertainty in carbon budgets for a best-estimate TCRE.
    </p>
    <p>A measure of the uncertainty due to variations in the consistent level of non-CO 2 mitigation at the time that net zero CO 2 emissions are reached in pathways is analysed by a quantile regression of each pathway's median peak temperature against its corresponding median RNCTC (evaluated with the FAIR model), for the 5th, median and 95th percentiles of scenarios. A variation of approximately ±0.1°C around the median RNCTC is observed for median peak temperatures between 0.3° and 1.2°C above the 2006-2015 mean. This variation is equated to a ±250 GtCO 2 uncertainty in carbon budgets for a median TCRE estimate of about 0.45°C per 1000 GtCO 2 . An uncertainty of −400 to +200 GtCO 2 is associated with the non-CO 2 forcing and response. This is analysed from a regression of 5th and 95th percentile RNCTC against 5th and 95th percentile peak temperature calculated with FAIR, compared to the median RNCTC response. These uncertainty contributions are shown in

They are global in scope and typically cover sufficient sectors and sources of greenhouse gas emissions to project anthropogenic emissions and climate change. This allows them to identify the consistency of different pathways with long-term goals of limiting warming to specific levels (

IAMs can be applied in a forward-looking manner to explore internally consistent socio-economic-climate futures, often extrapolating current trends under a range of assumptions or using counterfactual "no policy" assumptions to generate baselines for subsequent climate policy analysis. They can also be used in a back-casting mode to explore the implications of climate policy goals and climate targets for systems transitions and near-to-medium-term action. In most IAM-based studies, both applications of IAMs are used concurrently

IAMs with an economic core describe consistent pricequantity relationships, where the "shadow price" of a commodity generally reflects its scarcity in the given setting. To this end, the price of greenhouse gas emissions emerging in IAMs reflects the restriction of future emissions imposed by a warming limit (Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 2, Section 2.SM.1.2.2). Such a price needs to be distinguished from suggested levels of emissions pricing in multidimensional policy contexts that are adapted to existing market environments and often include a portfolio of policy instruments (Chapter 2, Section 2.5.2) (

The 1.5°C and 2°C-consistent pathways available to this report hence do not reflect climate impacts and adaptation challenges below 1.5°C and 2°C, respectively. Pathway modelling to date is also not able to identify socio-economic benefits of avoided climate damages between 1.5°C-consistent pathways and pathways leading to higher warming levels. These limitations are important knowledge gaps (Chapter 2, Section 2.6) and are a subject of active research. Due to these limitations, the use of the integrated pathway literature in this report is concentrated on the assessment of mitigation action to limit warming to 1.5°C, while the assessment of impacts and adaptation challenges in 1.5°C-warmer worlds relies on a different body of literature (see Chapters 3 to 5).

    <p>The use of IAMs for climate policy assessments has been framed in the context of solution-oriented assessments 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="9,503.69,267.07,57.30,11.20;9,315.22,279.07,58.31,11.20" target="#b31" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Edenhofer and Kowarsch, 2015;</ref>

This approach emphasizes the exploratory nature of integrated assessment modelling to produce scenarios of internally consistent, goal-oriented futures. They describe a range of pathways that achieve long-term policy goals, and at the same time highlight trade-offs and opportunities associated with different courses of action. This literature has noted, however, that such exploratory knowledge generation about future pathways cannot be completely isolated from societal discourse, value formation and decision making and therefore needs to be reflective of its performative character ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="9,358.15,387.05,123.00,11.20" target="#b31" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Edenhofer and Kowarsch, 2015;</ref>

This suggests an interactive approach which engages societal values and user perspectives in the pathway production process. It also requires transparent documentation of IAM frameworks and applications to enable users to contextualize pathway results in the assessment process. Integrated assessment modelling results assessed in AR5 were documented in Annex II of AR5 (

It draws upon increased efforts to extend and harmonize IAM documentations (Section 2.SM.

    <div class="head">2.SM.1.2.2 Economics and Policy Assumptions in IAMs</div>
    <p>Experiments with IAMs most often create scenarios under idealized policy conditions which assume that climate change mitigation measures are undertaken where and when they are the most effective ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="9,318.72,663.17,58.70,11.20" target="#b20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Clarke et al., 2014</ref>). Such 'idealized implementation' scenarios assume that a global price on GHG emissions is implemented across all countries and all economic sectors, and rises over time through 2100 in a way that will minimize discounted economic costs. The emissions price reflects marginal abatement costs and is often used as a proxy of climate policy costs (see Chapter 2, Section 2.5.2). Scenarios developed under these assumptions are often referred to as 'least-cost' or 'costeffective' scenarios because they result in the lowest aggregate global mitigation costs when assuming that global markets and economies operate in a frictionless, idealized way ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="10,192.05,87.17,65.40,11.20" target="#b20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Clarke et al., 2014;</ref>

However, in practice, the feasibility (see Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1) of a global carbon pricing mechanism deserves careful consideration (see Chapter 4, Section 4.4). Scenarios from idealized conditions provide benchmarks for policymakers, since deviations from the idealized approaches capture important challenges for sociotechnical and economic systems and resulting climate outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>Model experiments diverging from idealized policy assumptions aim to explore the influence of policy barriers to implementation of globally cost-effective climate change mitigation, particularly in the near term. Such scenarios are often referred to as 'second-best' scenarios. They include, for instance, (i) fragmented policy regimes in which some regions champion immediate climate mitigation action (e.g., by 2020) while other regions join this effort with a delay of one or more decades 
     <ref type="figure" coords="10,104.57,267.15,3.51,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(</ref> Pricing mechanisms in IAMs are often augmented by assumptions about regulatory and behavioural climate policies in the near-to midterm ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="10,74.46,447.13,73.44,11.20" target="#b7" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Bertram et al., 2015;</ref>

The choice of GHG price trajectory to achieve a pre-defined climate goal varies across IAMs and can affect the shape of mitigation pathways. For example, assuming exponentially increasing CO 2 pricing to stay within a limited CO 2 emissions budget is consistent with efficiency considerations in an idealized economic setting but can lead to temporary overshoot of the carbon budget if carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies are available. The pricing of non-CO 2 greenhouse gases is often pegged to CO 2 pricing using their global warming potentials (mostly GWP100) as exchange rates (see Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1). This leads to stringent abatement of non-CO 2 gases in the medium-to long-term.
    </p>
    <p>The choice of economic discount rate is usually reflected in the increase of GHG pricing over time and thus also affects the timing of emissions reductions. For example, the deployment of capital-intensive abatement options like renewable energy can be pushed back by higher discount rates. IAMs make different assumptions about the discount rate, with many of them assuming a social discount rate of ca. 5% per year ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="10,72.00,675.16,60.40,11.20" target="#b20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Clarke et al., 2014</ref>). In a survey of modelling teams contributing scenarios to the database for this assessment to which 13 out of 19 teams responded, discount rate assumptions varied between 2% yr −1 and 8% yr −1 depending on whether social welfare considerations or the representation of market actor behaviour is given larger weight. Some
    </p>
    <p>IAMs assume fixed charge rates that can vary by sector, taking into account the fact that private actors require shorter time horizons to amortize their investment. The impact of the choice of discount rate on mitigation pathways is underexplored in the literature. In general, the choice of discount rate is expected to have a smaller influence on lowcarbon technology deployment schedules for tighter climate targets, as they leave less flexibility in the timing of emissions reductions. However, the introduction of large-scale CDR options might increase sensitivity again. It was shown, for example, that if a long-term CDR option like direct air capture with CCS (DACCS) is introduced in the mitigation portfolio, lower discount rates lead to more early abatement and less CDR deployment 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="10,405.04,183.16,81.93,11.20" target="#b17" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Chen and Tavoni, 2013</ref>). If discount rates vary across regions, with higher costs of capital in developing countries, industrialized countries mitigate more and developing countries less, resulting in higher overall mitigation costs compared to a case with globally uniform discounting ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="10,420.25,231.15,55.96,11.20" target="#b55" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Iyer et al., 2015</ref>). More work is also needed to study the sensitivity of the deployment schedule of lowcarbon technologies to the choice of the discount rate. However, as overall emissions reductions need to remain consistent with the choice of climate goal, mitigation pathways from detailed process-based IAMs are still less sensitive to the choice of discount rate than cost-optimal pathways from cost-benefit IAMs (see

    <p>Although model-based assessments project drastic near-, medium-and long-term transformations in 1.5°C scenarios, projections also often struggle to capture a number of hallmarks of transformative change, including disruption, innovation, and non-linear change in human behaviour (

Regular revisions and adjustments are standard for expert and model projections, for example, to account for new information such as the adoption of the Paris Agreement. Costs and deployment of mitigation technologies will differ in reality from the values assumed in the full-century trajectories of the model results. CCS and nuclear provide examples of where real-world costs have been higher than anticipated

So-called 'rebound' effects in which behavioural changes partially offset policies, such as consumers putting less effort into demand reduction when efficiency is improved, are captured to a varying, and in many cases only limited, degree in IAMs.
    </p>
    <p>There is also substantial variation in mitigation options represented in IAMs (see Section 2.SM.1.2.6) which depend on the one hand on the constraints of individual modelling frameworks and on the other hand on model development decisions influenced by modellers' beliefs and preferences (Chapter 2, Section 2.3.1.2). Further limitations can arise on the system level. For example, trade-offs between material use for energy versus other uses are not fully captured in many IAMs (e.g., petroleum for plastics, biomass for material substitution). An important consideration for the analysis of mitigation potential is the choice of (alternative) baseline(s). For example, IAMs often assume, in line with historical experience, that economic growth leads to a reduction in local air pollution as populations become richer (i.e., an environmental Kuznets curve) ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="11,185.36,435.13,55.34,11.20" target="#b105" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Rao et al., 2017</ref>). In such cases, the mitigation potential is small because reference emissions that take into account this economic development effect are already low in scenarios that see continued economic development over their modelling time horizon. Assumptions about reference emissions are important because high reference emissions lead to high perceived mitigation potentials and potential overestimates of the actual benefit, while low reference emissions lead to low perceived benefits of mitigation measures and thus less incentive to address these important climate-and air-pollutants (

    <div class="head">2.SM.1.2.4 Land Use and Bioenergy Modelling in IAMs</div>
    <p>The IAMs used in the land-use assessment in this chapter are based on the SSPs ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="11,350.52,87.17,58.56,11.20" target="#b104" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Popp et al., 2017;</ref>
     <ref type="bibr" coords="11,410.53,87.17,56.40,11.20" target="#b108" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Riahi et al., 2017</ref>) and all include an explicit land model. These land models calculate the supply of food, feed, fibre, forestry, and bioenergy products (see also Chapter 2, Box 2.1). The supply depends on the amount of land allocated to the particular good, as well as the yield for the good. Different IAMs have different means of calculating land allocation and different assumptions about yield, which is typically assumed to increase over time, reflecting technological progress in the agricultural sector (see 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="11,450.81,171.16,58.58,11.20" target="#b103" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Popp et al., 2014</ref> for examples). In these models, the supply of bioenergy (including BECCS) depends on the price and yield of bioenergy, the policy environment (e.g., any taxes or subsidies affecting bioenergy profits), and the demand for land for other purposes. Dominant bioenergy feedstocks assumed in IAMs are woody and grassy energy crops (second-generation biomass) in addition to residues. Some models implement a "food first" approach, where food demands are met before any land is allocated to bioenergy. Other models use an economic land allocation approach, where bioenergy competes with other land uses depending on profitability.
    </p>
    <p>Competition between land uses depends strongly on socio-economic drivers such as population growth and food demand, and are typically varied across scenarios. When comparing global bioenergy yields from IAMs with the bottom-up literature, care must be taken that assumptions are comparable. An in-depth assessment of the land-use components of IAMs is outside the scope of this Special Report.</p>
    <p>In all IAMs that include a land model, the land-use change emissions associated with these changes in land allocation are explicitly calculated. Most IAMs use an accounting approach to calculating land-use change emissions, similar to 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="11,453.73,411.13,81.24,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Houghton et al. (2012)</ref>. These models calculate the difference in carbon content of land due to the conversion from one type to another and then allocate that difference across time in some manner. For example, increases in forest cover will increase terrestrial carbon stock, but that increase may take decades to accumulate. If forestland is converted to bioenergy, however, those emissions will enter the atmosphere more quickly.
    </p>
    <p>IAMs often account for carbon flows and trade flows related to bioenergy separately. That is, IAMs may treat bioenergy as "carbon neutral" in the energy system, in that the carbon price does not affect the cost of bioenergy. However, these models will account for any landuse change emissions associated with the land conversions needed to produce bioenergy. Additionally, some models will separately track the carbon uptake from growing bioenergy and the emissions from combusting bioenergy (assuming it is not combined with CCS).</p>

    <div class="head">2.SM.1.3.1.1 Criteria for submission to the scenario database</div>
    <p>Scenarios submitted to the database were required to either aim at limiting warming to 1.5°C or 2°C in the long term, or to provide context for such scenarios, for example, corresponding Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and baseline scenarios without climate policy. Model results should constitute an emissions trajectory over time, with underlying socio-economic development until at least the year 2050 generated by a formal model such as a dynamic systems, energyeconomy, partial or general equilibrium or integrated assessment model.</p>
    <p>The end of the 21st century is referred to as "long term" in the context of this scenario compilation. For models with time horizons shorter than 2100, authors and/or submitting modelling teams were asked to explain how they evaluated their scenario as being consistent with 1.5°C in the long term. Ultimately, scenarios that only covered part of the 21st century could only be integrated into the assessment to a very limited degree, as they lacked the longer-term perspective. Submissions of emissions scenarios for individual regions and specific sectors were possible, but no such scenarios were received.</p>
    <p>Each scenario submission required a supporting publication in a peerreviewed journal that was accepted by 15 May 2018. Alternatively, the scenario must have been published by the same date in a report that has been determined by IPCC to be eligible grey literature (see

    <p>Categorizing scenarios according to their long-term warming impact requires reported emissions time series until the end of the century of the following species: CO 2 from energy and industrial processes, methane, nitrous oxide and sulphur. The long-term climate impact could not be assessed for scenarios not reporting these species, and these scenarios were hence not included in any subsequent analysis.</p>
    <p>For the diagnostic assessment of the climate impact of each submitted scenario, reported emissions were harmonized to historical values (base year 2010) as provided in the RCP database by applying an additive offset, which linearly decreased until 2050. For non-CO 2 emissions where this method resulted in negative values, a multiplicative offset was used instead. Emissions other than the required species that were not reported explicitly in the submitted scenario were filled from RCP2.6 (

    <p>A total of 529 scenarios were submitted to the scenario database. Of these, 14 scenarios did not report results until the end of the century and an additional 80 scenarios did not report the required emissions species. During the validation and diagnostics, 24 scenarios were excluded because of negative CO 2 emissions from the land-use sector by 2020 (see Section 2.SM.1.3). Therefore, the analysis in this report is based on 411 scenarios, of which 90 scenarios are consistent with 1.5°C at the end of the century and 132 remain below 2°C throughout the century (not including the 90 scenarios that are deemed consistent with 1.5°C).

The pathways with proxy indicator values that are neither 0 nor 1 receive a 0.5 weighting. These 0, 0.5, or 1 values are used to determine the relative achievement of specific synergies or trade-offs per SDG in each scenario, by summing each respective interaction type (synergy, trade-off, or synergy or trade-off) over all proxy indicators. Ultimately these sums are synthesized in one interaction based on the majority of sub-interactions (synergy, tradeoff, or synergy or trade-off). In cases where both synergies and tradeoffs are identified, the 'synergy or trade-off' interaction is attributed.

    <p>The analysis and modelling aim to identify an economical way for society to reach the desired outcomes of reliable, affordable and clean energy. For a variety of reasons, the scenario results do not necessarily reflect the least-cost ideal. The ETP analysis takes into account those policies that have already been implemented or decided. In the short term, this means that deployment pathways may differ from what would be most cost-effective. In the longer term, the analysis emphasizes a normative approach, and fewer constraints governed by current political objectives apply in the modelling. The objective of this methodology is to provide a model for a cost-effective transition to a sustainable energy system.</p>

    <p>IMACLIM-NLU 1.0 (EMF33): In this version the Imaclim-R model is linked to the land-use mode Nexus Land use. Bioenergy demand level is determined by the fuel and electricity modules of Imaclim-R. The Nexus Land use gives the corresponding price of biomass feedstock, taking into account the land constraints and food production The production of biomass for electricity and ligno-cellulosic fuels is located on marginal lands (i.e., less fertile or accessible lands). By increasing the demand for land, and spurring agricultural intensification, Bioenergy propels land and food prices.</p>

    <p>Objective IMAGE is an ecological-environmental model framework that simulates the environmental consequences of human activities worldwide. The objective of the IMAGE model is to explore the longterm dynamics and impacts of global changes that result. More specifically, the model aims to analyse interactions between human development and the natural environment to gain better insight into the processes of global environmental change, to identify response strategies to global environmental change based on assessment of options, and to indicate key inter-linkages and associated levels of uncertainty in processes of global environmental change.</p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <div class="head">Concept</div>
    <p>The IMAGE framework can best be described as a geographically explicit integrated assessment simulation model, focusing on a detailed representation of relevant processes with respect to human use of energy, land and water in relation to relevant environmental processes.</p>

    <p>In the energy model, substitution among technologies is described in the model using the multinomial logit formulation. The multinomial logit model implies that the market share of a certain technology or fuel type depends on costs relative to competing technologies. The option with the lowest costs gets the largest market share, but in most cases not the full market. We interpret the latter as a representation of heterogeneity in the form of specific market niches for every technology or fuel. is an integrated assessment model originally developed by

It divides the world in geopolitical regions, each one represented by two coupled submodels describing the energy and economic sectors, respectively. MERGE acts as a global social planner with perfect foresight and determines the economic equilibrium in each region that maximizes global welfare, defined as a linear combination of the current and future regional welfares. Besides these regional energy-economic submodels, and linked to them, MERGE includes global submodels of greenhouse gas emissions and the climate to allow the analysis of the effectiveness and impacts of climate policies and the role of technologies to realize climate targets. The model is sufficiently flexible to explore views on a wide range of contentious issues: costs of abatement, damages of climate change, valuation and discounting.

    <div class="head">Model scope and methods</div>
    <p>Objective POLES was originally developed to assess energy markets, combining a detailed description of energy demand, transformation and primary supply for all energy vectors. It provides full energy balances on a yearly basis using frequent data updates so as to deliver robust forecasts for both short-and long-term horizons. It has quickly been used, since the late 90s, to assess energy-related CO 2 mitigation policies. Over time, other GHG emissions have been included (energy and industry non-CO 2 from the early 2000s), and linkages with agricultural and land use models have been progressively implemented. MAgPIE (Model of Agricultural Production and its Impacts on the Environment) is a global multiregional economic land-use optimization model designed for scenario analysis up to the year 2100. MAgPIE provides a holistic framework to explore future transformation pathways of the land system, including multiple trade-offs with ecosystem services and sustainable development.</p>

    <p>Concept REMIND: Hybrid model that couples an economic growth model with a detailed energy system model and a simple climate model.</p>
    <p>MAgPIE: Gridded land-use optimization model with 10 socioeconomic world regions. MAgPIE takes regional economic conditions, such as demand for agricultural commodities, technological development, and production costs, as well as spatially explicit data on potential crop yields, carbon stocks and water constraints (from the dynamic global vegetation model LPJmL), under current and future climatic conditions into account.</p>
    <p>Solution method REMIND: Inter-temporal optimization that, based on a Ramsey-type growth model, maximizes regional welfare in a Nash equilibrium or, alternatively, Pareto optimum using the Negishi algorithm.</p>
    <p>MAgPIE: Partial equilibrium model of the agricultural sector with recursive-dynamic optimization. The objective function of MAgPIE is the fulfilment of agricultural demand for 10 world regions at minimum global costs under consideration of biophysical and socio-economic constraints. Major cost types in MAgPIE are factor requirement costs (capital, labor, fertilizer), land conversion costs, transportation costs to the closest market, investment costs for yield-increasing technological change (TC) and costs for GHG emissions in mitigation scenarios.</p>
    <p>REMIND and MAgPIE are coupled by exchanging greenhouse gas prices and bioenergy demand from REMIND to MAgPIE, and bioenergy prices and AFOLU greenhouse gas emissions from MAgPIE to REMIND, and iterating until an equilibrium of prices and quantities is established. Policy implementation REMIND: Pareto-optimal achievement of policy targets on temperature, radiative forcing, GHG concentration, or cumulative carbon budgets. Alternatively, calculation of Nash equilibrium without internalized technology spillovers. Possibility to analyse changes in expectations about climate policy goals as well as prespecified policy packages until 2030/2050, including, for example, energy capacity and efficiency targets, renewable energy quotas, carbon and other taxes, and energy subsidies MAgPIE: 1st-and 2nd-generation bioenergy, pricing of GHG emissions from land-use change (CO 2 ) and agricultural land use (CH 4 , N 2 O), land-use regulation, REDD+ policies, afforestation, agricultural trade policies</p>

    <div class="head">Land use (MAgPIE)</div>
    <p>MAgPIE allocates land use to fulfil competing demands for commodities, feed, carbon storage, land conservation and environmental protection. Land use is broadly categorized in cropland, forest land, pasture land, and other natural land. Regional food energy demand is defined for an exogenously given population in 16 food energy categories, based on regional diets. Future trends in food demand are derived from a cross-country regression analysis, based on future scenarios on GDP and population growth. MAgPIE takes technological development and production costs as well as spatially explicit data on potential crop yields, land and water constraints (from LPJmL) into account. It includes agricultural trade with different levels of regional selfsufficiency constraints. MAgPIE calculates the following AFOLU GHG emissions: CO 2 from land use change (including changes to soil and plant carbon content), N 2 O from fertilizing agricultural soils and manure management, and CH 4 from enteric fermentation, manure management and rice cultivation.</p>

    <div class="div">BehaviourThe GEM-E3 model endogenously computes energy consumption, depending on energy prices, realized energy efficiency expenditures and autonomous energy efficiency improvements. Each agent decides how much energy it will consume in order to optimize its behaviour (i.e., to maximize profits for firms and utility for households) subject to technological constraints (i.e., a production function). At a sectoral level, energy consumption is derived from profit maximization under a nested CES (constant elasticity of substitution) specification. Energy enters the production function together with other production factors (capital, labour, materials). Substitution of energy and the rest of the production factors is imperfect (energy is considered an essential input to the production process) and it is induced by changes in the relative prices of each input. Residential energy consumption is derived from the utility maximization problem of households. Households allocate their income between different consumption categories and savings to maximize their utility subject to their budget constraint. Consumption is split between durable (e.g., vehicles, electric appliances) and non-durable goods. For durable goods, stock accumulation depends on new purchases and scrapping.</div>
