    <p>Limiting warming to 1.5°C implies reaching net zero CO 2 emissions globally around 2050 and concurrent deep reductions in emissions of non-CO 2 forcers, particularly methane (high confidence). Such mitigation pathways are characterized by energydemand reductions, decarbonization of electricity and other fuels, electrification of energy end use, deep reductions in agricultural emissions, and some form of CDR with carbon storage on land or sequestration in geological reservoirs. Low energy demand and low demand for land-and GHG-intensive consumption goods facilitate limiting warming to as close as possible to 1.5°C. {2.2.2, 2.3.1, 2.3.5, 2.5.1, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4}.</p>
    <p>In comparison to a 2°C limit, the transformations required to limit warming to 1.5°C are qualitatively similar but more pronounced and rapid over the next decades (high confidence). 1.5°C implies very ambitious, internationally cooperative policy environments that transform both supply and demand (high confidence). {2.3, 2.4, 2.5}</p>
    <p>Policies reflecting a high price on emissions are necessary in models to achieve cost-effective 1.5°C pathways (high confidence). Other things being equal, modelling studies suggest the global average discounted marginal abatement costs for limiting warming to 1.5°C being about 3-4 times higher compared to 2°C over the 21st century, with large variations across models and socioeconomic and policy assumptions. Carbon pricing can be imposed directly or implicitly by regulatory policies. Policy instruments, like technology policies or performance standards, can complement explicit carbon pricing in specific areas. {2.5.1, 2.5.2, 4.4.5}</p>
    <p>Limiting warming to 1.5°C requires a marked shift in investment patterns (medium confidence). Additional annual average energyrelated investments for the period 2016 to 2050 in pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C compared to pathways without new climate policies beyond those in place today (i.e., baseline) are estimated to be around billion USD2010 (range of 150 billion to 1700 billion USD2010 across six models). Total energy-related investments increase by about 12% (range of 3% to 24%) in 1.5°C pathways relative to 2°C pathways. Average annual investment in low-carbon energy technologies and energy efficiency are upscaled by roughly a factor of six (range of factor of 4 to 10) by 2050 compared to 2015, overtaking fossil investments globally by around 2025 (medium confidence). Uncertainties and strategic mitigation portfolio choices affect the magnitude and focus of required investments. {2.5.2}</p>

    <div class="head">Future Emissions in 1.5°C Pathways</div>
    <p>Mitigation requirements can be quantified using carbon budget approaches that relate cumulative CO 2 emissions to global mean temperature increase. Robust physical understanding underpins this relationship, but uncertainties become increasingly relevant as a specific temperature limit is approached. These uncertainties relate to the transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions (TCRE), non-CO 2 emissions, radiative forcing and response, potential additional Earth system feedbacks (such as permafrost thawing), and historical emissions and temperature. {2.2.2, 2.6.1}</p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <div class="head">Cumulative CO 2 emissions are kept within a budget by reducing global annual CO 2 emissions to net zero. This assessment suggests a remaining budget of about 420 GtCO 2 for a twothirds chance of limiting warming to 1.5°C, and of about 580</div>
    <p>GtCO 2 for an even chance (medium confidence). The remaining carbon budget is defined here as cumulative CO 2 emissions from the start of 2018 until the time of net zero global emissions for global warming defined as a change in global near-surface air temperatures. Remaining budgets applicable to 2100 would be approximately 100 GtCO 2 lower than this to account for permafrost thawing and potential methane release from wetlands in the future, and more thereafter. These estimates come with an additional geophysical uncertainty of at least ±400 GtCO 2 , related to non-CO 2 response and TCRE distribution. Uncertainties in the level of historic warming contribute ±250 GtCO 2 . In addition, these estimates can vary by ±250 GtCO 2 depending on non-CO 2 mitigation strategies as found in available pathways. {2.2.2, 2.6.1}</p>
    <p>Staying within a remaining carbon budget of 580 GtCO 2 implies that CO 2 emissions reach carbon neutrality in about 30 years, reduced to 20 years for a 420 GtCO 2 remaining carbon budget (high confidence). The ±400 GtCO 2 geophysical uncertainty range surrounding a carbon budget translates into a variation of this timing of carbon neutrality of roughly ±15-20 years. If emissions do not start declining in the next decade, the point of carbon neutrality would need to be reached at least two decades earlier to remain within the same carbon budget. {2.2.2, 2.3.5}</p>
    <p>Non-CO 2 emissions contribute to peak warming and thus affect the remaining carbon budget. The evolution of methane and sulphur dioxide emissions strongly influences the chances of limiting warming to 1.5°C. In the near-term, a weakening of aerosol cooling would add to future warming, but can be tempered by reductions in methane emissions (high confidence). Uncertainty in radiative forcing estimates (particularly aerosol) affects carbon budgets and the certainty of pathway categorizations. Some non-CO 2 forcers are emitted alongside CO 2 , particularly in the energy and transport sectors, and can be largely addressed through CO 2 mitigation. Others require specific measures, for example, to target agricultural nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and methane (CH4), some sources of black carbon, or hydrofluorocarbons (high confidence). In many cases, non-CO2 emissions reductions are similar in 2°C pathways, indicating reductions near their assumed maximum potential by integrated assessment models. Emissions of N 2 O and NH 3 increase in some pathways with strongly increased bioenergy demand. {2.2.2, 2.3.1, 2.4.2, 2.5.3}</p>
    <p>The Role of Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) All analysed pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot use CDR to some extent to neutralize emissions from sources for which no mitigation measures have been identified and, in most cases, also to achieve net negative emissions to return global warming to 1.5°C following a peak (high confidence). The longer the delay in reducing CO 2 emissions towards zero, the larger the likelihood of exceeding 1.5°C, and the heavier the implied reliance on net negative emissions after mid-century to return warming to 1.5°C (high confidence). The faster reduction of net CO 2 emissions in 1.5°C compared to 2°C pathways is predominantly achieved by measures that result in less CO 2 being produced and emitted, and only to a smaller degree through additional CDR. Limitations on the speed, scale and societal acceptability of CDR deployment also limit the conceivable extent of temperature overshoot. Limits to our understanding of how the carbon cycle responds to net negative emissions increase the uncertainty about the effectiveness of CDR to decline temperatures after a peak. {2.2, 2.3, 2.6, 4.3.7} CDR deployed at scale is unproven, and reliance on such technology is a major risk in the ability to limit warming to 1.5°C. CDR is needed less in pathways with particularly strong emphasis on energy efficiency and low demand. The scale and type of CDR deployment varies widely across 1.5°C pathways, with different consequences for achieving sustainable development objectives (high confidence). Some pathways rely more on bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), while others rely more on afforestation, which are the two CDR methods most often included in integrated pathways. Trade-offs with other sustainability objectives occur predominantly through increased land, energy, water and investment demand. Bioenergy use is substantial in 1.5°C pathways with or without BECCS due to its multiple roles in decarbonizing energy use. {2.3.1, 2.5.3, 2.6.3, 4.3.7}</p>

    <div class="head">Properties of Energy and Land Transitions in 1.5°C Pathways</div>
    <p>The share of primary energy from renewables increases while coal usage decreases across pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot (high confidence). By 2050, renewables (including bioenergy, hydro, wind, and solar, with directequivalence method) supply a share of 52-67% (interquartile range) of primary energy in 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot; while the share from coal decreases to 1-7% (interquartile range),</p>

     <ref type="bibr" coords="5,102.83,63.17,18.32,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(CCS)</ref>. From 2020 to 2050 the primary energy supplied by oil declines in most pathways (−39 to −77% interquartile range). Natural gas changes by −13% to −62% (interquartile range), but some pathways show a marked increase albeit with widespread deployment of CCS. The overall deployment of CCS varies widely across 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot, with cumulative CO 2 stored through 2050 ranging from zero up to 300 GtCO 2 (minimum-maximum range), of which zero up to 140 GtCO 2 is stored from biomass. Primary energy supplied by bioenergy ranges from 40-310 EJ yr −1 in 2050 (minimum-maximum range), and nuclear from 3-66 EJ yr −1 (minimum-maximum range). These ranges reflect both uncertainties in technological development and strategic mitigation portfolio choices. {2.4.2}
    </p>
    <p>1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot include a rapid decline in the carbon intensity of electricity and an increase in electrification of energy end use (high confidence). By 2050, the carbon intensity of electricity decreases to −92 to +11 gCO 2 MJ −1 (minimum-maximum range) from about 140 gCO 2 MJ −1 in 2020, and electricity covers 34-71% (minimum-maximum range) of final energy across 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot from about 20% in 2020. By 2050, the share of electricity supplied by renewables increases to 59-97% (minimum-maximum range) across 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot. Pathways with higher chances of holding warming to below 1.5°C generally show a faster decline in the carbon intensity of electricity by 2030 than pathways that temporarily overshoot 1.5°C. {2.4</p>

   <div>
    <div class="head">.1, 2.4.2, 2.4.3}</div>
    <p>Transitions in global and regional land use are found in all pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, but their scale depends on the pursued mitigation portfolio (high confidence). Pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot project a 4 million km 2 reduction to a 2.5 million km2 increase of non-pasture agricultural land for food and feed crops and a 0.5-11 million km 2 reduction of pasture land, to be converted into 0-6 million km 2 of agricultural land for energy crops and a 2 million km 2 reduction to 9.5 million km 2 increase in forests by 2050 relative to 2010 (medium confidence). Land-use transitions of similar magnitude can be observed in modelled 2°C pathways (medium confidence). Such large transitions pose profound challenges for sustainable management of the various demands on land for human settlements, food, livestock feed, fibre, bioenergy, carbon storage, biodiversity and other ecosystem services (high confidence). {2.3.4, 2.4.4}</p>

    <p>Demand-side measures are key elements of 1.5°C pathways.</p>
    <p>Lifestyle choices lowering energy demand and the land-and GHG-intensity of food consumption can further support achievement of 1.5°C pathways (high confidence).

    <div class="head">Links between 1.5°C Pathways and Sustainable Development</div>
    <p>Choices about mitigation portfolios for limiting warming to 1.5°C can positively or negatively impact the achievement of other societal objectives, such as sustainable development (high confidence). In particular, demand-side and efficiency measures, and lifestyle choices that limit energy, resource, and GHG-intensive food demand support sustainable development (medium confidence). Limiting warming to 1.5°C can be achieved synergistically with poverty alleviation and improved energy security and can provide large public health benefits through improved air quality, preventing millions of premature deaths. However, specific mitigation measures, such as bioenergy, may result in trade-offs that require consideration. {2.5.1, 2.5.2, 2.5.3}</p>

    <div class="head">Introduction to Mitigation Pathways and the Sustainable Development Context</div>
    <p>This chapter assesses the literature on mitigation pathways to limit or return global mean warming to 1.5°C (relative to the pre-industrial base period . Key questions addressed are: What types of mitigation pathways have been developed that could be consistent with 1.5°C? What changes in emissions, energy and land use do they entail? What do they imply for climate policy and implementation, and what impacts do they have on sustainable development? In terms of feasibility (see Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1), this chapter focuses on geophysical dimensions and technological and economic enabling factors. Social and institutional dimensions as well as additional aspects of technical feasibility are covered in Chapter 4.</p>
    <p>Mitigation pathways are typically designed to reach a predefined climate target alone. Minimization of mitigation expenditures, but not climate-related damages or sustainable development impacts, is often the basis for these pathways to the desired climate target (see Cross-Chapter Box 5 in this chapter for additional discussion). However, there are interactions between mitigation and multiple other sustainable development goals (see Sections 1.1 and 5.4) that provide both challenges and opportunities for climate action. Hence there are substantial efforts to evaluate the effects of the various mitigation pathways on sustainable development, focusing in particular on aspects for which integrated assessment models (IAMs) provide relevant information (e.g., land-use changes and biodiversity, food security, and air quality). More broadly, there are efforts to incorporate climate change mitigation as one of multiple objectives that, in general, reflect societal concerns more completely and could potentially provide benefits at lower costs than simultaneous single-objective policies (e.g., 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="6,70.46,435.13,61.04,11.20" target="#b77" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Clarke et al., 2014</ref>). For example, with carefully selected policies, universal energy access can be achieved while simultaneously reducing air pollution and mitigating climate change 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="6,211.94,459.13,85.23,11.20" target="#b290" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(McCollum et al., 2011;</ref>
     <ref type="bibr" coords="6,51.02,471.13,65.25,11.20" target="#b363" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Riahi et al., 2012;</ref>
     <ref type="bibr" coords="6,119.42,471.13,40.58,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">IEA, 2017d)</ref>. This chapter thus presents both the pathways and an initial discussion of their context within sustainable development objectives (Section 2.5), with the latter, along with equity and ethical issues, discussed in more detail in Chapter 5.
    </p>
    <p>As described in Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1, scenarios are comprehensive, plausible, integrated descriptions of possible futures based on specified, internally consistent underlying assumptions, with pathways often used to describe the clear temporal evolution of specific scenario aspects or goal-oriented scenarios. We include both these usages of 'pathways' here.</p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <div class="head">Mitigation Pathways Consistent with 1.5°C</div>
    <p>Emissions scenarios need to cover all sectors and regions over the 21st century to be associated with a climate change projection out to 2100. Assumptions regarding future trends in population, consumption of goods and services (including food), economic growth, behaviour, technology, policies and institutions are all required to generate scenarios (Section 2.3.1). These societal choices must then be linked to the drivers of climate change, including emissions of well-mixed greenhouse gases and aerosol and ozone precursors as well as landuse and land-cover changes. Deliberate solar radiation modification is not included in these scenarios (see Cross-Chapter Box 10 in Chapter 4).</p>
    <p>Plausible developments need to be anticipated in many facets of the key sectors of energy and land use. Within energy, these scenarios consider energy resources like biofuels, energy supply and conversion technologies, energy consumption, and supply and end-use efficiency. Within land use, agricultural productivity, food demand, terrestrial carbon management, and biofuel production are all considered. Climate policies are also considered, including carbon pricing and technology policies such as research and development funding and subsidies. The scenarios incorporate regional differentiation in sectoral and policy development. The climate changes resulting from such scenarios are derived using models that typically incorporate physical understanding of the carbon cycle and climate response derived from complex geophysical models evaluated against observations (Sections 2.2 and 2.6).</p>
    <p>The temperature response to a given emission pathway (see glossary) is uncertain and therefore quantified in terms of a probabilistic outcome. Chapter 1 assesses the climate objectives of the Paris Agreement in terms of human-induced warming, thus excluding potential impacts of natural forcing such as volcanic eruptions or solar output changes or unforced internal variability. Temperature responses in this chapter are assessed using simple geophysically based models that evaluate the anthropogenic component of future temperature change and do not incorporate internal natural variations and are thus fit for purpose in the context of this assessment (Section 2.2.1). Hence a scenario that is consistent with 1.5°C may in fact lead to either a higher or lower temperature change, but within quantified and generally wellunderstood bounds (see also Chapter 1, Section 1.2.3). Consistency with avoiding a human-induced temperature change limit must therefore also be defined probabilistically, with likelihood values selected based on risk-avoidance preferences. Responses beyond global mean temperature are not typically evaluated in such models and are assessed in Chapter 3.</p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <div class="head">The Use of Scenarios</div>
    <p>Variations in scenario assumptions and design define to a large degree which questions can be addressed with a specific scenario set, for example, the exploration of implications of delayed climate mitigation action. In this assessment, the following classes of 1.5°C-and 2°C-consistent scenarios are of particular interest to the topics addressed in this chapter: (i) scenarios with the same climate target over the 21st century but varying socio-economic assumptions (Sections 2.3 and 2.4), (ii) pairs of scenarios with similar socioeconomic assumptions but with forcing targets aimed at 1.5°C and 2°C (Section 2.3), and (iii) scenarios that follow the Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs 2 until 2030 with much more stringent mitigation action thereafter (Section 2.3.5).</p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <div class="head">Mitigation Pathways Compatible with 1.5°C in the Context of Sustainable Development Chapter 2</div>
    <p>Characteristics of these pathways, such as emissions reduction rates, time of peaking, and low-carbon energy deployment rates, can be assessed as being consistent with 1.5°C. However, they cannot be assessed as 'requirements' for 1.5°C, unless a targeted analysis is available that specifically asked whether there could be other 1.5°C-consistent pathways without the characteristics in question. AR5 already assessed such targeted analyses, for example, asking which technologies are important in order to keep open the possibility of limiting warming to 2°C 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="7,148.36,147.16,70.39,11.20" target="#b77" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Clarke et al., 2014)</ref>. By now, several such targeted analyses are also available for questions related to 1.5°C (

    </p>
    <p>Ultimately, society will adjust the choices it makes as new information becomes available and technical learning progresses, and these adjustments can be in either direction. Earlier scenario studies have shown, however, that deeper emissions reductions in the near term hedge against the uncertainty of both climate response and future technology availability ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="7,140.54,291.14,67.90,11.20" target="#b267" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Luderer et al., 2013;</ref>

Not knowing what adaptations might be put in place in the future, and due to limited studies, this chapter examines prospective rather than iteratively adaptive mitigation pathways (Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1). Societal choices illustrated by scenarios may also influence what futures are envisioned as possible or desirable and hence whether those come into being

    <div class="head">New Scenario Information since AR5</div>
    <p>In this chapter, we extend the AR5 mitigation pathway assessment based on new scenario literature. Updates in understanding of climate sensitivity, transient climate response, radiative forcing, and the cumulative carbon budget consistent with 1.5°C are discussed in Sections 2.2.</p>
    <p>Mitigation pathways developed with detailed process-based integrated assessment models (IAMs) covering all sectors and regions over the 21st century describe an internally consistent and calibrated (to historical trends) way to get from current developments to meeting long-term climate targets like 1.5°C ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="7,220.43,531.16,60.39,11.20" target="#b77" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Clarke et al., 2014</ref>). The overwhelming majority of available 1.5°C pathways were generated by such IAMs, and these pathways can be directly linked to climate outcomes and their consistency with the 1.5°C goal evaluated. The AR5 similarly relied upon such studies, which were mainly discussed in Chapter 6 of Working Group III (WGIII) (

Those scenarios explore 1.5°C-consistent pathways from multiple perspectives (see Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.3), examining sensitivity to assumptions regarding:
    </p>
    <p>• socio-economic drivers and developments including energy and food demand as, for example, characterized by the Shared SocioEconomic Pathways (SSPs; Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1) • near-term climate policies describing different levels of strengthening the NDCs • the use of bioenergy and the availability and desirability of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies A large number of these scenarios were collected in a scenario database established for the assessment of this Special Report (Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.3). Mitigation pathways were classified by four factors: consistency with a temperature increase limit (as defined by Chapter 1), whether they temporarily overshoot that limit, the extent of this potential overshoot, and the likelihood of falling within these bounds.</p>
    <p>Specifically, they were put into classes that either kept surface temperature increases below a given threshold throughout the 21st century or returned to a value below 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels at some point before 2100 after temporarily exceeding that level earlier -referred to as an overshoot (OS). Both groups were further separated based on the probability of being below the threshold and the degree of overshoot, respectively

    </p>
    <p>The probability assessment used in the scenario classification is based on simulations using two reduced-complexity carbon cycle, atmospheric composition, and climate models: the 'Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas-Induced Climate Change' (MAGICC) 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="7,512.23,423.09,48.75,11.20;7,315.22,435.09,44.83,11.20" target="#b297" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Meinshausen et al., 2011a)</ref>, and the 'Finite Amplitude Impulse Response' (FAIRv1.3) model (

For the purpose of this report, and to facilitate comparison with AR5, the range of the key carbon cycle and climate parameters for MAGICC and its setup are identical to those used in AR5 WGIII ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="7,357.29,483.08,59.59,11.20" target="#b77" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Clarke et al., 2014</ref>). For each mitigation pathway, MAGICC and FAIR simulations provide probabilistic estimates of atmospheric concentrations, radiative forcing and global temperature outcomes until 2100. However, the classification uses MAGICC probabilities directly for traceability with AR5 and because this model is more established in the literature. Nevertheless, the overall uncertainty assessment is based on results from both models, which are considered in the context of the latest radiative forcing estimates and observed temperatures

The comparison of these lines of evidence shows high agreement in the relative temperature response of pathways, with medium agreement on the precise absolute magnitude of warming, introducing a level of imprecision in these attributes. Consideration of the combined evidence here leads to medium confidence in the overall geophysical characteristics of the pathways reported here.

    <p>In addition to the characteristics of the above-mentioned classes, four illustrative pathway archetypes have been selected and are used throughout this chapter to highlight specific features of and variations across 1.5°C pathways. These are chosen in particular to illustrate the spectrum of CO 2 emissions reduction patterns consistent with 1.5°C,

    <p>* No pathways were available that achieve a greater than 66% probability of limiting warming below 1.5°C during the entire 21st century based on the MAGICC model projections.</p>

    <p>ranging from very rapid and deep near-term decreases, facilitated by efficiency and demand-side measures that lead to limited CDR requirements, to relatively slower but still rapid emissions reductions that lead to a temperature overshoot and necessitate large CDR deployment later in the century (Section 2.3).</p>

    <div class="head">Utility of Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) in the Context of this Report</div>
    <p>IAMs lie at the basis of the assessment of mitigation pathways in this chapter, as much of the quantitative global scenario literature is derived with such models. IAMs combine insights from various disciplines in a single framework, resulting in a dynamic description of the coupled energy-economy-land-climate system that cover the largest sources of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from different sectors. Many of the IAMs that contributed mitigation scenarios to this assessment include a process-based description of the land system in addition to the energy system (e.g., 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="8,174.44,507.16,58.63,11.20" target="#b352" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Popp et al., 2017)</ref>, and several have been extended to cover air pollutants (

Such integrated pathways hence allow the exploration of the whole-system transformation, as well as the interactions, synergies, and tradeoffs between sectors, and, increasingly, questions beyond climate mitigation

    </p>
    <p>Section 2.3 assesses the overall characteristics of 1.5°C pathways based on fully integrated pathways, while Sections 2.4 and 2.5 describe underlying sectoral transformations, including insights from sectorspecific assessment models and pathways that are not derived from IAMs. Such models provide detail in their domain of application and make exogenous assumptions about cross-sectoral or global factors. They often focus on a specific sector, such as the energy

Sector-specific pathways are assessed in relation to integrated pathways because they cannot be directly linked to 1.5°C by themselves if they do not extend to 2100 or do not include all GHGs or aerosols from all sectors.

While the representation of renewable energy resource potentials, technology costs and system integration in IAMs has been updated since AR5, leading to higher renewable energy deployments in many cases (

Bottom-up studies find higher mitigation potentials in the industry, buildings, and transport sectors in 2030 than realized in selected 2°C pathways from IAMs (UNEP 2017), indicating the possibility to strengthen sectoral decarbonization strategies until 2030 beyond the integrated 1.5°C pathways assessed in this chapter (

    <p>Detailed, process-based IAMs are a diverse set of models ranging from partial equilibrium energy-land models to computable general equilibrium models of the global economy, from myopic to perfect foresight models, and from models with to models without endogenous technological change (Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.2). The IAMs used in this chapter have limited to no coverage of climate impacts. They typically use GHG pricing mechanisms to induce emissions reductions and associated changes in energy and land uses consistent with the imposed climate goal. The scenarios generated by these models are defined by the choice of climate goals and assumptions about near-term climate policy developments. They are also shaped by assumptions about mitigation potentials and technologies as well as baseline developments such as, for example, those represented by different Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs), especially those pertaining to energy and food demand (

IAM results depend upon multiple underlying assumptions, for example, the extent to which global markets and economies are assumed to operate frictionless and policies are cost-optimized, assumptions about technological progress and availability and costs of mitigation and CDR measures, assumptions about underlying socio-economic developments and future energy, food and materials demand, and assumptions about the geographic and temporal pattern of future regulatory and carbon pricing policies (see Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.2 for additional discussion on IAMs and their limitations).

    <div class="head">Geophysical Characteristics of Mitigation Pathways</div>
    <p>This section employs the pathway classification introduced in Section 2.1, with geophysical characteristics derived from simulations with the MAGICC reduced-complexity carbon cycle and climate model and supported by simulations with the FAIR reduced-complexity model (Section 2.1). Within a specific category and between models, there remains a large degree of variance. Most pathways exhibit a temperature overshoot which has been highlighted in several studies focusing on stringent mitigation pathways

Only very few of the scenarios collected in the database for this report hold the average future warming projected by MAGICC below 1.5°C during the entire 21st century

Most 1.5°C-consistent pathways available in the database overshoot 1.5°C around mid-century before peaking and then reducing temperatures so as to return below that level in 2100. However, because of numerous geophysical uncertainties and model dependencies (Section 2.2.1.1, Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.1), absolute temperature characteristics of the various pathway categories are more difficult to distinguish than relative features 
     <ref type="figure" coords="9,434.07,123.15,29.92,11.20" target="#fig_2" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Figure 2</ref>.1, Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.1), and actual probabilities of overshoot are imprecise. However, all lines of evidence available for temperature projections indicate a probability greater than 50% of overshooting 1.5°C by mid-century in all but the most stringent pathways currently available (Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.1, 2.SM.1.4).
    </p>
    <p>Most 1.5°C-consistent pathways exhibit a peak in temperature by midcentury whereas 2°C-consistent pathways generally peak after 2050 (Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.4). The peak in median temperature in the various pathway categories occurs about ten years before reaching net zero CO 2 emissions due to strongly reduced annual CO 2 emissions and deep reductions in CH4 emissions (Section 2.3.3).</p>
    <p>The two reduced-complexity climate models used in this assessment suggest that virtually all available 1.5°C-consistent pathways peak and then decline global mean temperature, but with varying rates of temperature decline after the peak

In comparison, many pathways limiting warming to 2°C or higher by 2100 still have noticeable increasing trends at the end of the century, and thus imply continued warming.
    </p>
    <p>By 2100, the difference between 1.5°C-and 2°C-consistent pathways becomes clearer compared to mid-century, not only for the temperature response (

    <p>A first uncertainty arises from the magnitude of the radiative forcing attributed to non-CO 2 climate forcers.

    <p>For mitigation pathways that aim at halting and reversing radiative forcing increase during this century, the aerosol radiative forcing is a considerable source of uncertainty

The partitioning of total aerosol radiative forcing between aerosol precursor emissions is important (

The total aerosol effective radiative forcing change in stringent mitigation pathways is expected to be dominated by the effects from the phase-out of SO 2 , although the magnitude of this aerosol-warming effect depends on how much of the present-day aerosol cooling is attributable to SO 2 , particularly the cooling associated with aerosolcloud interaction

    <p>Figure 2.2 shows that there are substantial differences in the evolution of estimated effective radiative forcing of non-CO 2 forcers between MAGICC and FAIR. These forcing differences result in MAGICC simulating a larger warming trend in the near term compared to both the FAIR model and the recent observed trends of 0.2°C per decade reported in Chapter 1

The aerosol effective forcing is stronger in MAGICC compared to either FAIR or the AR5 best estimate, though it is still well within the AR5 uncertainty range (Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.1.1). A recent revision

This revision is used in the FAIR but not in the AR5 setup of MAGICC that is applied here. Other structural differences exist in how the two models relate emissions to concentrations that contribute to differences in forcing (see Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.1.1).

    <p>Non-CO 2 climate forcers exhibit a greater geographical variation in radiative forcings than CO 2 , which leads to important uncertainties in the temperature response

    <p>Since the AR5, several approaches have been proposed to estimate carbon budgets compatible with 1.5°C or 2°C. Most of these approaches indirectly rely on the approximate linear relationship between peak global mean temperature and cumulative emissions of carbon (the transient climate response to cumulative emissions of carbon, TCRE) (

These are uncertain but estimated to reduce the remaining carbon budget by an order of magnitude of about 100 GtCO 2 and more thereafter. Accounting for such feedbacks would make the carbon budget more applicable for 2100 temperature targets, but would also increase uncertainty

Excluding such feedbacks, the assessed range for the remaining carbon budget is estimated to be 840, 580, and 420 GtCO 2 for the 33rd, 50th and, 67th percentile of TCRE, respectively, with a median non-CO 2 warming contribution and starting from 1 January 2018 onward. Consistent with the approach used in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report

The global warming from the pre-industrial period until the 2006-2015 reference period is estimated to amount to 0.97°C with an uncertainty range of about ±0.1°C (see Chapter 1, Section 1.2.1). Three methodological improvements lead to these estimates of the remaining carbon budget being about 300 GtCO 2 larger than those reported in 
     <ref type="table" coords="14,94.20,123.17,25.75,11.20" target="#tab_2" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Table 2</ref>.2 of the IPCC AR5 SYR (IPCC, 2014a) (medium confidence). The AR5 used 15 Earth System Models (ESM) and 5 Earth-system Models of Intermediate Complexity (EMIC) to derive an estimate of the remaining carbon budget. Their approach hence made implicit assumptions about the level of warming to date, the future contribution of non-CO 2 emissions, and the temperature response to CO 2 (TCRE). In this report, each of these aspects are considered explicitly. When estimating global warming until the 2006-2015 reference period as a blend of near-surface air temperature over land and sea-ice regions, and sea-surface temperature over open ocean, by averaging the four global mean surface temperature time series listed in Chapter 1 Section 1.2.1, the global warming would amount to 0.87°C ±0.1°C. Using the latter estimate of historical warming and projecting global warming using global near-surface air temperatures from model projections leads to remaining carbon budgets for limiting global warming to 1.5°C of 1080, 770, and 570 GtCO 2 for the 33rd, 50th, and 67th percentile of TCRE, respectively. Note that future research and ongoing observations over the next years will provide a better indication as to how the 2006-2015 base period compares with the long-term trends and might affect the budget estimates. Similarly, improved understanding in Earth system feedbacks would result in a better quantification of their impacts on remaining carbon budgets for 1.5°C and 2°C.

    <p>After TCRE uncertainty, a major additional source of uncertainty is the magnitude of non-CO 2 forcing and its contribution to the temperature change between the present day and the time of peak warming. Integrated emissions pathways can be used to ensure consistency between CO 2 and non-CO 2 emissions (

This non-CO 2 contribution at the time of net zero CO 2 emissions varies by about ±0.1°C across scenarios, resulting in a carbon budget uncertainty of about ±250 GtCO 2 , and takes into account marked reductions in methane emissions (Section 2.3.3). If these reductions are not achieved, remaining carbon budgets are further reduced. Uncertainties in the non-CO 2 forcing and temperature response are asymmetric and can influence the remaining carbon budget by −400 to +200 GtCO 2 , with the uncertainty in aerosol radiative forcing being the largest contributing factor

The MAGICC and FAIR models in their respective parameter setups and model versions used to assess the non-CO 2 warming contribution give noticeable different non-CO 2 effective radiative forcing and warming for the same scenarios while both being within plausible ranges of future response

For this assessment, it is premature to assess the accuracy of their results, so it is assumed that both are equally representative of possible futures. Their non-CO 2 warming estimates are therefore averaged for the carbon budget assessment and their differences used to guide the uncertainty assessment of the role of non-CO 2 forcers. Nevertheless, the findings are robust enough to give high confidence that the changing emissions of non-CO 2 forcers (particularly the reduction in cooling aerosol precursors) cause additional near-term warming and reduce the remaining carbon budget compared to the CO 2 -only budget.

Assuming a log-normal instead of normal distribution of the assessed AR5 TCRE range would result in about a 200 GtCO 2 increase for the median budget estimates but only about half at the 67th percentile, while historical temperature uncertainty and uncertainty in recent emissions contribute ±150 and ±50 GtCO 2 to the uncertainty, respectively

    </p>
    <p>Calculating carbon budgets from the TCRE requires the assumption that the instantaneous warming in response to cumulative CO 2 emissions equals the long-term warming or, equivalently, that the residual warming after CO 2 emissions cease is negligible. The magnitude of this residual warming, referred to as the zero-emission commitment, ranges from slightly negative (i.e., a slight cooling) to slightly positive for CO 2 emissions up to present-day (Chapter 1, Section 1.2.4) (

The delayed temperature change from a pulse CO 2 emission introduces uncertainties in emission budgets, which have not been quantified in the literature for budgets consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. As a consequence, this uncertainty does not affect our carbon budget estimates directly but it is included as an additional factor in the assessed Earth system feedback uncertainty (as detailed below) of roughly 100 GtCO 2 on decadal time scales presented in 
     <ref type="formula" coords="15,118.31,339.17,23.05,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(2017)</ref> find there is possibility of 0.5-1.5 GtCO 2 y -1 being released from aerosol-biogeochemistry changes if aerosol emissions cease. In summary, these additional Earth system feedbacks taken together are assessed to reduce the remaining carbon budget applicable to 2100 by an order of magnitude of 100 GtCO 2 , compared to the budgets based on the assumption of a constant TCRE presented in

After 2100, the impact of additional Earth system feedbacks is expected to further reduce the remaining carbon budget (medium confidence).

    <p>The remaining carbon budgets assessed in this section are consistent with limiting peak warming to the indicated levels of additional warming. However, if these budgets are exceeded and the use of CDR (see Sections 2.3 and 2.4) is envisaged to return cumulative CO 2 emissions to within the carbon budget at a later point in time, additional uncertainties apply because the TCRE is different under increasing and decreasing atmospheric CO 2 concentrations due to ocean thermal and carbon cycle inertia

This assessment does not explicitly account for path dependence but takes it into consideration for its overall confidence assessment.
    </p>
    <p>This assessment finds a larger remaining budget from the 2006-2015 base period than the 1.5°C and 2°C remaining budgets inferred from AR5 from the start of 2011, which were approximately 1000 GtCO 2 for the 2°C (66% of model simulations) and approximately 400 GtCO 2 for the 1.5°C budget (66% of model simulations). In contrast, this assessment finds approximately 1600 GtCO 2 for the 2°C (66th TCRE percentile) and approximately 860 GtCO 2 for the 1.5°C budget (66th TCRE percentile) from 2011. However, these budgets are not directly equivalent as AR5 reported budgets for fractions of CMIP5 simulations and other lines of evidence, while this report uses the assessed range of TCRE and an assessment of the non-CO 2 contribution at net zero CO 2 emissions to provide remaining carbon budget estimates at various percentiles of TCRE. Furthermore, AR5 did not specify remaining budgets to carbon neutrality as we do here, but budgets until the time the temperature limit of interest was reached, assuming negligible zero emission commitment and taking into account the non-CO 2 forcing at that point in time.</p>
    <p>In summary, although robust physical understanding underpins the carbon budget concept, relative uncertainties become larger as a specific temperature limit is approached. For the budget, applicable to the mid-century, the main uncertainties relate to the TCRE, non-CO 2 emissions, radiative forcing and response. For 2100, uncertain Earth system feedbacks such as permafrost thawing would further reduce the available budget. The remaining budget is also conditional upon the choice of baseline, which is affected by uncertainties in both historical emissions, and in deriving the estimate of globally averaged human-induced warming. As a result, only medium confidence can be assigned to the assessed remaining budget values for 1.5°C and 2.0°C and their uncertainty. </p>

    <p>Limiting global mean temperature increase at any level requires global CO 2 emissions to become net zero at some point in the future (

At the same time, limiting the residual warming of short-lived non-CO 2 emissions can be achieved by reducing their annual emissions as much as possible (Section 2.2, Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1). This would require large-scale transformations of the global energy-agriculture-land-economy system, affecting the way in which energy is produced, agricultural systems are organized, and food, energy and materials are consumed ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="16,215.75,687.17,58.68,11.20" target="#b77" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Clarke et al., 2014</ref>). This section assesses key properties of pathways consistent with limiting global mean temperature to 1.5°C relative to pre-industrial levels, including their underlying assumptions and variations.
    </p>
    <p>Since the AR5, an extensive body of literature has appeared on integrated pathways consistent with 1.5°C (Section 2. 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="16,327.09,639.15,20.18,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">, 2018</ref>). These pathways have global coverage and represent all GHG-emitting sectors and their interactions. Such integrated pathways allow the exploration of the whole-system transformation, and hence provide the context in which the detailed sectoral transformations assessed in Section 2.4 of this chapter are taking place.
    </p>
    <p>The overwhelming majority of published integrated pathways have been developed by global IAMs that represent key societal systems and their interactions, like the energy system, agriculture and land use, and the economy (see Section 6.2 in 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="17,192.57,63.17,63.23,11.20" target="#b77" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Clarke et al., 2014</ref>). Very often these models also include interactions with a representation of the geophysical system, for example, by including spatially explicit land models or carbon cycle and climate models. The complex features of these subsystems are approximated and simplified in these models. IAMs are briefly introduced in Section 2.1 and important knowledge gaps identified in Section 2.6. An overview to the use, scope and limitations of IAMs is provided in Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.2.
    </p>
    <p>The pathway literature is assessed in two ways in this section. First, various insights on specific questions reported by studies can be assessed to identify robust or divergent findings. Second, the combined body of scenarios can be assessed to identify salient features of pathways in line with a specific climate goal across a wide range of models. The latter can be achieved by assessing pathways available in the database to this assessment (Section 2.1, Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.2-4). The ensemble of scenarios available to this assessment is an ensemble of opportunity: it is a collection of scenarios from a diverse set of studies that was not developed with a common set of questions and a statistical analysis of outcomes in mind. This means that ranges can be useful to identify robust and sensitive features across available scenarios and contributing modelling frameworks, but do not lend themselves to a statistical interpretation. To understand the reasons underlying the ranges, an assessment of the underlying scenarios and studies is required. To this end, this section highlights illustrative pathway archetypes that help to clarify the variation in assessed ranges for 1.5°C-consistent pathways.</p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <div class="head">Range of Assumptions Underlying 1.5°C Pathways</div>
    <p>Earlier assessments have highlighted that there is no single pathway to achieve a specific climate objective (e.g.,

Pathways depend on the underlying development processes, and societal choices, which affect the drivers of projected future baseline emissions. Furthermore, societal choices also affect climate change solutions in pathways, like the technologies that are deployed, the scale at which they are deployed, or whether solutions are globally coordinated.
    </p>
    <p>A key finding is that 1.5°C-consistent pathways could be identified under a considerable range of assumptions in model studies despite the tightness of the 1.5°C emissions budget

For example, based on alternative future fertility, mortality, migration and educational assumptions, population projections vary between 8.5 and 10.0 billion people by 2050 and between 6.9 and 12.6 billion people by 2100 across the SSPs. An important factor for these differences is future female educational attainment, with higher attainment leading to lower fertility rates and therefore decreased population growth up to a level of 1 billion people by

    <p>Baseline projections for energy-related GHG emissions are sensitive to economic growth assumptions, while baseline projections for land-use emissions are more directly affected by population growth (assuming unchanged land productivity and per capita demand for agricultural products) (

SSP-based modelling studies of mitigation pathways have identified high challenges to mitigation for worlds with a focus on domestic issues and regional security combined with high population growth (SSP3), and for worlds with rapidly growing resource and fossil-fuel intensive consumption (SSP5) (

No model found a 1.5°C-consistent pathway for SSP3 and some models could not identify 1.5°C-consistent pathways for SSP5 (2 of 4 models, compared to 1 of 4 models for 2°C-consistent pathways). The modelling analysis also found that the effective control of land-use emissions becomes even more critical in 1.5°C-consistent pathways. Due to high inequality levels in SSP4, land use can be less well managed. This caused 2 of 3 models to no longer find an SSP4-based 1.5°C-consistent pathway even though they identified SSP4-based 2°C-consistent pathways at relatively moderate mitigation costs (

These results show that 1.5°C-consistent pathways can be identified under a broad range of assumptions, but that lack of global cooperation (SSP3), high inequality (SSP4) and/or high population growth (SSP3) that limit the ability to control land use emissions, and rapidly growing resource-intensive consumption (SSP5) are key impediments.

    <p>This elicitation (Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.2) confirms that IAMs cover most supply-side mitigation options on the process level, while many demand-side options are treated as part of underlying assumptions, which can be varied (

In recent years, there has been increasing attention on improving the modelling of integrating variable renewable energy into the power system Those are also included in Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.2. The configuration of carbon-neutral energy systems projected in mitigation pathways can vary widely, but they all share a substantial reliance on bioenergy under the assumption of effective land-use emissions control. There are other configurations with less reliance on bioenergy that are not yet comprehensively covered by global mitigation pathway modelling. One approach is to dramatically reduce and electrify energy demand for transportation and manufacturing to levels that make residual non-electric fuel use negligible or replaceable by limited amounts of electrolytic hydrogen. Such an approach is presented in a first-of-its kind low-energy-demand scenario (

    <div class="head">Policy assumptions in 1.5°C pathways</div>
    <p>Besides assumptions related to socio-economic drivers and mitigation technology, scenarios are also subject to assumptions about the mitigation policies that can be put in place. Mitigation policies can either be applied immediately in scenarios or follow staged or delayed approaches. Policies can span many sectors (e.g., economy-wide carbon pricing), or policies can be applicable to specific sectors only (like the energy sector) with other sectors (e.g., the agricultural or the land-use sector) treated differently. These variations can have an important impact on the ability of models to generate scenarios compatible with stringent climate targets like 1.5°C

    <p>1.5°C-consistent pathways are characterized by a rapid phase out of CO 2 emissions and deep emissions reductions in other GHGs and climate forcers (Section 2.2.2 and 2.3.3). This is achieved by broad transformations in the energy; industry; transport; buildings; and agriculture, forestry and other land-use

    <p>Because the overall emissions total under a pathway is limited by a geophysical carbon budget (Section 2.2.2), choices in one sector affect the efforts that are required from others (

As discussed in Section 2.2.2, to keep warming below 1.5°C with a two-in-three (one-in-two) chance, the cumulative amount of CO 2 emissions from 2018 onwards need to remain below a carbon budget of 420 (580) GtCO 2 ; accounting for the effects of additional Earth system feedbacks until 2100 reduces this estimate by 100 GtCO 2 . Based on the current state of knowledge, exceeding this remaining carbon budget at some point in time would give a one-in-three (one-in-two) chance that the 1.5°C limit is overshot

Note that the S5 scenario reports the building and industry sector emissions jointly. Green-blue areas hence show emissions from the transport sector and the joint building and industry demand sector, respectively.

Thus, following an NDC trajectory would already exhaust 95-130% (70-95%) of the remaining two-in-three (one-in-two) 1.5°C carbon budget (unadjusted for additional Earth system feedbacks) by 2030. This would leave no time (0-9 years) to bring down global emissions from NDC levels of around 40 GtCO 2 yr −1 in

    </p>
    <p>Most 1.5°C-consistent pathways show more stringent emissions reductions by 2030 than implied by the NDCs (Section 2.3.5) The lower end of those pathways reach down to below 20 GtCO 2 yr −1 in 2030 (Section 2.3.3, 
     <ref type="table" coords="22,102.03,207.17,23.46,11.20" target="#tab_2" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Table 2</ref>.4), less than half of what is implied by the NDCs. Whether such pathways will be able to limit warming to 1.5°C without overshoot will depend on whether cumulative net CO 2 emissions over the 21st century can be kept below the remaining carbon budget at any time. Net global CO 2 emissions are derived from the gross amount of CO 2 that humans annually emit into the atmosphere reduced by the amount of anthropogenic CDR in each year. New research has looked more closely at the amount and the drivers of gross CO 2 emissions from fossil-fuel combustion and industrial processes (FFI) in deep mitigation pathways 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="22,126.31,315.17,73.05,11.20" target="#b271" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Luderer et al., 2018)</ref>, and found that the larger part of remaining CO 2 emissions come from direct fossil-fuel use in the transport and industry sectors, while residual energy supply sector emissions (mostly from the power sector) are limited by a rapid approach to net zero CO 2 emissions until mid-century. The 1.5°C pathways with no or limited (&lt;0.1°C) overshoot that were reported in the scenario database project remaining FFI CO 2 emissions of 610-1260 GtCO 2 over the period 2018-2100 (5th-95th percentile range; median: 880 GtCO 2 ). 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="22,51.02,411.17,74.63,11.20" target="#b247" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Kriegler et al. (2018b)</ref> conducted a sensitivity analysis that explores the four central options for reducing fossil-fuel emissions: lowering energy demand, electrifying energy services, decarbonizing the power sector and decarbonizing non-electric fuel use in energy end-use sectors. By exploring these options to their extremes, they found a lowest value of 500 GtCO 2 (2018-2100) gross fossil-fuel CO 2 emissions for the hypothetical case of aligning the strongest assumptions for all four mitigation options. The two lines of evidence and the fact that available 1.5°C pathways cover a wide range of assumptions (Section 2.3.1) give a robust indication of a lower limit of about 500 GtCO 2 remaining fossil-fuel and industry CO 2 emissions in the 21st century.
    </p>
    <p>To compare these numbers with the remaining carbon budget, CO 2 emissions from agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) need to be taken into account. In many of the 1.5°C-consistent pathways, AFOLU CO 2 emissions reach zero at or before mid-century and then turn to negative values 
     <ref type="table" coords="22,134.82,603.17,26.53,11.20" target="#tab_2" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Table 2</ref>.4). This means human changes to the land lead to atmospheric carbon being stored in plants and soils. This needs to be distinguished from the natural CO 2 uptake by land, which is not accounted for in the anthropogenic AFOLU CO 2 emissions reported in the pathways. Given the difference in estimating the 'anthropogenic' sink between countries and the global integrated assessment and carbon modelling community ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="22,164.57,675.17,64.54,11.20" target="#b143" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Grassi et al., 2017</ref>), the AFOLU CO 2 estimates included here are not necessarily directly comparable with countries' estimates at global level. The cumulated amount of AFOLU CO 2 emissions until the time they reach zero combine with the fossil-fuel and industry CO 2 emissions to give a total amount of gross emissions of 650-1270 GtCO 2 for the period 2018-2100 (5th-95th percentile; median 950 GtCO 2 ) in 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot. The lower end of the range is close to what emerges from a scenario of transformative change that halves CO 2 emissions every decade from 2020 to 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="22,360.72,99.17,17.96,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">2050</ref>

All these estimates are above the remaining carbon budget for a one-in-two chance of limiting warming below 1.5°C without overshoot, including the low end of the hypothetical sensitivity analysis of 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="22,429.70,135.17,73.15,11.20" target="#b247" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Kriegler et al. (2018b)</ref>, who assumes 75 Gt AFOLU CO 2 emissions adding to a total of 575 GtCO 2 gross CO 2 emissions. As almost no cases have been identified that keep gross CO 2 emissions within the remaining carbon budget for a one-in-two chance of limiting warming to 1.5°C, and based on current understanding of the geophysical response and its uncertainties, the available evidence indicates that avoiding overshoot of 1.5°C will require some type of CDR in a broad sense, e.g., via net negative AFOLU CO 2 emissions (medium confidence). 
     <ref type="table" coords="22,387.49,231.17,29.43,11.20" target="#tab_2" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Table 2.</ref>2).
    </p>
    <p>Net CO 2 emissions can fall below gross CO 2 emissions, if CDR is brought into the mix. Studies have looked at mitigation and CDR in combination to identify strategies for limiting warming to 1.5°C ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="22,313.47,291.17,81.55,11.20" target="#b392" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Sanderson et al., 2016;</ref>

CDR, which may include net negative AFOLU CO 2 emissions, is deployed by all 1.5°C-consistent pathways available to this assessment, but the scale of deployment and choice of CDR measures varies widely (Section 2.3.4 CDR until the point of carbon neutrality (5th to 95th percentile; median 110 GtCO 2 ). Because gross CO 2 emissions in most cases exceed the remaining carbon budget by several hundred GtCO 2 and given the limits to CDR deployment until 2050, most of the 1.5°C-consistent pathways available to this assessment are overshoot pathways. However, the scenario database also contains nine non-overshoot pathways that remain below 1.5°C throughout the 21st century

    <div class="head">Emissions Evolution in 1.5°C Pathways</div>
    <p>This section assesses the salient temporal evolutions of climate forcers over the 21st century. It uses the classification of 1.5°C pathways presented in Section 2.1, which includes a Below-1.5°C class, as well as other classes with varying levels of projected overshoot (1.5°C-low-OS and 1.5°C-high-OS). First, aggregate-GHG benchmarks for 2030 are assessed. Subsequent sections assess long-lived climate forcers (LLCF) and short-lived climate forcers (SLCF) separately because they contribute in different ways to near-term, peak and long-term warming (Section 2.2, Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1).</p>
    <p>Estimates of aggregated GHG emissions in line with specific policy choices are often compared to near-term benchmark values from mitigation pathways to explore their consistency with long-term climate goals

Benchmark emissions or estimates of peak years derived from IAMs provide guidelines or milestones that are consistent with achieving a given temperature level. While they do not set mitigation requirements in a strict sense, exceeding these levels in a given year almost invariably increases the mitigation challenges afterwards by increasing the rates of change and increasing the reliance on speculative technologies, including the possibility that its implementation becomes unachievable ( Appropriate benchmark values of aggregated GHG emissions depend on a variety of factors. First and foremost, they are determined by the desired likelihood to keep warming below 1.5°C and the extent to which projected temporary overshoot is to be avoided (Sections 2.2, 2.3.2, and 2.3.5). For instance, median aggregated 2030 GHG emissions are about 10 GtCO 2 e yr −1 lower in 1.5°C-low-OS compared to 1.5°C-high-OS pathways, with respective interquartile ranges of 26-31 and 36-49 GtCO 2 e yr −1

These ranges correspond to about 25-30 and 35-48 GtCO 2 e yr −1 in 2030, respectively, when aggregated with 100-year Global Warming Potentials from the IPCC Second Assessment Report. The limited evidence available for pathways aiming to limit warming below 1.5°C without overshoot or with limited amounts of CDR (

Due to the small number of 1.5°C pathways with no overshoot in the report's database 
     <ref type="table" coords="23,119.71,615.16,26.52,11.20" target="#tab_2" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Table 2</ref>.4) and the potential for a downward bias in the selection of underlying scenario assumptions, the headline range for 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot is also assessed to be of the order of 25-30 GtCO 2 e yr −1 . Ranges for the 1.5°C-low-OS and Lower-2°C classes only overlap outside their interquartile ranges, highlighting the more accelerated reductions in 1.5°C-consistent compared to 2°C-consistent pathways.
    </p>
    <p>Appropriate emissions benchmark values also depend on the acceptable or desired portfolio of mitigation measures, representing clearly identified trade-offs and choices (Sections 2.3.4, 2.4, and 2.5.3) (

     <ref type="bibr" coords="23,384.30,159.16,66.40,11.20" target="#b452" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Strefler et al., 2018b</ref>). On the other hand, pathways that assume or anticipate only limited deployment of CDR during the 21st century imply lower emissions benchmarks over the coming decades, which are achieved in models through further reducing CO 2 emissions in the coming decades. The pathway archetypes used in the chapter illustrate this further 
     <ref type="figure" coords="23,464.32,219.17,39.77,11.20" target="#fig_2" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Figure 2.6)</ref>. Under middleof-the-road assumptions of technological and socioeconomic development, pathway S2 suggests emission benchmarks of 34, 12 and −8 GtCO 2 e yr −1 in the years 2030, 2050, and 2100, respectively. In contrast, a pathway that further limits overshoot and aims at eliminating the reliance on negative emissions technologies like BECCS as well as CCS (here labelled as the LED pathway) shows deeper emissions reductions in 2030 to limit the cumulative amount of CO 2 until net zero global CO 2 emissions (carbon neutrality). The LED pathway here suggests emission benchmarks of 25, 9 and 2 GtCO 2 e yr −1 in the years 2030, 2050, and 2100, respectively. However, a pathway that allows and plans for the successful large-scale deployment of BECCS by and beyond 2050 (S5) shows a shift in the opposite direction.
    </p>
    <p>The variation within and between the abovementioned ranges of 2030 GHG benchmarks hence depends strongly on societal choices and preferences related to the acceptability and availability of certain technologies.</p>
    <p>Overall these variations do not strongly affect estimates of the 1.5°C-consistent timing of global peaking of GHG emissions. Both Below-1.5°C and 1.5°C-low-OS pathways show minimum-maximum ranges in 2030 that do not overlap with 2020 ranges, indicating the global GHG emissions peaked before 2030 in these pathways. Also, 2020 and 2030 GHG emissions in 1.5°C-high-OS pathways only overlap outside their interquartile ranges.</p>
    <p>Kyoto-GHG emission reductions are achieved by reductions in CO 2 and non-CO 2 GHGs. The AR5 identified two primary factors that influence the depth and timing of reductions in non-CO 2 Kyoto-GHG emissions: (i) the abatement potential and costs of reducing the emissions of these gases and (ii) the strategies that allow making trade-offs between them ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="23,410.46,591.17,61.90,11.20" target="#b77" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Clarke et al., 2014</ref> options in the current generation of IAMs, which are hence not able to reduce residual emissions of sources linked to livestock production and fertilizer use ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="24,117.70,75.17,67.05,11.20" target="#b77" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Clarke et al., 2014;</ref>

Therefore, while net CO2 emissions are projected to be markedly lower in 1.5°C-consistent compared to 2°C-consistent pathways, this is much less the case for methane (CH 4 ) and nitrous-oxide (N 2 O) (Figures 2.6-2.7). This results in reductions of CO 2 being projected to take up the largest share of emissions reductions when moving between 1.5°C-consistent and 2°C-consistent pathways ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="24,146.93,159.17,68.82,11.20" target="#b376" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Rogelj et al., 2015b</ref>

If additional non-CO 2 mitigation measures are identified and adequately included in IAMs, they are expected to further contribute to mitigation efforts by lowering the floor of residual non-CO 2 emissions. However, the magnitude of these potential contributions has not been assessed as part of this report.
    </p>
    <p>As a result of the interplay between residual CO 2 and non-CO 2 emissions and CDR, global GHG emissions reach net zero levels at different times in different 1.5°C-consistent pathways. Interquartile ranges of the years in which 1.5°C-low-OS and 1.5°C-high-OS reach net zero GHG emissions range from 2060 to 2080 
     <ref type="table" coords="24,175.90,291.17,25.93,11.20" target="#tab_2" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Table 2</ref>.4). A seesaw characteristic can be found between near-term emissions reductions and the timing of net zero GHG emissions. This is because pathways with limited emissions reductions in the next one to two decades require net negative CO 2 emissions later on (see earlier). Most 1.5°C-high-OS pathways lead to net zero GHG emissions in approximately the third quarter of this century, because all of them rely on significant amounts of annual net negative CO 2 emissions in the second half of the century to decline temperatures after overshoot (

    </p>
    <p>All 1.5°C pathways see global CO 2 emissions embark on a steady decline to reach (near) net zero levels around 2050, with 1.5°C-low-OS pathways reaching net zero CO 2 emissions around 2045-2055

Near-term differences between the various pathway classes are apparent, however. For instance, Below-1.5°C and 1.5°C-low-OS pathways show a clear shift towards lower CO 2 emissions in 2030 relative to other 1.5°C and 2°C pathway classes, although in all 1.5°C classes reductions are clear

These lower near-term emissions levels are a direct consequence of the former two pathway classes limiting cumulative CO 2 emissions until carbon neutrality in order to aim for a higher probability of limiting peak warming to 1.5°C (Section 2.2.2 and 2.3.2.2). In some cases, 1.5°C-low-OS pathways achieve net zero CO 2 emissions one or two decades later, contingent on 2030 CO 2 emissions in the lower quartile of the literature range, that is, below about 18 GtCO 2 yr −1 . Median year-2030 global CO 2 emissions are of the order of 5-10 GtCO 2 yr −1 lower in Below-1.5°C compared to 1.5°C-low-OS pathways, which are in turn lower than 1.5°C-high-OS pathways

    <p>The development of CO 2 emissions in the second half of the century in 1.5°C pathways is characterized by the need to stay or return within a carbon budget.

This net withdrawal of CO 2 from the atmosphere compensates for residual long-lived non-CO 2 GHG emissions that also accumulate in the atmosphere (like N2O) or cancels some of the build-up of CO 2 due to earlier emissions to achieve increasingly higher likelihoods that warming stays or returns below 1.5°C (see Section 2.3.4 for a discussion of various uses of CDR). Even non-overshoot pathways that aim at achieving temperature stabilization would hence deploy a certain amount of net negative CO 2 emissions to offset any accumulating long-lived non-CO 2 GHGs. The 1.5°C overshoot pathways display significantly larger amounts of annual net negative CO 2 emissions in the second half of the century. The larger the overshoot the more net negative CO 2 emissions are required to return temperatures to 1.5°C by the end of the century ( a result, sizeable residual N 2 O emissions are currently projected to continue throughout the century, and measures to effectively mitigate them will be of continued relevance for 1.5°C societies. Finally, the reduction of nitrogen use and N 2 O emissions from agriculture is already a present-day concern due to unsustainable levels of nitrogen pollution (

Because the dominant sources of certain aerosol mixtures are emitted during the combustion of fossil fuels, the rapid phase-out of unabated fossil fuels to avoid CO 2 emissions would also result in removal of these either warming or cooling SLCF air-pollutant species. Furthermore, SLCFs are also reduced by efforts to reduce particulate air pollution. For example, year-2050 SO 2 emissions (precursors of sulphate aerosol) in 1.5°C-consistent pathways are about 75-85% lower than their 2010 levels. Some caveats apply, for example, if residential biomass use would be encouraged in industrialised countries in stringent mitigation pathways without appropriate pollution control measures, aerosol concentrations could also increase (

Nevertheless, there can be additional gains from targeted deeper reductions of CH 4 emissions and tropospheric ozone precursors, with some scenarios projecting less than 0.1 W m −2 forcing from SLCFs by 2100.

A set of key questions emerge: how strongly do 1.5°C-consistent pathways rely on CDR deployment and what types of CDR measures are deployed at which scale? How does this vary across available 1.5°C-consistent pathways and on which factors does it depend? How does CDR deployment compare between 1.5°C-and 2°C-consistent pathways and how does it compare with the findings at the time of the AR5? How does CDR deployment in 1.5°C-consistent pathways relate to questions about availability, policy implementation and sustainable development implications that have been raised about CDR technologies? The first three questions are assessed in this section with the goal to provide an overview and assessment of CDR deployment in the 1.5°C pathway literature. The fourth question is only touched upon here and is addressed in greater depth in Chapter 4, Section 4.3.7, which assesses the rapidly growing literature on costs, potentials, availability and sustainability implications of individual CDR measures (

    <p>Only some of these approaches have so far been considered in IAMs (see Section 2.3. Integrated assessment modelling has not yet explored land conservation, restoration and management options to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in sufficient depth, despite land management having a potentially considerable impact on the terrestrial carbon stock ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="29,540.92,387.16,20.03,11.20;29,315.21,399.16,30.82,11.20" target="#b106" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Erb et al., 2018)</ref>. Moreover, associated CDR measures have low technological requirements, and come with potential environmental and social co-benefits (

Despite the evolving capabilities of IAMs in accounting for a wider range of CDR measures, 1.5°C-consistent pathways assessed here continue to predominantly rely on BECCS and afforestation/reforestation (see Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.2). However, IAMs with spatially explicit land-use modelling include a full accounting of land-use change emissions comprising carbon stored in the terrestrial biosphere and soils. Net CDR in the AFOLU sector, including but not restricted to afforestation and reforestation, can thus in principle be inferred by comparing AFOLU CO 2 emissions between a baseline scenario and a 1.5°C-consistent pathway from the same model and study. However, baseline AFOLU CO 2 emissions can not only be reduced by CDR in the AFOLU sector but also by measures to reduce deforestation and preserve land carbon stocks. The pathway literature and pathway data available to this assessment do not yet allow separating the two contributions. As a conservative approximation, the additional net negative AFOLU CO 2 emissions below the baseline are taken as a proxy for AFOLU CDR in this assessment. Because this does not include CDR that was deployed before reaching net zero AFOLU CO 2 emissions, this approximation is a lower-bound for terrestrial CDR in the AFOLU sector (including all mitigation-policy-related factors that lead to net negative AFOLU CO 2 emissions).

This shows the flexibility in substituting between individual CDR measures, once a portfolio of options becomes available. The high end of the CDR deployment range is populated by high overshoot pathways, as illustrated by pathway archetype S5 based on SSP5 (fossil-fuelled development, see Section 2.3.1.1) and characterized by very large BECCS deployment to return warming to 1.5°C by 2100 (

As additional CDR measures are being built into IAMs, the prevalence of BECCS is expected to be further reduced. It does not include CCS combined with fossil fuels (which is not a CDR technology as it does not result in active removal of CO 2 from the atmosphere). AFOLU CDR has not been reported directly and is hence represented by means of a proxy: the additional amount of net negative CO 2 emissions in the AFOLU sector compared to a baseline scenario (see text for a discussion). 'Compensatory CO 2 ' depicts the cumulative amount of CDR that is used to neutralize concurrent residual CO 2 emissions. 'Net negative CO 2 ' describes the additional amount of CDR that is used to produce net negative CO 2 emissions, once residual CO 2 emissions are neutralized.

    <p>As discussed in Section 2.3.2, CDR can be used in two ways in mitigation pathways: (i) to move more rapidly towards the point of carbon neutrality and maintain it afterwards in order to stabilize global mean temperature rise, and (ii) to produce net negative CO 2 emissions, drawing down anthropogenic CO 2 in the atmosphere in order to decline global mean temperature after an overshoot peak (

    <p>carbon budget, and because many pathways in the literature do not restrict exceeding this budget prior to 2100, the relative weight of the net negative emissions component of CDR increases compared to 2°C-consistent pathways. The amount of compensatory CDR remains roughly the same over the century. This is the net effect of stronger deployment of compensatory CDR until mid-century to accelerate the approach to carbon neutrality and less compensatory CDR in the second half of the century due to deeper mitigation of end-use sectors Total CDR is the difference between gross (red horizontal bar) and net (purple horizontal bar) cumulative CO 2 emissions over the period 2018-2100, and it is equal to the sum of the BECCS (grey) and AFOLU CDR (green) contributions. Cumulative net negative emissions are the difference between peak (orange horizontal bar) and net (purple) cumulative CO 2 emissions.

Comparing median levels, end-of-century net cumulative CO 2 emissions are roughly 600 GtCO 2 smaller in 1.5°C compared to 2°C-consistent pathways, with approximately two thirds coming from further reductions of gross CO 2 emissions and the remaining third from increased CDR deployment. As a result, median levels of total CDR deployment in 1.5°C-consistent pathways are larger than in 2°C-consistent pathways

BECCS deployment is still limited in 2030, but ramps up to median levels of 3 (Below-1.5°C), 5 (1.5°C-low-OS) and 7 GtCO 2 yr −1 (1.5°C-high-OS) in 2050, and to 6 (Below-1.5°C), 12 (1.5°C-low-OS) and 15 GtCO 2 yr −1 (1.5°C-high-OS) in 2100, respectively. In 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot, this amounts to 0-1, 0-8, and 0-16 GtCO 2 yr −1 in 2030, 2050, and 2100, respectively (ranges refer to the union of the min-max range of the Below-1.5°C and the interquartile range of the 1.5°C-low-OS class; see

Net CDR in the AFOLU sector reaches slightly lower levels in 2050, and stays more constant until 2100. In 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot, AFOLU CDR amounts to 0-5, 1-11, and 1-5 GtCO 2 yr −1 (see above for the definition of the ranges) in 2030, 2050, and 2100, respectively. In contrast to BECCS, AFOLU CDR is more strongly deployed in non-overshoot than overshoot pathways. This indicates differences in the timing of the two CDR approaches. Afforestation is scaled up until around mid-century, when the time of carbon neutrality is reached in 1.5°C-consistent pathways, while BECCS is projected to be used predominantly in the 2nd half of the century 
     <ref type="figure" coords="31,368.86,567.16,30.28,11.20" target="#fig_2" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Figure 2</ref>.5). This reflects the fact that afforestation is a readily available CDR technology, while BECCS is more costly and much less mature a technology. As a result, the two options contribute differently to compensating concurrent CO 2 emissions (until 2050) and to producing net negative CO 2 emissions (post-2050). BECCS deployment is particularly strong in pathways with high overshoots but can also feature in pathways with low overshoot (see

Annual deployment levels until mid-century are not found to be significantly different between 2°C-consistent pathways and 1.5°C-consistent pathways with no or low overshoot. This suggests similar implementation challenges for ramping up BECCS deployment at the rates projected in the pathways

Deeper near-term emissions reductions are required to reach the 1.5°C-2°C target range if CDR availability is constrained. As a result, the least-cost benchmark pathways to derive GHG emissions gap estimates (UNEP, 2017) are dependent on assumptions about CDR availability. Using GHG benchmarks in climate policy makes implicit assumptions about CDR availability (

There are significant trade-offs between near-term action, overshoot and reliance on CDR deployment in the long-term which are assessed in Section 2.3.5. . As land impacts are tied to bioenergy use, the exclusion of BECCS from the mitigation portfolio will not automatically remove the trade-offs with food, water and other sustainability objectives due to the continued and potentially increased use of bioenergy.

    <p>IAMs assume bioenergy to be supplied mostly from second generation biomass feedstocks such as dedicated cellulosic crops (for example Miscanthus or poplar) as well as agricultural and forest residues. Detailed process IAMs include land-use models that capture competition for land for different uses (food, feed, fiber, bioenergy, carbon storage, biodiversity protection) under a range of dynamic factors including socio-economic drivers, productivity increases in crop and livestock systems, food demand, and land, environmental, biodiversity, and carbon policies.

As discussed, these land-use patterns are heavily influenced by assumptions about, among other things, future population levels, crop yields, livestock production systems, and food and livestock demand, which all vary between the pathways (Popp et al., 2017) (Section 2.3.1.1). In pathways that allow for large-scale afforestation in addition to BECCS, land demand for afforestation can be larger than for BECCS

This follows from the assumption in the modelled pathways that, unlike bioenergy crops, forests are not harvested to allow unabated carbon storage on the same patch of land. If wood harvest and subsequent processing or burial are taken into account, this finding can change. There are also synergies between the various uses of land, which are not reflected in the depicted pathways. Trees can grow on agricultural land (

The pathways show a very substantial land demand for the two CDR measures combined, up to the magnitude of the current global cropland area. This is achieved in IAMs in particular by a conversion of pasture land freed by intensification of livestock production systems, pasture intensification and/or demand changes (

This is a direct consequence of the quasi-linear relationship between the total cumulative amount of CO 2 emitted into the atmosphere and global mean temperature rise ( for the NDCs rely on an assumed swift and widespread deployment of CDR after 2030, and show peak cumulative CO 2 emissions from 2018 of about 800-1000 GtCO 2 , above the remaining carbon budget for a one-in-two chance of remaining below 1.5°C. These emissions reflect that no pathway is able to project a phase-out of CO 2 emissions starting from year-2030 NDC levels of about 40 GtCO 2 yr −1

Based on the implied emissions until 2030, the high challenges of the assumed post-2030 transition, and the assessment of carbon budgets in Section 2.2.2, global warming is assessed to exceed 1.5°C if emissions stay at the levels implied by the NDCs until 2030

The chances of remaining below 1.5°C in these circumstances remain conditional upon geophysical properties that are uncertain, but these Earth system response uncertainties would have to serendipitously align beyond current median estimates in order for current NDCs to become consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. As a second line of evidence, peak cumulative CO 2 emissions derived from a 1.5°C pathway sensitivity analysis (

    <p>It is unclear whether following NDCs until 2030 would still allow global mean temperature to return to 1.5°C by 2100 after a temporary overshoot, due to the uncertainty associated with the Earth system response to net negative emissions after a peak (Section 2.2). Available IAM studies are working with reduced-form carbon cycle-climate models like MAGICC, which assume a largely symmetric Earthsystem response to positive and net negative CO 2 emissions. The IAM findings on returning warming to 1.5°C from NDCs after a temporary temperature overshoot are hence all conditional on this assumption.

An IAM comparison study found increasing challenges to implementing pathways with the same end-of-century carbon budgets after following NDCs until 2030 (

The majority of model experiments (four out of seven) failed to produce NDC pathways that would return cumulative CO 2 emissions over the 2016-2100 period to 200 GtCO 2 , indicating limitations to the availability and timing of CDR. The few such pathways that were identified show highly disruptive features in 2030 (including abrupt transitions from moderate to very large emissions reduction and low carbon energy deployment rates) indicating a high risk that the required post-2030 transformations are too steep and abrupt to be achieved by the mitigation measures in the models (high confidence). NDC pathways aiming for a cumulative 2016-2100 CO 2 emissions budget of 800 GtCO 2 were more readily obtained

(2018) find 90 (80-120) GtCO 2 additional emissions until 2030, growing to 240 (190-260) GtCO 2 by 2050 and 290 (200-200) GtCO 2 by 2100. As a result, peak warming is about 0.2°C</div>

   <div>
    <div class="head">Energy Supply</div>
    <p>Several energy supply characteristics are evident in 1.5°C pathways assessed in this section: (i) growth in the share of energy derived from low-carbon-emitting sources (including renewables, nuclear and fossil fuel with CCS) and a decline in the overall share of fossil fuels without CCS (Section 2.4.2.1), (ii) rapid decline in the carbon intensity of electricity generation simultaneous with further electrification of energy end-use (Section 2.4.2.2), and (iii) the growth in the use of CCS applied to fossil and biomass carbon in most 1.5°C pathways (Section 2.4.2.3).</p>

Both show an increasing share of electricity accompanied by a rapid decline in the carbon intensity of electricity. Both also show a generally slower decline in the carbon intensity of the residual fuel mix, which arises from the decarbonization of liquids, gases and solids provided to industry, residential and commercial activities, and the transport sector.
    </p>
    <p>The largest differences between 1.5°C and 2°C pathways are seen in the first half of the century

Those scenarios that are available, however, show a faster decline in the carbon intensity of electricity generation and residual fuel mix by 2030 than most pathways that are projected to temporarily overshoot 1.5°C and return by 2100 (or 2°C pathways). The Below-1.5°C pathways also appear to differentiate themselves from the other pathways as early as 2030 through reductions in final energy demand and increases in electricity share

    <p>The share of energy from renewable sources (including biomass, hydro, solar, wind and geothermal) increases in all 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot, with the renewable energy share of primary energy reaching 38-88% in 2050

    <p>Nuclear power increases its share in most 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot by 2050, but in some pathways both the absolute capacity and share of power from nuclear generators decrease

Some 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot no longer see a role for nuclear fission by the end of the century, while others project about 95 EJ yr −1 of nuclear power in 2100

    <p>The share of primary energy provided by total fossil fuels decreases from 2020 to 2050 in all 1.5°C pathways, but trends for oil, gas and coal differ (Table 2.6). By 2050, the share of primary energy from coal decreases to 0-11% across 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot, with an interquartile range of 1-7%. From 2020 to 2050 the primary energy supplied by oil changes by −93 to −9% (interquartile range −77 to −39%); natural gas changes by −88 to +85% (interquartile range −62 to −13%), with varying levels of CCS. Pathways with higher use of coal and gas tend to deploy CCS to control their carbon emissions (see Section 2.4.2.3). As the energy transition is accelerated by several decades in 1.5°C pathways compared to 2°C pathways, residual fossilfuel use (i.e., fossil fuels not used for electricity generation) without CCS is generally lower in 2050 than in 2°C pathways, while combined hydro, solar, and wind power deployment is generally higher than in 2°C pathways

    </p>
    <p>In addition to the 1.5°C pathways included in the scenario database (Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.3), there are other analyses in the literature including, for example, sector-based analyses of energy demand and supply options. Even though they were not necessarily developed in the context of the 1.5°C target, they explore in greater detail some options for deep reductions in GHG emissions.

These analyses could, provided their assumptions prove plausible, expand the range of 1.5°C pathways.
    </p>
    <p>In summary, the share of primary energy from renewables increases while that from coal decreases across 1.5°C pathways (high confidence). This statement is true for all 1.5°C pathways in the scenario database and associated literature (Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.3), and is consistent with the additional studies mentioned above, an increase in energy supply from lower-carbon-intensity energy supply, and a decrease in energy supply from higher-carbonintensity energy supply.

Wind, solar, and biomass together make a major contribution in 2050, although the share for each spans a wide range across 1.5°C pathways 
     <ref type="figure" coords="42,136.77,687.16,44.38,11.20" target="#fig_0" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Figure 2.16)</ref>. Fossil fuels on the other hand have a decreasing role in electricity supply, with their share falling to 0-25% by 2050 (Table 2.7).
    </p>
    <p>In summary, 1.5°C pathways include a rapid decline in the carbon intensity of electricity and an increase in electrification of energy enduse (high confidence). This is the case across all 1.5°C pathways and their associated literature (Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.3), with pathway trends that extend those seen in past decades, and results that are consistent with additional analyses (see Section 2.4.2.2).</p>

    <p>Studies have shown the importance of CCS for deep mitigation pathways (

This remains a valid finding for those 1.5°C and 2°C pathways that do not radically reduce energy demand or do not offer carbon-neutral alternatives to liquids and gases that do not rely on bioenergy.
    </p>
    <p>There is a wide range of CCS that is deployed across 1.5°C pathways

For example, the LED pathway has no CCS, whereas other pathways, such as the S5 pathway, rely on a large amount of BECCS to get to net-zero carbon emissions. The cumulative fossil and biomass CO 2 stored through 2050 ranges from zero to 300 GtCO 2 across 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot, with zero up to 140 GtCO 2 from biomass captured and stored. Some pathways have very low fossil-fuel use overall, and consequently little CCS applied to fossil fuels. In 1.5°C pathways where the 2050 coal use remains above 20 EJ yr −1 in 2050, 33-100% is combined with CCS. While deployment of CCS for natural gas and coal vary widely across pathways, there is greater natural gas primary energy connected to CCS than coal primary energy connected to CCS in many pathways

However, storage capacity is not solely determined by the geological setting, and Bachu (2015) describes storage engineering practices that could further extend storage capacity estimates. In summary, the storage capacity of all of these global estimates is larger than the cumulative CO 2 stored via CCS in 1.5°C pathways over this century.

    <p>There is uncertainty in the future deployment of CCS given the limited pace of current deployment, the evolution of CCS technology that would be associated with deployment, and the current lack of incentives for large-scale implementation of CCS (

Given the importance of CCS in most mitigation pathways and its current slow pace of improvement, the large-scale deployment of CCS as an option depends on the further development of the technology in the near term.

    <div class="head">Energy End-Use Sectors</div>
    <p>Since the power sector is almost decarbonized by mid-century in both 1.5°C and 2°C pathways, major differences come from CO 2 emission reductions in end-use sectors. Energy-demand reductions are key and common features in 1.5˚C pathways, and they can be achieved by efficiency improvements and various specific demand-reduction measures. Another important feature is end-use decarbonization including by electrification, although the potential and challenges in each end-use sector vary significantly.</p>
    <p>In the following sections, the potential and challenges of CO 2 emission reductions towards 1.5°C and 2°C-consistent pathways are discussed for each end-use energy sector (industry, buildings, and transport). For this purpose, two types of pathways are analysed and compared: IAM (integrated assessment modelling) studies and sectoral (detailed) studies. IAM data are extracted from the database that was compiled for this assessment (see Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.3), and the sectoral data are taken from a recent series of publications; 'Energy Technology Perspectives' (ETP)

     <ref type="table" coords="44,443.14,711.16,25.42,11.20" target="#tab_2" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Table 2</ref>.1 in Section 2.1). Since the number of Below-1.5°C pathways is small, the following analyses focus only on the features of the 1.5°C-low-OS and 1.5°C-high-OS pathways (hereafter denoted together as 1.5°C overshoot pathways or IAM-1.5DS-OS) and 2°C-consistent pathways (IAM-2DS). In order to show the diversity of IAM pathways, we again show specific data from the four illustrative pathways archetypes used throughout this chapter (see Sections 2.1 and 2.3).
    </p>
    <p>IEA ETP-B2DS ('Beyond 2 Degrees') and ETP-2DS are pathways with a 50% chance of limiting temperature rise below 1.75°C and 2°C by 2100, respectively (IEA, 2017a). The IEA-66%2DS pathway keeps global mean temperature rise below 2°C, not just in 2100 but also over the course of the 21st century, with a 66% chance of being below 2°C by 2100 (OECD/IEA and IRENA, 2017). The comparison of CO 2 emission trajectories between ETP-B2DS and IAM-1.5DS-OS show that these are consistent up to 2060 
     <ref type="figure" coords="45,175.00,219.17,44.10,11.20" target="#fig_0" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Figure 2.18)</ref>. IEA scenarios assume that only a very low level of BECCS is deployed to help offset emissions in difficult-to-decarbonize sectors, and that global energy-related CO 2 emissions do not turn net negative at any time but stay at zero from 2060 to 2100 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="45,109.87,267.17,42.80,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(IEA, 2017a)</ref>. Therefore, although its temperature rise in 2100 is below 1.75°C rather than below 1.5°C, this scenario can give information related to a 1.5°C overshoot pathway up to 2050. The trajectory of IEA-66%2DS (also referred to in other publications as IEA's 'Faster Transition Scenario') lies between IAM-1.5DS-OS and IAM-2DS pathway ranges, and IEA-2DS stays in the range of 2°C-consistent IAM pathways. The Shell-Sky scenario aims to hold the temperature rise to well below 2°C, but it is a delayed action pathway relative to others, as can be seen in 
     <ref type="figure" coords="45,144.59,363.16,27.17,11.20" target="#fig_2" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Figure 2</ref>.18.
    </p>
    <p>Energy-demand reduction measures are key to reducing CO 2 emissions from end-use sectors for low-carbon pathways. The upstream energy reductions can be from several times to an order of magnitude larger than the initial end-use demand reduction. There are interdependencies among the end-use sectors and between energy-supply and end-use sectors, which elevate the importance of a wide, systematic approach. As shown in 
     <ref type="figure" coords="45,99.53,459.17,26.41,11.20" target="#fig_2" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Figure 2</ref>.19, global final energy consumption grows by 30% and 10% from 2010 to 2050 for 2°C-consistent and 1.5°C overshoot pathways from IAMs, respectively, while much higher growth of 75% is projected for reference scenarios. The ranges within a specific pathway class are due to a variety of factors as introduced in Section 2.3.1, as well as differences between modelling frameworks. The important energy efficiency and conservation improvements that facilitate many of the 1.5°C pathways raise the issue of potential rebound effects 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="45,56.70,555.15,59.33,11.20" target="#b395" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Saunders, 2015)</ref>, which, while promoting development, can make the achievement of low-energy demand futures more difficult than modelling studies anticipate (see Sections 2.5 and 2.6).
    </p>
    <p>Final energy demand is driven by demand in energy services for mobility, residential and commercial activities (buildings), and manufacturing. Projections of final energy demand depend heavily on assumptions about socio-economic futures as represented by the SSPs (Bauer et al., 2017) (see Sections 2.1, 2.3 and 2.5). The structure of this demand drives the composition of final energy use in terms of energy carriers (electricity, liquids, gases, solids, hydrogen etc.). This trend is more significant in 1.5°C pathways than 2°C pathways. Electrification continues throughout the second half of the century, leading to a 3.5-to 6-fold increase in electricity demand (interquartile range; median 4.5) by the end of the century relative to today 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="45,337.92,363.13,74.42,11.20" target="#b150" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Grubler et al., 2018;</ref>

     <ref type="figure" coords="45,332.36,387.13,27.74,11.20" target="#fig_2" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Figure 2</ref>.20), electrification is the primary means to decarbonize energy end-use sectors.
    </p>
    <p>The CO 2 emissions 6 of end-use sectors and carbon intensity are shown in 
     <ref type="figure" coords="45,324.90,435.17,28.17,11.20" target="#fig_2" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Figure 2</ref>.20. The projections of IAMs and IEA studies show rather different trends, especially in the carbon intensity. These differences come from various factors, including the deployment of CCS, the level of fuel switching and efficiency improvements, and the effect of structural and behavioural changes. IAM projections are generally optimistic for the industry sectors, but not for buildings and transport sectors. Although GDP increases by a factor of 3.4 from 2010 to 2050, the total energy consumption of end-use sectors grows by only about 30% and 20% in 1.5°C overshoot and 2°C-consistent pathways, respectively. However, CO 2 emissions would need to be reduced further to achieve the stringent temperature limits. 
     <ref type="figure" coords="45,467.75,555.17,27.43,11.20" target="#fig_2" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Figure 2</ref>.20 shows that the reduction in CO 2 emissions of end-use sectors is larger and more rapid in 1.5°C overshoot than 2°C-consistent pathways, while emissions from the power sector are already almost zero in 2050 in both sets of pathways, indicating that supply-side emissions reductions are almost fully exploited already in 2°C-consistent pathways (see to a very low level of around 10 gCO 2 MJ -1 , the carbon intensity of transport becomes the highest of any sector by 2040 due to its higher reliance on oil-based fuels. In the following subsections, the potential and challenges of CO 2 emission reduction in each end-use sector are discussed in detail.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <div class="head">Industry</div>
    <p>The industry sector is the largest end-use sector, both in terms of final energy demand and GHG emissions. Its direct CO 2 emissions currently account for about 25% of total energy-related and process CO 2 emissions, and emissions have increased at an average annual rate of 3.4% between 2000 and 2014, significantly faster than total CO 2 emissions 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="46,106.57,651.17,73.36,11.20" target="#b169" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Hoesly et al., 2018)</ref>. In addition to emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels, non-energy uses of fossil fuels in the petrochemical industry and metal smelting, as well as non-fossil fuel process emissions (e.g., from cement production) contribute a small amount (~5%) to the sector's CO 2 emissions inventory. Material industries are particularly energy and emissions intensive: together, the steel, non-ferrous metals, chemicals, non-metallic minerals, and pulp and paper industries accounted for close to 66% of final energy demand and 72% of direct industry-sector emissions in 2014 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="46,538.60,507.17,17.07,11.20;46,309.54,519.17,23.62,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(IEA, 2017a)</ref>. In terms of end-uses, the bulk of energy in manufacturing industries is required for process heating and steam generation, while most electricity (but smaller shares of total final energy) is used for mechanical work ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="46,388.97,555.16,74.92,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Banerjee et al., 2012;</ref>

    </p>
    <p>As shown in 
     <ref type="figure" coords="46,358.56,579.16,28.83,11.20" target="#fig_2" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Figure 2</ref>.21, a major share of the additional emission reductions required for 1.5°C-overshoot pathways compared to those in 2°C-consistent pathways comes from industry. Final energy, CO 2 emissions, and carbon intensity are consistent in IAM and sectoral studies, but in IAM-1.5°C-overshoot pathways the share of electricity is higher than IEA-B2DS (40% vs. 25%) and hydrogen is also considered to have a share of about 5% versus 0%. In 2050, final energy is increased by 30% and 5% compared with the 2010 level (red dotted line) for 1.5°C-overshoot and 2°C-consistent pathways, respectively, but CO 2 emissions are decreased by 80% and 50% and carbon intensity by 80% and 60%, respectively. This additional decarbonization is brought by switching to low-carbon fuels and CCS deployment. Broadly speaking, the industry sector's mitigation measures can be categorized in terms of the following five strategies: (i) reducing demand, (ii) energy efficiency, (iii) increasing electrification of energy demand, (iv) reducing the carbon content of non-electric fuels, and (v) deploying innovative processes and application of CCS. IEA ETP estimates the relative contribution of different measures for CO 2 emission reduction in their B2DS scenario compared with their reference scenario in 2050 as follows: energy efficiency 42%, innovative process and CCS 37%, switching to low-carbon fuels and feedstocks 13% and material efficiency (include efficient production and use to contribute to demand reduction) 8%. The remainder of this section delves more deeply into the potential mitigation contributions of these strategies as well as their limitations.
    </p>
    <p>Reduction in the use of industrial materials, while delivering similar services, or improving the quality of products could help to reduce energy demand and overall system-level CO 2 emissions. Strategies include using materials more intensively, extending product lifetimes, increasing recycling, and increasing inter-industry material synergies, such as clinker substitution in cement production ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="48,226.73,279.17,70.43,11.20" target="#b10" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Allwood et al., 2013;</ref>

Related to material efficiency, use of fossil-fuel feedstocks could shift to lower-carbon feedstocks, such as from oil to natural gas and biomass, and end-uses could shift to more sustainable materials, such as biomass-based materials, reducing the demand for energyintensive materials 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="48,119.10,339.16,37.71,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(IEA, 2017a</ref>).
    </p>
    <p>Reaping energy efficiency potentials hinges critically on advanced management practices, such as energy management systems, in industrial facilities as well as targeted policies to accelerate adoption of the best available technology (see Section 2.5). Although excess energy, usually as waste heat, is inevitable, recovering and reusing this waste heat under economically and technically viable conditions benefits the overall energy system. Furthermore, demand-side management strategies could modulate the level of industrial activity in line with the availability of resources in the power system. This could imply a shift away from peak demand and as power supply decarbonizes, this demand-shaping potential could shift some load to times with high portions of low-carbon electricity generation (IEA, 2017a).</p>
    <p>In the industry sector, energy demand increases more than 40% between 2010 and 2050 in baseline scenarios. However, in the 1.5°C-overshoot and 2°C-consistent pathways from IAMs, the increase is only 30% and 5%, respectively 
     <ref type="figure" coords="48,170.90,555.14,40.04,11.20" target="#fig_0" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Figure 2.21</ref>). These energy-demand reductions encompass both efficiency improvements in production and reductions in material demand, as most IAMs do not discern these two factors.
    </p>
    <p>CO 2 emissions from industry increase by 30% in 2050 compared to 2010 in baseline scenarios. By contrast, these emissions are reduced by 80% and 50% relative to 2010 levels in 1.5°C-overshoot and 2°C-consistent pathways from IAMs, respectively 
     <ref type="figure" coords="48,222.66,651.17,42.82,11.20" target="#fig_0" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Figure 2.21)</ref>. By midcentury, CO 2 emissions per unit of electricity are projected to decrease to near zero in both sets of pathways (see 
     <ref type="figure" coords="48,458.00,63.17,40.57,11.20" target="#fig_2" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Figure 2.20)</ref>. An accelerated electrification of the industry sector thus becomes an increasingly powerful mitigation option. In the IAM pathways, the share of electricity increases up to 30% by 2050 in 1.5°C-overshoot pathways ( 
     <ref type="figure" coords="48,534.72,99.17,20.62,11.20;48,309.54,111.17,3.64,11.20" target="#fig_2" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Figure 2</ref>.21) from 20% in 2010. Some industrial fuel uses are substantially more difficult to electrify than others, and electrification would have other effects on the process, including impacts on plant design, cost and available process integration options (IEA, 2017a). 7
    </p>
    <p>In 1.5°C-overshoot pathways, the carbon intensity of non-electric fuels consumed by industry decreases to 16 gCO 2 MJ −1 by 2050, compared to 25 gCO 2 MJ −1 in 2°C-consistent pathways. Considerable carbon intensity reductions are already achieved by 2030, largely via a rapid phase-out of coal. Biomass becomes an increasingly important energy carrier in the industry sector in deep-decarbonization pathways, but primarily in the longer term (in 2050, biomass accounts for only 10% of final energy consumption even in 1.5°C-overshoot pathways). In addition, hydrogen plays a considerable role as a substitute for fossilbased non-electric energy demands in some pathways.</p>
    <p>Without major deployment of new sustainability-oriented low-carbon industrial processes, the 1.5°C-overshoot target is difficult to achieve. Bringing such technologies and processes to commercial deployment requires significant investment in research and development. Some examples of innovative low-carbon process routes include: new steelmaking processes such as upgraded smelt reduction and upgraded direct reduced iron, inert anodes for aluminium smelting, and full oxyfuelling kilns for clinker production in cement manufacturing 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="48,538.98,387.15,16.69,11.20;48,309.55,399.15,19.28,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(IEA, 2017a</ref>).
    </p>
    <p>CCS plays a major role in decarbonizing the industry sector in the context of 1.5°C and 2°C pathways, especially in industries with higher process emissions, such as cement, iron and steel industries. In 1.5°C-overshoot pathways, CCS in industry reaches 3 GtCO 2 yr −1 by 2050, albeit with strong variations across pathways. Given the projected long-lead times and need for technological innovation, early scale-up of industry-sector CCS is essential to achieving the stringent temperature target. Development and demonstration of such projects has been slow, however. Currently, only two large-scale industrial CCS projects outside of oil and gas processing are in operation (Global CCS Institute, 2016). The estimated current cost 8 of CO 2 avoided (in USD2015) ranges from $20-27 tCO 2 −1 for gas processing and bioethanol production, and $60-138 tCO 2 −1 for fossil fuel-fired power generation up to $104-188 tCO 2 −1 for cement production

    <p>In 2014, the buildings sector accounted for 31% of total global final energy use, 54% of final electricity demand, and 8% of energy-related CO 2 emissions (excluding indirect emissions due to electricity). When 7 Electrification can be linked with the heating and drying process by electric boilers and electro-thermal processes, and also with low-temperature heat demand by heat pumps. In the iron and steel industry, hydrogen produced by electrolysis can be used as a reduction agent of iron instead of coke. Excess resources, such as black liquor, will provide the opportunity to increase the systematic efficiency to use for electricity generation.</p>

    <p>upstream electricity generation is taken into account, buildings were responsible for 23% of global energy-related CO 2 emissions, with onethird of those from direct fossil fuel consumption (IEA, 2017a).</p>
    <p>Past growth of energy consumption has been mainly driven by population and economic growth, with improved access to electricity, and higher use of electrical appliances and space cooling resulting from increasing living standards, especially in developing countries ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="49,60.61,567.16,61.38,11.20" target="#b265" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Lucon et al., 2014</ref>). These trends will continue in the future and in 2050, energy consumption is projected to increase by 20% and 50% compared to 2010 in the IAM-1.5°C-overshoot and 2°C-consistent pathways, respectively 
     <ref type="figure" coords="49,139.86,603.16,44.42,11.20" target="#fig_2" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Figure 2.22)</ref>. However, sectoral studies (IEA-ETP scenarios) show different trends. Energy consumption in 2050 decreases compared to 2010 in ETP-B2DS, and the reduction rate of CO 2 emissions is higher than in IAM pathways 
     <ref type="figure" coords="49,218.15,639.17,42.86,11.20" target="#fig_2" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Figure 2.22)</ref>. Mitigation options are often more widely covered in sectoral studies ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="49,262.06,651.17,40.78,11.20;49,56.69,663.17,15.12,11.20" target="#b265" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Lucon et al., 2014</ref>), leading to greater reductions in energy consumption and CO 2 emissions.
    </p>
    <p>Emissions reductions are driven by a clear tempering of energy demand and a strong electrification of the buildings sector. The share of electricity in 2050 is 60% in 1.5°C-overshoot pathways, compared with 50% in 2°C-consistent pathways 
     <ref type="figure" coords="49,460.59,471.17,45.29,11.20" target="#fig_2" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Figure 2.22)</ref>. Electrification contributes to the reduction of direct CO 2 emissions by replacing carbon-intensive fuels, like oil and coal. Furthermore, when combined with a rapid decarbonization of the power system (see Section 2.4.1) it also enables further reduction of indirect CO 2 emissions from electricity. Sectoral bottom-up models generally estimate lower electrification potentials for the buildings sector in comparison to global IAMs (see 
     <ref type="figure" coords="49,315.21,555.17,28.96,11.20" target="#fig_2" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Figure 2</ref>.22). Besides CO 2 emissions, increasing global demand for air conditioning in buildings may also lead to increased emissions of HFCs in this sector over the next few decades. Although these gases are currently a relatively small proportion of annual GHG emissions, their use in the air conditioning sector is expected to grow rapidly over the next few decades if alternatives are not adopted. However, their projected future impact can be significantly mitigated through better servicing and maintenance of equipment and switching of cooling gases

    <p>IEA-ETP (IEA, 2017a) analysed the relative importance of various technology measures toward the reduction of energy and CO 2 emissions in the buildings sector.

    <p>ETP-B2DS, energy demand for space heating and cooling is 33% lower in 2050 than in the reference scenario, and these reductions account for 54% of total reductions from the reference scenario. Energy savings from shifts to high-performance lighting, appliances, and water heating equipment account for a further 24% of the total reduction. The longterm, strategic shift away from fossil-fuel use in buildings, alongside the rapid uptake of energy efficient, integrated and renewable energy technologies (with clean power generation), leads to a drastic reduction of CO 2 emissions. In ETP-B2DS, the direct CO 2 emissions are 79% lower than the reference scenario in 2050, and the remaining emissions come mainly from the continued use of natural gas.</p>
    <p>The buildings sector is characterized by very long-living infrastructure, and immediate steps are hence important to avoid lock-in of inefficient carbon and energy-intensive buildings. This applies both to new buildings in developing countries where substantial new construction is expected in the near future and to retrofits of existing building stock in developed regions. This represents both a significant risk and opportunity for mitigation. 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="50,88.15,267.75,2.66,6.47" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">9</ref> A recent study highlights the benefits of deploying the most advanced renovation technologies, which would avoid lock-in into less efficient measures (

Aside from the effect of building envelope measures, adoption of energy-efficient technologies such as heat pumps and, more recently, light-emitting diodes is also important for the reduction of energy and CO 2 emissions (IEA, 2017a). Consumer choices, behaviour and building operation can also significantly affect energy consumption (see Chapter 4, Section 4.3).
    </p>

   <div>
    <div class="head">Transport</div>
    <p>Transport accounted for 28% of global final energy demand and 23% of global energy-related CO 2 emissions in 2014. Emissions increased by 2.5% annually between 2010 and 2015, and over the past half century the sector has witnessed faster emissions growth than any other. The transport sector is the least diversified energy end-use sector; the sector consumed 65% of global oil final energy demand, with 92% of transport final energy demand consisting of oil products (IEA, 2017a), suggesting major challenges for deep decarbonization.</p>
    <p>Final energy, CO 2 emissions, and carbon intensity for the transport sector are shown in 
     <ref type="figure" coords="50,127.53,519.17,28.61,11.20" target="#fig_2" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Figure 2</ref>.23. The projections of IAMs are more pessimistic than IEA-ETP scenarios, though both clearly project deep cuts in energy consumption and CO 2 emissions by 2050. For example, 1.5°C-overshoot pathways from IAMs project a reduction of 15% in energy consumption between 2015 and 2050, while ETP-B2DS projects a reduction of 30% 
     <ref type="figure" coords="50,128.13,579.17,44.99,11.20" target="#fig_2" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Figure 2.23)</ref>. Furthermore, IAM pathways are generally more pessimistic in the projections of CO 2 emissions and carbon intensity reductions. In AR5 ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="50,185.00,603.17,68.47,11.20" target="#b77" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Clarke et al., 2014;</ref>

Since the AR5, two important changes can be identified: rapid growth of electric vehicle sales in passenger cars, and more attention towards structural changes in this sector. The former contributes to reduction of CO 2 emissions and the latter to reduction of energy consumption.
    </p>
    <p>Deep emissions reductions in the transport sector would be achieved by several means. Technology-focused measures such as energy efficiency and fuel-switching are two of these. Structural changes that avoid or shift transport activity are also important. While the former solutions (technologies) always tend to figure into deep decarbonization pathways in a major way, this is not always the case with the latter, especially in IAM pathways. Comparing different types of global transport models, 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="50,372.02,171.16,56.48,11.20" target="#b514" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Yeh et al. (2016)</ref> find that sectoral (intensive) studies generally envision greater mitigation potential from structural changes in transport activity and modal choice. Though, even there, it is primarily the switching of passengers and freight from less-to more-efficient travel modes (e.g., cars, trucks and airplanes to buses and trains) that is the main strategy; other actions, such as increasing vehicle load factors (occupancy rates) and outright reductions in travel demand (e.g., as a result of integrated transport, land-use and urban planning), figure much less prominently. Whether these dynamics accurately reflect the actual mitigation potential of structural changes in transport activity and modal choice is a point of investigation. According to the recent IEA-ETP scenarios, the share of avoid (reduction of mobility demand) and shift (shifting to more efficient modes) measures in the reduction of CO 2 emissions from the reference to B2DS scenarios in 2050 amounts to 20% (IEA, 2017a).
    </p>
    <p>The potential and strategies to reduce energy consumption and CO 2 emissions differ significantly among transport modes. In ETP-B2DS, the shares of energy consumption and CO 2 emissions in 2050 for each mode are rather different (see 
     <ref type="table" coords="50,425.50,399.17,25.61,11.20" target="#tab_2" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Table 2</ref>.8), indicating the challenge of decarbonizing heavy-duty vehicles (HDV, trucks), aviation, and shipping. The reduction of CO 2 emissions in the whole sector from the reference scenario to ETP-B2DS is 60% in 2050, with varying contributions per mode 
     <ref type="table" coords="50,395.89,447.17,27.09,11.20" target="#tab_2" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Table 2</ref>.8). Since there is no silver bullet for this deep decarbonization, every possible measure would be required to achieve this stringent emissions outcome. The contribution of various measures for the CO 2 emission reduction from the reference scenario to the IEA-B2DS in 2050 can be decomposed to efficiency improvement (29%), biofuels (36%), electrification (15%), and avoid/ shift (20%) 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="50,352.98,519.17,42.67,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(IEA, 2017a)</ref>. It is noted that the share of electrification becomes larger compared with older studies, reflected by the recent growth of electric vehicle sales worldwide. Another new trend is the allocation of biofuels to each mode of transport. In IEA-B2DS, the total amount of biofuels consumed in the transport sector is 24EJ 10 in 2060, and allocated to LDV (light-duty vehicles, 17%), HDV (35%), aviation (28%), and shipping (21%), that is, more biofuels is allocated to the difficult-to-decarbonize modes (see 
     <ref type="table" coords="50,434.59,603.17,23.70,11.20" target="#tab_2" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Table 2</ref>.8).
    </p>
    <p>In road transport, incremental vehicle improvements (including engines) are relevant, especially in the short to medium term. Hybrid electric vehicles are also instrumental to enabling the transition from 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="50,51.02,688.72,2.24,5.45" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">9</ref> In this section, we only discuss the direct emissions from the sector, but the selection of building materials has a significant impact on the reduction of energy and emissions during production, such as shift from the steel and concrete to wood-based materials.

    <p>This is estimated for the biofuels produced in a "sustainable manner" from non-food crop feedstocks, which are capable of delivering significant lifecycle GHG emissions savings compared with fossil fuel alternatives, and which do not directly compete with food and feed crops for agricultural land or cause adverse sustainability impacts.</p>

Electrification is a powerful measure to decarbonize short-distance vehicles (passenger cars and two and three wheelers) and the rail sector. In road freight transport (trucks), systemic improvements (e.g., in supply chains, logistics, and routing) would be effective measures in conjunction with efficiency improvement of vehicles. Shipping and aviation are more challenging to decarbonize, while their demand growth is projected to be higher than other

In the near and medium term, this would be advanced biofuels while in the long term it could be hydrogen as direct use for shipping or an intermediate product for synthetic fuels for both modes (IEA, 2017a).</p>

     <ref type="figure" coords="52,51.02,111.17,27.02,11.20" target="#fig_2" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Figure 2</ref>.23, the projections of energy consumption, CO 2 emissions and carbon intensity are quite different between IAM and ETP scenarios. These differences can be explained by more weight on efficiency improvements and avoid/shift decreasing energy consumption, and the higher share of biofuels and electricity accelerating the speed of decarbonization in ETP scenarios. Although biofuel consumption and electric vehicle sales have increased significantly in recent years, the growth rates projected in these pathways would be unprecedented and far higher than has been experienced to date. The 1.5°C pathways require an acceleration of the mitigation solutions already featured in 2°C-consistent pathways (e.g., more efficient vehicle technologies operating on lower-carbon fuels), as well as those having received lesser attention in most global transport decarbonization pathways up to now (e.g., mode-shifting and travel demand management). Current-generation, global pathways generally do not include these newer transport sector developments, whereby technological solutions are related to shifts in traveller's behaviour.

Further assessments of AFOLU mitigation options are provided in other parts of this report and in the IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL). Chapter 4 provides an assessment of bioenergy (including feedstocks, see Section 4.3.1), livestock management (Section 4.3.1), reducing rates of deforestation and other land-based mitigation options (as mitigation and adaptation option, see Section 4.3.2), and BECCS, afforestation and reforestation options (including the bottom-up literature of their sustainable potential, mitigation cost and side effects, Section 4.3.7). Chapter 3 discusses impacts land-based CDR (Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3). Chapter 5 assesses the sustainable development implications of AFOLU mitigation, including impacts on biodiversity (Section 5.4). Finally, the SRCCL will undertake a more comprehensive assessment of land and climate change aspects. For the sake of complementarity, this section focusses on the magnitude and pace of land transitions in 1.5°C pathways, as well as on the implications of different AFOLU mitigation strategies for different land types. The interactions with other societal objectives and potential limitations of identified AFOLU measures link to these large-scale evolutions, but these are assessed elsewhere (see above).

    <p>Land-use changes until mid-century occur in the large majority of SSP pathways, both under stringent mitigation and in absence of mitigation

In the latter case, changes are mainly due to socio-economic drivers like growing demands for food, feed and wood products. General transition trends can be identified for many land types in 1.5°C pathways, which differ from those in baseline scenarios and depend on the interplay with mitigation in other sectors

Mitigation that demands land mainly occurs at the expense of agricultural land for food and feed production. Additionally, some biomass is projected to be grown on marginal land or supplied from residues and waste, but at lower shares. Land for second-generation energy crops (such as Miscanthus or poplar) expands by 2030 and 2050 in all available pathways that assume a cost-effective achievement of a 1.5°C temperature goal in 2100 
     <ref type="figure" coords="52,493.37,471.08,40.70,11.20" target="#fig_2" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Figure 2.24</ref>), but the scale depends strongly on underlying socio-economic assumptions (see later discussion of land pathway archetypes). Reducing rates of deforestation restricts agricultural expansion, and forest cover can expand strongly in 1.5°C and 2°C pathways alike compared to its extent in no-climate-policy baselines due to reduced deforestation and afforestation and reforestation measures. However, the extent to which forest cover expands varies highly across models in the literature, with some models projecting forest cover to stay virtually constant or decline slightly. This is due to whether afforestation and reforestation is included as a mitigation technology in these pathways and interactions with other sectors.
    </p>
    <p>As a consequence of other land-use changes, pasture land is generally projected to be reduced compared to both baselines in which no climate change mitigation action is undertaken and 2°C-consistent pathways. Furthermore, cropland for food and feed production decreases in most 1.5°C pathways, both compared to a no-climate baseline and relative to 2010. These reductions in agricultural land for food and feed production are facilitated by intensification on agricultural land and in livestock production systems (

However, there is uncertainty in the sign and magnitude of these future landuse changes (

The pace of projected cropland changes overlaps with historical trends over the past four decades, but in several cases also goes well beyond this range. By the 2030-2050 period, the projected reductions in pasture and potentially strong increases in forest cover imply a reversed dynamic compared to historical and baseline trends. This suggests that distinct policy and government measures would be needed to achieve forest increases, particularly in a context of projected increased bioenergy use.

    <p>Changes in the AFOLU sector are driven by three main factors: demand changes, efficiency of production, and policy assumptions

On the supply side, minor productivity growth in extensive livestock production systems is projected to lead to substantial CO 2 emission abatement, but the emission-saving potential of productivity gains in intensive systems is limited, mainly due to trade-offs with soil carbon stocks (

Finally, several mitigation measures that could affect these agricultural non-CO 2 emissions are not, or only to a limited degree, considered in the current integrated pathway literature (see Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.2). Such measures (like plant-based and synthetic proteins, methane inhibitors and vaccines in livestock, alternate wetting and drying in paddy rice, or nitrification inhibitors) are very diverse and differ in their development or deployment stages. Their potentials have not been explicitly assessed here.
    </p>
    <p>Pathways consistent with 1.5°C rely on one or more of the three strategies highlighted above (demand changes, efficiency gains, and policy assumptions), and can apply these in different configurations. For example, among the four illustrative archetypes used in this chapter (Section 2.1), the LED and S1 pathways focus on generally low resource and energy consumption (including healthy diets with low animal-calorie shares and low food waste) as well as significant agricultural intensification in combination with high levels of nature protection. Under such assumptions, comparably small amounts of land are needed for land-demanding mitigation activities such as BECCS and afforestation and reforestation, leaving the land footprint for energy crops in 2050 virtually the same compared to 2010 levels for the LED pathway. In contrast, future land-use developments can look very different under the resource-and energy-intensive S5 pathway that includes less healthy diets with high animal shares and high shares of food waste 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="55,389.18,399.14,85.05,11.20" target="#b462" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Tilman and Clark, 2014;</ref>

In such pathways, climate change mitigation strategies strongly depend on the availability of CDR through BECCS ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="55,392.41,459.14,81.93,11.20" target="#b179" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Humpenöder et al., 2014</ref>). As a consequence, the S5 pathway sources significant amounts of biomass through bioenergy crop expansion in combination with agricultural intensification. Also, further policy assumptions can strongly affect land-use developments, highlighting the importance for land use of making appropriate policy choices. For example, within the SSP set, some pathways rely strongly on a policy to incentivize afforestation and reforestation for CDR together with BECCS, which results in an expansion of forest area and a corresponding increase in terrestrial carbon stock. Finally, the variety of pathways illustrates how policy choices in the AFOLU and other sectors strongly affect land-use developments and associated sustainable development interactions (Chapter 5, Section 5.4) in 1.5°C pathways.
    </p>
    <p>The choice of strategy or mitigation portfolio impacts the GHG dynamics of the land system and other sectors (see Section 2.3), as well as the synergies and trade-offs with other environmental and societal objectives (see Section 2.5.3 and Chapter 5, Section 5.4). For example, AFOLU developments in 1.5°C pathways range from strategies that differ by almost an order of magnitude in their projected land requirements for bioenergy

High agricultural yields and application of intensified animal husbandry, implementation of best-available technologies for reducing non-CO 2 emissions, or lifestyle changes including a less-meat-intensive diet and less CO 2 -intensive transport modes, have been identified as allowing for such a forest expansion and reduced footprints from bioenergy without compromising food security

Finally, this assessment did not look into the literature of agricultural sector models which could provide important additional detail and granularity to the discussion presented here. 12 This limits their ability to capture the full mitigation potentials and benefits between scenarios. An in-depth assessment of these aspects lies outside the scope of this Special Report. However, their existence affects the confidence assessment of the AFOLU transition in 1.5°C pathways.
    </p>
    <p>Despite the limitations of current modelling approaches, there is high agreement and robust evidence across models and studies that the AFOLU sector plays an important role in stringent mitigation pathways. The findings from these multiple lines of evidence also result in high confidence that AFOLU mitigation strategies can vary significantly based on preferences and policy choices, facilitating the exploration of strategies that can achieve multiple societal objectives simultaneously (see also Section 2.5.3). At the same time, given the many uncertainties and limitations, only low to medium confidence can be attributed by this assessment to the more extreme AFOLU developments found in the pathway literature, and low to medium confidence to the level of residual non-CO 2 emissions.</p>

    </p>
    <p>The available literature indicates that mitigation pathways in line with 1.5°C pathways would require stringent and integrated policy interventions (very high confidence). Higher policy ambition often takes the form of stringent economy-wide emission targets (and resulting peak-and-decline of emissions), larger coverage of NDCs to more gases and sectors (e.g., land-use, international aviation), much lower energy and carbon intensity rates than historically seen, carbon prices much higher than the ones observed in real markets, increased climate finance, global coordinated policy action, and implementation of additional initiatives (e.g., by non-state actors) (Sections 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5.2). The diversity (beyond explicit carbon pricing) and effectiveness of policy portfolios are of prime importance, particularly in the shortterm (

For instance, deep decarbonization pathways in line with a 2˚C target (covering 74% of global energy-system emissions) include a mix of stringent regulation (e.g., building codes, minimum performance standards), carbon pricing mechanisms and R&amp;D (research and development) innovation policies (

Effective planning (including compact city measures) and integrated regulatory frameworks are also key drivers in the IEA-ETP B2DS study for the transport sector (IEA, 2017a). Effective urban planning can reduce GHG emissions from urban transport between 20% and 50%

Comprehensive policy frameworks would be needed if the decarbonization of the power system is pursued while increasing end-use electrification (including transport) (IEA, 2017a). Technology policies (e.g., feed-in-tariffs), financing instruments, carbon pricing and system integration management driving the rapid adoption of renewable energy technologies are critical for the decarbonization of electricity generation

A lack of integrated policy portfolios can increase the risks of trade-offs between mitigation approaches and sustainable development objectives (see Sections 2.5.3 and 5.4). However, more detailed analysis is needed about realistic (less disruptive) policy trajectories until 2030 that can strengthen near-term mitigation action and meaningfully decrease post-2030 challenges (see Chapter 4, Section 4.4).

    <p>Whereas the policy frameworks and enabling conditions identified above pertain to the 'idealized' dimension of mitigation pathways, aspects related to 1.5°C mitigation pathways in practice are of prime importance. For example, issues related to second-best stringency levels, international cooperation, public acceptance, distributional consequences, multilevel governance, non-state actions, compliance levels, capacity building, rebound effects, linkages across highly heterogeneous policies, sustained behavioural change, finance and intra-and inter-generational issues need to be considered (see Chapter 4, Section 4.4) (

Furthermore, policies interact with a wide portfolio of preexisting policy instruments that address multiple areas (e.g., technology markets, economic growth, poverty alleviation, climate adaptation) and deal with various market failures (e.g., information asymmetries) and behavioural aspects (e.g., heuristics) that prevent or hinder mitigation actions (

    <p>Two approaches have been commonly used to assess alternative emissions pathways: cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and cost-benefit analysis (CBA). CEA aims at identifying emissions pathways minimising the total mitigation costs of achieving a given warming or GHG limit ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="58,185.26,399.17,62.51,11.20" target="#b77" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Clarke et al., 2014</ref>). CBA has the goal to identify the optimal emissions trajectory minimising the discounted flows of abatement expenditures and monetized climate change damages

Negative and positive impacts are monetized, discounted and the net value is expressed as an equivalent loss of consumption today. The SCC can be evaluated for any emissions pathway under policy consideration 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="58,199.34,459.17,44.26,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Rose, 2012;</ref>

    </p>
    <p>Along the optimal trajectory determined by CBA, the SCC equals the discounted value of the marginal abatement cost of a metric ton of CO 2 emissions. Equating the present value of future damages and marginal abatement costs includes a number of critical value judgements in the formulation of the social welfare function (SWF), particularly in how non-market damages and the distribution of damages across countries and individuals and between current and future generations are valued ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="58,419.75,519.17,63.75,11.20" target="#b229" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Kolstad et al., 2014</ref>). For example, since climate damages accrue to a larger extent farther in the future and can persist for many years, assumptions and approaches to determine the social discount rate (normative 'prescriptive' vs. positive 'descriptive') and social welfare function (e.g., discounted utilitarian SWF vs. undiscounted prioritarian SWF) can heavily influence CBA outcomes and associated estimates of SCC (

    </p>
    <p>In CEA, the marginal abatement cost of carbon is determined by the climate goal under consideration. It equals the shadow price of carbon associated with the goal which in turn can be interpreted as the willingness to pay for imposing the goal as a political constraint. Emissions prices are usually expressed in carbon (equivalent) prices using the GWP-100 metric as the exchange rate for pricing emissions of non-CO 2 GHGs controlled under internationally climate agreements (like CH 4 , N 2 O and fluorinated gases, see Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1). 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="58,210.34,639.75,5.32,6.47" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">13</ref> Since policy goals like the goals of limiting warming to 1.5°C or well below 2°C do not directly result from a money metric trade-off between mitigation and damages, associated shadow prices can differ from the SCC in a CBA. In CEA, value judgments are to a large extent concentrated in the choice of climate goal and related implications, while more explicit assumptions about social values are required to perform CBA. For example, in CEA assumptions about the social discount rate no longer affect the overall abatement levels now set by the climate goal, but the choice and timing of investments in individual measures to reach these levels.

    <p>Although CBA-based and CEA-based assessment are both subject to large uncertainty about socio-techno-economic trends, policy developments and climate response, the range of estimates for the SCC along an optimal trajectory determined by CBA is far wider than for estimates of the shadow price of carbon in CEA-based approaches. In CBA, the value judgments about inter-and intragenerational equity combined with uncertainties in the climate damage functions assumed, including their empirical basis, are important

    <p>An important question is how results from CEA-and CBA-type approaches can be compared and synthesized. Such synthesis needs to be done with care, since estimates of the shadow price of carbon under the climate goal and SCC estimates from CBA might not be directly comparable due to different tools, approaches and assumptions used to derive them. Acknowledging this caveat, the SCC literature has identified a range of factors, assumptions and value judgements that support SCC values above $100 tCO 2 −1 that are also found as net present values of the shadow price of carbon in 1.5°C pathways. These factors include accounting for tipping points in the climate system

Since 2008, the U.S. government has used SCC estimates to assess the benefits and costs related to CO 2 emissions resulting from federal policymaking

    <p>The use of the SCC for policy appraisals is, however, not straightforward in an SDG context.

    <p>The price of carbon assessed here is fundamentally different from the concepts of optimal carbon price in a cost-benefit analysis, or the social cost of carbon (see Cross-Chapter Box 5 in this chapter and Chapter 3, Section 3.5.2). Under a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) modelling framework, prices for carbon (mitigation costs) reflect the stringency of mitigation requirements at the margin (i.e., cost of mitigating one extra unit of emission). Explicit carbon pricing is briefly addressed here to the extent it pertains to the scope of Chapter 2. For detailed policy issues about carbon pricing see Section 4.4.5.</p>
    <p>Based on data available for this special report, the price of carbon varies substantially across models and scenarios, and their values increase with mitigation efforts (see 
     <ref type="figure" coords="60,186.05,255.16,28.63,11.20" target="#fig_2" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Figure 2</ref>.26) (high confidence). in 2100. Values for 1.5°C-low-OS pathway are relatively higher than 1.5°C-high-OS pathway in 2030, but the difference decreases over time, particularly between 2050 and 2070. This is because in 1.5°C-high-OS pathways there is relatively less mitigation activity in the first half of the century, but more in the second half. The low energy demand (LED, P1 in the Summary for Policymakers) scenario exhibits the lowest values across the illustrative pathway archetypes. As a whole, the global average discounted price of emissions across 1.5°C-and 2°C pathways differs by a factor of four across models (assuming a 5% annual discount rate, comparing to Below-1.5°C and 1.5°C-low-OS pathways). If 1.5°C-high-OS pathways (with peak warming 0.1-0.4°C higher than 1.5°C) or pathways with very large land-use sinks are also considered, the differential value is reduced to a limited degree, from a factor 4 to a factor 3. The increase in mitigation costs between 1.5°C and 2°C pathways is based on a direct comparison of pathway pairs from the same model and the same study in which the 1.5°C pathway assumes a significantly smaller carbon budget compared to the 2°C pathway (e.g., 600 GtCO 2 smaller in the CD-LINKS and ADVANCE studies). This assumption is the main driver behind the increase in the price of carbon (

Assuming global implementation of a mix of regionally existing best-practice policies (mostly regulatory policies in the electricity, industry, buildings, transport and agricultural sectors) and moderate carbon pricing (between 5-20 USD2010 tCO 2 ) to generate a 1.5°C pathway for the U.S. electric sector (

    <p>In summary, new analyses are consistent with AR5 and show that the price of carbon increases significantly if a higher level of stringency is pursued (high confidence). Values vary substantially across models, scenarios and socio-economic, technology and policy assumptions. While an explicit carbon pricing mechanism is central to prompt mitigation scenarios compatible with 1.5°C pathways, a complementary mix of stringent policies is required.</p>

Global energy-system investments in the year 2016 are estimated at approximately 1.7 trillion USD2010 (approximately 2.2% of global GDP and 10% of gross capital formation), of which 0.23 trillion USD2010 was for incremental end-use energy efficiency and the remainder for supply-side capacity installations

Notwithstanding, the trend for global energy investments has been generally upward over the last two decades: increasing about threefold between 2000 and 2012, then levelling off for three years before declining in both 2015 and 2016 as a result of the oil price collapse and simultaneous capital cost reductions for renewables

    <p>Estimates of demand-side investments, either in total or for incremental efficiency efforts, are more uncertain, mainly due to a lack of reliable statistics and definitional issues about what exactly is counted towards a demand-side investment and what the reference should be for estimating incremental efficiency

The broad definition defines end-use technologies as the technological systems purchasable by final consumers in order to provide a useful service, for example, heating and air conditioning systems, cars, freezers, or aircraft. The narrow definition sets the boundary at the specific energy-using components or subsystems of the larger enduse technologies (e.g., compressor, car engine, heating element). Based on these two definitions, demand-side energy investments for the year 2005 were estimated about 1-3.5 trillion USD2010 (central estimate 1.7 trillion USD2010) using the broad definition and 0.1-0.6 trillion USD2010 (central estimate 0.3 trillion USD2010) using the narrower definition. Due to these definitional issues, demand-side investment projections are uncertain, often underreported, and difficult to compare. Global IAMs often do not fully and explicitly represent all the various measures that could improve end-use efficiency.

    <p>Research carried out by six global IAM teams found that 1.5°C-consistent climate policies would require a marked upscaling of energy system supply-side investments (resource extraction, power generation, fuel conversion, pipelines/transmission, and energy storage) between now and mid-century, reaching levels of between 1.6-3.8 trillion USD2010 yr −1 globally on average over the 2016-2050 timeframe

How these investment needs compare to those in a policy baseline scenario is uncertain: they could be higher, much higher, or lower. Investments in the policy baselines from these same models are 1.6-2.7 trillion USD2010 yr −1 . Much hinges on the reductions in energy demand growth embodied in the 1.5°C pathways, which require investing in energy efficiency. Studies suggest that annual supply-side investments by mid-century could be lowered by around 10% 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="62,137.76,411.17,81.83,11.20" target="#b293" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(McCollum et al., 2018)</ref> and in some cases up to 50%

However, the degree to which these supply-side reductions would be partially offset by an increase in demand-side investments is unclear.

    <p>Some trends are robust across scenarios 
     <ref type="figure" coords="62,197.42,483.16,43.80,11.20" target="#fig_2" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Figure 2.27)</ref>. First, pursuing 1.5°C mitigation efforts requires a major reallocation of the investment portfolio, implying a financial system aligned to mitigation challenges. The path laid out by countries' current NDCs until 2030 will not drive these structural changes; and despite increasing low-carbon investments in recent years (IEA, 2016b; Frankfurt School-UNEP Centre/ BNEF, 2017), these are not yet aligned with 1.5°C. Second, additional annual average energy-related investments for the period 2016 to 2050 in pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C compared to the baseline (i.e., pathways without new climate policies beyond those in place today) are estimated by the models employed in 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="62,204.04,603.14,82.45,11.20" target="#b293" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">McCollum et al. (2018)</ref> to be around 830 billion USD2010 (range of 150 billion to 1700 billion USD2010 across six models). This compares to total annual average energy supply investments in 1.5°C pathways of 1460 to 3510 billion USD2010 and total annual average energy demand investments of 640 to 910 billion USD2010 for the period 2016 to 2050. Total energyrelated investments increase by about 12% (range of 3% to 24%) in 1.5°C pathways relative to 2°C pathways. Average annual investment in low-carbon energy technologies and energy efficiency are upscaled by roughly a factor of six (range of factor of 4 to 10) by 2050 compared to 2015. Specifically, annual investments in low-carbon energy are projected to average 0.8-2.9 trillion USD2010 yr −1 globally to 2050 in 1.5°C pathways, overtaking fossil investments globally already by around 2025 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="62,358.55,75.17,83.06,11.20" target="#b293" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(McCollum et al., 2018)</ref>. The bulk of these investments are projected to be for clean electricity generation, particularly solar and wind power (0.09-1.0 trillion USD2010 yr −1 and 0.1-0.35 trillion USD2010 yr −1 , respectively) as well as nuclear power (0.1-0.25 trillion USD2010 yr −1 ). Third, the precise apportioning of these investments depends on model assumptions and societal preferences related to mitigation strategies and policy choices (see Sections 2.1 and 2.3). Investments for electricity transmission and distribution and storage are also scaled up in 1.5°C pathways (0.3-1.3 trillion USD2010 yr −1 ), given their widespread electrification of the end-use sectors (see Section 2.4). Meanwhile, 1.5°C pathways see a reduction in annual investments for fossil-fuel extraction and unabated fossil electricity generation (to 0.3-0.85 trillion USD2010 yr −1 on average over the 2016-2050 period). Investments in unabated coal are halted by 2030 in most 1.5°C projections, while the literature is less conclusive for investments in unabated gas

This illustrates how mitigation strategies vary between models, but in the real world should be considered in terms of their societal desirability (see Section 2.5.3). Furthermore, some fossil investments made over the next few years -or those made in the last few -will likely need to be retired prior to fully recovering their capital investment or before the end of their operational lifetime (

    </p>
    <p>Until now, IAM investment analyses of 1.5°C pathways have focused on middle-of-the-road socio-economic and technological development futures (SSP2) ( 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="62,365.41,591.17,60.46,11.20" target="#b118" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Fricko et al., 2017</ref>). Consideration of a broader range of development futures would yield different outcomes in terms of the magnitudes of the projected investment levels. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the magnitude of supply-side investments as well as the investment portfolio do not change strongly across the SSPs for a given level of climate policy stringency 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="62,423.34,651.16,75.26,11.20" target="#b293" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(McCollum et al., 2018</ref>). With only one dedicated multimodel comparison study published, there is limited to medium evidence available. For some features, there is high agreement across modelling frameworks leading, for example, to medium to high confidence that limiting global temperature increase to 1.5°C would require a major reallocation of the investment portfolio. Given the limited amount of sensitivity cases available compared to the default SSP2 assumptions, medium confidence can be assigned to the specific energy and climate mitigation investment estimates reported here.

    <p>Assumptions in modelling studies indicate a number of challenges. For instance, access to finance and mobilization of funds are critical

    </p>
    <p>In summary and despite inherent uncertainties, the emerging literature indicates a gap between current investment patterns and those compatible with 1.5°C (or 2°C) pathways (limited to medium evidence, high agreement). Estimates and assumptions from modelling frameworks suggest a major shift in investment patterns and entail a financial system effectively aligned with mitigation challenges (high confidence). Whiskers show the full range around the multimodel means. T&amp;D stands for transmission and distribution, and CCS stands for carbon capture and storage. Global cumulative carbon dioxide emissions, from fossil fuels and industrial processes (FF&amp;I) but excluding land use, over the 2016-2100 timeframe range from 880 to 1074 GtCO 2 (multimodel mean: 952 GtCO 2 ) in the '2°C' pathway and from 206 to 525 GtCO 2 (mean: 390 GtCO 2 ) in the '1.5°C' pathway.</p>

    <div class="head">Sustainable Development Features of 1.5°C Pathways</div>
    <p>Potential synergies and trade-offs between 1.5°C mitigation pathways and different sustainable development (SD) dimensions (see CrossChapter Box 4 in Chapter 1) are an emerging field of research. Chapter 5, Section 5.4 assesses interactions between individual mitigation measures with other societal objectives, as well as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) ( 
     <ref type="table" coords="64,420.62,51.17,26.33,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Table 5</ref>.1). This section synthesized the Chapter 5 insights to assess how these interactions play out in integrated 1.5°C pathways, and the four illustrative pathway archetypes of this chapter in particular (see Section 2.1). Information from integrated pathways is combined with the interactions assessed in Chapter 5 and aggregated for each SDG, with a level of confidence attributed to each interaction based on the amount and agreement of the scientific evidence (see Chapter 5). 28 shows how the scale and combination of individual mitigation measures (i.e., their mitigation portfolios) influence the extent of synergies and trade-offs with other societal objectives. All pathways generate multiple synergies with sustainable development dimensions and can advance several other SDGs simultaneously. Some, however, show higher risks for trade-offs. An example is increased biomass production and its potential to increase pressure on land and water resources, food production, and biodiversity and to reduce air quality when combusted inefficiently. At the same time, mitigation actions in energy-demand sectors and behavioural response options with appropriate management of rebound effects can advance multiple SDGs simultaneously, more so than energy supply-side mitigation actions (see Chapter 5, Section 5.4, 
     <ref type="table" coords="65,183.65,195.16,24.67,11.20" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Table 5</ref>.1 and

Of the four pathway archetypes used in this chapter (LED, S1, S2, and S5, referred to as P1, P2, P3, and P4 in the Summary for Policymakers), the S1 and LED pathways show the largest number of synergies and least number of potential trade-offs, while for the S5 pathway more potential trade-offs are identified. In general, pathways with emphasis on demand reductions and policies that incentivize behavioural change, sustainable consumption patterns, healthy diets and relatively low use of CDR (or only afforestation) show relatively more synergies with individual SDGs than other pathways.
    </p>
    <p>There is robust evidence and high agreement in the pathway literature that multiple strategies can be considered to limit warming to 1.5°C (see Sections 2.1.3, 2.3 and 2.4). Together with the extensive evidence on the existence of interactions of mitigation measures with other societal objectives (Chapter 5, Section 5.4), this results in high confidence that the choice of mitigation portfolio or strategy can markedly affect the achievement of other societal objectives. For instance, action on SLCFs has been suggested to facilitate the achievement of SDGs (

Reductions in both surface aerosols and ozone through methane reductions provide health and ecosystem co-benefits

    <div class="head">Knowledge Gaps</div>
    <p>This section summarizes the knowledge gaps articulated in earlier sections of the chapter.</p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <div class="head">Geophysical Understanding</div>
    <p>Knowledge gaps are associated with the carbon cycle response, the role of non-CO 2 emissions and the evaluation of an appropriate historic baseline.</p>
    <p>Quantifying how the carbon cycle responds to negative emissions is an important knowledge gap for strong mitigation pathways (Section 2.2). Earth system feedback uncertainties are important to consider for the longer-term response, particularly in how permafrost melting might affect the carbon budget (Section 2.2). Future research and ongoing observations over the next years will provide a better indication as to how the 2006-2015 base period compares with the long-term trends and might at present bias the carbon budget estimates.</p>
    <p>The future emissions of short-lived climate forcers and their temperature response are a large source of uncertainty in 1.5°C pathways, having a greater relative uncertainty than in higher CO 2 emission pathways. Their global emissions, their sectoral and regional disaggregation, and their climate response are generally less well quantified than for CO 2 (Sections 2.2 and 2.3). Emissions from the agricultural sector, including land-use based mitigation options, in 1.5°C pathways constitute the main source of uncertainty here and are an important gap in understanding the potential achievement of stringent mitigation scenarios (Sections 2.3 and 2.4). This also includes uncertainties surrounding the mitigation potential of the long-lived GHG nitrous oxide (Sections 2.3 and 2.4).</p>
    <p>There is considerable uncertainty in how future emissions of aerosol precursors will affect the effective radiative forcing from aerosol-cloud interaction. The potential future warming from mitigation of these emissions reduces remaining carbon budgets and increases peak temperatures (Section 2.2). The potential co-benefits of mitigating air pollutants and how the reduction in air pollution may affect the carbon sink are also important sources of uncertainty (Sections 2.2 and 2.5).</p>
    <p>The pathway classification employed in this chapter employs results from the MAGICC model with its AR5 parameter sets. The alternative representation of the relationship between emissions and effective radiative forcing and response in the FAIR model would lead to a different classification that would make 1.5°C targets more achievable (Section 2.2 and Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.1). Such a revision would significantly alter the temperature outcomes for the pathways and, if the result is found to be robust, future research and assessments would need to adjust their classifications accordingly. Any possible high bias in the MAGICC response may be partly or entirely offset by missing Earth system feedbacks that are not represented in either climate emulator and that would act to increase the temperature response (Section 2.2). For this assessment report, any possible bias in the MAGICC setup applied in this and earlier reports is not established enough in the literature to change the classification approach. However, we only place medium confidence in the classification adopted by the chapter.</p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <div class="head">Integrated Assessment Approaches</div>
    <p>IAMs attempt to be as broad as possible in order to explore interactions between various societal subsystems, like the economy, land, and energy system. They hence include stylized and simplified representations of these subsystems. Climate damages, avoided impacts and societal co-benefits of the modelled transformations remain largely unaccounted for and are important knowledge gaps. Furthermore, rapid technological changes and uncertainties about input data present continuous challenges.</p>
    <p>The IAMs used in this report do not account for climate impacts (Section 2.1), and similarly, none of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) projections in the mitigation pathway literature assessed in this chapter included the feedback of climate damages on economic growth (Section 2.3). Although some IAMs do allow for climate impact feedbacks in their modelling frameworks, particularly in their land components, such feedbacks were by design excluded in pathways developed in the context of the SSP framework. The SSP framework aims at providing an integrative framework for the assessment of climate change adaptation and mitigation. IAMs are typically developed to inform the mitigation component of this question, while the assessment of impacts is carried out by specialized impact models. However, the use of a consistent set of socio-economic drivers embodied by the SSPs allows for an integrated assessment of climate change impacts and mitigation challenges at a later stage. Further integration of these two strands of research will allow a better understanding of climate impacts on mitigation studies.</p>
    <p>Many of the IAMs that contributed mitigation pathways to this assessment include a process-based description of the land system in addition to the energy system, and several have been extended to cover air pollutants and water use. These features make them increasingly fit to explore questions beyond those that touch upon climate mitigation only. The models do not, however, fully account for all constraints that could affect realization of pathways (Section 2.1).</p>
    <p>While the representation of renewable energy resource potentials, technology costs and system integration in IAMs has been updated since AR5, bottom-up studies find higher mitigation potentials in the industry, buildings, and transport sector in that realized by selected pathways from IAMs, indicating the possibility to strengthen sectoral decarbonization strategies compared to the IAM 1.5°C pathways assessed in this chapter (Section 2.1).</p>
    <p>Studies indicate that a major shift in investment patterns is required to limit global warming to 1.5°C. This assessment would benefit from a more explicit representation and understanding of the financial sector within the modelling approaches. Assumptions in modelling studies imply low-to-zero transaction costs for market agents and that regulatory oversight mechanisms and fiduciary duty need to be highly robust to guarantee stable and credible financial markets in the long term. This area can be subject to high uncertainty, however. The heterogeneity of actors (e.g., banks, insurance companies, asset managers, or credit rating agencies) and financial products also needs to be taken into account, as does the mobilization of capital and financial flows between countries and regions (Section 2.5).</p>
    <p>The literature on interactions between 1.5˚C mitigation pathways and SDGs is an emergent field of research (Section 2.3.5, 2.5 and Chapter 5). Whereas the choice of mitigation strategies can noticeably affect the attainment of various societal objectives, there is uncertainty regarding the extent of the majority of identified interactions. Understanding climate-SDG interactions helps inform the choice of mitigation options that minimize trade-offs and risks and maximize synergies towards sustainable development objectives and the 1.5°C goal (Section 2.5).</p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <div class="head">Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR)</div>
    <p>Most 1.5°C and 2°C pathways are heavily reliant on CDR at a speculatively large scale before mid-century. There are a number of knowledge gaps associated which such technologies. Chapter 4 performs a detailed assessment of CDR technologies.</p>
    <p>There is uncertainty in the future deployment of CCS given the limited pace of current deployment, the evolution of CCS technology that would be associated with deployment, and the current lack of incentives for large-scale implementation of CCS (Chapter 4, Section 4.2.7). Technologies other than BECCS and afforestation have yet to be comprehensively assessed in integrated assessment approaches. No proposed technology is close to deployment at scale, and regulatory frameworks are not established. This limits how they can be realistically implemented within IAMs. (Section 2.3)</p>
    <p>Evaluating the potential from BECCS is problematic due to large uncertainties in future land projections due to differences in modelling approaches in current land-use models, and these differences are at least as great as the differences attributed to climate scenario variations. (Section 2.3)</p>
    <p>There is substantial uncertainty about the adverse effects of largescale CDR deployment on the environment and societal sustainable development goals. It is not fully understood how land-use and land-management choices for large-scale BECCS will affect various ecosystem services and sustainable development, and how they further translate into indirect impacts on climate, including GHG emissions other than CO 2 .

   </div>
   <div>
    <div class="head">FAQ 2.1 | What Kind of Pathways Limit Warming to 1.5°C and are we on Track?</div>
    <p>Summary: There is no definitive way to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. This Special Report identifies two main conceptual pathways to illustrate different interpretations. One stabilizes global temperature at, or just below, 1.5°C. Another sees global temperature temporarily exceed 1.5°C before coming back down. Countries' pledges to reduce their emissions are currently not in line with limiting global warming to 1.5°C.</p>
    <p>Scientists use computer models to simulate the emissions of greenhouse gases that would be consistent with different levels of warming. The different possibilities are often referred to as 'greenhouse gas emission pathways'. There is no single, definitive pathway to limiting warming to 1.5°C.</p>
    <p>This IPCC special report identifies two main pathways that explore global warming of 1.5°C. The first involves global temperature stabilizing at or below before 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The second pathway sees warming exceed 1.5°C around mid-century, remain above 1.5°C for a maximum duration of a few decades, and return to below 1.5°C before 2100. The latter is often referred to as an 'overshoot' pathway. Any alternative situation in which global temperature continues to rise, exceeding 1.5°C permanently until the end of the 21st century, is not considered to be a 1.5°C pathway.</p>
    <p>The two types of pathway have different implications for greenhouse gas emissions, as well as for climate change impacts and for achieving sustainable development. For example, the larger and longer an 'overshoot', the greater the reliance on practices or technologies that remove CO 2 from the atmosphere, on top of reducing the sources of emissions (mitigation). Such ideas for CO 2 removal have not been proven to work at scale and, therefore, run the risk of being less practical, effective or economical than assumed. There is also the risk that the use of CO 2 removal techniques ends up competing for land and water, and if these trade-offs are not appropriately managed, they can adversely affect sustainable development. Additionally, a larger and longer overshoot increases the risk for irreversible climate impacts, such as the onset of the collapse of polar ice shelves and accelerated sea level rise.</p>
    <p>Countries that formally accept or 'ratify' the Paris Agreement submit pledges for how they intend to address climate change. Unique to each country, these pledges are known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Different groups of researchers around the world have analysed the combined effect of adding up all the NDCs. Such analyses show that current pledges are not on track to limit global warming to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels. If current pledges for 2030 are achieved but no more, researchers find very few (if any) ways to reduce emissions after 2030 sufficiently quickly to limit warming to 1.5°C. This, in turn, suggests that with the national pledges as they stand, warming would exceed 1.5°C, at least for a period of time, and practices and technologies that remove CO 2 from the atmosphere at a global scale would be required to return warming to 1.5°C at a later date.</p>
    <p>A world that is consistent with holding warming to 1.5°C would see greenhouse gas emissions rapidly decline in the coming decade, with strong international cooperation and a scaling up of countries' combined ambition beyond current NDCs. In contrast, delayed action, limited international cooperation, and weak or fragmented policies that lead to stagnating or increasing greenhouse gas emissions would put the possibility of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels out of reach. stabilizing global temperature at, or just below, 1.5°C (left) and global temperature temporarily exceeding 1.5°C before coming back down later in the century (right). Temperatures shown are relative to pre-industrial but pathways are illustrative only, demonstrating conceptual not quantitative characteristics.</p>

    <div class="head">FAQ 2.2 | What do Energy Supply and Demand have to do with Limiting Warming to 1.5°C?</div>
    <p>Summary: Limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels would require major reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in all sectors. But different sectors are not independent of each other, and making changes in one can have implications for another. For example, if we as a society use a lot of energy, then this could mean we have less flexibility in the choice of mitigation options available to limit warming to 1.5°C. If we use less energy, the choice of possible actions is greater -for example, we could be less reliant on technologies that remove carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) from the atmosphere.</p>
    <p>To stabilize global temperature at any level, 'net' CO 2 emissions would need to be reduced to zero. This means the amount of CO 2 entering the atmosphere must equal the amount that is removed. Achieving a balance between CO 2 'sources' and 'sinks' is often referred to as 'net zero' emissions or 'carbon neutrality'. The implication of net zero emissions is that the concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere would slowly decline over time until a new equilibrium is reached, as CO 2 emissions from human activity are redistributed and taken up by the oceans and the land biosphere. This would lead to a near-constant global temperature over many centuries.</p>
    <p>Warming will not be limited to 1.5°C or 2°C unless transformations in a number of areas achieve the required greenhouse gas emissions reductions. Emissions would need to decline rapidly across all of society's main sectors, including buildings, industry, transport, energy, and agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU). Actions that can reduce emissions include, for example, phasing out coal in the energy sector, increasing the amount of energy produced from renewable sources, electrifying transport, and reducing the 'carbon footprint' of the food we consume.</p>
    <p>The above are examples of 'supply-side' actions. Broadly speaking, these are actions that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the use of low-carbon solutions. A different type of action can reduce how much energy human society uses, while still ensuring increasing levels of development and well-being. Known as 'demand-side' actions, this category includes improving energy efficiency in buildings and reducing consumption of energyand greenhouse-gas intensive products through behavioural and lifestyle changes, for example. Demand-and supply-side measures are not an either-or question, they work in parallel with each other. But emphasis can be given to one or the other.</p>
    <p>Making changes in one sector can have consequences for another, as they are not independent of each other. In other words, the choices that we make now as a society in one sector can either restrict or expand our options later on. For example, a high demand for energy could mean we would need to deploy almost all known options to reduce emissions in order to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, with the potential for adverse side-effects. In particular, a pathway with high energy demand would increase our reliance on practices and technologies that remove CO 2 from the atmosphere. As of yet, such techniques have not been proven to work on a large scale and, depending on how they are implemented, could compete for land and water. By leading to lower overall energy demand, effective demand-side measures could allow for greater flexibility in how we structure our energy system. However, demand-side measures are not easy to implement and barriers have prevented the most efficient practices being used in the past.</p>

The literature on the many diverse CDR options only recently started to develop strongly (Minx et al., 2017) (see Chapter 4, Section 4.3.7 for a detailed assessment), and hence these options are only partially included in IAM analyses. IAMs mostly incorporate afforestation and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and only in few cases also include direct air capture with CCS (DACCS) (Chen and Tavoni, 2013; Marcucci et al., 2017; Strefler et al., 2018b). Several studies have either directly or indirectly explored the dependence of 1.5°C-consistent pathways on specific (sets of) mitigation and CDR technologies (Bauer et al., 2018; Grubler et al., 2018; Holz et al., 2018b; Kriegler et al., 2018a; Liu et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018; Strefler et al., 2018b; van Vuuren et al., 2018). However, there are a few potentially disruptive technologies that are typically not yet well covered in IAMs and that have the potential to alter the shape of mitigation pathways beyond the ranges in the IAM-based literature.</div>

In the scenario ensemble available to this assessment, several variations of near-term mitigation policy implementation can be found: immediate and cross-sectoral global cooperation from 2020 onward towards a global climate objective, a phase-in of globally coordinated mitigation policy from 2020 to 2040, and a more short-term oriented and regionally diverse global mitigation policy, following NDCs until 2030 (Kriegler et al., 2018a; Luderer et al., 2018; McCollum et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018; Strefler et al., 2018b). For example, the above- mentioned SSP quantifications assume regionally scattered mitigation policies until 2020, and vary in global convergence thereafter (Kriegler et al., 2014a; Riahi et al., 2017). The impact of near-term policy choices on 1.5°C-consistent pathways is discussed in Section 2.3.5. The literature has also explored 1.5°C-consistent pathways that build on a portfolio of policy approaches until 2030, including the combination of regulatory policies and carbon pricing (Kriegler et al., 2018a),</div>

Here we assess 1.5°C-consistent pathways with and without overshoot during the 21st century. One study also explores pathways overshooting 1.5°C for longer than the 21st century (Akimoto et al., 2017), but these are not considered 1.5°C-consistent pathways in this report (Chapter 1, Section 1.1.3). This subsection summarizes robust and varying properties of 1.5°C-consistent pathways regarding system transformations, emission reductions and overshoot. It aims to provide an introduction to the detailed assessment of the emissions evolution (Section 2.3.3), CDR deployment (Section 2.3.4), energy (Section 2.4.1, 2.4.2), industry (2.4.3.1), buildings (2.4.3.2), transport (2.4.3.3) and land-use transformations (Section 2.4.4) in 1.5°C-consistent pathways. Throughout Sections 2.3 and 2.4, pathway properties are highlighted with four 1.5°C-consistent pathway archetypes (LED, S1, S2, S5; referred to as P1, P2, P3, and P4 in the Summary for Policymakers) covering a wide range of different socio-economic and technology assumptions (Figure 2.5, Section 2.3.1).</div>
   <div class="figure">Figure 2 .25) (Grubler et al., 2018; Holz et al., 2018b; van Vuuren et al., 2018), or by being more lenient about the amount of CO 2 that continues to be produced in the above-mentioned end-use sectors (both by 2030 and mid-century) and strongly relying on technological CDR options like BECCS (S2 and S5 pathways in Figure 2.5) (Luderer et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018). Major drivers of these differences are assumptions about energy and food demand and the stringency of near-term climate policy (see the difference between early action in the scenarios S1, LED and more moderate action until 2030 in the scenarios S2, S5). Furthermore, the carbon budget in each of these pathways depends also on the non-CO 2 mitigation measures implemented in each of them, particularly for agricultural emissions (Sections 2.2.2, 2.3.3) (Gernaat et al., 2015). Those pathways differ not only in terms of their deployment of mitigation and CDR measures (Sections 2.3.4 and 2.4), but also in terms of the resulting temperature overshoot (Figure 2.1). Furthermore, they have very different implications for the achievement of sustainable development objectives, as further discussed in Section 2.5.3.</div>

For comparison, around 290 ± 20 (1 standard deviation range) GtCO 2 have been emitted in the years 2011-2017, with annual CO 2 emissions in 2017 around 42 ± 3 GtCO 2 yr −1 (Jackson et al., 2017; Le Quéré et al., 2018). Committed fossil-fuel emissions from existing fossil-fuel infrastructure as of 2010 have been estimated at around 500 ± 200 GtCO 2 (with about 200 GtCO 2 already emitted through 2017) (Davis and Caldeira, 2010). Coal-fired power plants contribute the largest part. Committed emissions from existing coal-fired power plants built through the end of 2016 are estimated to add up to roughly 200 GtCO 2 , and a further 100-150 GtCO 2 from coal-fired power plants under construction or planned (González-Eguino et al., 2017; Edenhofer et al., 2018). However, there has been a marked slowdown of planned coal-power projects in recent years, and some estimates indicate that the committed emissions from coal plants that are under construction or planned have halved since 2015 (Shearer et al., 2018). Despite these uncertainties, the committed fossil-fuel emissions are assessed to already amount to more than two thirds (half) of the remaining carbon budget. An important question is to what extent the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement are aligned with the remaining carbon budget. It was estimated that the NDCs, if successfully</div>

   <div class="figure">Emissions of fluorinated gases (IPCC/TEAP, 2005; US EPA, 2013; Velders et al., 2015; Purohit and Höglund-Isaksson, 2017) in 1.5°C-consistent pathways are reduced by roughly 75-80% relative to 2010 levels (interquartile range across 1.5°C-consistent pathways) in 2050, with no clear differences between the classes. Although unabated hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) emissions have been projected to increase (Velders et al., 2015), the Kigali Amendment recently added HFCs to the basket of gases controlled under the Montreal Protocol (Höglund- Isaksson et al., 2017). As part of the larger group of fluorinated gases, HFCs are also assumed to decline in 1.5°C-consistent pathways. Projected reductions by 2050 of fluorinated gases under 1.5°C-consistent pathways are deeper than published estimates of what a full implementation of the Montreal Protocol including its Kigali Amendment would achieve (Höglund-Isaksson et al., 2017), which project roughly a halving of fluorinated gas emissions in 2050 compared to 2010. Assuming the application of technologies that are currently commercially available and at least to a limited extent already tested and implemented, potential fluorinated gas emissions reductions of more than 90% have been estimated (Höglund-Isaksson et al., 2017). There is a general agreement across 1.5°C-consistent pathways that until 2030 forcing from the warming SLCFs is reduced less strongly than the net cooling forcing from aerosol effects, compared to 2010. As a result, the net forcing contributions from all SLCFs combined are projected to increase slightly by about 0.2-0.3 W m −2 , compared to 2010. Also, by the end of the century, about 0.1-0.3 W m −2 of SLCF forcing is generally currently projected to remain in 1.5°C-consistent scenarios (Figure 2.8). This is similar to developments in 2°C-consistent pathways (Rose et al., 2014b; Riahi et al., 2017)</div>

   <div class="figure">Anumber of approaches to actively remove carbon-dioxide from the atmosphere are increasingly discussed in the literature (Minx et al., 2018) (see also Chapter 4, Section 4.3.7). Approaches under consideration include the enhancement of terrestrial and coastal carbon storage in plants and soils such as afforestation and reforestation (Canadell and Raupach, 2008), soil carbon enhancement (Paustian et al., 2016; Frank et al., 2017; Zomer et al., 2017), and other conservation, restoration, and management options for natural and managed land (Griscom et al., 2017) and coastal ecosystems (McLeod et al., 2011). Biochar sequestration (Woolf et al., 2010; Smith, 2016; Werner et al., 2018) provides an additional route for terrestrial carbon storage. Other approaches are concerned with storing atmospheric carbon dioxide in geological formations. They include the combination of biomass use for energy production with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) (Obersteiner et al., 2001; Keith and Rhodes, 2002; Gough and Upham, 2011) and direct air capture with storage (DACCS) using chemical solvents and sorbents (Zeman and Lackner, 2004; Keith et al., 2006; Socolow et al., 2011). Further approaches investigate the mineralization of atmospheric carbon dioxide (Mazzotti et al., 2005; Matter et al., 2016), including enhanced weathering of rocks (Schuiling and Krijgsman, 2006; Hartmann et al., 2013; Strefler et al., 2018a).</div>
   <div class="figure">1.2). The mitigation scenario literature up to AR5 mostly included BECCS and, to a more limited extent, afforestation and reforestation (Clarke et al., 2014).

Other, more speculative approaches, in particular ocean-based CDR and removal of non-CO 2 gases, have not yet been taken up by the literature on mitigation pathways. See Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.2 for an overview on the coverage of CDR measures in models which contributed pathways to this assessment.

Total CDR comprises all forms of CDR, including AFOLU CDR and BECCS, and, in a few pathways, other CDR measures like DACCS.

AFOLU CDR has not been reported directly and is hence represented by means of a proxy: the additional amount of net negative CO 2 emissions in the AFOLU sector compared to a baseline scenario (see text for a discussion). 'Compensatory CO 2 ' depicts the cumulative amount of CDR that is used to neutralize concurrent residual CO 2 emissions. 'Net negative CO 2 ' describes the additional amount of CDR that is used to produce net negative CO 2 emissions, once residual CO 2 emissions are neutralized. The two quantities add up to total CDR for individual pathways (not for percentiles and medians, see Footnote 4).</div>

   <div class="figure">Frank et al., 2017). Whether bioenergy has large adverse impacts on environmental and societal goals depends in large parts on the governance of land use (Haberl et al., 2013; Erb et al., 2016b; Obersteiner et al., 2016; Humpenöder et al., 2018). Here IAMs often make idealized assumptions about effective land management, such as full protection of the land carbon stock by conservation measures and a global carbon price, respectively, but variations on these assumptions have also been explored (Calvin et al., 2014; Popp et al., 2014a). 2.3.4.2 Sustainability implications of CDR deployment in 1.5°C pathways Strong concerns about the sustainability implications of large-scale CDR deployment in deep mitigation pathways have been raised in the literature (Williamson and Bodle, 2016; Boysen et al., 2017b; Dooley and Kartha, 2018; Heck et al., 2018), and a number of important knowledge gaps have been identified (Fuss et al., 2016). An assessment of the literature on implementation constraints and sustainable development implications of CDR measures is provided in Chapter 4, Section 4.3.7 and the Cross-chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3. An initial discussion of potential environmental side effects of CDR deployment in 1.5°C-consistent pathways is provided in this section. Chapter 4, Section 4.3.7 then contrasts CDR deployment in 1.5°C-consistent pathways with other branches of literature on limitations of CDR. Integrated modelling aims to explore a range of developments compatible with specific climate goals and often does not include the full set of broader environmental and societal concerns beyond climate change. This has given rise to the concept of sustainable development pathways (Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1) (van Vuuren et al., 2015)</div>
   <div class="figure">CDR measures have different characteristics and therefore would carry different risks for their sustainable deployment at scale (Smith et al., 2015). Terrestrial CDR measures, BECCS and enhanced weathering of rock powder distributed on agricultural lands require land. Those land-based measures could have substantial impacts on environmental services and ecosystems (Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3) (Smith and Torn, 2013; Boysen et al., 2016; Heck et al., 2016; Krause et al., 2017). Measures like afforestation and bioenergy with and without CCS that directly compete with other land uses could have significant impacts on agricultural and food systems (Creutzig et al., 2012, 2015; Calvin et al., 2014; Popp et al., 2014b, 2017; Kreidenweis et al., 2016; Boysen et al., 2017a; Frank et al., 2017; Stevanović et al., 2017; Strapasson et al., 2017; Humpenöder et al., 2018). BECCS using dedicated bioenergy crops could substantially increase agricultural water demand (Bonsch et al., 2014; Séférian et al., 2018) and nitrogen fertilizer use (Bodirsky et al., 2014). DACCS and BECCS rely on CCS and would require safe storage space in geological formations, including management of leakage risks (Pawar et al., 2015) and induced seismicity (Nicol et al., 2013). Some approaches like DACCS have high energy demand (Socolow et al., 2011). Most of the CDR measures currently discussed could have significant impacts on either land, energy, water, or nutrients if deployed at scale (Smith et al., 2015). However, actual trade-offs depend on a multitude factors (Haberl et al., 2011; Erb et al., 2012; Humpenöder et al., 2018), including the modalities of CDR deployment (e.g., on marginal vs. productive land) (Bauer et al., 2018), socio-economic developments (Popp et al., 2017), dietary choices (Stehfest et al., 2009; Popp et al., 2010; van Sluisveld et al., 2016; Weindl et al., 2017; van Vuuren et al., 2018), yield increases, livestock productivity and other advances in agricultural technology (Havlik et al., 2013; Valin et al., 2013; Havlík et al., 2014; Weindl et al., 2015; Erb et al., 2016b), land policies (Schmitz et al., 2012; Calvin et al., 2014; Popp et al., 2014a), and governance of land use (Unruh, 2011; Buck, 2016; Honegger and Reiner, 2018).</div>
   <div class="figure">Figure 2 .2Figure 2.11 shows the land requirements for BECCS and afforestation in the selected 1.5°C-consistent pathway archetypes, including the LED (Grubler et al., 2018) and S1 pathways (Fujimori, 2017; Rogelj et al., 2018) following a sustainable development paradigm. As discussed, these land-use patterns are heavily influenced by assumptions about, among other things, future population levels, crop yields, livestock production systems, and food and livestock demand, which all vary between the pathways (Popp et al., 2017) (Section 2.3.1.1). In pathways that allow for large-scale afforestation in addition to BECCS, land demand for afforestation can be larger than for BECCS (Humpenöder et al., 2014). This follows from the assumption in the modelled pathways that, unlike bioenergy crops, forests are not harvested to</div>

Electrification continues throughout the second half of the century, leading to a 3.5-to 6-fold increase in electricity demand (interquartile range; median 4.5) by the end of the century relative to today (Grubler et al., 2018; Luderer et al., 2018).

   <div class="figure">This section assesses the transformation of the AFOLU system, mainly making use of pathways from IAMs (see Section 2.1) that are based on quantifications of the SSPs and that report distinct land-use evolutions in line with limiting warming to 1.5°C (Calvin et al., 2017; Fricko et al., 2017; Fujimori, 2017; Kriegler et al., 2017; Popp et al., 2017; Riahi et al., 2017; van Vuuren et al., 2017b; Doelman et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018). The SSPs were designed to vary mitigation challenges (O'Neill et al., 2014) (Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1), including for the AFOLU sector (Popp et al., 2017; Riahi et al., 2017). The SSP pathway ensemble hence allows for a structured exploration of AFOLU transitions in the context of climate change mitigation in line with 1.5°C, taking into account technological and socio-economic aspects.</div>
   <div class="figure">(see also Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2 for an assessment of these mitigation options). For example, in a scenario based on rapid technological progress (Kriegler et al., 2017), global average cereal crop yields in 2100 are assumed to be above 5 tDM ha −1 yr −1 in mitigation scenarios aiming at limiting end-of-century radiative forcing to 4.5 or 2.6 W m −2 , compared to 4 tDM ha −1 yr −1 in the SSP5 baseline to ensure the same food production. Similar improvements are present in 1.5°C variants of such scenarios. Historically, cereal crop yields are estimated at 1 tDM ha −1 yr −1 and about 3 tDM ha −1 yr −1 in 1965 and 2010, respectively (calculations based on FAOSTAT, 2018). For aggregate energy crops, models assume 4.2-8.9 tDM ha −1 yr −1 in 2010, increasing to about 6.9-17.4 tDM ha −1 yr −1 in 2050, which fall within the range found in the bottom-up literature yet depend on crop, climatic zone, land quality and plot size (Searle and Malins, 2014).</div>

Ranges show the minimum-maximum range across the SSPs. Single pathways are shown with plus signs. Illustrative archetype pathways are highlighted with distinct icons. Each panel shows the changes for a different land type. The 1.9 and 2.6 W m −2 pathways are taken as proxies for 1.5°C and 2°C pathways, respectively. The 2.6 W m −2 pathways are mostly consistent with the Lower-2°C and Higher-2°C pathway classes. The 1.9 W m −2 pathways are consistent with the 1.5°C-low-OS (mostly SSP1 and SSP2) and 1.5°C-high-OS (SSP5) pathway classes. In 2010, pasture was estimated to cover about 3-3.5 103 Mha, food and feed crops about 1.5-1.6 103 Mha, energy crops about 0-14 Mha and forest about 3.7-4.2 103 Mha, across the models that reported SSP pathways (Popp et al., 2017). When considering pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, the full set of scenarios shows a conversion of 50-1100 Mha of pasture into 0-600 Mha for energy crops, a 200 Mha reduction to 950 Mha increase forest, and a 400 Mha decrease to a 250 Mha increase in non-pasture agricultural land for food and feed crops by 2050 relative to 2010. The large range across the literature and the understanding of the variations across models and assumptions leads to medium confidence in the size of these ranges.</div>

Variations in these drivers can lead to drastically different land-use implications (Popp et al., 2014b) (Figure 2.24). Stringent mitigation pathways inform general GHG dynamics in the AFOLU sector. First, CO 2 emissions from deforestation can be abated at relatively low carbon prices if displacement effects in other regions (Calvin et al., 2017) or other land-use types with high carbon density (Calvin et al., 2014; Popp et al., 2014a; Kriegler et al., 2017) can be avoided. However, efficiency and costs of reducing rates of deforestation strongly depend on governance performance, institutions and macroeconomic factors (Wang et al., 2016). Secondly, besides CO 2 reductions, the land system can play an important role for overall CDR efforts (Rogelj et al., 2018) via BECCS, afforestation and reforestation, or a combination of options. The AFOLU sector also provides further potential for active terrestrial carbon sequestration, for example, via land restoration, improved management of forest and agricultural land (Griscom et al., 2017), or biochar applications (Smith, 2016) (see also Chapter 4, Section 4.3.7). These options have so far 11 Land-based mitigation options on the supply and the demand side are assessed in 4.3.2, and CDR options with a land component in 4.3.7.

These interactions will be discussed further in the SRCCL. Residual agricultural non-CO 2 emissions of CH 4 and N 2 O play an important role for temperature stabilization pathways, and their relative importance increases in stringent mitigation pathways in which CO 2 is reduced to net zero emissions globally (Gernaat et al., 2015; Popp et al., 2017; Stevanović et al., 2017; Rogelj et al., 2018), for example, through their impact on the remaining carbon budget (Section 2.2). Although agricultural non-CO 2 emissions show marked reduction potentials in 2°C-consistent pathways, complete elimination of these emission sources does not occur in IAMs based on the evolution of agricultural practice assumed in integrated models (Figure 2.25) (Gernaat et al., 2015)</div>

(b) Average annual investments over the 2016-2050 period in the "baselines" (i.e., pathways without new climate policies beyond those in place today), scenarios which implement the NDCs ('NDC', including conditional NDCs), scenarios consistent with the Lower-2°C pathway class ('2°C'), and scenarios in line with the 1.5°C-low-OS pathway class ('1.5°C'). Whiskers show the range of models; wide bars show the multimodel means; narrow bars represent analogous values from individual IEA scenarios (OECD/IEA and IRENA, 2017). (c) Average annual mitigation investments and disinvestments for the 2016-2030 periods relative to the baseline.

The assessment of interactions between mitigation measures and individual SDGs is based on the assessment of Chapter 5, Section 5.4. Proxy indicators and synthesis method are described in Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.5.</div>
   <div class="figure">Figure 2 .2Figure 2.28 shows how the scale and combination of individual mitigation measures (i.e., their mitigation portfolios) influence the extent of synergies and trade-offs with other societal objectives. All pathways generate multiple synergies with sustainable development dimensions and can advance several other SDGs simultaneously. Some, however, show higher risks for trade-offs. An example is increased biomass production and its potential to increase pressure on land and water resources, food production, and biodiversity and to reduce air quality when combusted inefficiently. At the same time, mitigation actions in energy-demand sectors and behavioural response options with appropriate management of rebound effects can advance multiple SDGs simultaneously, more so than energy supply-side mitigation actions (see Chapter 5, Section 5.4, Table 5.1 and Figure 5.3 for more examples). Of the four pathway archetypes used in this chapter (LED, S1, S2, and S5, referred to as P1, P2, P3, and P4 in the Summary for Policymakers), the S1 and LED pathways show the largest number of synergies and least number of potential trade-offs, while for the S5 pathway more potential trade-offs are identified. In general, pathways with emphasis on demand reductions and policies that incentivize behavioural change, sustainable consumption patterns, healthy diets and relatively low use of CDR (or only afforestation) show relatively more synergies with individual SDGs than other pathways.</div>

   <div class="figure">Table 2 .2.2Remaining carbon budgets are further influenced by Earth system feedbacks not accounted for in CMIP5 models, such as the permafrost carbon feedback (Friedlingstein et al., 2014b; MacDougall et al., 2015; Burke et al., 2017; Lowe and Bernie, 2018), and their influence on the TCRE. Lowe and Bernie (2018) used a simple climate sensitivity scaling approach to estimate that Earth system feedbacks (such as CO 2 released by permafrost thawing or methane released by wetlands) could reduce carbon budgets for 1.5°C and 2°C by roughly 100 GtCO 2 on centennial time scales. Their findings are based on an older understanding of Earth system feedbacks (Arneth et al., 2010). This estimate is broadly supported by more recent analysis of individual feedbacks. Schädel et al. (2014) suggest an upper bound of 24.4 PgC (90 GtCO 2 ) emitted from carbon release from permafrost over the next forty years for a RCP4.5 scenario. Burke et al. (2017) use a single model to estimate permafrost emissions between 0.3 and 0.6 GtCO 2 y -1 from the point of 1.5°C stabilization, which would reduce the budget by around 20 GtCO 2 by 2100. Comyn-Platt et al. (2018) include carbon and methane emissions from permafrost and wetlands and suggest the 1.5°C remaining carbon budget is reduced by 116 GtCO 2 . Additionally, Mahowald et al. </div>
   <div class="figure">Table 2 .22 cannot be formally combined, but current understanding of the assessed geophysical uncertainties suggests at least a ±50% possible variation for remaining carbon budgets for 1.5°C-consistent pathways. By the end of 2017, anthropogenic CO 2 emissions since the pre-industrial period are estimated to have amounted to approximately 2200 ±320 GtCO 2 (medium confidence) (Le Quéré et al., 2018). When put in the context of year-2017 CO 2 emissions (about 42 GtCO 2 yr -1 , ±3 GtCO 2 yr -1 , high confidence) (Le Quéré et al., 2018), a remaining carbon budget of 580 GtCO 2 (420 GtCO 2 ) suggests meeting net zero global CO 2 emissions in about 30 years (20 years) following a linear decline starting from 2018 (rounded to the nearest five years)</div>
