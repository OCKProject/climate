Research has documented that air pollutants are primarily from power generation, industry, transportation, agriculture, and residential activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Although residential fuel consumption contributes a very small fraction of the total energy use in China, it contributes significantly to pollutant emissions and consequently adverse health and climate impacts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. This is because the emission factors (EFs, quantities of air pollutants emitted per unit of fuel consumed) for extensively used solid fuels in this sector are very high. According to the latest estimation, 27% primary PM<sub>2.5</sub> (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 &#x003bc;m) and 51%&#x000a0;BC (black carbon)&#x000a0;emissions in mainland China&#x000a0;were from the residential sector in 2014, and nearly 80% was from rural areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Unfortunately, without enough first-hand data, the important role that residential energy transition can play in mitigating health burdens has hardly been justified. The residential sector has long been overlooked for its contribution to air pollution in China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, likely because the relatively low contribution of the residential sector to total energy use was known, whereas very high EFs are often not aware of. Another obstacle for better understanding is the fact that residential energy consumption and emissions were poorly recorded in comparison with other sectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, leading to higher uncertainties in emission estimations. Consequently, the residential sector is the &#x0201c;shortest wooden bar&#x0201d; in the overall evaluation of emissions and air pollution.</p><p id="Par5">Recently, a thorough nationwide survey was conducted to collect first-hand data on rural residential energy use from 1992 to 2012 in rural China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. A rapid transition of rural residential energy from solid fuels towards cleaner energy was revealed. The study also found that the quantities of biomass fuel use and the energy mix transition have been misestimated to a large extent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The new data from this survey provide us with a unique opportunity to improve our estimation of residential contributions to air pollution and to evaluate the impacts of the residential energy transition on health and climate forcing. In fact, the co-impacts of air pollution and co-benefits of emission reduction on health- and climate-relevant air pollutants are often expected and recognized in literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.

The reason for focusing on rural areas is because the majority of residential emissions in China are from rural areas where the detailed residential energy survey was targeted.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Contributions to ambient and population-weighted PM<sub>2.5</sub></title><p id="Par7">Due to the rapid transition of cooking and heating energy from solid fuels towards clean fuels and electricity, as well as a&#x000a0;rapid urbanization, most air pollutant emissions from the rural residential sector have been reduced over the last two decades; however, this sector remains a significant source of many air pollutants, contributing 39% and 46% of the total emissions of BC and organic carbon (OC) in 2012, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Based on the results of atmospheric chemical transport modelling (see Method), in 2012, the increment contributed by rural residential emissions to the national annual mean ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration was 5.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.1&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup> with high spatial variations. This value corresponds to a relative contribution of one-third (33&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;17%) of the total PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration in ambient air originating from all anthropogenic emission sources including power generation, industry, and transportation.</p><p id="Par8">Because of uneven population distribution, the population-weighted concentration (PWC) was different from the air quality concentration. The contribution from rural residential emissions to the annual mean PWC was 14&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;10&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup>, accounting for 21&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;14% of the total PWC from all sources. The national average rural residential source associated PWC (14&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/m<sup>3</sup>) was almost three times the average ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration attributable to rural residential emissions (5.4&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/m<sup>3</sup>). Since the National Grade-I standard<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, equal to the Interim Target-1 level set by the World Health Organization (WHO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, for the annual mean ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> is 35&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup>, the contribution from the rural residential sector cannot be ignored in the overall mitigation strategy for combating severe air pollution.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Impact on rural and urban air quality</title><p id="Par9">Although the emissions from this sector occur only in rural areas, their contribution to air pollution is not limited to such areas. According to the model results, the absolute contribution of rural residential emissions to the average ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration in cities (13&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;10&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup>) was even higher than that in rural areas (5.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.0&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup>). This outcome occurred because vast areas in western China with very low population densities are far from high emission regions, whereas most populated cities are located in eastern China and surrounded by highly populated rural villages. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in the PWC between rural (13&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup>) and urban (14&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;13&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup>) areas, due to higher urban population density. In relative terms, the contributions of rural residential emissions in&#x000a0;rural areas, for both air concentration (33&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;17%) and PWC (23&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;13%), were higher than those in urban areas (21&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;15% and 20&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;17%, respectively), due to strong emissions from other sectors in urban areas.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Two-decadal changes in rural residential contributions</title><p id="Par10">While the contribution of the rural residential sector to air pollution remained significant in 2012, it was even higher prior to 2012. Because of the rapid transition of the rural residential energy mix over the past two decades, from domination by solid fuels to clean fuels and electricity, the contribution of this sector to the ambient air concentration has decreased. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the decreasing trends of the PWC in both absolute (A) and relative (B) terms for urban, rural, and national averages from 1992 to 2012. In 1992, the relative contributions of the rural residential sector to the overall ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PWC were as high as 45&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;11% and 39&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;13%, respectively. Over the 20-year period, the national average PWC decreased by ~26% from 18&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup> to 14&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup>. The relative decrease of the national average was even more rapid from 39% to 21% because the air pollutant emissions from other sectors increased during this same period<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. This increase is particularly true for urban areas after 2002. For example, against the decreasing trend in NOx emissions from the rural residential sector, the total NOx emissions from all sources jumped 316% from 1992 to 2012, primarily driven by the massive industrialization and explosive growth of the passenger car fleet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Contributions of rural residential emissions to the overall population-weighted ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration (PWC) in mainland China from 1992 to 2012.

However, because of the strong seasonality of heating needs in northern China, there has been very high seasonal variation in this contribution. For example, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> shows the monthly contributions of rural residential emissions to PM<sub>2.5</sub> PWC in China in 1992 and shows strong seasonality. On a national scale, the rural residential sector contributed 33&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup> PM<sub>2.5</sub> to ambient air in the three winter months from December to February, while the summer value was only 12&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup>.</p><p id="Par12">Although the seasonal patterns were similar among the four study years, the differences between the heating and non-heating seasons increased over this period. The ratios of the relative contributions between winter and summer months increased from 1.8 (1992) to 2.4 (2002), 2.8 (2007), and 3.7 (2012). This trend can be explained by the fact that, at this stage, the rural residential energy transition occurred primarily for cooking activities. The time-sharing fraction of using LPG, biogas, and electricity for cooking increased from 7% in 1992 to 59% in 2012, whereas the fraction for heating only reached 15% in 2012<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Because cooking emissions tend to remain constant between seasons, the cooking energy transition-induced decrease in PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations did not vary among months. On the other hand, the heating energy transition, which can lead to seasonal change, occurred at a much slower pace and largely in mid-latitude provinces where heating is needed for no more than a few weeks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In the northern, northwestern, and northeastern regions, where heating is usually needed for several months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, residents cannot shift to electricity or gas for heating due to the high cost and their low income<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Strong spatial variations with higher contributions in east</title><p id="Par13">In addition to the temporal changes, there was also strong spatial variation in the contributions of rural residential emissions to ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations, which is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> as provincial averages. Although the national average contribution of rural residential sources to the annual mean ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> was 5.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.1&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup> in 2012, the contributions in eastern China, where the majority of the population reside, were much higher than those in western China. The heating activity not only caused significant seasonal differences (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) but also different geographical distribution patterns of the contributions, with much higher levels in northern China during heating periods due to high heating demand. The spatial variation was enhanced by population weighting for assessing exposure, as shown by provincial averages in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>. The overlay of the sources (emissions) and receptors (population) led to an even sharper contrast between the heavily and less polluted regions.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Spatial distribution of rural residential emission contributions in 2012 in mainland China.

In addition to poor dispersion conditions, heating activity in rural areas is definitely one of the most important reasons for the severe air pollution in winter. Despite increasing concerns on&#x000a0;this issue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, the contribution to exposure has not been well quantified in the literature. To fill this data gap, the contributions of rural residential emissions to the PM<sub>2.5</sub> PWC in all provinces were calculated. The results are listed in Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> in both absolute and relative terms. The relatively high standard deviation values indicate high spatial variation. For the provinces in the North China Plain and Guanzhong Plain, the annual mean contributions were not higher than the national averages. However, the winter (January) values were much higher. For most provinces in the northeast, north, and northwest, except for Beijing and Tianjin, the relative contributions in January were between 27% and 51%, accounting for approximately one-third to one-half of the PWC in the region.

More importantly, the absolute contributions of rural residential emissions to the PWC in cities in eastern China are often close to, or even higher than, those in rural areas. For example, the relative contributions of the rural residential sector to PM<sub>2.5</sub> PWC in urban and rural areas in Heilongjiang were 24&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;14% and 32&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;10%, respectively.

Although the relative contributions in western provinces such as Xingjiang (34&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;25%) and Qinghai (23&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;14%) were even higher, the absolute contributions were much lower (2.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.8 and 3.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.6&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively) than those in the east. The contributions were much higher in 1992 compared to those in 2012, indicating a rapid reduction due to the clean energy transition. For example, the absolute and relative contributions in January in 1992 were as high as 53&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;25&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup> and 60&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;15% in Hebei, and 77&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;16&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup> and 69&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7% in Henan&#x000a0;provinces, respectively, which are among the most populated provinces in China. The rural residential energy transition resulted in a significantly reduced contribution to overall air pollution. Although this trend is promising, the rural residential sector still plays a critical role in PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution, especially in northern China during winter. The emissions from this source should be remediated before the nationwide air pollution issue can finally be solved.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Co-benefits of rural residential energy transition</title><p id="Par15">With significant contributions to exposure, adverse health effects from rural residential emissions are inevitable.

Although baseline mortality rates changed rapidly during this period, the decrease in the mortality attributable to rural residential emissions was still significant from 1992 to 2012, with the influence of the population growth, aging, and age-standardised mortality rate adjusted (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The estimated number of deaths avoided due to decreased rural residential exposure was approximately 130,000 (90,000&#x02013;160,000).

Among the components studied, CO<sub>2</sub> and BC contributed positively to climate forcing, whereas primary organic aerosol (POA), nitrate, and sulfate contributed negatively. According to our results, five components from the rural residential sector contributed +0.006&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.004 (CO<sub>2</sub>), +0.049&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.007 (BC), &#x02212;0.019&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.002 (POA), &#x02212;0.002&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.000 (nitrate), and &#x02212;0.003&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.000 (sulfate) W/m<sup>2</sup> in 2012, with a net contribution of +0.031&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.008&#x02009;W/m<sup>2</sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). This contribution is equivalent to 12.5% of the total forcing caused by CO<sub>2</sub> from all sources in 2012. Of the five components, BC was the most important component, whereas the CO<sub>2</sub> contribution was much smaller.

Although the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from LPG and electricity consumption increased, the decrease in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fuelwood use was faster, leading to a net reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from this sector from 1992 to 2012. Because BC contributed much more than all others in absolute terms, despite the opposite effects of other forcing components, the residential energy transition-induced decrease in the BC emissions from biomass burning&#x000a0;led to a significant decrease in net radiative forcing of 61%, from 0.057&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.016&#x02009;W/m<sup>2</sup> to 0.031&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.008&#x02009;W/m<sup>2</sup> during this 20-year period.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Radiative forcing associated with emissions from rural residential sector. <bold>a</bold> Radiative forcing caused by CO<sub>2</sub>, BC, POA, sulfate, and nitrate originating from rural residential emissions in 1992, 2002, 2007, and 2012. <bold>b</bold> The net forcing of these components.

Although this is a simple box-model without seasonal variation, it is very efficient in terms of computation. As a parametric model with most parameters previously calibrated against complex models during a meta-modelling process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, OSCAR fits our purpose well.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Uncertainty analysis</title><p id="Par27">A Monte Carlo simulation (1000 times) was conducted to characterize the uncertainty of the estimated health impacts. The results reflect the influences of both the exposure level and the dose-response relationship including slope and nonlinearity. Because of the heavy computation load, a Monte Carlo simulation could not be conducted for the transport modelling. According to the results from a&#x000a0;previous research the variation of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations is similar to that of primary PM<sub>2.5</sub> emissions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, which was close to 10% in China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Therefore, for each grid, a 10% uncertainty in air&#x000a0;PM<sub>2.5</sub> was assumed and used in the uncertainty analysis for the health impact assessment. The sensitivity analysis (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>) showed that differences in estimated premature deaths with the assumed grid PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration uncertainties at 10%, 15%, and 25% were within 1%, indicating that the overall uncertainty in health outcomes was affected largely by dose-response functions compared with the uncertainty in PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. The uncertainties of estimated health impacts were calculated based on the given distribution of parameters from the GEMM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>, by applying a 1000-run Monte Carlo simulation. The variations derived from the Monte Carlo simulation are strongly associated with the nonlinearity of the dose-response relationship. The importance of the dose-response relationship for uncertainty has been previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. The results are presented at a 95% uncertainty interval (which ranges between the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec14"><p>
