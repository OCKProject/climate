Soil instabilities can result from natural phenomena such as soil creep, slope failures, landslides and seismic excitations in the proximity of tectonic faults. Human activities such as excavation, tunnelling, directional drilling and pipe bursting can also lead to lateral soil movements against pipes. The pipe can actually be dragged through the soil mass to a point where exceedance of stresses owing to bending can jeopardize the structural integrity of the pipe. Moreover, even if the structural safety is guaranteed through sizing of a sufficiently flexible pipe, serviceability design limits may still be exceeded (e.g. local ovalization or wrinkling).</p><p>With the ever increasing construction of energy pipeline projects around the world, there is a growing need for more in-depth understanding of three-dimensional (3D) effects on deformable pipes. Full-scale testing and site investigation are two very accurate methods to achieve this objective. However, considering the high cost associated with such studies, it is generally more economical and less time-consuming to perform numerical simulations. This method permits broader investigation of the pipe&#x02013;soil interaction by performing parametric analyses on material properties (both for the pipe and the soil), geometrical configurations (pipe size and embedment ratios) and loading conditions (combined loading and pipe pressurization). On the other hand, data obtained from field surveys or from laboratory tests can be useful for calibrating or validating such models.</p><p>In pipe&#x02013;soil interaction problems, it is known that the restraint loads acting on the pipeline are governed by the soil stress&#x02013;strain constitutive law. Over the years, numerous researchers using finite-element simulations have attempted to capture the influence of different soil parameters on the load-carrying capacity. Popescu <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="RSOS181550C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] presented a two-dimensional (2D) numerical study on pipes translating through the ground. The developed model is based on non-associated Mohr&#x02013;Coulomb material model, with hardening of soil parameters cohesion, <italic>c</italic>, and friction angle, <italic>&#x003d5;</italic>, defined as functions of plastic strain magnitude, <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> (all symbols used in this article are included in <xref rid="RSOS181550TB1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Mahdavi <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="RSOS181550C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] complemented the numerical investigation of Popescu <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="RSOS181550C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] by examining the effect of parameters such as nominal pipe diameter, pipe diameter to wall thickness ratio (<italic>D</italic>/<italic>t</italic>), steel grade, internal pressure, axial force and embedment ratio (<italic>H</italic>/<italic>D</italic>) on local buckling response. Guo &#x00026; Stolle [<xref rid="RSOS181550C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] conducted a numerical parametric study on the effect of embedment ratio, soil parameters and scale effect on soil capacity for a 2D numerical model. Phillips <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="RSOS181550C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] examined the impact of combined axial load and lateral pipe&#x02013;soil interaction, while Yimsiri <italic>et al</italic>.

[<xref rid="RSOS181550C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] performed 2D finite model analyses to predict lateral loads on pipelines in dry and unsaturated sandy soils and were compared with full-scale tests. Cheong <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="RSOS181550C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] investigated the pipe&#x02013;soil interaction owing to lateral loading, but with emphasis on bent pipes. While most of the computational work adopted implicit finite-element analysis (FEA), different numerical approaches have been used as well. Roy <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="RSOS181550C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] performed simulations using the explicit solver to capture more accurately the strength degradation in shear bands compared to the implicit solver. Other different numerical simulation studies include the work of Calvetti <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="RSOS181550C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], employed the distinct element method, and Karimian [<xref rid="RSOS181550C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], used the finite difference method. In the present study, simple 2D and 3D finite-element models employing stress-dependent stiffness of the soil using the Janbu model subroutine are presented and discussed.

</p><p>Most guidelines for the design of buried pipelines (e.g. [<xref rid="RSOS181550C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSOS181550C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]) employ a structural representation of the pipe&#x02013;soil interaction, where a series of independent nonlinear structural springs in the axial, lateral and vertical directions are used to represent the soil support, while the pipeline is simulated using beam elements. One of the most widely used design approaches is the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) guidelines [<xref rid="RSOS181550C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], according to which the lateral soil reaction on a pipe is defined as follows:
<disp-formula id="RSOS181550M1.1"><label>1.1</label><mml:math id="DM1"><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">qh</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>&#x003b3;</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">&#x02032;</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>P</italic><sub>u</sub> is the peak load per unit length; <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>&#x02032; is the effective unit weight of soil; <italic>H</italic> is the burial depth to the pipe spring line; <italic>D</italic> is the outer pipe diameter; <italic>N</italic><sub>qh</sub> is the horizontal bearing capacity for sand.</p><p><italic>N</italic><sub>qh</sub> is a dimensionless parameter that depends on soil friction and embedment ratio (<italic>H</italic>/<italic>D</italic>). The ASCE guidelines [<xref rid="RSOS181550C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] provide different charts to determine this parameter. One chart is based on the method developed by Hansen [<xref rid="RSOS181550C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and the other is based on the research work of Trautmann &#x00026; O'Rourke [<xref rid="RSOS181550C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. While such simplification provides a convenient analysis tool that can be implemented in the design, springs do not model the through-soil interaction (connecting points as well as connecting the vertical and horizontal resistance of the soil), which limits the prediction accuracy (e.g. [<xref rid="RSOS181550C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS181550C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS181550C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]).</p><p>The objectives of the present work are: (i) to develop a simple 3D modelling technique to estimate the load&#x02013;deflection response of pipes moving laterally through the ground, based on independent parameters for the pipe and soil; (ii) to assess the performance of the model through comparisons against the most commonly used 2D modelling which enables the use of higher order elements, and then compare both anayses with measured behaviour; and (iii) to use the 3D analysis to examine pipe bending, pressure distribution along the pipe and also to develop calculation methods that address challenges with the low-order elements that must generally be used for 3D soil&#x02013;pipe interaction analysis (where failure loads are usually overestimated). These computational tools will then be available to assess a variety of buried pipe bending problems of interest to the oil and gas pipeline industry.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><label>2.</label><title>Testing programme</title><p>A series of physical tests were performed at the geotechnical laboratory testing facility at Queen's University [<xref rid="RSOS181550C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The test pit and test set-up are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS181550F1">figure&#x000a0;1</xref>. A total of nine tests were conducted to examine effects of burial depth (ratios of 3, 5 and 7), boundary effects, internal friction of the pulling mechanism (interactions between the pulling system and the soil) and repeatability of testing on the load&#x02013;displacement curve. In each test, a mild-steel pipe of 102 mm diameter was buried in uniformly graded dense Olivine sand [<xref rid="RSOS181550C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], which was then pulled laterally using a hydraulic actuator. The actuator is attached to one side of a spreader beam, where two steel cables (encased in PVC tubes to minimize contact friction with the surrounding soil) are attached to the other side of the spreader beam and run through the soil mass connecting to the pipe ends. Pulling was applied at a fixed rate of 5 mm min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Soil and pipe parameters used in the analysis are given in tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="RSOS181550TB2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="RSOS181550TB3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, respectively. Details of the soil characterization tests including grain size analysis and triaxial tests are discussed by Almahakeri [<xref rid="RSOS181550C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. During testing, pipe deflection was measured at five sections along the pipe using string potentiometers and strain gauges were fixed to the outer surface of the pipe (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS181550F2">figure&#x000a0;2</xref> for a layout of the pipe instrumentation). Because the test with burial depth of <italic>H/D</italic> = 3 was repeated four times [<xref rid="RSOS181550C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] to check for repeatability of results, the test with close to the average results (test no. S4A) relative to the other three tests has been selected for comparison with the numerical calculations in this paper (variations in loads at specific levels of lateral displacement were within 10% and 6% of the average peak and residual pulling loads, respectively).

This is usually accomplished by writing the field function as a number of &#x02018;IF&#x02019; statements in the body of the subroutine, each one is used to control a corresponding field variable (which is, in this case, the soil modulus). Each field variable has a corresponding value that is defined through the user interface of the software. Those values depend on the soil elastic parameters (<italic>n</italic> and <italic>K</italic>) calculated using equation (3.4). It has been observed that by increasing the number of the pre-calculated points on the curve (and consequently, the number of the corresponding &#x02018;IF&#x02019; statements), the analysis completion progress was gradually advancing and that the calculated load&#x02013;displacement curve gets closer to the one obtained from the experimental results. Hence, an &#x02018;IF&#x02019; statement was used to represent the soil modulus for each 0.001 inch of soil depth.

Equation (3.4) indicates that the modulus approaches zero near the surface, which, as expected, causes numerical convergence problems. Hence, a minimum, non-zero value of the soil modulus was assigned to the top soil layer (layer thickness depends on the pipe burial depth ratio that is analysed). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS181550F3">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref> shows the modulus of elasticity distribution over the soil depth used for the 3D analyses.

While coarse grained soils often exhibit reductions in dilation angle with increases in plastic strain, neglecting of this effect was found to influence the load&#x02013;displacement curve in the post-peak region. Hence, changes in dilation angle should not significantly affect the pre-peak results, and the added complexity of reducing the dilation angle at large values of shear strain is not required. A constant value for the friction angle of shearing resistance of the soil (<italic>&#x003d5;</italic>) was also used, to avoid issues associated with modelling of strain softening (mesh dependency, e.g. [<xref rid="RSOS181550C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]).

This type of element is useful for modelling areas with irregular geometries and curvatures and their expected deformations. The analysis was also performed using the three-noded linear triangle (CPE3) and results are compared and discussed in the &#x02018;Results and discussion&#x02019; section. The use of plane strain elements with reduced integration (CPE4R) led to severe penetration of the pipe's elements nodes into the soil elements, which in turn resulted in convergence difficulties during the analyses. To eliminate this effect, an analytical rigid body was used for the pipe part. While analyses started and progressed successfully using this approach, it was observed that excessive stiffening of the soil had an impact on the numerical stability. Hence, second-order triangular elements were adopted for the 2D analyses presented and discussed in this study. For the 3D model, analysis was attempted using the 20-node hexahedral, reduced integration element (C3D20R) for the soil, but owing to intrinsic convergence issues with quadratic (higher order) elements in contact problems (as will be discussed subsequently), the element had to be substituted by eight-noded linear (lower order) hexahedral elements (C3D8). Because &#x02018;lower order&#x02019; elements are overly stiff, extremely fine meshes are often required to obtain accurate results. For the pipe elements, four-noded reduced integration shell elements (S4R) were employed in the 3D model. This type of element account for finite membrane strains and arbitrarily large rotations and are therefore suitable for large strain problems like the one treated herein.</p><p>Mesh sensitivity analysis of the soil was performed for both the 2D and 3D numerical models.

The &#x02018;intermediate&#x02019; mesh was selected in this study for both the 2D and 3D analyses (for an embedment ratio <italic>H/D</italic> = 3, element size ranges between 11 and 60 mm). Mesh sensitivity analysis on the load&#x02013;displacement curve revealed almost identical behaviour up to the onset of plastic deformation of the soil for all examined mesh densities (2D and 3D), with minimal reduction in the level of strain hardening obtained with finer meshes at higher deformations (end displacement greater than 20 mm). On the other hand, increased mesh refinement leads to lower bending moment than coarser meshes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS181550F5">figure&#x000a0;5</xref>) with more pronounced rates than the load&#x02013;displacement curve of the soil (12.5% reduction in peak bending moment between the coarse and intermediate meshes, and 8% reduction between the intermediate and fine meshes). However, the analysis time of the model using fine mesh was significantly longer than the one with the intermediate mesh. Based on these results, and in order to maintain a computationally efficient model, the mesh with intermediate refinement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS181550F4">figure&#x000a0;4</xref><italic>e</italic>) was selected for the 3D analyses reported in what follows.</p><p>For the pipe, a fixed number of 40 elements were used in the 2D analyses to discretize the pipe over the circumference.

Moreover, a finite displacement contact interaction formulation was employed. This contact modelling approach is suitable for problems involving large sliding, separation and arbitrary rotation of the contact surfaces. Tangential and normal behaviour is defined between the two surfaces. For the normal interaction behaviour, a non-penetrating condition was defined (referred as &#x02018;hard&#x02019; contact in ABAQUS), while for the tangential direction, the friction coefficient, <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>, between the pipe and the soil was introduced.

This peak pulling force is an output of major importance either for pipe design or for comparison against experimental results. Therefore, a consistent and robust approach is needed to identify this peak force from the calculated results. In this section, various techniques for estimating peak pulling force are discussed.</p><p>One first approach that deals with this issue is through the identification of the pipe displacement at the peak pulling load, so that this displacement can be used to select a characteristic force from the calculated load&#x02013;displacement curve (one that corresponds to the peak pulling force observed in experiments if the approach is successful). However, in a 3D problem where movements at the ends of the pipe are greater than at &#x02018;mid-span&#x02019; (the point midway between the ends being pulled) as a result of bending deformations, there is more than one deformation value, so end displacement at peak (denoted <italic>Y<sub>u,e</sub></italic>), and mid-span displacement at peak (denoted <italic>Y<sub>u,m</sub></italic>) need to be examined separately if a characteristic deformation is to be identified.</p><p>ASCE [<xref rid="RSOS181550C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] reports a procedure where lateral, rigid, pipe displacement at peak force is given by the following expression:

Given the difficulty of undertaking 3D analysis of the soil&#x02013;pipe interaction, a computationally efficient approach is to simulate the behaviour as a plane strain problem to estimate the lateral forces and bending moments. This approximation involves considering the lateral soil movements as being uniform along the pipeline, which means that the effect of longitudinal bending deflections along the pipe is neglected. The current study seeks to develop a simplified 3D analysis method, but also includes more conventional 2D calculations for comparison purposes (to assess the relative ability of these two different approaches to capture the peak pulling forces and pressure distribution around and along the pipe). In order to facilitate the comparisons between these two types of analysis, pulling load (<italic>P</italic>) is presented in this article in units of load/unit length (the units resulting from 2D calculations), unless otherwise stated, despite the fact that load is not generally uniform in laterally loaded pipes subjected to bending (the 3D results, therefore, represent the average magnitude of load per unit length along the whole of the pipe being modelled).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS181550F8">Figure&#x000a0;8</xref><italic>a</italic>&#x02013;<italic>c</italic> show the contact pressure distribution around the pipe circumference for the 2D analysis compared with the pressure distribution at the same load level obtained from the 3D analysis at the pipe mid-span. The three figures covering analyses for <italic>H/D</italic> = 3, 5 and 7 suggest that analyses using 3D models provide comparable calculations to the 2D models if the contact pressure is averaged around the pipe mid-span circumference. The slight variation in pressure distribution shapes between the 2D and 3D analyses can be attributed to the inherent differences between the two meshes used (element type, and the mesh refinement levels). On the other hand, examination of the variation of the longitudinal pressure distribution along the pipe spring line reveals that for relatively stiff pipes, the pressure distribution varies with the change of confining pressure. At burial depth of <italic>H/D</italic> = 3, the pressure is fairly uniformly distributed along the pipe when pulling loads are still at relatively low values (0.94 kN m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS181550F8">figure&#x000a0;8</xref><italic>d</italic>. However, the nonlinearity of pressure distribution increases for pulling loads between 4.7 and 6.12 kN m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. A more pronounced nonlinear pressure distribution is shown in the figure for <italic>H/D</italic> = 7 at a pulling load of 19 kN m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. These results suggest that a 2D analysis could still be used for the purpose of estimating loads imposed on the pipe from the perspective of soil capacity, but the nonlinearity of the pressure distribution along the pipe either with increase in pulling load or soil cover would emphasize the importance of conducting 3D analysis when an accurate prediction of the flexural behaviour of the pipe is required (as discussed further in the following sections).

These results are typical of what is calculated, whereby lower order elements overestimate the stiffness of the system and often fail to produce a clear peak load at higher displacements.</p><p>Because the present problem involves large deformations and the flow of soil around the pipe, the use of master&#x02013;slave interaction is necessary. Even if contact pressures are uniform, higher order elements feature nodal forces that vary across the element (they are higher at mid-side nodes than at corners), and it is often necessary to use lower order elements to obtain stable solutions (as lower order elements produce uniform nodal forces across the element face) for this class of problem [<xref rid="RSOS181550C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. These difficulties are even more pronounced for 3D analyses (calculations using higher order elements in the 3D models did not converge from the early stages of the analysis). Therefore, all 3D analysis results reported herein are based on the use of lower order elements.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS181550F10">Figure&#x000a0;10</xref> summarizes the comparison between all 2D calculations, to evaluate the performance of the two different types of finite elements (higher order and lower order) on the residual pulling force (<italic>P</italic><sub>resid</sub>) for the three examined burial depths, together with the results of 3D analysis using only the lower order elements (the issue of peak versus residual force is discussed in the next section). The figure shows that linear elements overestimate the soil resistance loads in all 2D numerical simulations compared to the experiments and relative to the loads obtained with quadratic elements by 34%, 27% and 22% for embedment ratios of 3, 5 and 7, respectively. The same figure also illustrates how 3D analysis produces higher values of <italic>P</italic><sub>resid</sub> relative to the 2D analysis with linear elements for the three burial depths that were examined (by 7%, 14% and 9% for embedment ratios of 3, 5 and 7, respectively). This overestimation of the force observed in the 3D analysis compared to the 2D analysis could be attributed partly to the difference in mesh refinement level between the two analyses, though it might also be owing to other differences in the element formulations.

This means that soil strength decreases as the soil undergoes increasing shear deformation. The conventional approach for solving such soil mechanics problem is to employ peak friction, <italic>&#x003d5;</italic><sub>p</sub>, angle to estimate peak strength and residual angle of friction, <italic>&#x003d5;</italic><sub>resid</sub>, to estimate residual strength. Provided the level of dilation in the soil undergoing shear deformation is reasonably uniform, calculations based on peak friction angle will not greatly exceed the peak measured strength. The use of uniform values of peak and residual friction angle is explored herein to identify to what extent the approach provides accurate predictions of the experimental response. However, the soil along the pipe exhibits complex 3D softening behaviour as strength varies along the pipe, with lower strength values being expected at the ends (because lateral movements are higher) and higher values being expected at mid-span (where lateral movements are smaller).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS181550F11">Figure&#x000a0;11</xref> shows measured load versus displacement for <italic>H/D</italic> = 3, together with 2D calculations using higher order elements (quadratic displacement) based on both <italic>&#x003d5;</italic><sub>resid</sub> and <italic>&#x003d5;</italic><sub>p</sub>.

It is also shown how closely the 2D analyses can estimate peak soil load for both shallow and deeper burial conditions (1%, 5% and 7.8% differences relative to measured values for the embedment ratios of 3, 5 and 7, respectively). On the other hand, the 3D analysis showed similar behaviour but with higher differences (1.7%, 17.5% and 17.4% for the embedment ratios of 3, 5 and 7, respectively). It should be noted that the use of lower order 3D elements leads to load overestimation compared to second-order elements. However, the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS181550F12">figure&#x000a0;12</xref> for the 3D analysis are based on residual soil strength (i.e. <italic>&#x003d5;</italic><sub>resid</sub>), which &#x02018;underestimates&#x02019; the load compared to calculations based on <italic>&#x003d5;</italic><sub>p</sub>. These effects compensate for each other, over the burial depth range considered here, and are discussed further in a subsequent section.

It can also be observed that both the 2D and 3D analyses are close to the initial slope of the load&#x02013;displacement curves for shallow cover (<italic>H/D</italic> = 3), while the predicted slope gets higher (i.e. stiffer response) as the burial depth increases. This higher stiffness response can be attributed partly to numerical limitations encountered when applying very low modulus of elasticity for the soil&#x02014;near the surface&#x02014;at greater burial depths (<italic>H/D</italic> = 5 and 7) as opposed to the theoretical modulus distribution calculated using the Janbu model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS181550F3">figure&#x000a0;3</xref>). Also, the soil modulus of elasticity used in the analyses is applied as an initial distribution and remains constant during the analysis, whereas in actual test conditions, soil modulus would be updated during the analysis. If such an approach was followed, as the soil was sheared (i.e. it weakens), the soil modulus would reduce and so would its stiffness (see [<xref rid="RSOS181550C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] for further discussion).

The numerical analyses reported by Karimian [<xref rid="RSOS181550C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] produced similar results but with much stiffer initial soil behaviour when compared with the current study that adopts the &#x02018;Janbu initial&#x02019; subroutine. Such overestimated calculations reported by Karimian [<xref rid="RSOS181550C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] for the loads lead consequently to overestimation of bending moment along the pipe as discussed in the previous section (curves &#x02018;1&#x02019; and &#x02018;1B&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS181550F18">figure&#x000a0;18</xref>). Additional validation work of the current numerical model for flexible fibre reinforced polymer pipes has been discussed in detail by Almahakeri <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="RSOS181550C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><label>5.</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>The current study presents a 3D numerical modelling approach that is relatively simple to implement for 3D pipe&#x02013;soil interaction problems. The numerical model also provides flexural bending stresses and strains along the pipe, together with the history of bending deflections up to the peak lateral force. A series of 2D and 3D FEAs have been conducted to simulate experiments where thin-walled steel pipes buried in dense sand were pulled laterally through the soil. The analyses were performed using ABAQUS/S<sc>tandard</sc>, and employed large strain theory. The non-associated Mohr&#x02013;Coulomb constitutive model was used for the sand with stress-dependent values of initial soil modulus (i.e. elastic soil modulus that increases with depth according to the Janbu stress function). An elastoplastic model was used for the steel pipe. While the numerical model proposed in the current study lacks the ability to capture the post-peak response of the soil since strain softening is neglected, the 3D model does provide good agreement with experimental results in estimating the soil response, load&#x02013;displacement curves and the flexural behaviour of the pipe over the elastic loading range of the soil. Comparisons of the 2D and 3D calculations to the experimental observations lead to the following conclusions:
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>(i)&#x02003;the 2D simulations using higher order elements can effectively provide the peak mobilized load (within 1%, 5% and 7% of the measured values for the embedment ratios of 3, 5 and 7, respectively) at the onset of plastic deformation of the soil;</p></list-item><list-item><p>(ii)&#x02003;because the 3D analysis requires the use of lower order (linear displacement) elements, it overestimates the peak mobilized load (by an average of 43%). However, the model can effectively provide the progress of both the load&#x02013;strain and load&#x02013;deflection curves for the steel pipe, especially for embedment ratios <italic>H/D</italic> = 3 and 5. The agreement with experimental data measured over this embedment ratio range in the pre-peak pipe loading range would be of great interest for pipeline designers because most energy pipelines are buried at depths that range from one to four times the pipe diameter;</p></list-item><list-item><p>(iii)&#x02003;both 2D and 3D models are able to capture the effect of burial depth in terms of estimating pulling forces, and the 3D model provides the bending deflection of the pipe;</p></list-item><list-item><p>(iv)&#x02003;adopting a stress-dependent soil modulus improves significantly the numerical analysis calculations. For burial depth ratio <italic>H/D</italic> = 3, the numerical model produces load&#x02013;displacement curves within 0.3% of the measured behaviour, and within 0.4% of the bending moment at &#x000bc; diameter of pipe displacement; and</p></list-item><list-item><p>(v)&#x02003;it is found that effective estimates of peak pulling force and bending moments along the pipeline can be obtained using 3D analysis based on residual shear strength. Such an approach is more straightforward and useful for buried pipe calculations compared to techniques that involve empirical adjustments of soil modulus or other calibrations.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Stress-Dependent Soil Modulus Subroutine</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx" xlink:href="rsos181550supp1.docx" orientation="portrait" id="d35e2307" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="d35e149"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="rsos181550_review_history.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec id="s6"><title>Data accessibility</title><p>The datasets supporting this article have been uploaded as part of the electronic supplementary material.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>I.D.M. and A.F. conceived the original idea for this study, provided feedback on the modelling, results analysis and manuscript draft.
