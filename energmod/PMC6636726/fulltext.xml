Reducing car use and increasing active transport is expected to improve health at the city-level, nationally, and internationally [<xref rid="pone.0219316.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219316.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Setting and population-specific estimates of the impact of transport changes are required to trade-off the positive and negative impacts of increased active transport. For example, there are concerns that increased injury risk or increased air pollution exposure may outweigh the benefits of increased physical activity levels in selected population groups or settings [<xref rid="pone.0219316.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>New Zealand (NZ) is highly car dependent: 79% of all self-reported trips are made by car [<xref rid="pone.0219316.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and car ownership rates are among the highest in the world. Low physical activity is the 4<sup>th</sup> leading behavioural risk factor in NZ [<xref rid="pone.0219316.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and only half of adults meet the national physical activity recommendations [<xref rid="pone.0219316.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In addition, 17.3% of gross greenhouse gas emissions in NZ are related to road transport [<xref rid="pone.0219316.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Internationally, estimates of the health impact of increases in active transport are commonly conducted using comparative risk assessment (CRA) methods [<xref rid="pone.0219316.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219316.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, comparative risk assessment methods do not account for time lags between exposure and disease and long-term changes in survival [<xref rid="pone.0219316.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and this suggests that many studies modelling the health impact of increasing active transport overestimate the benefits.</p><p>Previous NZ research based on comparative risk assessment methods strongly suggests that increasing active transport is likely to have positive health impacts and reduce greenhouse gas emissions [<xref rid="pone.0219316.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219316.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, neither of the previous studies included time lags, estimated the uncertainty around modelled health impacts, nor used a lifetime approach to assess the long-term health impact. These methodological limitations mean it is unclear how the health impact of increasing active transport might compare to addressing other population level risks (e.g. smoking and unhealthy diets). This is particularly problematic from a policy perspective&#x02013;if the likely impacts of addressing different health risks cannot be compared due to differing methodological approaches then it is difficult to prioritise resource spending appropriately across competing health priorities.</p><p>We conducted this study to estimate the health impact, change in health system costs, and greenhouse gas emissions associated with increasing active transport in New Zealand. We use an established multi-state life table modelling approach that has been used to estimate the impact of a wide range of other public health interventions internationally including dietary change, alcohol reduction, and tobacco end game strategies [<xref rid="pone.0219316.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219316.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Use of comparable methods facilitates comparison of increasing active transport with interventions addressing other population level risks (e.g. smoking and unhealthy diet).</p><p>The aims of this study were: (i) to estimate health impact of switching short trips to walking and cycling; (ii) to estimate change in health system costs associated with modelled changes in transport patterns; (iii) to estimate change in greenhouse gas emissions associated with changes in transport patterns in NZ.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Overview</title><p>We modelled the differences in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and healthcare costs of shifts in transport behaviours in NZ. We estimated changes in transport patterns and greenhouse gas emissions using unit-level survey data and then multi-state life table (MSLT) modelling to determine long-term impacts on population health and change in health system costs. The MSLT part of the model used the intervention impacts (change in physical activity, distance travelled, and air pollution) to estimate impact on QALYs and healthcare costs over the remainder of the lifetime of the New Zealand population alive in 2011.

A MET is the ratio of work metabolic rate to a standard resting metabolic rate, where one MET is equivalent to sitting quietly [<xref rid="pone.0219316.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>For trips that switched to walking under the intervention scenarios, we assumed that the distance travelled remained constant at a 4.4km/hr walking speed (SD 0.88) [<xref rid="pone.0219316.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We calculated the duration of the walking trip and multiplied by 3 (SD 0.06, uncorrelated with walking speed) (assigned MET value for walking [<xref rid="pone.0219316.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]) to estimate the change in MVPA-METmins. For example, a 0.6km car journey switched to walking would result in a MVPA-METmin increase of 24.5 (0.6 /4.4 * 60 * 3). For trips that switched to cycling, we followed the same process but assumed a speed of 10.5km/hr (average cycling speed of those who reported cycling trips at baseline in the Household Travel Survey (calculated from reported trip distance and duration)) and a 3.5MET values corresponding to cycling at that speed derived from the Compendium of Physical Activities [<xref rid="pone.0219316.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Trip-level changes in physical activity and mode were aggregated to estimate average population level changes in weekly physical activity and annual mode-specific distance travelled, by age, sex, and ethnicity. Change in air pollution exposure, for the whole population, was calculated from change in distance travelled by motor vehicle.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Intervention impact</title><p>The health impacts of modelled interventions were estimated using a proportional multi-state life table model adapted from a model previously developed to evaluate health impacts of changes in diet [<xref rid="pone.0219316.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We simulated the health impact on the adult NZ population, alive in 2011, out until death (lifetime horizon). The business-as-usual (BAU) scenario reflects continuation of current physical activity levels and transport behaviour, and best future annual percentage change estimates for future trends to 2026 (then held constant) in all-cause mortality and non-communicable disease incidence and case fatality in New Zealand. Intervention scenario changes are assumed to continue for the remainder of the modelled population&#x02019;s lifetime. We applied a 3% discount rate to QALY gains and cost-offsets, in accordance with the Burden of Disease Epidemiology, Equity, and Cost-Effectiveness Protocol and international precedent (e.g. ACE-Prevention in Australia and the recommendations of a US panel of health economists) [<xref rid="pone.0219316.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].

These changes in disease incidence rates flowed through the proportional life tables to change disease prevalence and then changed disease mortality (as disease case fatality was acting on a different prevalent pool of cases). Disease-specific changes in mortality and morbidity rates were summed up across diseases in each annual cycle for each sex by age by ethnicity (M&#x00101;ori and Non-M&#x00101;ori) cohort, and subtracted or added to the BAU all-cause mortality and morbidity rates in the main lifetable to estimate QALYs gained over the remainder of the cohort&#x02019;s lifespan (or up to age 110 if still alive). Changes in health system costs between BAU and intervention scenarios were also calculated by the changes in the proportion of the population experiencing incidence, prevalence, and death.</p><sec id="sec010"><title>Physical activity</title><p>To estimate the baseline distribution of physical activity, we converted responses to the New Zealand Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form in the New Zealand Health Survey to MVPA-METmins/week.

Pedestrian and cycling trips were assigned emissions of 0.195kgCO<sub>2</sub>e/km and 0.094kgCO<sub>2</sub>e/km respectively, again reflecting the fuel (in terms of food), required to travel a kilometre. The emissions factors used for pedestrian and cycling trips assumed that energy expenditure was fully compensated with increased energy intake (in line with our assumption of interventions resulting in no change in BMI), and that the emissions profile of the food eaten to compensate had the same emissions footprint as the average New Zealand diet [<xref rid="pone.0219316.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219316.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>We report changes in emissions separately for vehicular and dietary emissions to ease comparisons with previous studies that did not include the dietary emissions component.

The authors estimated per capita gains of around 28.8 health-adjusted life years per thousand (3% discounted) for an intervention that reduced the proportion of trips made by car from 82% to 63%, a similar intervention and result to the full uptake of our combined walking and cycling scenario.</p><p>The relative reduction in health gain from increased road injuries as a proportion of the total health gain of interventions that increase physical activity is also similar to previous research. Stevenson et al [<xref rid="pone.0219316.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] found reductions in health gains from increased road injury to be up to 7% of total health gains observed across a range of cities worldwide; road injury increases also amount to between 2 and 20% of the total disability adjusted life years gained from interventions to increase walking and cycling in California [<xref rid="pone.0219316.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These studies demonstrate the need for road safety improvements alongside strategies to increase active transport, to ameliorate real and perceived road safety issues associated with active transport uptake, and to maximise health gains. Strategies to improve road safety are particularly important to ensure positive shorter-term health impacts of increased active transport in younger age groups who experience low non-communicable disease prevalence but high risk of road injury.</p><p>The overall greenhouse gas emissions reductions we observe for 100% uptake of the walking and cycling scenario are equivalent to up to 64,000 people flying return between London and Auckland, or up to 1.4% of total emissions from road transport in NZ. The reductions modelled here are smaller than previous estimates as we attribute greenhouse gas emissions factors to walking and cycling (as the current study included estimates of GHG emissions associated with increased food intake), as well as to motorised vehicles. Our emissions factors for walking and cycling are based on the assumption that individuals completely compensate for the increased energy expenditure resulting from walking and cycling, and that the emissions of foods that are compensated is comparable to that of current diets in New Zealand [<xref rid="pone.0219316.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Meta-analysis of the impact of active transport on BMI shows minimal impact [<xref rid="pone.0219316.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], hence we assumed that walkers and cyclers increase food intake directly proportion to changes in energy requirements. However, if energy expenditure was not fully compensated, then the emissions associated with walking and cycling would be lower and there would be additional (likely substantial) health impacts from reduced obesity. In an Australian modelling study which assumed that increased active transport would result in reduced obesity, the change in obesity alone resulted in 80% of the health gains of all risk factor components combined (i.e. obesity, road injury, physical activity, and air pollution combined)[<xref rid="pone.0219316.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Regarding the GHG emissions, the dietary component of greenhouse gas emissions is amenable to change&#x02013;dietary greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced by 70&#x02013;80% by adopting more sustainable diets (e.g. by reducing meat and dairy intake) [<xref rid="pone.0219316.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].

However, there may be other trip combinations that are amenable to switching that were not considered as part of this analysis (e.g. A &#x02192; B &#x02192; C &#x02192; A).</p><p>We present results for differing levels of intervention uptake and show that there are disproportionate health gains at even low levels of intervention uptake; 25% uptake of trip switches delivers around a third of the total health gain possible from switching all eligible trips. This is due to dose-response relationships between physical activity and cardiovascular diseases demonstrating decreasing marginal returns as physical activity increases [<xref rid="pone.0219316.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, this pattern would change if trip switching was clustered within individuals. For example, if trip switches were clustered within individuals with low levels of physical activity then the health gains would be larger.</p><p>We were not able to account for patterns of clustering of trips within households. This means that two survey respondents, in the same household, making the same sequence of trips were treated independently in our analysis. This was necessary as we were not able to identify the same trip (in the same vehicle) across multiple survey respondents, and not all people making a trip were captured in the dataset (i.e. not all individuals making a particular trip were survey respondents). This is unlikely to be problematic in the context of the hypothetical scenarios examined in this study, but may be an important consideration for future work examining more targeted behaviour change strategies. For example, for analysis of a family-targeted active transport intervention it would be important to ensure that all family members &#x0201c;switched&#x0201d; at the same time to accurately capture the health impact of the intervention.</p><p>The MSLT modelling approach adopted in this study allows us to examine the timing of health gains and account for time lags between changes in transport behaviours and reductions in disease incidence. Traditional CRA approaches overestimate the benefits of physical activity relative to MSLT modelling approaches [<xref rid="pone.0219316.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and therefore it was unclear whether the benefits of increased physical activity would continue to override the negative impacts of increases in injuries. Our study shows that it does&#x02013;though injury impacts may predominate in the short term in younger age groups.</p><p>We lacked data relating transport-related physical activity behaviours to current physical activity levels. We assumed that increases in physical activity under the intervention scenarios were independent of baseline physical activity levels. This may underestimate the health impacts of the modelled interventions if those who make more of their short trips by car have lower physical activity levels, again, due to decreasing marginal returns at high levels of physical activity. We also assumed that increases in transport related physical activity did not displace other physical activity (e.g. recreational physical activity). As current physical activity levels are low, it is unlikely that increases active transport would displace other physical activity but further evidence is needed to establish the extent of substitution under specific policies.</p><p>Our estimate of the health impacts related to air pollution are based on vehicle distance travelled. This captures the overall improvement in air quality due to reduced vehicle distance. We do not capture the change in trip-level air pollution exposure for an individual who switches from a car trip (at a rest breathing rate) to an active trip involving a higher breathing rate. The impact of this could be positive (if outdoor air quality is good) or negative (if active trip involves longer exposure to areas with poor air quality due to slower speed). There was insufficient data to determine air pollution exposure at the individual level within the dataset; whilst breathing rates are higher for active modes, the quality of air breathed during the trip could be better or worse. Whilst negative impacts of increased air pollution exposure associated with breathing are unlikely to negate benefits from physical activity [<xref rid="pone.0219316.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], examining real-world changes in air pollution exposure from changes in travel mode is needed.</p><p>We assumed that switching short trips to active modes would not impact on BMI, in line with findings of a recent review that argued that there were minimal changes in BMI from increases in active transport [<xref rid="pone.0219316.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Previous modelling studies have assumed BMI reductions based on zero compensation of energy intake [<xref rid="pone.0219316.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219316.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and therefore likely overestimate the health impacts of modelled interventions. However, there is emerging evidence from observational studies suggesting that individuals who transition from walking to cycling may have a decrease in BMI [<xref rid="pone.0219316.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219316.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Further research is needed to establish the extent to which additional energy expenditure from increased walking and cycling is compensated by increased food intake. Different interventions may have different BMI impacts (e.g. mass media campaign encouraging walking for weight loss compared to infrastructure improvements). Further research is also needed to determine the BMI impacts of specific active transport interventions to allow more comprehensive estimates of health and greenhouse gas emission impacts. Interventions that lead to BMI reductions in addition to physical activity level increases could have much larger health gains (and greater reductions in greenhouse gas emissions) than those presented here.</p><p>Our emissions assumptions for car journeys do not reflect systematic variation in car emissions such as higher emissions for &#x02018;cold starts&#x02019; nor differences based on engine size. Emissions for short car trips tend to be higher on a per kilometre basis than those of longer trips due to the fuel required to warm the engine, but the magnitude of this impact is likely to be small [<xref rid="pone.0219316.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. There may also be systematic differences in the car types used for shorter trips, but there was insufficient detail on car type at the trip level to include this in our analysis. If the average engine size of cars used for short trips is larger than average then our scenarios may result in even greater reductions in vehicular emissions.</p><p>Finally, this study examines the healthcare cost implications associated with increases in active transport. Whilst we do not model intervention costs for our hypothetical intervention scenarios, the healthcare cost savings provide an indication of the cost-effectiveness threshold for interventions to improve walking and cycling. From a health system perspective, an intervention (e.g. a mass media campaign or infrastructure improvements) that results in switching 25% of trips to walking would be cost saving up to an intervention cost of NZ$127million (US$90million) and cost effective (at the $45,000 per QALY threshold) up to around NZ$445million (US$317million). Our estimate of the cost-effectiveness threshold for walking and cycling is considerably higher than the total amount spent on walking and cycling investment by the New Zealand Transport Agency between 2008 and 2017 (~NZ$120million [<xref rid="pone.0219316.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]).</p><p>This study adds to the growing body of research around the impact of increasing active travel. Increases in active travel could provide a meaningful increase in physical activity at the population level, but may not be enough to address low physical activity levels alone. Interventions to encourage active transport need to address issues around road safety, but recognise that the long-term benefits of increased physical activity far outweigh road injury risks.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec021"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Switching short trips to walking and cycling would have positive health impacts, reduce healthcare costs, and may also reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
