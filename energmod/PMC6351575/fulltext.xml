The objective of this research is to find out the impacts of social, economic, technological and regulatory barriers in the deployment of renewable energy. Data were collected through an online questionnaire responded to by 223 professionals working in the energy sector all over the globe. This research shows that social, technological and regulatory barriers have a strong influence on the deployment of renewable energy, while economic barriers significantly influence it indirectly. By breaking research and development-related barriers, organizations will be able to invest greatly in developing advanced technologies that can optimize usage of renewable energy and make renewable energy appear more lucrative. With less polluting and lower tariff energy solutions being made available to local people, and higher profits for manufacturers, this will create an atmosphere where all stakeholders are satisfied.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keyword</title><kwd>Business</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">The world's population is growing at an unprecedented rate and that has necessitated a dramatic increase in energy demand globally. Matching supply with this surging demand is a principal and critical challenge for countries around the world. Currently, this demand is being met through the increased use of fossil fuels. The majority of the world's power is generated from the use of coal, oil and gas. These so-called fossil fuels, when burned, release heat energy which is then converted into electricity releasing into the atmosphere a lot of carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas that contributes to the issue of global warming. A renewable energy supply offers a solution to both challenges. For economic growth and human advancement, energy has always been universally considered one of the most crucial measures (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Rawat and Sauni, 2015</xref>). There is a three-dimensional relationship alongside a bi-directional causal relationship between economy, the environment and energy (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Azad et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="p0015">Globally, the population is growing at fast rate; however, the world's energy demand is likely to grow even more rapidly than the increase in the population. According to International Energy Outlook (2013), global energy demand will be increased by 56 per cent between 2010 and 2040 (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Azad et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). Currently, the majority of the world's energy consumption is satisfied by consuming energy created using fossil fuels. To satisfy the ever-increasing energy demand and to protect the climate, breakthrough advancements have been made in the past to design technologies that can control and harness power from alternative energy sources. As controlling carbon emissions is critical in dealing with climate change, renewable energy is an appropriate way to satisfy energy demand without degrading the ecosystem (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Jing, 2016</xref>). Apart from bringing environmental sustainability, renewable energy offers another advantage&#x02014;the ability to provide power to even the most underprivileged people living in the remotest areas where traditional power is not yet available (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Rawat and Sauni, 2015</xref>).</p><p id="p0020">Awareness of the need to encourage deployment of renewable energy has increased drastically in recent years. More countries, whether developed or developing, are promoting and changing policies to promote the deployment of renewable energy. In 2005, only 55 countries had taken steps to make renewable targets and create policies supporting renewable energy. This number had increased to 144 countries by 2013, with almost all the world understanding the need to reduce carbon emissions.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Background</title><p id="p0025">Despite remarkable promotion and commitment from various nations, only a small percentage of energy is generated from renewable energy, especially in developing countries. This scenario is because of the numerous barriers that control the diffusion of renewable energy. These barriers prevent renewable energy from effectively competing with traditional energy and hamper achievement of the necessary large-scale deployment (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Nasirov et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). Penetration and scale-up of renewable require a strong political and regulatory framework which supports and promotes a continued focus on fossil fuels (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Karatayev et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="p0030">A review of the literature shows that many studies have been conducted to identify barriers to the use of renewable energy. However, very few studies have grouped these barriers and discussed the impact of these barriers in the deployment of renewable energy. The variables which were identified from the literature review for use in future research were <italic>social barriers</italic>, <italic>economic barriers, technological barriers and</italic> regulatory barriers.</p><p id="p0035">The objective of this research is to discover the impacts of breaking barriers in the deployment of renewable energy.

Other types of diffusion include social diffusion and theories of change, going back to Lewin's description of the need to alter group standards to promote lasting individual change (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Lewin, 1951</xref>). The focus has since shifted towards external conditions that are likely to be more influential than group decisions (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Darnton, 2008</xref>). Political diffusion deals with the spread of policies and governance approaches across jurisdictional boundaries which come about because of external pressures and/or internal pressures relating to quests for legitimacy (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Weyland, 2005</xref>). More fundamentally, diffusion defines the often random movement of a characteristic. The theory of diffusion is used to understand the attitude and perception of people with regard to government policies.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Hypotheses</title><p id="p0065">This literature review looks at the outcomes of penetration and deployment of renewable energy, which are affected by four major factors: social barriers, economic barriers, technological barriers and regulatory barriers.</p><sec id="sec4.1"><label>4.1</label><title>Social barriers</title><p id="p0070">The transition from conventional resources to renewable energy has encountered public resistance and opposition. This is due to a lack of awareness of the benefits of renewable energy, disruption of seascape, and acquisition of land which could have been used for agriculture, tourism, etc. (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Goldsmiths, 2015</xref>).</p><p id="p0075"><italic>Public awareness and information barriers:</italic> Sustainable development stems from the satisfaction of human desires, through socially recognized technological systems and suitable policies and regulatory tools (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Paravantis et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). The main concerns with respect to public understanding are: 1) insufficient information regarding ecological and financial benefits; 2) inadequate awareness of renewable energy technologies (RET); and 3) uncertainties about the financial feasibility of RE installation projects (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Nasirov et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="p0080"><italic>Not in my backyard&#x02019; (NIMBY) syndrome:</italic> According to NIMBY syndrome, people do support renewable energy generally, but not in their own neighbourhood. Renewable power project proposals often face opposition from individual citizens, political leaders, grassroots organizations, national interest groups and, in some cases, even environmental groups (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Jianjun and Chen, 2014</xref>). Public opposition occurs for a number of reasons, including landscape impact, environmental degradation and lack of consultation concerns among local communities (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Nasirov et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="p0085"><italic>Loss of other/alternative income:</italic> A major issue with renewable plants (especially solar and wind farms) is the vast area of land required to produce an amount of energy equivalent to that which can be produced from a small coal fire power plant (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Chauhan and Saini, 2015</xref>).</p><p id="p0090">To make a significant contribution to global energy consumption, there is a need to develop large scale renewable energy plants, but this requires vast areas of countryside. Enormous parts of the countryside, which includes farmland, need to be converted into buildings or roads or any other infrastructure to support a renewable energy power plant. In achieving this, often agriculture, tourism, fishing, etc. can be affected (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Nesamalar et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="p0095"><italic>Lack of experienced professionals:</italic> Universal transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources requires the solid foundation of a skilled labour force.

There is a need to teach renewable energy courses and for proper training to be conducted to develop the skills required to install and operate renewable energy projects. The shortage of trained workforce to design, finance, build, operate and maintain renewable energy projects is considered a major obstacle to the wide penetration of renewable energy (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Karakaya and Sriwannawit, 2015</xref>).<statement id="enun_H1"><label>H1</label><p id="p0105">Social barriers have a significant influence on the deployment of renewable energy.</p></statement><statement id="enun_H2"><label>H2</label><p id="p0110">Social barriers have a significant influence on economic barriers.</p></statement></p></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><label>4.2</label><title>Economic barriers</title><p id="p0115">Factors influencing economic and financial barriers are high initial capital, lack of financial institutes, lack of investors, competition from fossil fuels, and fewer subsidies compared to traditional fuel (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Raza et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). These factors have prevented renewable energy from becoming widespread.</p><p id="p0120"><italic>Tough competition from fossil fuel:</italic> Fossil fuels will remain a dominant player in supplying energy in the future. A report by EIA's International Energy Outlook (2016) suggests that fossil fuels (oil, natural gas and coal) are expected to supply 78 per cent of the global energy used in 2040. Investment in fossil fuels (including supply and power generation) still accounts for 55 per cent of 2016 global energy investment, compared with 16 per cent for renewable energy. Coal is still a dominant fuel source in most counties because of its abundance, which makes it cheap and accessible (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Dulal et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). There have been huge changes in energy since summer 2014. Oil, as measured by the Brent crude contract, which was priced at $115.71/barrel in June 2014, fell to $27.10 on 20 January 2016, a huge drop of 76 per cent. Similarly, the ARA coal contract dropped from $84/tonne in April 2014 to $36.30 in February 2016. There was a huge decline in the price of natural gas, which slid from around $4.50/MMBtu in June 2014 to $1.91 in mid-February 2016. Due to falling prices and fossil fuel still emerging as a cheaper alternative to renewable energy, it is able to offer tough competition to renewable energy projects.</p><p id="p0125"><italic>Government</italic>
<italic>grants</italic>
<italic>and subsidies:</italic> The amount of government subsidies provided to conventional energy is much higher than the subsidies awarded to renewable energy. This keeps renewable energy at a disadvantage. The subsidies provided by governments to generate electricity from fossil fuel sources is overshadowing the wide use of low emission technologies. For example, coal companies in Australia and Indonesia still receive government subsidies for mining and exploration (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Dulal et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>).</p><p id="p0130"><italic>Fewer financing institutions:</italic> Renewable energy developers and producers face severe difficulties in securing financing for projects at rates which are as low as are made available for fossil fuel energy projects (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Ansari et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). There are limited financial instruments and organizations for renewable project financing. This reflects that the investments are considered somewhat risky, thus demotivating investors (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Ohunakin et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="p0135"><italic>High initial capital cost:</italic> Renewable energy projects require high initial capital cost and, because of the lower efficiency of renewable technology, the net pay back period is high, which in turn pushes investors on to the back foot (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Ansari et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). Both the users and the manufacturers may have very low capital and to install a plant they require capital financing. This problem is further highlighted by the strict lending measures that restrict access to financing even when funding is available for traditional energy projects (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Suzuki, 2013</xref>). High cost of capital, often lack of capital and most important with high payback period projects often becomes un-viable (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Painuly. J, 2001</xref>).</p><p id="p0140"><italic>Intangible costs:</italic> Currently, in almost all countries, the total cost of fuel includes the cost of exploration, production, distribution and usage, but it does not include the cost of the damage it does to the environment and society. Despite severe effects on health and on the atmosphere, the unseen costs (externalities) which are connected with traditional fuels are not included in their price (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Arnold, 2015</xref>). Understanding these impacts is essential for evaluating the actual cost of utilizing fossil fuels for energy generation.<statement id="enun_H3"><label>H3</label><p id="p0145">Economic barriers have a significant influence on the deployment of renewable energy.</p></statement></p></sec><sec id="sec4.3"><label>4.3</label><title>Technological barriers</title><p id="p0150">There are a number of legitimate technological barriers to the widespread deployment of renewable energy, including limited availability of infrastructure, inefficient knowledge of operations and maintenance, insufficient research and development initiatives, and technical complexities like energy storage and unavailability of standards (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="p0155"><italic>Limited availability of infrastructure and facilities:</italic> There is limited availability of advanced technologies required for renewable energy, especially in developing countries, which acts as a factor preventing penetration of renewable energy. Even if this technology is available, the cost of procuring it is very high (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Dulal et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). Since renewable energy power plants are mostly placed in remote locations, they require additional transmission lines to connect to the main grid. Since most of the existing grids are not designed to integrate with renewable energy, these existing grids need to be upgraded or modified (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Izadbakhsh et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). Grid integration is amongst the biggest problems affecting the development of renewable energy projects.</p><p id="p0160"><italic>Lack of operation and maintenance culture:</italic> Since renewable energy technology is comparatively new and not optimally developed, there is a lack of knowledge about operation and maintenance. Efficiency cannot be achieved if a plant is not optimally operated and if maintenance is not carried out regularly (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Sen and Bhattacharyya, 2014</xref>). Lack of availability of equipment, components and spare parts will require a substantial increase in the production costs, as these items need to be imported from other countries, therefore being procured at high prices and so increasing the overall cost (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bhandari et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="p0165"><italic>Lack of research and development (R&#x00026;D) capabilities:</italic> Investment in research and development (R&#x00026;D) is insufficient to make renewable energies commercially competitive with fossil fuel. Both governments and energy firms shy away from spending on R&#x00026;D as renewable energy is in its development stage and risks related to this technology are high (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Cho et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>).</p><p id="p0170"><italic>Technology complexities:</italic> There are not enough standards, procedures and guidelines in renewable energy technologies in terms of durability, reliability, performance, etc. This prevents renewable energy from achieving large scale commercialization (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Nasirov et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). A major technical issue which renewable energy is facing today is the storage of energy. The supply of sun or wind is not continuous despite their infinite abundance and electricity grids cannot operate unless they are able to balance supply and demand. To resolve these issue, large batteries need to be developed which can compensate for the times when a renewable resource is not available (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Weitemeyer et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>).<statement id="enun_H4"><label>H4</label><p id="p0175">Technological barriers have a significant influence on the deployment of renewable energy.</p></statement><statement id="enun_H5"><label>H5</label><p id="p0180">Technological barriers have a significant influence on economic barriers.</p></statement></p></sec><sec id="sec4.4"><label>4.4</label><title>Regulatory barriers</title><p id="p0185">Factors like lack of national policies, bureaucratic and administrative hurdles, inadequate incentives, impractical government targets, and lack of standards and certifications have prevented renewable energy from expanding dramatically (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Stokes, 2013</xref>).</p><p id="p0190"><italic>Ineffective policies by government:</italic> Strong regulatory policies within the energy industry are not only required for a nation's sustainable development, but also resolve the inconsistency between renewable and non-renewable energy. Lack of effective policies creates confusion among various departments over the implementation of the subsidies. Major issues such as unstable energy policy, insufficient confidence in RET, absence of policies to integrate RET with the global market and inadequately equipped governmental agencies act as barriers to the deployment of renewable energy projects (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="p0195"><italic>Inadequate fiscal incentives:</italic> There have not been enough measures by governments to remove tax on imports of the equipment and parts required for renewable energy plants. Feed-in tariffs are the measures by which governments aim to subsidize renewable energy sources to make them cost-competitive with fossil fuel-based technologies, but the absence of these adequate financial incentives results in high costs that hinder the industry's development, operation and maintenance, and stagnate the future (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Sun and Nie, 2015</xref>).</p><p id="p0200"><italic>Administrative and bureaucratic complexities:</italic> Obstacles arising in the deployment of renewable energy projects are manifold, including (and not limited to) administrative hurdles such as planning delays and restrictions. Lack of coordination between different authorities and long lead times in obtaining authorization unnecessarily increase the timeline for the development phase of the project. Higher costs are also associated with obtaining permission due to lobbying. All these factors prolong the project start-up period and reduce the motivation required to invest in renewable energy (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Ahlborg &#x00026; Hammar, 2014</xref>).</p><p id="p0205"><italic>Impractical government commitments:</italic> There is a gap between the policy targets set by governments and the actual results executed by implementation (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Goldsmiths, 2015</xref>). There is a lack of understanding of a realistic target and loopholes in the implementation process itself. The responsibility for overcoming these commitment issues lies with governments. Policies should be devised that can offer clear insight into important legislation and regulatory issues so that the industry can be promoted as stable and offering growth. Governments can fix this mismatch by becoming more responsive and reactive.</p><p id="p0210"><italic>Lack of standards and certifications:</italic> Standards and certificates are required to ensure that the equipment and parts manufactured or procured from overseas are in alignment with the standards of the importing company. These certifications make sure that companies are operating the plant in compliance with local law.

However, the barriers (social, economic, technological and regulatory) existing in this sector prevents the development and penetration of renewable energy globally.</p><p id="p0230"><italic>User-friendly procedures:</italic> Bureaucratic procedures in the deployment of renewable energy are considered the biggest hindrance, and this demotivates investors and entrepreneurs from entering and investing in renewable energy. Government policies are not aligned at national and state level, thus failing to attract energy sector investment (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Nesamalar et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>).

By utilizing more renewable energy resources, nations can help fulfil energy deficiencies without damaging nature. The repercussions of this change would be the creation of more jobs in the designing, building, operation and maintenance of renewable energy project infrastructures. Higher levels of diffusion will help to achieve economies of scale, and that will bring down the costs and thus the price for the end user. This will improve investors' confidence and will trigger increased investments in renewable energy projects. Higher benefits can be reaped from the availability of green energy as there will not be severe environmental implications, and that can help in maintaining the earth's ecosystem.</p><p id="p0240"><italic>Successful research and development (R&#x00026;D) ventures:</italic> In a study conducted by <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Halabi et&#x000a0;al.

Alternative energies that have minimal impact on the environment and are inexhaustible, such as renewable energy, can be a solution to the long-fought sustainability problem. However, despite on-going awareness of the manifold advantages of renewable energy, the diffusion of renewable energy is limited globally. This restriction has been attributed to social, economic, technological and regulatory barriers.</p><p id="p0380">This research presents the impact of social, economic, technological and regulatory barriers on the deployment of renewable energy and how these barriers are interrelated. Focusing on factors influencing barriers and the deployment of renewable energy, a research model was developed and tested by analysing the data collected from 223 respondents. Respondents were experienced professionals from the energy industry. The findings show that social barriers have a positive impact while technological and regulatory barriers have a very significant impact on the deployment of renewable energy. However, this research shows that economic barriers do not directly impact the deployment of renewable energy, but are interrelated with social, technological and regulatory barriers, thus indirectly affecting the deployment of renewable energy. The simultaneous increase in energy demand and the negative impact of fossil fuels on the environment underscores the need for energy production from renewable energy sources. Renewable energy sources strike a perfect balance between economic, technical and environmental considerations, and contribute to a more sustainable development that will favour future generations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec8"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="sec8.1"><title>Author contribution statement</title><p id="p0385">Seetharaman Conceived and designed the experiments.</p><p id="p0390">Krishna Moorthy: Performed the experiments, Analyzed and interpreted the data, Wrote the paper.</p><p id="p0395">Nitin Patwa: Performed the experiments.</p><p id="p0400">Saravanan: Analyzed and interpreted the data.</p><p id="p0405">Yash Gupta: Contributed reagents, materials, analysis tools or data.</p></sec><sec id="sec8.2"><title>Funding statement</title><p id="p0410">This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</p></sec><sec id="sec8.3"><title>Competing interest statement</title><p id="p0415">The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec id="sec8.4"><title>Additional information</title><p id="p0420">No additional information is available for this paper.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ahlborg</surname><given-names>H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Hammar</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Drivers and barriers to rural electrification in Tanzania and Mozambique: Grid-extension, off-grid and renewable energy technologies</article-title><source>Renew.
