    "Polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) is a thermoplastic formed by polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and ethylene glycol and known for his high impact resistance and ductility. The printability of PETG for fused deposition modelling (FDM) is studied by monitoring the filament temperature using an infra-red camera. The microstructural arrangement of 3D printed PETG is analysed by means of X-ray micro-tomography and tensile performance is investigated in a wide range of printing temperatures from 210 °C to 255 °C. A finite element model is implemented based on 3D microstructure of the printed material to reveal the deformation mechanisms and the role of the microstructural defects on the mechanical performance. The results show that PETG can be printed within a limited range of printing temperatures. The results suggest a significant loss of the mechanical performance due to the FDM processing and particularly a substantial reduction of the elongation at break is observed. The loss of this property is explained by the inhomogeneous deformation of the PETG filament. X-ray micro-tomography results reveal a limited amount of process-induced porosity, which only extends through the sample thickness. The FE predictions point out the combination of local shearing and inhomogeneous stretching that are correlated to the filament arrangement within the plane of construction."
