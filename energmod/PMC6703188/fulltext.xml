The low-income scenario makes it unique because the entire proposition is based on the importance of non-income drivers of appliance ownership that includes effects of changing the built environment (BE), household practices (HP) and appliances characteristics (AC). This study demonstrates quantitatively that non-income factors around energy practices influence appliance ownership, and therefore electricity consumption. The methodology consists of questionnaire design across the dimension of BE, HP and AC based on social practice theory, surveying of 1224 households and empirical analysis using covariance-based structural equation modelling. Results show that higher appliance ownership in the slum rehabilitation housing is due to change in household practice, built environment and affordability criteria of the appliances. Change in HP shifts necessary activities like cooking, washing and cleaning from outdoor to indoor spaces that positively and significantly influences higher appliance ownership. Poor BE conditions about indoor air quality, thermal comfort and hygiene; and product cost, discounts and ease of use of the appliances also triggers higher appliance ownership. The findings of this study can aid in designing better regulatory and energy efficiency policies for low-income settlements.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="abs0015"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">Slum rehabilitation causes household practices to shift indoors.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">Shifting of household practices to indoors increase appliance ownership.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">Slum rehabilitation increases energy intensive activities.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0025">Non-income factors around energy practices influence appliance ownership.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Appliance ownership</kwd><kwd>Residential electricity</kwd><kwd>Slum</kwd><kwd>India</kwd><kwd>Energy efficiency</kwd><kwd>Poverty</kwd><kwd>Slum rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>Practice-based approach</kwd><kwd>SEM</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0030">Residential electricity demand is going to increase in the Global South with its accelerated economic growth in the coming decades. The International Energy Agency (IEA) states that OECD countries account for 65 per cent of the total residential electricity consumption globally, while electricity demand in non-OECD countries, especially in the Global South, have grown at twice the rate compared to the OECD countries (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">IEA, 2009</xref>). It is expected that non-OECD countries will exceed OECD countries&#x02019; demand by up to 25 per cent in 2030 (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Cabeza et al., 2014</xref>). Global climate and energy scenario estimate future appliance penetration by using income (average national GDP), electrification and urbanisation driven logistic curves (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">McNeil et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Daioglou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Farsi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">McNeil and Letschert, 2010</xref>). This method is rooted based on the assumption that all households globally at a certain income level would have the same appliances which oversimplify reality (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Rao and Ummel, 2017</xref>). However, factors like market accessibility, affordability, household characteristics, wealth and income levels together better explain appliance ownership (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Rao and Ummel, 2017</xref>).</p><p id="p0035">Everyday activities of occupants shape their need for household appliances which influence energy consumption. These activities represent practices, which are routinised type of behaviour of normal life (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Reckwitz, 2002</xref>). These practices, consciously or not, drive the &#x02018;practical rational&#x02019; behind appliance purchase decisions of individuals and households (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">R&#x000f8;pke, 2009</xref>). Practice-related research demand examinations of broader social processes that place the onus on the practices and how they are performed by households, instead of individuals as energy consumers or appliance users (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Foulds et al., 2016</xref>). Social practise theory (SPT) is a tool to study such social processes. It states that practices are entities made of material arrangements (i.e. materials, technologies and tangible and physical entities), know-how and routines, institutionalised rules and teleoaffective structures (domains of symbols, meanings, beliefs and emotions) (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Labanca and Bertoldi, 2018</xref>). <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Shove et al. (2012)</xref> conceptualised this idea for energy studies through the combinations material, meaning and competencies that together make up the social practice and shape the practice in their process of interaction. In SPT individuals act as a carrier of a practice which ultimately leads to decision-making rather than just the behavioural attributes. <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Shove et al. (2012)</xref> elucidation on the material dimension (i.e. objects, infrastructure, tools, hardware and the human body) of SPT establishes connecting theories around energy consumption in households, but the causations are yet to be studied. A change of built environment in low-income communities is linked with a change in their social processes. However, the influences of this change on the broader physical systems like energy remains understudied in the literature.</p><p id="p0040">Known drivers of residential energy use at a macro-level are income, climate, demographic characteristics, along with energy price dynamics, dwelling type and technology evolution including information and communication technologies (ICT) (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Cabeza et al., 2014</xref>), (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Rao and Ummel, 2017</xref>), (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Ekholm et al., 2010</xref>). In India, macro-level studies have revealed a hierarchy in the order in which goods are acquired (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Daioglou et al., 2012</xref>). Both rural and urban households have been shown to follow complex energy transition trajectories and tend to rely on more than one energy source, as contrary to the idea of climbing the hypothetical energy ladder (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Van Der Kroon et al., 2013</xref>). With the rise in household income, improved solutions become more accessible; there is a tendency to stack multiple energy sources, termed as &#x02018;energy stacking&#x02019; or &#x02018;energy staircase&#x02019; (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Van Der Kroon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Kowsari and Zerriffi, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Bisaga and Parikh, 2018</xref>). The accessibility of an &#x02018;improved solution&#x02019; is shaped by the social practices of the occupants which adds meaning and competence to their daily life through appliance purchase (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Bisaga and Parikh, 2018</xref>). As the improved solution complies with the household practices of a social class, appliance ownership increases, as occupants find value in owning that appliance. Practice theory suggests that appliance ownership is more context-specific than merely a function of income, and not everyone may acquire appliances in the same way as income rises (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Shove et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p id="p0045">In this study, we investigate whether the change of the built environment of slum dwellers to slum rehabilitation housing (SRH) affect their residential electricity use. In doing so, we investigate the number of appliance purchase in the slum rehabilitation housing after shifting and assume it as an indicator of end-user demand for residential electricity. This system boundary defines the novelty of this work, where we link change in built environment, household practice and appliance characteristics as essential drivers of appliance ownership in low-income settlements.</p><p id="p0050">The policy of &#x02018;Slum Rehabilitation Housing&#x02019; was adopted in 1995 by the Government of Maharashtra as a response to redevelop the slums into high-rise social housing by incentivising the private sector to participate in the redevelopment of slum communities. The process mandated to re-house the slum dwellers onsite in high-rise buildings that includes legal entitlement to a stipulated 269-square-foot apartment, including a bathroom with tap water and a kitchenette. This policy provided the slum dweller access to a cross-subsidised, free of cost house, without burdening their time or economic poverty (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Nutkiewicz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Debnath et al., 2017</xref>). The housing units though provided the slum dwellers with a permanent shelter. The units lack basic guidelines for design, energy efficiency or socio-cultural considerations (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Sunikka-Blank et al., 2019</xref>). How housing units are used determines the dynamics of social practices that influence appliance ownership vis-&#x000e0;-vis energy use.</p><p id="p0055">We base our study in an SRH society in Mumbai that comprises of occupants who have been living here for more than six months. Previous studies have shown that these SRHs often resemble &#x02018;vertical slums&#x02019; characterised through the hyper-density of occupants, sub-standard dwelling quality and inadequacy to provide basic amenities (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bardhan et al., 2018a</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">2018b</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Debnath et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Zhang, 2016</xref>). These sub-standard conditions compel the occupants to move back to horizontal slums. A recent study has shown that about 40% of that occupants move out (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Nair, 2018</xref>). In a similar study, it was found that higher appliance ownership in the SRH causes economic distress that causes wider psychological and social discomfort (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Debnath et al., 2019</xref>). However, none of these studies investigated the effect of household practice on occupants' distress and discomfort in the SRH. The present study contributes to this gap in energy research and present empirical evidence on the influence of household practice and built environment on appliance ownership. The contribution of this study is twofold. First, it empirically links household practice, built environment and appliance characteristics to appliance ownership in low-income settlements under urban transition (slums to slum rehabilitation housing). Second, the policy implications of this study can guide in designing better subsidy and energy efficiency plans for such low-income communities.</p><p id="p0060">The primary hypothesis of this study is that higher appliance ownership in the slum rehabilitation housing is due to change in household practice triggered by the change in the built environment from the horizontal slums to SRHs. Six sub-hypotheses (<xref rid="enun_H1" ref-type="statement">H1</xref> to <xref rid="enun_H6" ref-type="statement">H6</xref>) were developed based on a conceptual model of appliance ownership in the rehabilitation houses. It is discussed in detail in Section <xref rid="sec3.2" ref-type="sec">3.2</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. A questionnaire survey was developed to allocate the built environment, appliance characteristics and household practice-based questions to empirically test this hypothesis using a latent-variable modelling approach (see Section <xref rid="sec3.1" ref-type="sec">3.1</xref>). The findings of the empirical analysis are illustrated in Section <xref rid="sec4.2" ref-type="sec">4.2</xref> preceded by a detailed presentation of the data descriptive (see Section <xref rid="sec4.1" ref-type="sec">4.1</xref>). Policy implications of this study are offered in the discussion section (Section <xref rid="sec5" ref-type="sec">5</xref>), and a broader policy pathway for energy sustainability in such urban transition is illustrated in the conclusion section (Section 6).</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Background</title><p id="p0065">Appliance ownership has mainly been discussed or predicted using empirical research based on societal trends, while very few studies examined determinants of appliance ownership at a household level (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Rao and Ummel, 2017</xref>). Macroeconomic studies have estimated the household appliance penetration based on logistic curves driven by income, electrification and urbanisation (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">McNeil et al., 2013</xref>), (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Daioglou et al., 2012</xref>), (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Batih and Sorapipatana, 2016</xref>). However, these estimates do not explain historical appliance diffusion or investigate the household-specific factors that arise from coordinated and independent &#x02018;homely&#x02019; practices that a household performs. Recent studies that describe the growth of household appliances in urban India and China are also skewed by only using the demographic characteristic data (especially the household size), and not considering the effect of household-level drivers in appliance ownership decisions (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Cabeza et al., 2014</xref>), (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bhattacharyya, 2015</xref>). Studies that examined the effect of income elasticity on appliance purchasing capability discussed heavily between the patterns of income and energy growth (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Wolfram et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Auffhammer and Wolfram, 2014</xref>).</p><p id="p0070">Among the few studies of household level determinants, most of the studies have reported household size to be a significant non-income determinant, along with housing type and age (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">O'Doherty et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Leahy and Lyons Sean, 2010</xref>). In rural China, <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Rong and Yao (2003)</xref> found that more education, public services and a higher number of female members in a household increase the likelihood of appliance ownership. In rural India, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Kemmler (2007)</xref> found that important non-income drivers were household characteristics, the degree of community electrification, and the quality of electricity supply. In urban India, <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Tiwari (2000)</xref> found that household size has positive significance on residential electricity consumption. It was recognised that a five-member family in Bombay (now Mumbai) would have 23% more electricity expenditure compared to a two-member family, an addition of an extra member increases the usage by 7.7%. Contrary to this study, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Filippini and Pachauri (2004)</xref> determined negative correlation with electrical energy consumption in urban Indian households, stating that houses with more than six members had lower electricity consumption than those with fewer numbers. A study by <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Louw et al. (2008)</xref> in a low-income household in South Africa had established that the number of household members did not affect the electricity consumption as most of the electrical end-uses (like cooking or watching TV) were shared simultaneously between the occupants.</p><p id="p0075">A significant effect of family composition (i.e. presence of children teenagers, adults and older adults) and the age of the household responsible person (HRP) has been widely acknowledged in the literature as a crucial non-income driver of energy consumption (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2015</xref>). However, these studies do not specifically comment on the drivers of appliance purchase, but rather comment on the effect of household energy consumption and the age of HRP. Tenure type of the house is also identified to have a significant impact on the total residential electricity consumption, but it remains a local-effect and differs widely with the study area (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Wyatt, 2013</xref>). The relationship between dwelling type and higher appliance ownership remains unclear, as in general, the literature suggests that the influence of dwelling type on electricity consumption is related to the differences in floor area (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Wyatt, 2013</xref>). Similarly, for dwelling age it is reported that newer homes have higher energy consumption despite owning higher energy efficient appliances; it is primarily attributed to the rebound effect of energy efficiency (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Tiwari, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Halvorsen and Larsen, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Louw et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2015</xref>). However, most of these studies were conducted in developed countries and may be entirely different for a country like India where culture specific practices matter in driving the electricity demand (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Sunikka-Blank et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="p0080">Other commonly discussed built-environment elements that influence energy consumption are the number of rooms, bedrooms, floors and the floor area in addition to the presence of electric space heating, ventilation, electric hot water heating systems and air-conditioning systems (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Brounen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Larsen and Nesbakken, 2004</xref>). As mentioned earlier, these studies report the findings from developed economies, in our study area, i.e. the slum rehabilitation housing, the presence of these elements (like mechanical cooling, ventilation, hot water system and space heating) is highly unlikely as the general population belong to the lower to middle-income demographic characteristics.</p><p id="p0085"><xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Rao and Ummel (2017)</xref> in their cross-country and micro-level study of Brazil, India and South Africa have shown that there is a significant variation in appliance penetration at a given income level, implying that country-specific factors matter. Upfront purchase cost that determines the affordability of an appliance matters most in low-income households across these countries. Appliances like television and refrigerators have higher penetration in all three countries, whereas the penetration of washing varies widely across the nations. Higher penetration of television and refrigerators can be explained by the influence of social practices with these appliances. While television (an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) equipment) provides a medium for entertainment and knowledge sharing, a refrigerator provides extra utility time, especially to the women of the house (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Dhanaraj et al., 2018</xref>). These devices are purchased for use in households in order to contribute to customers' well-being by creating value in the form of knowledge or entertainment (in case of ICT devices), or by saving time from daily grocery shopping (in case of refrigerators) (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Pothitou et al., 2017</xref>). Studies have reported that occupants tend to own the appliance which complements their social practices, which in turn influence their social practices (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Pothitou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">R&#x000f8;pke and Christensen, 2012</xref>). These appliances enable the users to save time from their day-to-day activities that enable them to derive greater utility from its usage. This extra time is very crucial for the low-income population as they often use it for income generation activities, especially in emerging economies (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Sunikka-Blank et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, &#x02018;time-saved&#x02019; from ICT usage for economic activities is a primary cause behind its higher penetration rate in the emerging economies as compared to the OECD nations (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">IEA, 2009</xref>).</p><p id="p0090">In another study by <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Dhanaraj et al. (2018)</xref>, examining the reason behind low refrigerator ownership in India, the authors found that lack of female education and decision-making capability in the households significantly affect refrigerator purchasing behaviour in the household. The authors suggest that income is not a sufficient condition behind refrigerator ownership; the duration of electricity for more than 17&#x0202f;h a day has more significance. They also mention that as the females in the households tend to derive greater utility from refrigerator usage, their role in purchasing decision-making is vital. Refrigerator lowers household burden of work and eases women's entry into the labour market (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Dhanaraj et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, appliances in such low-income settings have a dynamic role in changing practices and household welfare. Additionally, non-income drivers include household size, years of education of the HRP, number of rooms, dwelling quality, affordability, automobile ownership, female to male ratio, rural-urban migration, race and tenure type (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Rao and Ummel, 2017</xref>).</p><p id="p0095">While these drivers represent the material aspect of Social Practice Theory (SPT), the meaning and skills represent the abstract element of the occupants' socio-cultural dynamics that drives their energy stacking behaviour. In a study by <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Khalid and Sunikka-Blank (2017)</xref> in middle-class households in Pakistan have reported that material and social constructs of &#x02018;homely&#x02019; household practice related to comfort, lighting, cleanliness, cooking and ICT were critical in driving &#x02018;uncanny&#x02019; residential electricity demand. The modernistic prefiguration of spaces and electrical appliances shape occupants social practice, which in turn, shapes everyday energy practices (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Khalid and Sunikka-Blank, 2017</xref>). In a similar work by <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Bisaga and Parikh (2018)</xref> in South Africa have reported that social practices change dramatically and depend on the availability of appliances. They found that appliance ownership does not increase linearly with time. Instead, the change in practices by using an appliance motivates occupants to purchase solar energy appliances. <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Foulds et al. (2016)</xref>, investigated the trend in appliance purchasing amongst occupants who changed home to energy-efficient houses in the UK have found that moving home can change the appliance requirements. The social-meaning of specific appliance-using practices (e.g. stylishness convenience, thermal comfort, cleanliness) were significant in motivating occupants to purchase appliances. However, skills and competence to perform appliance-using practices were less prominent in influencing appliance ownership changes. They suggested that change in the built environment of occupants change appliance ownership based on appliance-using practices.</p><p id="p0100">Rao and Ummel's (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Rao and Ummel, 2017</xref>), Bisaga and Parikh's (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Bisaga and Parikh, 2018</xref>) and Foulds et al.&#x02018;s (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Foulds et al., 2016</xref>), studies provide critical clues for this work as the occupants living in the slum rehabilitation housing have heterogeneity in all the above drivers. These inhabitants are part of one of the biggest informal economy of the world (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Debnath et al., 2017</xref>), they are rural to urban migrants, and they tend to restore their rural identity and social practices (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Nijman, 2015</xref>). They live in low-income settlements, yet they have middle-income household characteristics (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Zhang, 2016</xref>), these occupants own their houses which is a significant fulfilment of aspiration for the middle class (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bardhan et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, these housing units are characterised by sub-standard living conditions in a vertical and high rise building fabric (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Debnath et al., 2019</xref>). A study by <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Debnath et al. (2019)</xref>, have reported that these occupants tend to move out of these houses, and rebound to their original horizontal slums. At present, it is estimated that nearly 40% of the inhabitants rebound by either selling or renting their SRH flats to a third person (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Nair, 2018</xref>). The reason behind such a rebound behaviour was found out to be increased discomfort and distress in the slum rehabilitation households (SRH) owing to a mismatch between social, cultural and architectural design requirements of the occupants (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Debnath et al., 2019</xref>). It was also due to higher appliance ownership among the rehabilitated occupants as they feel SRH as rising their social ladder, and they buy appliances as soon as they move in to fulfil their aspirations (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Debnath et al., 2019</xref>). The transition of the built environment from slums to a permanent vertical housing structure (SRH) was found to influence their social practices that may have had a considerable impact on the appliance purchasing decisions, leading to higher electricity usage. However, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Debnath et al.

Almost 72% of the refrigerators and 75% of the washing machines were bought after moving into the rehabilitation house (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Television ownership almost doubled (49%) on moving to SRH, and similar numbers are recorded for an increase in clothing iron ownership (47%). Contrastingly, ownership of air conditioning units (AC) rose by 100% (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), even though AC units represented only 4.90% of total appliance ownership in the study area (See <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). It is an indicator of growing middle-class and energy-intensive behaviour among the residents.</p><p id="p0240">While almost 99% of the surveyed households had ceiling fans (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), there was a 35.45% increase in its ownership upon shifting to SRHs. A ceiling fan is the only &#x02018;cooling&#x02019; devices available to occupants in the SRHs that is used in the regulation of the occupants' thermal comfort. Increase in its ownership can indicate towards increased discomfort through built environment and is further discussed later in this section concerning the SEM results (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Increase in ICT device ownerships like computer, TV, laptop/tablet computers can influence household practices. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> shows a significant rise in the computer (up by 77%), laptop/tablet (up by 67%) ownership among the occupants along with other devices like toaster (up by 100%), microwave (up by 100%) and geyser (up by 99%) for hot water. These devices account for less than one-tenth the total appliance ownership (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), but their rise in ownership point towards rising energy demand in these low-income areas.<fig id="fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Average time spent in household activities in horizontal slums and slum rehabilitation housing.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0035">Fig. 5</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr5"/></fig></p><p id="p0245"><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> shows the average time spent in the household activities that constitute the social practices of the occupants in the slums and the SRH. The average time spent in household activities in horizontal slums and SRH has contrasting differences in the organisation of the spaces, as mentioned earlier. The life in the horizontal slum was communal therefore activities like cooking, cleaning and washing clothes used to take a greater share of time (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). On moving to the SRH, life became more private, and household practices reoriented around it. The washing time reduced due to shifting of practices to washing machines, the cooking time went down as they had to cook for only the family members, and not as a communal meal. Indoor and private cooking also influenced higher adoption of refrigerators in the households as they could store a larger quantity of cooked meal for days. It was absent in the horizontal slums because the community preferred readily-cooked meals, which eliminated the requirement of a refrigerator. Lack of space in the horizontal slums was also contributed to the low refrigerator ownership.</p><p id="p0250">The cleaning time also reduced as the occupants had to cater to their own 265 square feet rooms rather than cleaning several slum houses and the collective social spaces as in the horizontal slums. This shifting of household practices to private and indoor life in the SRH due to the architectural design of the built environment encouraged adoption of energy intensive appliances like washing machines and refrigerators. It is discussed in detail in section <xref rid="sec4.2" ref-type="sec">4.2</xref>.</p><p id="p0255">A stark difference is in the time spent in subsistence activities (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>d), wherein horizontal slums it used to be a significant component of their social and household practices. These subsistence activities were informal activities that the occupants used to perform in groups to support their livelihood, and it required a considerable amount of social spaces. In the SRH, lack of social spaces restricted this activity which is a significant cause of discomfort and distress as mentioned in (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Sunikka-Blank et al., 2019</xref>), (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Debnath et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, the effect of indoor and private living is evident from the increase in time spent in watching TV and ICT usage in the SRH in comparison to the horizontal slums (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>e). The increased TV and ICT usage have a strong influence on the total increase of indoor energy-intensive activities in the SRH that contributes to an increase in the residential electricity bills. These descriptive evidences support our initial observation that change in household practices contributes to higher appliance ownership, where household practices are changed as the slum dwellers are moved from their informal shacks to formal apartments in the SRH. The next section quantitatively demonstrates this nexus and confirms the significant influence of such non-income drivers in determining the residential energy demand in such low-income settlements.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><label>4.2</label><title>Model estimation for all data</title><p id="p0260">The final SEM model and model fit indices for all data (n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;1224) are shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> and <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, respectively.

Model results show that change of built environment from horizontal slums to vertical SRH apartments positively influenced household practices (0.16), while it significantly accentuated on specific appliance characteristics (0.20, p&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.01) to be central in purchase decision making (see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). The appliance characteristics have a significant positive influence on the changing household practices in the SRH (0.47, p&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.01).</p><p id="p0270">Specific appliance characteristics that have a significant positive effect on the household practices of the occupants are brand (0.63, p&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.01), product cost (0.68, p&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.01), quality (0.59, p&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.01), discount available (0.58, p&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.01) and ease of use (0.67, p&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.01) (see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). As mentioned in section <xref rid="sec3.2" ref-type="sec">3.2</xref>, these variables became important for the occupants on moving to the permanent houses in the SRH because they strongly consider the shift as a step up the social ladder. It further encourages the purchase of rated appliances that have these specific characteristics to suit their aspirational element of &#x02018;owning permanent housing in the city&#x02019;. In the horizontal slums, the occupants preferred buying unrated appliances to save on the upfront cost (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Khosla and Bharadwaj, 2015</xref>). While it is a good indicator from the perspectives of energy efficiency policies that consumers are voluntarily moving towards rated appliances, but this segment of consumers have the added burden of poverty as slum rehabilitation did not change their socio-economic conditions. Therefore, these characteristics do not have a significant influence on a high number of appliance ownership (0.03) on shifting from slums to SRH (see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Instead, these appliance characteristics strongly influence household practices that in turn effects appliance purchase decision in the SRH.</p><p id="p0275">The change of the built environment influences changes in household practices (see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), and it supports the hypothesis <xref rid="enun_H1" ref-type="statement">H1</xref>. The change in the built environment is characterised by the difference in architectural designs between horizontal slum communities and the SRH apartments. As described in section <xref rid="sec3.2" ref-type="sec">3.2</xref>, this change is primarily characterised by the lack of outdoor social spaces in the SRH. Household practices in the horizontal slums revolved around these outdoor spaces where mandatory activities like cooking, cleaning and washing clothes used to be performed communally. The current design of the SRH restricts such as social spaces (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Sunikka-Blank et al., 2019</xref>), which is shifting these activities indoors and is altering the household practices. Increase in indoor activities is increasing the energy intensity of the activities that are translated into higher electricity bills for these low-income households (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Debnath et al., 2019</xref>). It points toward the critical nexus between housing design and energy choices in such low-income settlement programs that can aid in deriving effective energy policies for people living in poverty.</p><p id="p0280">Model results show that there is a significant increase in indoor household activities upon moving into the SRH that significantly influences the household practices (0.10, p&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.01) that in turn strongly influences higher appliance ownership (0.27, p&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.05) (see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Increase in energy-intensive activities on shifting to the SRH has a sizable factor loading on the household practices (0.17). It is due to private usage of appliances in contrast to that of the slums.</p><p id="p0285">The hypothesis <xref rid="enun_H4" ref-type="statement">H4</xref> relates to the relationship between the built environment and uptake of appliances (see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> and section <xref rid="sec3.2" ref-type="sec">3.2</xref>). The significant negative factor loading (0.22, p&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.01) can be interpreted as certain aspects of built environment deteriorate upon moving into rehabilitation housing which influences the purchasing of appliances to compensate for this loss in home comfort. Poor built environment condition in the SRH is a factor of its inefficient design that negatively effects the thermal comfort (0.52, p&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.01) and indoor air quality (0.25, p&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.01). As the household practices have moved indoors in the SRH, poor thermal comfort and indoor air quality further contribute to occupants&#x02019; discomfort and distress (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Debnath et al., 2019</xref>). It, in turn, leads to uptake of appliances that can relieve them from the added discomfort.</p><p id="p0290">Considering the direct and indirect effects on the appliance purchase after shifting, the total estimated effect of each factor is shown in <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>.

Change of practices like confining daily activities indoors was found to have a significant association with the increase in energy-intensive activities (see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) like washing clothes in washing machines, indulging in more ICT usage and increased refrigerator usage and ownership as compared to the horizontal slums (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Built environment elements like lack of social spaces was a critical confounding factor that mediated higher appliance ownership through a change of practices.</p><p id="p0300">The household practices mainly performed by women in the horizontal slums were an open system where spatially unbounded multitasking of activities occurred. For example, women cooked and washed clothes outdoors while socialising with their neighbours. The traditional practice of preparing fresh meals along with ease of availability of fresh vegetables from the local &#x02018;<italic>bazaar</italic>&#x02019; dismissed the need for refrigerators. The ineffective design of SRH with low accessibility made the activities singular and space-bound, triggering energy-intensive indoor living. Presently, refrigerator and TV are the most common appliance that was purchased after shifting to the SRH (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) to compensate for the discomforts from the poor built environment (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Debnath et al., 2019</xref>). The poor indoor air quality, thermal discomfort and lack of hygiene in the SRH are eased through higher appliance ownership which lead to higher electricity demand. If appliance ownership is assumed to have a linear association with energy demand, then this evidence suggests that energy demand will rise multi-fold with the future building stock. Understanding such built environment induced energy demand becomes more important as 70% of India's low-middle income building stocks is yet to be built (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bardhan and Debnath, 2016</xref>).</p><p id="p0305">The results from this study are particularly relevant in designing better energy policies for low-income housing sector through regulatory changes. The policies should be in tandem with the quality of the built environment and appliance purchase behaviour of appliances like refrigerators and washing machines that contribute sufficiently to household welfare by reducing female burden in these low-income habitats. <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Dhanaraj et al. (2018)</xref>, regarded these appliances as &#x02018;welfare appliances&#x02019;. Thus, a &#x02018;good&#x02019; energy policy for such low-income houses should enable the usage of these welfare appliances through built environment design regulations or by providing economic incentives for owning them.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion and Policy implications</title><p id="p0310">We have examined the drivers of higher appliance ownership in low-income settlements that is undergoing transition. This study demonstrates quantitatively that non-income factors around energy practices influence appliance ownership, and therefore electricity consumption. We find that appliance ownership increases when household practices shift indoors. We also find that poor indoor air quality, hygiene and thermal comfort act as a compensatory trigger for higher appliance purchase. Sub-standard design of social housing like the slum rehabilitation housing, not only pose health hazards to the occupants, but our empirical findings indicate the possibility of energy burden on the occupants through higher electricity bills. The findings of this study are crucial for the quantification of a practice-based approach to make &#x02018;good&#x02019; energy policies. Good energy policy in this context should provide the drive for better-built environment design and higher inclusion of welfare appliance to deliver energy efficiency naturally in changing household practices. For example, better-designed SRH can be pre-fitted with energy labelled welfare appliances that can naturally embed relative energy savings in changing practices. This study opens a new dialogue on the inclusion of the effects of changing practices in search of sound energy policy for the Global South.</p><p id="p0315">The significant implications of this study lie in contributing to the energy demand forecasting for growing megacity like Mumbai. It is primarily because the occupants of low-income housing are assumed to belong to the lowest strata of the energy ladder, i.e. they will consume the least energy. However, this study has shown that non-income factors like a change in household practices and built environment characteristics can significantly increase the energy demand despite low-income status. This finding emphasises on the need of designing policies by considering the effects of housing and energy choices of people living in low and middle-income social classes. It remains a significant gap in the current policy discussions as the low-income population are assumed to consume the least energy and resources are allocated accordingly. Such gap if not addressed can pose threats to India's energy security, especially when two-thirds of the building stocks are yet to be built. While India will pull-out millions of its citizens from extreme poverty in the coming decades, the future of urbanisation will primarily belong to the low-income strata. Hence, understanding their practices and energy choices will be critical in determining future energy sustainability.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Funding</title><p id="p0320">RD is supported by <funding-source id="gs1">Bill &#x00026; Melinda Gates Foundation</funding-source> (Grant no.
