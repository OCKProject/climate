This study examines the effect of inclined wall self-shading strategy on heat gain in an office building. Field measurement of environmental variables such as ambient temperature, relative humidity, dew point, and wet bulb temperature was carried out in a case study inclined wall self-shading office building located in Putrajaya, Malaysia. The results of the validation of ApacheSim simulation software tool against the measured environmental variables indicated significant reliability having Pearson correlations ranging from 0.56 to 0.90. In establishing the relationship between different inclined wall strategies to the amount of heat gain, modification of the inclined wall self-shading projection (SSP) was modelled and experimented using ApacheSim simulation. Findings from the analysis revealed a relationship between heat gains into a building space and self-shading projection (SSP), as heat gains tend to reduce with increased SSP. From the findings, the optimum inclination angle of self-shading for effective heat gain reduction is based on a 45% self-shading projection. The application of inclined wall self-shading strategy in buildings would, therefore, bring about a reduction in heat gain, which invariably reduces energy consumption for cooling.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Energy</kwd><kwd>Environmental science</kwd><kwd>Self-shading</kwd><kwd>Simulation</kwd><kwd>Energy efficiency</kwd><kwd>Diamond building</kwd><kwd>Heat gain</kwd><kwd>Inclined wall</kwd><kwd>Environmental analysis</kwd><kwd>Environmental assessment</kwd><kwd>Environmental engineering</kwd><kwd>Environmental impact assessment</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Wall shading strategy in buildings is one of the passive design strategies to minimize the direct impact of sunlight on a building facade as a means of reducing solar heat penetration in buildings, especially, in the tropics (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Chia, 2008</xref>). The building envelope is its external parts through which radiant heat is conducted into the indoor building spaces. Consequently, buildings are expected to have an outer skin that prevents or reduce heat penetration (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Malaysian Standard, 2007</xref>). The increase in energy demand is not at parity with available natural resources, therefore, resulting in higher energy cost. The design and construction of buildings to promote sustainable environment have been reinvigorated especially, by applying appropriate technology and methods. A decrease in energy consumption can be attained using both the user-based and infrastructure-based method. The user-based method involved changing the building occupant's behavior as regards a reduction in energy demand regarding efficiency yield, while the infrastructure-based method involved building designs that have less energy demand in their functional requirements. The passive design of buildings has consequently, translated into an improvement in the buildings natural ventilation and thermal insulation.</p><p id="p0015">Sustainable buildings and the efficient use of energy in recent times have turned out to be main subjects of critique which requires much attention to be committed to it (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Marszal et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). One of the top sectors in energy demand and depletion particularly in countries with higher urbanization rate and standard of living is the building industry (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Xin and Rao, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). In tropical Malaysia for example, cooling account for most of her energy consumption. For instance, a study carried out by <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Chan (2004)</xref>, have shown that air-conditioning alone takes about 64% of energy demand in a typical office building in Malaysia, because of it hot and humid climate. Other building services such as lighting and general equipment take the remaining percentage in the ratio of 2:1 respectively. <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Saidur (2009)</xref> on the other hand have affirmed that the energy consumption for air-conditioning in buildings in Malaysia takes 57% while lighting makes 19%, which contradicted Chan's assertion. However, these study outcomes are indicative of the necessities to reduce energy consumption in Malaysian office buildings by applying energy-efficient strategies.</p><p id="p0020">As a result of high energy cost and its environmental impact, energy consumption in buildings needs to be reduced both at the conceptual design stage and the building in use. Research has shown that energy demand in buildings can be reduced where specific energy efficient innovations are employed in the building design (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Cambiaso, 2013</xref>). For sustainability to be achieved in the design of green buildings, the need to carry out building modelling and simulations using computer-aided tools have been alluded (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Cambiaso, 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, most architectural design of buildings tends towards aesthetic values rather than the design of buildings to respond to climatic elements thereby reducing heating and cooling loads (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Sulaiman and Hassan, 2011a</xref>). Consequently, several types of research have been carried out in Malaysia to develop strategies that can minimize the demand for energy for cooling in (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bhaskoro and Gilani, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Kwong et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Sulaiman and Hassan, 2011b</xref>). Through some of these studies, some forms of modifications to building facades such that would reduce heat gain into the building by direct sun rays especially in highrise buildings have been suggested (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Capeluto, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Chia, 2008</xref>). One of these modifications is self-shading in buildings, which reduces the impact of solar radiation on the building indoor spaces.</p><p id="p0025">There have also been efforts towards constructing &#x0201c;Zero Energy Building (ZEB)&#x0201d; with no carbon and energy footprints (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Todorvic, 2012</xref>). In Malaysia today, there exist about three prominent energy efficient office buildings which have been adjudged to achieving less energy demand in comparison to other typical office buildings (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chan, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Kandar, 2005</xref>). The successes recorded as result of the design and construction of these buildings have brought about increasing awareness and concern by both government and policymakers, and also researchers, towards the promotion of energy efficiency in buildings.</p><p id="p0030">Heat penetration into a building can be influenced by the building form, location, orientation, wall shading, and fenestration performance, which invariably affects the amount of energy required for cooling (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Lam et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Kuhn et&#x000a0;al. (2001)</xref>, have stated that only a small amount of solar radiation incident on a building wall is transferred through openings. The average intensity of solar energy incident on a horizontal building plane is 1000W/m2 annually while that on a vertical wall plane facing Eastern and Western direction is 850 W/m<sup>2</sup>. In the tropics, therefore, it is preferable to have windows facing towards the North and South directions to minimize the impact of solar radiation (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Djamila et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). This study has also shown the importance of window wall ratio (WWR) in balancing between daylighting and cooling effects. A WWR of 25% is required as the optimum for achieving both lighting and cooling in office buildings (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Nikpour et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Zain-Ahmed et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>). The need therefore to study the energy performance of existing buildings have become paramount, as it would lead to the building improvement and also an increase in the design of new buildings for better energy efficiency.</p><p id="p0035">There is a high need for the provision of optimum environmental comfort conditions for office workers regarding solar irradiation, ventilation, and thermal comfort. However, meeting these essential needs of building occupants is synonymous to increase in energy consumption. The quest towards providing a comfortable environment to building occupants at reduced energy demand has led to the promotion of sustainable and green building design, application of energy harvested from renewable means and efficient heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning system (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Anselm, 2006</xref>). This ingenuity has been adopted by different countries including Malaysia towards reducing natural fuel and the application of energy from renewable resources, to mitigate global warming and climate change (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Begum et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). A reduction in energy demand in a building can be reduced through heat gain reduction. The decrease of heat gain through a building fabric can be achieved through external shading, window-wall area, glazing type, surface finish, shading coefficient (SC), solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) etc (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Lam et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>).</p><p id="p0040">The evaluation of a building in use through systematic analysis provides the avenue for identifying success in the design features that can be promoted for future use. External shading geometry on buildings has been found to contribute considerably to reducing energy consumption for cooling loads due to its shading behaviour. An external building shading can, therefore, be designed to achieve energy efficiency in multi-story office buildings (Dilshan R <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Ossen et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). Several buildings have been designed such that their exterior facades could enhance their thermal performance. Some of these buildings have Self-shaded facades and includes amongst others; the Energy Commission building (Diamond Building) in Putrajaya, Malaysia (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>), Bank of Israel in Jerusalem (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>a), and Bat Yam City Hall also in Israel (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>b). The above-mentioned building facades act as a shield to the sun not allowing it get into the building. Such strategies that was employed on these buildings reduces the amount of incident solar radiation thereby reducing the peak-cooling load of the buildings. Another example of a building having a self-shading fa&#x000e7;ade is the Madrid's &#x02018;Distrito C&#x02019; office building (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>c) whose fa&#x000e7;ade was designed with protruding panels acting as sun visors, as well as, providing the building with a unique aesthetic character. The self-shading of the building is provided through its twisted form configuration that protects the building from direct solar heat gains.<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Examples of some Selected Self-Shaded Buildings (a) Sketch of Bank of Israel, Jerusalem (b) Sketch of Bat Yam City Hall (c) Sketch of Madrid's &#x02018;Distrito C&#x02019; Office Building, Spain.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0010">Fig.&#x000a0;1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p><p id="p0045">An investigation carried out on Energy Commission building in Malaysia, have shown that the application of active energy sustaining design approaches are still under trial examination (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Xin and Rao, 2012</xref>). In designing a building for energy efficiency, an important parameter to be considered is heat gain into the building (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Malaysian Standard, 2007</xref>). The quantity of heat transmission from the outdoor to the indoor space of the building through the building fabric is called the overall thermal transfer value (OTTV) (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Tzikopoulos et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). OTTV is therefore used as a basis for achieving optimum building fabric design towards reducing heat penetration through external walls. Therefore, to promote inclined wall self-shading strategies in the design of office building facades, an investigation of the self-shading scheme employed on the Diamond building is carried out to ascertain its effectiveness on heat gain and cooling load demand. The study is aimed at exploring the performance of inclined wall self-shading fa&#x000e7;ades towards reducing heat gain and load for cooling. In determining the most efficient self-shading strategy, different models of an office space having the wall fa&#x000e7;ade inclined at various self-shading projection (SSP) are modelled. The significance of this study is in providing an improvement of design databases, criteria, and control literature towards making of better-informed design decisions and having an understanding of the implications of design (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Preiser, 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Study area</title><p id="p0050">Energy Commission building called &#x0201c;Diamond Building&#x0201d; as one of the Green rated office buildings in Malaysia has drawn the attention of many in recent times. This building is a remarkable edifice in the sense that, it showcases how efficient building design strategies can reduce energy demand as a means of realizing zero energy building. The Energy Commission building exhibits the potentials of sustainable green building initiatives, which is integrated with smart technology innovations to achieved energy efficiency.</p><p id="p0055">The design of Diamond building is like a pyramid turned upside-down and had its top vertex buried underground. The building has eight (8) storeys with a deep floor plan. The building reinforced concrete slabs used for the roof and floors were designed with embedded elastic 22mm PERT cold water pipes, as a cooling storage system. It has a building fa&#x000e7;ade that symbolizes a Diamond shape (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>). The choice of this form is to create a self-shading effect such that direct sun rays are eliminated from the building while allowing diffused daylight. The design strategies of the building are of energy performance, efficient water management, indoor environmental quality and sustainable building landscape. The building has a tilted fa&#x000e7;ade that is extensively glazed whose configuration provides shading for the lower floors, prevents direct solar radiation on the fa&#x000e7;ade, and also offers a smaller building footprint. The low E-glass used on the building fa&#x000e7;ade walls is to reduce radiant heat infiltration. The building orientation follows the Sun path pattern to minimize the area that is impacted by direct sunlight. The tilted fa&#x000e7;ade eliminated any requirement for external shading devices as it is self-shaded from the incidence of solar radiation and heat (the upper floors providing shade to the lower levels). The Diamond building has surrounding landscape as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref> as an external obstruction but acting as barriers to heat gain into the building.

The surface properties were based on the properties of the material components of the building. This case study office space was employed as the baseline model for simulation.

The external walls of the Diamond building are inclined at the same angle in all the four different facades. Therefore, the effect of the building self-shading is taken to be the same in all the offices at each floor level. Hence, the choice of single office space on level four of the office building for measurement and study. The building glazing has a solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) of about 0.37 with an emmisivity of 0.16, and a shading coefficient of 43%, which reduces greatly the direct influx of solar heat gain on the East/West orientation. The glazing also has a visual light transmittance of about 52% and a U-value of 0.072Wh/m<sup>2</sup>K. On the other hand, the Diamond building has a shading coefficient (SC) of 0.53 for the north and south orientation, visual transmittance of 55.9%, solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) of 0.46, and a U-value of 0.956 W/m<sup>2</sup>K. It has a window wall ratio (WWR) of about 60% (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Nikpour et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>).

Both field measurement and simulations were carried out and analysed to quantify the effect of inclined wall self-shading strategy towards reducing heat gain and energy consumption for cooling.</p><p id="p0200">Heat conduction through wall and window as well as, solar heat gain were estimated for a test baseline model and other modification to inclined wall self-shading projection. Also, in trying to ascertain the best-inclined wall angle with the least level of heat penetration, the amount of OTTV was calculated for the various self-shading projections. The finding from the results can be summarised as follows:<list list-type="simple" id="olist0010"><list-item id="o0010"><label>1.</label><p id="p0205">There is a relationship between heat gains into a building space and the self-shading projection, as heat gain tends to reduce with increased SSP.</p></list-item><list-item id="o0015"><label>2.</label><p id="p0210">A self-shading projection of 45<sup>o</sup> (SSP-45) and above received a zero heat conduction through walls and zero solar heat gain through windows.</p></list-item><list-item id="o0020"><label>3.</label><p id="p0215">OTTV is minimal in the baseline model (SSP-45) as compared to other self-shading projections. SSP-45 happens to be the test baseline model (Energy Commission building), which has the least possible level of heat gain during working hours. This can be seen as the best self-shading projection to be adopted for inclined wall strategy.</p></list-item><list-item id="o0025"><label>4.</label><p id="p0220">The design of self-shading using an optimum SSP-45 inclined wall strategy at an angle of 65<sup>o</sup> to the horizontal plane, as evident in the Diamond building has exhibited the best performance regarding reduction in heat gain and energy demand for cooling.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="p0225">Inclined wall self-shading strategy has shown to be of considerable impact on reducing direct solar gains and heat conduction into a building space. This study has found out that, the optimum inclination angle of self-shading for efficient heat gain reduction is based on a 45% self-shading projection. The application of inclined wall self-shading strategy in buildings would, therefore, bring about a decrease in the amount of OTTV, which would invariably reduce energy consumption for cooling. Inclined wall self-shading principle can, thus, be employed by design Architects towards energy-efficient and green buildings delivery.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="sec6.1"><title>Author contribution statement</title><p id="p0230">Mohd Zin Kandar: Conceived and designed the experiments; Performed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data; Contributed reagents, materials, analysis tools or data.</p><p id="p0235">Pontip Nimlyat: Performed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data; Contributed reagents, materials, analysis tools or data; Wrote the paper.</p><p id="p0240">Muhammed Abdullahi: Performed the experiments; Contributed reagents, materials, analysis tools or data.</p><p id="p0245">Yakubu Aminu Dodo: Performed the experiments; Wrote the paper.</p></sec><sec id="sec6.2"><title>Funding statement</title><p id="p0250">This research was supported by the GUP Grant of <funding-source id="gs1">Universiti Teknologi Malaysia</funding-source> (UTM), Grant number: PY/2014/01613.</p></sec><sec id="sec6.3"><title>Competing interest statement</title><p id="p0255">The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec id="sec6.4"><title>Additional information</title><p id="p0260">No additional information is available for this paper.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Anselm</surname><given-names>A.J.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Building with nature (ecological principles in building design)</article-title><source>J.&#x000a0;Appl.
