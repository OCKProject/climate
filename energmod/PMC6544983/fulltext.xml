Although the contributions of growth to shape change have been captured through modelling tissue sheets or isotropic volumes, a framework for modelling both isotropic and anisotropic volumetric growth in three dimensions over large changes in size and shape has been lacking. Here, we describe an approach based on finite-element modelling of continuous volumetric structures, and apply it to a range of forms and growth patterns, providing mathematical validation for examples that admit analytic solution. We show that a major difference between sheet and bulk tissues is that the growth of bulk tissue is more constrained, reducing the possibility of tissue conflict resolution through deformations such as buckling. Tissue sheets or cylinders may be generated from bulk shapes through anisotropic specified growth, oriented by a polarity field. A second polarity field, orthogonal to the first, allows sheets with varying lengths and widths to be generated, as illustrated by the wide range of leaf shapes observed in nature. The framework we describe thus provides a key tool for developing hypotheses for plant morphogenesis and is also applicable to other tissues that deform through differential growth or contraction.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>growth modelling</kwd><kwd>plant development</kwd><kwd>volumetric growth</kwd><kwd>finite-element modelling</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-2012-AdG 323028 - CarnoMorph</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/L008920/1</award-id><award-id>BBS/E/J/000PR9787</award-id><award-id>BB/M023117/1</award-id><award-id>BBS/E/J/00000152</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>May 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Various approaches have been taken to mathematically model plant tissue growth and morphogenesis in order to develop and clarify hypotheses for tissue behaviours [<xref rid="RSOB190057C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSOB190057C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Biologically, plant tissue is an interconnected mesh of cell walls, whose growth is driven by turgor pressure, with new walls arising by cell division as the tissue grows. One approach is to model the walls and interiors of cells explicitly. Such models allow cellular-level predictions to be made and validated. This method has been used to model the growth of meristem primordia, embryos, roots, shoot apices, fern gametophytes, sepals and leaves [<xref rid="RSOB190057C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSOB190057C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Another approach, and the one adopted in this paper, is to abstract from cells, by modelling tissue as a continuous material, either as a surface with no thickness or as a sheet of finite thickness. The advantage of the continuum approach is its simplicity, particularly when dealing with three-dimensional deformations and anisotropic growth. The method has been used to simulate growth and morphogenesis of various tissue sheets, including shoot apices, leaves, sepals, petals and fruits [<xref rid="RSOB190057C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="RSOB190057C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="RSOB190057C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSOB190057C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], as well as animal tissue sheets such as hearts and facial cartilage [<xref rid="RSOB190057C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="RSOB190057C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Modelling software that we have developed [<xref rid="RSOB190057C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] was specialized for sheet-like tissues (those that are everywhere thin in one direction, but may be curved in space). Here, we extend the method and software to volumetric growth of bulk tissues. Sheet-like tissues can then be modelled as an outcome of patterns of growth from an initial non-sheet-like primordium, rather than being an assumed initial state.</p><p>When tissue is modelled as a continuum, it is assumed that for each region of the tissue, there is a specified rate of growth that defines how much that region would grow in mechanical isolation from neighbouring tissue [<xref rid="RSOB190057C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This rate of &#x02018;specified&#x02019; growth is a tensor quantity, representing the possibility that the growth may be by different amounts in different directions. The problem is then to compute the deformation field, or resultant growth (i.e. a mapping of each region of the tissue to its new position), that will result from applying the field of specified growth rate for all regions when mechanically connected together, over some small time interval. In general, there will be no deformation field in which every region of the tissue achieves its specified growth. For example, a disc-shaped tissue growing faster at its edge than at its centre may be forced to buckle out of the plane, introducing a deformation (curvature or rotation) which was not specified by the growth field. The actual deformation resulting from the field of specified growth is taken to be whatever shape minimizes the strain energy. In general, there may be no deformation that reduces the strain energy to zero everywhere, and there will remain some residual strain. Another way of conceptualizing this is that the specified growth defines a new metric on the tissue, and the deformation is that which aligns this metric as closely as possible (i.e. with minimal strain energy) with the standard Euclidean metric [<xref rid="RSOB190057C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Residual strain may be assumed to dissipate as fast as it arises, or may be allowed to accumulate at a finite rate.</p><p>The physical mechanism of growth of plant tissue is generally held to be that cells enlarge by turgor pressure acting to stretch cell walls whose elastic stiffness has been reduced, which are then reinforced by the addition of wall material [<xref rid="RSOB190057C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In our framework, the specified growth of each cell-sized region during a time step corresponds to the amount by which the cell would incrementally yield in this way, if it were unconstrained by the surrounding tissue. The resultant growth of each region is then its equilibrium conformation given the constraint that the whole tissue remains continuous.</p><p>The discarding of residual strain after each time step amounts to treating the resultant deformation as an irreversible plastic flow. Thus, the framework treats growth as a viscoelastic process [<xref rid="RSOB190057C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The amount of plasticity may be reduced by retaining all or part of the residual strain.</p><p>Specified growth rates are assumed to be set by morphogens that are produced or removed at certain locations, and may diffuse through the tissue and react with each other. These processes are modelled by partial differential equations, which are solved by numerical methods. The sheets are one finite element thick, and growth is specified as being oriented normal to the plane of the sheet (growth in thickness) or oriented within the plane (planar growth). Anisotropic growth within the plane can be specified through a polarity field, established by taking the local gradient of a diffusible factor called POL. Specified growth rates may then be given parallel (<italic>k</italic><sub>par</sub>) or perpendicular (<italic>k</italic><sub>per</sub>) to the gradient of POL. Sheet curvature may arise as it reduces potential growth conflicts [<xref rid="RSOB190057C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="RSOB190057C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>To extend this framework to volumetric growth, several challenges need to be met. First, methods are required for dynamic local subdivision of finite elements growing in three dimensions, in order to maintain the computational quality of the mesh as it is deformed. Second, anisotropic growth orientations need to be specified through an internal mechanism, rather than by pre-assigning growth to be within or normal to the plane of a sheet. Third, growth patterns should be validated by examples that allow analytical solutions. Here, we address these problems and apply the volumetric framework to several case studies, illustrating how additional tissue constraints arise in bulk tissue compared with sheets, and how a variety of forms, including sheets and outgrowths, can be generated.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><label>2.</label><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><label>2.1.</label><title>Volumetric finite-element meshes</title><p>Modelling the growth of two-dimensional sheets is in some ways simpler than modelling growth in three-dimensional volumes, because growth orientations are specified in relation to the plane of the sheet (i.e. growth parallel to the plane and growth in sheet thickness). This difference influences the choice of finite-element shapes. For sheets, we employed finite elements in the shape of warped triangular prisms [<xref rid="RSOB190057C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB190057F1">figure 1</xref>. Sheets are one element thick (modelling sheet thickness directly rather than by thin shell methods), with the triangular ends of the prisms corresponding to the two surfaces of the sheet.

Any shape can be decomposed into tetrahedra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB190057F1">figure 1</xref> shows an example), whereas other finite-element shapes are less flexible. A further advantage of tetrahedral elements is that they are more amenable to local dynamic remeshing (discussed below). All of the solid three-dimensional models described in this paper use meshes of tetrahedra.</p><p>For simplicity of coding, we have implemented only first-order (linear) elements, as employed previously for modelling sheets [<xref rid="RSOB190057C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. That is, the geometry of an element is determined by its corner vertices, and there are no additional vertices along its edges, within its faces or in its interior. Each quantity of interest, such as the concentration of a morphogen, is represented by its values at the vertices of the elements, and conceptually interpolated over the volume of each element. Each step of the simulation calculates the specified deformation of each finite element at certain points in its interior, and the result of the calculation is a displacement of every vertex. This displacement is then applied, and a new simulation step begun.</p><p>The constitutive equations, which define the relevant physical properties of the tissue (elasticity and diffusion), are the same as those previously used (see [<xref rid="RSOB190057C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and the electronic supplementary material to the present paper). The numerical implementation applies them to general tetrahedral meshes instead of a single layer of pentahedra.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><label>2.2.</label><title>Dynamic refinement</title><p>Differential regional growth can lead to the accumulation of very large differences in element size over a mesh. Anisotropic growth can also produce elements that are very thin in one or two dimensions. These phenomena can reduce numerical accuracy. To maintain the quality of the decomposition into finite elements, it is necessary from time to time to subdivide or reorganize parts of the mesh, by splitting large elements into smaller ones and eliminating very thin elements, while maintaining the outer shape, the continuity of the mesh and the distribution of morphogens across the mesh.</p><p>This process of dynamic remeshing involves splitting finite elements in such a way that all daughter elements are of the same type as the parents (e.g. all tetrahedra, or all prisms). Dynamic remeshing of a growing sheet of triangular prisms is relatively straightforward, as we only need to consider subdividing the triangular surface mesh (there are no subdivisions within the thickness of the sheet). If we wish to split a single edge of a triangle by introducing a new vertex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB190057F2">figure 2</xref><italic>a</italic>), we can simply split the triangle on each side into two. Similarly, splitting two or three edges with new vertices (red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB190057F2">figure 2</xref><italic>b</italic> and <italic>c,</italic> respectively) can create daughter triangles by joining to surrounding vertices. If an arbitrary set of edges is to be split, we can find for each triangle a subdivision into smaller triangles that splits exactly the desired edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB190057F2">figure 2</xref><italic>d</italic>).

New vertices are drawn in red on the left and new edges added to maintain a triangular mesh are drawn in red on the right.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rsob-9-190057-g2"/></fig></p><p>Dynamic subdivision of a tetrahedral mesh involves establishing new connectivities with vertices in three dimensions. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB190057F3">figure 3</xref><italic>a</italic> shows a mesh comprising five tetrahedra around a common edge (drawn in red). The individual tetrahedra are shown in an &#x02018;exploded view&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB190057F3">figure 3</xref><italic>b</italic>. If we split the common edge by introducing a new vertex (also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB190057F3">figure 3</xref><italic>a</italic>), then all five of the tetrahedra must be split in two as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB190057F3">figure 3</xref><italic>c</italic>. The 10 tetrahedra are shown in exploded view in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB190057F3">figure 3</xref><italic>d</italic>. However, if an arbitrary subset of the edges of a tetrahedron are to be split, then it becomes more complicated. When a face of a tetrahedron is split, and that face is shared by a second tetrahedron, then that tetrahedron must be split in a way that gives the same splitting of the common face in order to maintain consistency of the finite-element decomposition. There are further transformations, such as merging the ends of very short edges, that would be useful to maintain the quality of the mesh but implementing these is not straightforward (see electronic supplementary material).

The reason is that, while in cases (<italic>a</italic>&#x02013;<italic>d</italic>) there is a natural choice of how to subdivide each face of the tetrahedron, in cases such as (<italic>e</italic>) there are two different ways to split the face. Another tetrahedron will share that face and must give it the same subdivision. Coordinating these divisions while searching for one that will best maintain the quality of the mesh is a complex problem.

(<italic>e</italic>) Example of a case that is not implemented. Two adjacent edges are to be split. There are two ways to split the face containing these edges into triangles. The tetrahedron on the other side of that face must split it in the same way. This coordination of splitting complicates the implementation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rsob-9-190057-g4"/></fig></p><p>To ensure that we only deal with cases (<italic>a</italic>&#x02013;<italic>d</italic>), when we have identified a set of edges that should be split because of their length, we eliminate edges from the set until the required splitting of each tetrahedron matches one of those cases. The edges left unsplit can be dealt with by repeated applications of this process.</p><p>For meshes made of pentahedra (warped triangular prisms) and hexahedra (warped cubes), dynamic remeshing is more difficult. It is easy to subdivide every element simultaneously into smaller elements, but to refine some arbitrary subset, while maintaining consistency across shared faces, is not necessarily possible, unless one allows meshes that mix different shapes of element. The number of special cases of thin elements of these shapes is also large. Therefore, while our software supports pentahedral and hexahedral elements, we have not implemented remeshing for these elements.</p><p>As described in [<xref rid="RSOB190057C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], when we subdivide sheet meshes, new vertices are in general not placed at the midpoints of the split edges, because this would tend to preserve the flatness of every triangle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB190057F5">figure 5</xref><italic>a</italic>). Instead, we use a method drawn from computer graphics called butterfly subdivision [<xref rid="RSOB190057C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB190057F5">figure 5</xref><italic>b</italic>). This method considers the triangular mesh to be an approximation to a continuous curved surface, and attempts to place the new vertex on that surface by suitably offsetting it from the midpoint. For volumetric meshes, we use simple bisection for edges in the interior, but butterfly subdivision on the surface.
<fig id="RSOB190057F5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Two iterations of three methods of subdivision: flat (<italic>a</italic>), butterfly (<italic>b</italic>) and Catmull&#x02013;Clark (<italic>c</italic>).

For our purposes, butterfly subdivision has the essential property that the refined mesh includes all of the vertices of the original mesh. This is not the case, for example, for the more widely used Catmull&#x02013;Clark subdivision [<xref rid="RSOB190057C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], where none of the original vertices lie on the refined mesh, and which tends to shrink the mesh as it is refined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB190057F5">figure 5</xref><italic>c</italic>). The Catmull&#x02013;Clark method also produces quadrilaterals, regardless of what polygons the original mesh was made of.</p><p>The displacement of vertices prescribed by the butterfly method should not be thought of as a deformation of the finite elements, but as a remeshing that better approximates the smooth-surfaced volume that is being modelled. Therefore, if residual strain is present in the elements, it retains its values during subdivision. The volume of a divided element at the surface will increase slightly where the surface is convex and decrease where it is concave, thus changing its total strain energy, but the amount is slight and comparable to the finite accuracy of the finite-element method itself.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><label>2.3.</label><title>Volumetric tissue conflicts</title><p>Using the finite-element system described above, we explore the effects of various spatial patterns of specified growth on the resultant growth and deformation. For growth of sheets, tissue conflicts can be classified into three types: surface (differential specified growth between the surfaces of the sheet), areal (differential specified growth rates across the sheet) and directional (variation in the orientation of specified growth) [<xref rid="RSOB190057C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. For volumetric growth modelling, there is no predefined sheet, so there is no category of surface conflict. We, therefore, define only two types of conflict: regional (conflicts arising through variation in specified volumetric growth rates) and directional (conflicts arising from variation in the orientations of specified growth). We investigate how both regional and directional tissue conflicts may be resolved and how this compares with the situation for growth of sheets.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><label>2.4.</label><title>Isotropic specified growth</title><p>We first consider cases in which specified growth is equal in all orientations. In this case, specified growth rates for each region of tissue can be described with a scalar: the specified volumetric growth rate. Because of tissue conflicts, resultant growth rates may include anisotropic and rotational (vorticity) terms, and therefore require tensors to be fully represented.</p><sec id="s2d1"><label>2.4.1.</label><title>Uniform isotropic growth</title><p>The simplest type of growth is uniform specified isotropic growth, which produces an enlargement of the tissue, whatever its initial shape with no conflict or residual strain.

A latitude/longitude grid is shown on the outside of the initial spherical tissue, and a section shown in a hemispherical cutaway. As expected, the shape is unchanged after growth, there is no residual strain and there is a good agreement with the radial displacement obtained with the analytical solution. Similar results are obtained with an initially circular sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB190057F7">figure 7</xref><italic>a</italic>).

We explore this pattern of growth by having the rate of specified isotropic growth in our sphere depend on the radial distance from the centre, creating regional conflicts.</p><p>In cellular terms, the notion of residual compression does not mean that plant cell walls themselves are under compression, only that the region of tissue is held at a smaller size than it would otherwise take without the external constraint. Thus cell walls will still be under tension owing to osmotic pressure, even in the presence of residual compression.</p><p>If the specified growth rate of the sphere increases with radial distance (proportional to the square of the radius), the shape remains spherical, with the inner core regions experiencing residual tension, while the outer surface is put under residual compression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB190057F6">figure 6</xref><italic>b</italic>). The lack of shape change contrasts with what happens if a circular sheet rather than a sphere has the same pattern of specified growth. For a disc, the outer rim of the sheet buckles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB190057F7">figure 7</xref><italic>b</italic>), resolving most of the residual strain. The number and positioning of the ripples depends on the rapidity of the increase of growth with radius, the initial perturbation and the thickness of the sheet. (Since the initial perturbation is random for (<italic>b</italic>), the buckling is different each time this simulation is run.) Thus, compared with a sheet, the constraint of the surrounding material in a solid sphere inhibits regional conflict resolution through buckling. While buckling can occur in a solid sphere ([<xref rid="RSOB190057C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], ch 15), it requires more extreme disparities in growth or elasticity properties than it does in a thin sheet, where buckling will result from even quite small amounts of residual strain.</p><p>If the specified growth rate of the sphere decreases with radial distance (decreasing quadratically from a maximum at the centre to zero at the surface), the shape again remains spherical, but now the core regions experience residual compression, while the outer surface is put under residual tension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB190057F6">figure 6</xref><italic>c</italic>), similar to the situation for some plant tissues. With the same pattern of specified growth a circular sheet buckles to form a cup shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB190057F7">figure 7</xref><italic>c</italic>), resolving most of the residual strain except for some stretching near the rim. These results illustrate how volumetric shapes are less able to resolve regional conflicts through changes in curvature than sheets, and thus have more constrained shapes.</p><p>The symmetry of these examples allows for an alternative mathematical analysis, taking advantage of the symmetry to reduce the problem to an ordinary differential equation. When the growth rate is a sum of powers of the radius (including non-integer powers), this equation can be solved explicitly (see electronic supplementary material). This provides a check on the correctness of the finite-element implementation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB190057F6">Figure 6</xref> includes graphs comparing the finite-element calculations with the analytical solutions.

Radial growth patterns can produce shape change in other volumetric shapes, such as cubes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB190057F8">Figure 8</xref><italic>a</italic>&#x02013;<italic>d</italic> illustrates the result of a growth rate applied to a cube, which is zero everywhere from the centre of the cube out to the distance of the face centres, thereafter increasing linearly with radius to a maximum at the corners. Unlike the sphere, there is a shape change, and protrusions form at the corners. There is reduced residual compression towards the corners as these have the most freedom to deform into the surrounding space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB190057F8">figure 8</xref><italic>e</italic>,<italic>f</italic>). A further difference from the sphere is presence of vorticity. For spheres with a radial gradient of growth, there was no rotation of the deforming tissue (zero vorticity everywhere). Each point moves only in the radial direction. However, vorticity is generated for the cube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB190057F8">figure 8</xref><italic>g</italic>). The direction of rotation with respect to a particular axis is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB190057F8">figure 8</xref><italic>h</italic>. The vorticity reflects changes in curvature, which reduce residual strain. The opposite pattern of specified growth rate reducing with distance from the centre of a cube would tend to stretch and flatten the corners. These comparisons between a sphere and a cube illustrate how introducing asymmetries (e.g. corners with more space around them to grow into) gives greater freedom for curvature and changes in shape to arise through regional conflicts.

Thus, compared with the growth of sheets, the growth of volumetric shapes provides additional constraints, making it more difficult to fully resolve regional conflicts. This is also evident from the Riemann mapping theorem, which shows that in two dimensions isotropic mappings exist between almost any two shapes that do not have holes. In three dimensions, there are by comparison very few such mappings.

We also created a strand of +ORG for POL, running from the convergence site towards the midplane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB190057F17">figure 17</xref><italic>b</italic>). Both <italic>k</italic><sub>par2</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>per</sub> were also increased in the neighbourhood of the +ORG strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB190057F17">figure 17</xref><italic>c</italic>,<italic>d</italic>). With these assumptions an outgrowth formed, centred on the +ORG strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOB190057F17">figure 17</xref><italic>e</italic>,<italic>f</italic>,<italic>h</italic>). This model is beyond the capability of the earlier version of GFtbox, which was limited to sheet-like meshes which could vary in thickness, but did not support changes of form beyond that.

Rather than presupposing a sheet-like configuration, with growth being defined parallel to the tissue plane or normal to it, sheets and other tissue forms are generated as an outcome of growth. A major difference between sheet and bulk tissues is that the growth of bulk tissue is more geometrically constrained. Every point of a sheet has empty space close by, into which tissue can move to reduce residual strain generated by growth conflicts. By contrast, with bulk tissues regions may be constrained by material all around them, reducing the possibilities for conflict resolution by geometrical deformation. Thus, a radially increasing rate of isotropic growth for a circular sheet can lead to a reduction in residual strain by buckling to form a wavy edge, whereas the same pattern of growth for a solid sphere leads to higher levels of residual strain and no shape change. Similarly, a linear gradient of increasing specified isotropic growth across a square sheet generates a conformal deformation with little or no accumulation of residual strain, whereas a similar pattern of growth for a cube is non-conformal and generates some residual strain.</p><p>For many plant tissues, such as the shoot apex or hypocotyl, surgical incisions have shown that the epidermal layer is under residual tension whereas the internal tissue is under residual compression [<xref rid="RSOB190057C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. If specified growth is isotropic, this situation would correspond to specified growth rates being higher for internal than for outer tissue layers. However, epidermal tension can also be generated by uniform anisotropic growth oriented radially, showing that levels of residual tension alone cannot be used to infer patterns of specified growth. Orientations as well as the level of residual stresses could be helpful in distinguishing between different possibilities. Incisions could be implemented in GFtbox, and have been for sheet-like models, but we have not yet implemented this for volumetric models.</p><p>The shape deformations generated through differential specified isotropic growth depend on both the initial starting shape and the pattern of growth. For example, whereas a radially increasing specified growth rate leads to no shape change for a sphere, it leads to a cube forming outgrowths at the corners. This is because the corners are less constrained by surrounding bulk tissue. Conversely, if the specified growth rate decreases radially, the corners of a cube become less sharp, resolving some of the residual strain. The pattern of growth is also important. A linear gradient of specified growth rate across a sphere (from pole to pole) leads to the formation of a dimpled shape, whereas a more restricted region of higher specified growth leads to an egg shape. In both cases, the region of high growth comes to dominate the tissue more and more. This raises the question of how meristematic domains, such as those in the shoot or root apex, maintain a relatively fixed size in the face of growth.</p><p>Although differential isotropic specified growth can create a range of shape deformations, some are much harder to achieve. For example, transforming a sphere into a sheet is not straightforward through isotropic specified growth alone (though it may be possible). By contrast, the transformation can be readily achieved through specified anisotropic growth oriented by a polarity field. For example, if specified growth is high perpendicular to a polarity field defined by a midplane organizer, a sphere deforms into a sheet. Growth parallel to the polarity corresponds to growth in sheet thickness whereas growth perpendicular to the polarity corresponds to growth in the plane of the sheet. This view is consistent with experimental studies on genes controlling leaf abaxial/adaxial asymmetry [<xref rid="RSOB190057C38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. These genes establish a midplane domain of <italic>WOX</italic> expression which is thought to be critical for establishing planar growth [<xref rid="RSOB190057C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="RSOB190057C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. From a cellular perspective, the higher specified growth rate perpendicular to the polarity field corresponds to cell walls being less reinforced in these directions than parallel to the field. However, whether a polarity field of this type exists and how it may influence cell wall stiffness remains to be established [<xref rid="RSOB190057C41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>Although a single polarity field allows for many shape transformations, it only allows two of the three components of a specified strain tensor to be defined. Thus, it would not be straighforward to generate a leaf that is much longer than it is wide. Such transformations can be readily achieved through inclusion of a second polarity field, orthogonal to the first. Applying such fields to a sphere allows an elongated leaf-like sheet to be generated, with one polarity field becoming oriented in the plane of the sheet (planar polarity) and the other oriented normal to the sheet (orthoplanar polarity). Polarly localized proteins such as PIN and BASL provide evidence for a planar polarity field in leaves [<xref rid="RSOB190057C42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="RSOB190057C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Loss of the orthoplanar polarity field (e.g. midplane organizer) leads to reduced outgrowth of the blade or lamina [<xref rid="RSOB190057C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="RSOB190057C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Ectopic activation of a strand of the midplane organizer can lead to the formation of radial outgrowths, as we show by modelling the formation of leaf outgrowths in the <italic>kanadi1</italic>
<italic>kanadi2</italic> double mutant of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. There is evidence for a radial polarity field in roots [<xref rid="RSOB190057C44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="RSOB190057C45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], but evidence for a midplane polarity field has yet to be obtained.</p><p>Dynamic subdivision is more complex in the volumetric finite-element framework. In two dimensions, there is a small repertoire of local transformations that eliminate low-quality finite elements. However, in three dimensions, the number of cases to consider is much larger, and the transformations are much more complex. Moreover, validity constraints (e.g. always generating the same geometric class of element) complicate the task of locally transforming the mesh to improve quality. Our implementation is in this respect still incomplete: we have implemented only the simpler cases of dynamic subdivision and not incorporated elision of short edges. This need not imply that division of biological cells is more difficult to achieve in volumes than sheets. This is because biological cell division is not constrained by having to always generate the same geometric class. To model biological cells with a finite-element framework, multiple elements would be needed for each cell, introducing additional complexity.</p><p>In conclusion, our analysis shows that the finite-element framework used to model tissue sheets can be extended to model volumetric growth. This extension highlights the additional constraints brought about through growth in three dimensions, and also provides a basis for studying the generation of tissue sheets or other conformations that have previously been taken as starting points.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplementary information</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="rsob190057supp1.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d35e1784" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="d35e133"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="rsob190057_review_history.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><caption><title>Movies and VRML files illustrating Figure 6 (b,c).</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" xlink:href="rsob190057supp2.zip" orientation="portrait" id="d35e1792" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><caption><title>Movies and VRML files illustrating Figure 7 (b,c).</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" xlink:href="rsob190057supp3.zip" orientation="portrait" id="d35e1800" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><caption><title>Movies and VRML files illustrating Figure 13 (d).</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" xlink:href="rsob190057supp4.zip" orientation="portrait" id="d35e1808" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><caption><title>Movies and VRML files illustrating Figure 16 (h,i,j,k).</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" xlink:href="rsob190057supp5.zip" orientation="portrait" id="d35e1816" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank John Fozard, Karen Lee, Jie Cheng and the anonymous referees for critical reading of the manuscript.</p></ack><sec id="s4"><title>Data accessibility</title><p>This article has no additional data.</p></sec><sec id="s5" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Competing interests</title><p>We declare we have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by grants from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (grant nos.
