    "Coagulase (Coa) activity is essential for the virulence of Staphylococcus aureus (S aureus), one of the most important pathogenic bacteria leading to catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI). We have demonstrated that the mutation of coagulase improved outcomes in disease models of S aureus CRBSI, suggesting that targeting Coa may represent a novel antiinfective strategy for CRBSI. Here, we found that quercetin, a natural compound that does not affect S aureus viability, could inhibit Coa activity. Chemical biological analysis revealed that the direct engagement of quercetin with the active site (residues Tyr187, Leu221 and His228) of Coa inhibited its activity. Furthermore, treatment with quercetin reduced the retention of bacteria on catheter surfaces, decreased the bacterial load in the kidneys and alleviated kidney abscesses in vivo. These data suggest that antiinfective therapy targeting Coa with quercetin may represent a novel strategy and provide a new leading compound with which to combat bacterial infections."
