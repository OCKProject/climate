State, territory and federal Australian governments formally committed to reducing disparities between Indigenous and other Australians in 2008 through the Closing the Gap strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Since then, progress has been limited: improvements in measures of Indigenous people&#x02019;s health have stalled, and education and employment gaps are widening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">In Australia as globally, movements for Indigenous self-determination recognise that Indigenous communities have different goals and aspirations from those of non-Indigenous populations. Socio-economic indicators developed by and for national populations may not address Indigenous peoples&#x02019; aspirations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Measuring and monitoring Indigenous community progress requires development of indicators that are meaningful for Indigenous people, and that address the distinct and diverse aspirations of individual communities. These can build on measurements of life satisfaction and wellbeing, which are fundamental to development, relatively simple to measure and monitor, and unbiased by differences in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Recognising that Indigenous Australians have distinct social characteristics, the Australian Bureau of Statistics conducts a periodic National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Survey (NATSISS); Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups being the two populations of Indigenous Australians. The most recent NATSISS, conducted in 2014&#x02013;2015, included a question on overall life-satisfaction. Results showed that overall, Indigenous Australians enjoy high levels of life satisfaction, with those in remote and very remote regions reporting mean life-satisfaction of 7.6, and those in non-remote regions 7.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Mean life satisfaction score for all Australians in 2015 was also 7.6, despite Indigenous people in remote/ very remote regions showing significant differences from the mean Australian levels in other social measures including income, employment, education and health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This suggests that at a population level, remote residence is associated with increased life satisfaction for Indigenous Australians.</p><p id="Par24">The Access and Remoteness Index of Australia (ARIA) defines five categories of remoteness based on road distance to the nearest urban centre, shown geographically in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The research described in this article involved communities in areas classified as remote and very remote. More Indigenous Australian live in very remote than remote regions, 95,200 and 53,500 respectively, 11.8 and 6.7% of the total Indigenous population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Map of the 2016 Remoteness Areas for Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12913_2019_4302_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par25">There is a paradox regarding Indigenous people of remote and very remote Australia, who report high levels of wellbeing despite socio-economic disadvantage as assessed through indicators of education, employment and income [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Possible explanations include the strength of identity and culture that Indigenous people maintain through their connections to the land particularly when they have access to their ancestral lands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In other populations, improvements in wellbeing are independently associated with improvements in health, education and productivity, through increases in creativity, cognitive capacity, sociability, cooperation and productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Health benefits of increases in wellbeing include reduced inflammation, lowered risk of cardiovascular disease and susceptibility to infections, and increases in health promoting behaviours including choosing healthier foods, exercising more and smoking less [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Although such benefits have not been specifically demonstrated for Indigenous Australians, attention to wellbeing may provide opportunities to address complex socio-economic disadvantage where current approaches are inadequate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">Wellbeing as a goal of service delivery was the focus of the Interplay research, an initiative of the Cooperative Research Centre for Remote Economic Participation whose overall aim was to guide economic development to meet the aspirations of Indigenous people in remote/ very remote regions of Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The Interplay research began by developing a wellbeing framework, which encompassed the government priorities of health, education and employment, together with community priorities of community, culture and empowerment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Social and emotional wellbeing is often used as an alternative term for mental health for Indigenous Australians, but as the construct in this research related to absence of symptoms of mental illness, we use the term mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">The research presented here aims to quantify relationships between health care access, mental and physical health and wellbeing, assuming that access to health care services contributes to wellbeing both directly and through its impacts on mental and physical health. The hypothesis was that health care access is directly associated with wellbeing for Indigenous people in remote and very remote communities; alternatively, mental and physical health may mediate this relationship. Understanding these relationships can provide direction for services to optimise wellbeing for Indigenous Australians in remote/ very remote regions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Research governance</title><p id="Par28">The Cooperative Research Centre for Remote Economic Participation (CRC-REP) which has community connections throughout remote Australia managed the Interplay research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Indigenous leadership and governance of the project prioritised qualitative approaches to understanding wellbeing, based on peoples&#x02019; stories as sources of knowledge and understanding. Government, university and industry partners in the project sought numerical indicators, so the project also included quantitative analysis of aspects of wellbeing.</p><p id="Par29">Design and development of the research extended over 3 years of consultation with Indigenous communities and researchers. Advisory group meetings, workshops, interviews and discussions, and the employment of Indigenous community-based researchers enabled collaboration between Indigenous community members, researchers and government representatives in all aspects of the research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Considerable effort was made to ensure that the project encompassed both Indigenous and non-Indigenous knowledge and understandings. Following data collection, the research team continues work with communities of the study.

It included questions on demography, Indigenous status, mental and physical&#x000a0;health symptoms and diagnoses, barriers to health care access, and wellbeing.

To measure physical health, questions involved health as a resource for living, through asking people whether health problems interfered with aspects of their day to day lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Refined questions from the Strong Souls instrument provided a measurement of mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

Improvements in mental health and wellbeing may then lead to improved physical health, as suggested in the Interplay structural model and in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Mental health complements other contributors to wellbeing identified in the Interplay project, namely cultural practices, empowerment, identity and spirituality, Indigenous and English literacy, employment, community and freedom from substance use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par64">Australia&#x02019;s Indigenous community-controlled health sector has long-advocated for a broader approach to health but been limited by funding requirements that demand a focus on biomedical services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This limits both the impact of health care on wellbeing, and also the impact of health care on health because the very meaning of health for Indigenous people may not be represented in the biomedical model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Effective community-control of Indigenous health care services and better integration of services may have manifold benefits, through a comprehensive approach including action on the social determinants of health, and through greater levels of employment of Indigenous people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Study limitations</title><p id="Par65">Limitations of this study include its localised scale, providing detailed information about a convenience sample of participants from four Indigenous communities in remote/ very remote regions rather than a statistically representative sample. Data are cross-sectional so direction of relationships is theoretical rather than experimental. Surveys were conducted by community researchers in their home communities so interpersonal relationships may have led to response bias.</p><p id="Par66">While the survey instrument was developed by experienced researchers working with community researchers, and there was agreement about the meaning of the questions, the accuracy and consistency of interpretations have not been formally established.</p><p id="Par67">Owing to small numbers of participants from individual communities, sample size was inadequate to conduct multigroup analysis by&#x000a0;community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The analysis with participants grouped by community remoteness highlights the possible differences between communities, and suggests that this may be an important area of further research.</p><p id="Par68">Lack of clinical data and more specific measures of health care access are limitations. Relationships between health care access, biomedical measures of health and Indigenous people&#x02019;s own experiences of health and wellbeing form an important area for further study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par69">The Interplay project worked with Indigenous people in remote/ very remote regions of Australia to explore wellbeing, which is an outcome of service provision. Structural equation modelling of wellbeing and its relationships with health care access and mental and physical&#x000a0;health showed that of these constructs, only mental health is associated with wellbeing. For participants in remote communities, mental health also forms an indirect pathway from health care access to wellbeing. Relationships differed between participants from&#x000a0;remote and very remote communities.</p><p id="Par70">Mental health and wellbeing for Indigenous Australians in remote Australia may be enhanced through strengthening and collaboration among services outside the health sector, particularly those that contribute to relationships, empowerment, cultural identity and care of the land. Addressing wellbeing may contribute to alleviation of other aspects of socioeconomic disadvantage faced by Indigenous Australians.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ACI</term><def><p id="Par9">Akaike&#x02019;s Information Criteria</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AGFI</term><def><p id="Par10">Adjusted Goodness of Fit Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CFA</term><def><p id="Par11">Confirmatory factor analysis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CFI</term><def><p id="Par12">Comparative Fit Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRC-REP</term><def><p id="Par13">Cooperative Research Centre for Remote Economic Participation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EFA</term><def><p id="Par14">Exploratory factor analysis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GFI</term><def><p id="Par15">Goodness of Fit Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NATSISS</term><def><p id="Par16">National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Survey</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NNFI</term><def><p id="Par17">Non-Normed Fit Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RMSEA</term><def><p id="Par18">Root Mean Square Error of Approximation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p id="Par19">Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SEM</term><def><p id="Par20">Structural Equation Modelling</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge the support and involvement of key organisational stakeholders for the Interplay project: Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Australian Bureau of Statistics, Centre for Remote Health (Flinders University and Charles Darwin University), Flinders NT-Katherine, Poche Centre for Indigenous Health and Wellbeing Northern Territory, Banatjarl Strongbala Wumin Grup, Central Desert Native Title Services, Dhimurru Aboriginal Corporation, Kalano Community Association, Katherine Stolen Generations Group, Layhnapuy Homelands Aboriginal Corporation, Marthakal Homelands Resource Centre, Martu Rangers (Wiluna), Miwatj Health Aboriginal Corporation, Muntjiltjarra Wurrgumu Group, Northern Star Resources, Ngangganawili Aboriginal Health Service Community, StrongBala Men&#x02019;s Health Program, Wurli-Wurlinjang Health Service, Yalu Mar&#x0014b;githinyaraw Aboriginal Corporation, and Yolngu Business Enterprises.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Disclaimer</title><p id="Par71">Jessica Yamaguchi is an Advisor working for the Australian Government.
