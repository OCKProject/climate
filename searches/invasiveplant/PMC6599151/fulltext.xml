In this respect, invasive weeds, which have traits better adapted to drought stress than crops, add to concerns regarding crop sustainability. <italic>Lactuca serriola</italic>, an aggressive agronomic weed is thought to be a successful weed because of its ability to maintain high water use efficiency under drought conditions. In this study, experiments were conducted to examine the influence of different soil moisture regimes (100%, 75%, 50% and 25% water holding capacity (WHC)) on growth, photosynthetic capacity, leaf biochemistry and reproduction of this species. Soil moisture significantly affected plant&#x02019;s height, stem diameter, number of leaves and biomass. The highest plant height (115.14 cm &#x000b1; 11.64), shoot diameter (9.4 mm &#x000b1; 0.18), leaf area (1206.5 mm<sup>2</sup> &#x000b1; 73.29), plant fresh weight (83.1 &#x000b1; 3.98) and dry weight (22.38 &#x000b1; 1.24) were recorded at 75% soil moisture content. A fundamental adaptation to drought was observed as plants in the 25% WHC treatment had the highest root: shoot ratio. Soluble sugars and total phenolic content were highest in the 25% WHC treatment and significantly different to 100% WHC which was a response to soil moisture stress to ameliorate the damaging effects of reactive oxygen species produced under stress conditions. Results also indicate that <italic>L</italic>. <italic>serriola</italic> can survive and produce seeds under water stress as more than 6000 seeds were produced per plant in all WHC treatments. In this study, there was no significant difference in the seed weight, number of seeds produced and their germination ability. This can have a huge impact on agricultural systems as the species can survive both under low and high soil moisture conditions. We therefore suggest that the demonstrated ability of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>serriola</italic> to complete its life cycle and produce biomass and seeds under water stressed conditions leads to the introduction of strategies that minimize weed survival while maximizing irrigation efficiency for the crop. A clear understanding of the ecological and biological characteristics of this weed will help land managers take appropriate control measures to mitigate the effect of this species on economic crop productivity.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Authors no funding revived this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="9"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="17"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plants undergo or display symptoms of extreme water deficiency when the required levels of moisture are unavailable in their habitat soil. This happens when the plants continuously lose water via transpiration or evaporation due to high temperatures and the loss of ground moisture is not refurbished [<xref rid="pone.0218191.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This extreme dryness, declared as drought, which extends to long periods of time, is prevalent on a global scale. These conditions combine lack of water through rain with high temperatures and radiation, and currently pose the most important environmental threats to plant survival and crop productivity [<xref rid="pone.0218191.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The prevailing stress conditions are exacerbated by competition from associated weed species, due to photosynthetic decrease, constraint of metabolic processes and interference with nutrient availability [<xref rid="pone.0218191.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0218191.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. With regard to the outcomes of competition for water in a cropping situation, it depends on the abilities of the crop and weed species to survive under water stress conditions [<xref rid="pone.0218191.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It has been noted that invasive plant species, by virtue of their traits, are more adaptable to water stress than crop and pasture species [<xref rid="pone.0218191.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Thus, prevailing arid conditions is an important factor in weed invasion, as it impacts the competitive establishment, physiology, subsequent growth and reproduction of the mixture of plants in a crop [<xref rid="pone.0218191.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], making it an important element of crop production studies.</p><p>The ability to survive drought differs between species, within species and the stage of development of a plant based upon intensity and duration of water stress conditions [<xref rid="pone.0218191.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0218191.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0218191.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It is known that moisture deficiency is characterized primarily by drought signalling in roots, reduction in leaf water potential, closure of stomata and cellular dehydration [<xref rid="pone.0218191.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Secondary or long-term effects of soil moisture stress are reduction in cell enlargement and growth, reduction of cellular and metabolic activities, photosynthetic inhibition, turgor loss, manufacture of reactive oxygen species, and altered carbon partitioning [<xref rid="pone.0218191.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0218191.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0218191.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>It has been established that drought stress is an important limiting factor for plant growth and establishment. This prevents plants from achieving the maximum growth potential set by their genotypes [<xref rid="pone.0218191.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0218191.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Growth is accomplished through cell enlargement, cell division and differentiation and involves a complex interaction of genetic, physiological, ecological and morphological events. Moisture stress affects these events as impaired mitosis and loss of turgor results in limited cell division and obstructed cell elongation respectively which in turn causes diminished growth [<xref rid="pone.0218191.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0218191.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. During water stress, production of abscisic acid triggers stomatal closure, following which, there is a decline in intercellular CO<sub>2</sub> levels, and therefore, a photosynthesis reduction [<xref rid="pone.0218191.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0218191.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Simultaneously, metabolic changes occur in photosynthetic pigments and components [<xref rid="pone.0218191.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0218191.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and there is a reduction in the functioning of Calvin cycle enzymes which all together results in reduced plant growth and yield [<xref rid="pone.0218191.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Prevailing macro and micro environmental factors, such as water stress conditions, trigger survival instincts in plants, which produce changes in their biochemical processes as an adaptive measure. Under moisture stress, production of reactive oxygen species increases and as an adaptive measure, plants produce enzymatic antioxidants to limit the oxidative degradation. In order to maintain their cellular hydration, plants synthesize and accumulate solutes by osmotic adjustment, which function as osmolytes in cells and help in the preservation of cellular structure, its components and the protection of metabolic functions [<xref rid="pone.0218191.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0218191.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Environmental factors acting to the detriment of plant health have an increased impact while the plant is in its growth phase and reduces the reproductive allocation to seeds, which could result in the production of either fewer or smaller seeds. They could also influence seed quality traits such as seed dormancy and chemical defence [<xref rid="pone.0218191.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0218191.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Water deficiency at the time of seed maturation also impacts the dormancy and germination of weed seeds [<xref rid="pone.0218191.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Thus the adaptive measures incorporated by a plant as a response to stressed conditions including carbon assimilation, allocation of photo assimilates to different parts and the preservation of its reproductive ability, all contribute to the endurance of a plant species under environmental stress [<xref rid="pone.0218191.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>It has been claimed that the ability of <italic>Lactuca serriola</italic> to adapt to a varied macro and micro environmental conditions in several countries is responsible for its successful establishment and proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0218191.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0218191.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Although <italic>L</italic>. <italic>serriola</italic> has been established and is growing in several disparate climatic conditions, the interactions between <italic>L</italic>. <italic>serriola&#x02019;s</italic> growth and surrounding environmental factors such as soil moisture content, soil salinity levels and weather and climatic conditions, have not been quantified until quite recently. Understanding the influence of various soil moisture regimes on <italic>L</italic>. <italic>serriola</italic> is an essential requirement to help us to predict its proliferation, consequent impact and develop suitable containment methods.</p><p>Recent climate modelling studies have shown that among significant future environmental factors, rainfall events will decline and droughts will increase in frequency in the state of Victoria (Australia) [<xref rid="pone.0218191.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. While it is known that the water content in the soil of a particular area or region largely determines and aides the establishment of any invasive weed species [<xref rid="pone.0218191.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0218191.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However it is obvious that different species will respond differently when exposed to water stress conditions. Indeed, some weed species have survived and even thrived to the extent of completing their life cycle, maintaining growth and their reproductive ability even during times of severe water scarcity [<xref rid="pone.0218191.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0218191.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Therefore, it is to our benefit to log, observe and study the impacts of water stress on all plants, especially invasive weeds, which in turn will lead to improved management practices and for possibly altering the fate of economically important vegetation under climate change [<xref rid="pone.0218191.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Hence, the present study was performed to gauge and enumerate the morphological, photosynthetic physiological, biochemical and reproductive responses of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>serriola</italic> to various soil moisture regimes. The objectives of the study were to: (i) observe and evaluate the growth and reproductive abilities of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>serriola</italic> to four different (100%, 75%, 50% and 25%) soil moisture regimes; and (ii) study the underlying physiological and biochemical changes in response to moisture stress. This would help to assess if this species is directly impacted with the possibility for greater establishment and proliferation under future drought conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Experimental design</title><p>The experiment was conducted using a Completely Randomized Design located within a temperature-controlled glasshouse at Federation University Australia&#x02019;s Mt Helen campus in Australia from December 2017 to April 2018.

The seeds were surface sterilized by rinsing them in 1% sodium hypochlorite for 1 minute and then rinsed thoroughly with RO water. 20 randomly selected seeds were placed evenly into a 9 cm diameter Petri dish lined with Whatman No. 11 filter paper. Sterilized distilled water was added to each Petri dish, which was subsequently sealed with para-film to prevent loss of water. Petri dishes were placed into an incubator (Thermoline Scientific Australia, Temperature and humidity Cabinet, Model: TRISLA-495-1-SD), maintained at 30/20&#x000b0;C day/night temperature with a 12 hr light/12 hr dark and 24 hours darkness photoperiod, with cool-white fluorescent lamps that produced a photosynthetic photon flux of 100&#x003bc;mol m<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>.

Exposure of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>serriola</italic> to drought stress resulted in decreased growth rate, and reduced biomass production. A high root to shoot ratio, as well as elevated biomass of the root, allows it to efficiently absorb the required amount of water from the soil and ensure transference to its above-ground parts. An increase in soluble sugars and phenolic content, which are mechanisms to tolerate drought stress was observed as moisture stress increased. Although moisture stress reduced the overall plant biomass, it failed to make any substantial impact on the reproductive abilities of this plant type. While physiological responses were decreased with respect to drought stress, however, the plants were healthy and completed their life cycle even at the low soil moisture level of 25% water holding capacity. Due to its ability to tolerate drought stress, <italic>L</italic>. <italic>serriola</italic> is very likely to expand its range under a drying climate. Its ability to sustain growth through morphological adaptation, physiological and biochemical regulation, even during times of water stress, ensures <italic>L</italic>. <italic>serriola</italic> with a robust mechanism to continue spreading to new regions.</p><p>It is recommended that management strategies for <italic>L</italic>. <italic>serriola</italic> should include early control of this weed in cropping fields, because the combined pressure of enhanced weed competition and water stress conditions could severely impair crop yield. Thus it is important to control <italic>L</italic>. <italic>serriola</italic> at the earliest possible time in order to conserve soil moisture for crops where possible.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0218191.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Raw data inputs for this study.</title><p>Data for repeated measures, biochemical analysis, fecundity, 1<sup>st</sup> harvest and 2<sup>nd</sup> harvest are provided in the excel sheet in their respective tabs.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0218191.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0218191.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Jaleel</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Manivannan</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Wahid</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Farooq</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Al-Juburi</surname><given-names>HJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Somasundaram</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
