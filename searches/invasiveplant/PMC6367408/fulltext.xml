The objectives of this study were to estimate the current fractional cover gradient of invasive trees of the genus <italic>Prosopis</italic> in the Afar Region, Ethiopia, and to identify drivers of its invasion. We used seventeen explanatory variables describing Landsat 8 image reflectance, topography, climate and landscape structures to model the current cover of <italic>Prosopis</italic> across the invaded range using the random forest (RF) algorithm. Validation of the RF algorithm confirmed high model performance with an accuracy of 92% and a Kappa-coefficient of 0.8. We found that, within 35 years after its introduction, <italic>Prosopis</italic> has invaded approximately 1.17 million ha at different cover levels in the Afar Region (12.3% of the surface). Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and elevation showed the highest explanatory power among the 17 variables, in terms of both the invader&#x02019;s overall distribution as well as areas with high cover. Villages and linear landscape structures (rivers and roads) were found to be more important drivers of future <italic>Prosopis</italic> invasion than environmental variables, such as climate and topography, suggesting that <italic>Prosopis</italic> is likely to continue spreading and increasing in abundance in the case study area if left uncontrolled. We discuss how information on the fractional cover and the drivers of invasion can help in developing spatially-explicit management recommendations against a target invasive plant species.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur F&#x00026;amp;#x00F6;rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung (Swiss National Science Foundation)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>400440_152085</award-id><award-id>400440_152085</award-id><award-id>400440_152085</award-id><award-id>400440_152085</award-id><award-id>400440_152085</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shiferaw</surname><given-names>Hailu</given-names></name><name><surname>Alamirew</surname><given-names>Tena</given-names></name><name><surname>Zeleke</surname><given-names>Gete</given-names></name><name><surname>Teketay</surname><given-names>Demel</given-names></name><name><surname>Eckert</surname><given-names>Sandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), with Grant no. 400440_152085</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Invasive alien plant species (IAPS) are key drivers of anthropogenic global environmental change as they threaten native species, communities and ecosystems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, with significant consequences for the people living in the invaded range<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Yet, the management of widely established IAPS is often complex and challenging, as eradication is not feasible. Rather, management strategies may need to integrate multiple management options across the invaded range, considering the current geographic distribution and abundance of the target species, its environmental niche in the invaded region, the areas within the invaded range that are likely to experience high impacts, the distribution of high-value areas that should be kept free from invasion and the availability of funding for management<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Moreover, two classes of factors also affect management of IAPS: (i) intrinsic biological factors, such as the reproductive mode and the number of propagules produced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, and (ii) extrinsic environmental factors, such as dispersal vectors and invasion pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Ignoring these factors may make the spatial management of IAPS challenging and complicated.</p><p id="Par3">As management options may differ between areas with high IAPS cover and those areas where only isolated patches are found, accurate and detailed information is needed on the actual area invaded as well as on the local abundance or cover of IAPS across the invaded region. In recent years, an increasing number of papers have been published providing distribution maps of IAPS at different spatial scales and with different resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. One way to address this issue is to develop fractional cover maps of IAPS, but such mapping products of invasive species have rarely been developed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Fractional vegetation cover assessments, mostly in semi-arid environments, were so far mainly a methodological research focus of the remote sensing research community. Machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest (RF) in combination with satellite data, show the potential to model tree biomass successfully and accurately<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> or to map a variety of vegetation covers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Besides providing accurate predictions, they are able to model complex interactions among input variables, to identify most significant explanatory variables<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and to handle noise or outliers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. An approach with such advantages could possibly also be suitable for developing fractional cover maps as well as help identifying the relative importance of factors in explaining the current and predicting the future distribution and abundance of IAPS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, thereby providing important information for developing spatially explicit management strategies.</p><p id="Par4">During the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> century, various species and hybrids of the genus <italic>Prosopis</italic> that are native to South and Central America were planted in areas outside their native range (e.g. Australia, southern Asia, southern and eastern Africa) with the aim of providing firewood, charcoal, fodder and timber, to stabilize soil in degraded ecosystems, and prevent desertification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The first introductions in Ethiopia were made during the 1970s and 1980s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, but problems arose soon thereafter, in the early 1990s, when the tree started invading croplands, grasslands, riverbanks and roadsides, thereby causing significant environmental impacts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, and becoming a source of conflict among pastoralist groups due to the resulting dwindling grazing land<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Despite its potential benefits, particularly regarding the provision of firewood and charcoal, Ethiopia has declared <italic>Prosopis</italic> a noxious weed and has recently published a national <italic>Prosopis</italic> management strategy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In the case of <italic>Prosopis</italic>, various distribution maps have been developed with the goal to describe the spatial extent of <italic>Prosopis</italic> invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, its spread over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, or model its potential invasion area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. However, all of these studies either focused on relatively small study areas or if they were extensive provided only coarse-resolution maps of either presence or absence of the species.</p><p id="Par5">In this study, we set out to create a fractional cover map of <italic>Prosopis</italic> for the Afar Region, Ethiopia, one of the areas in Eastern Africa most heavily invaded by <italic>Prosopis</italic>.

Pastoralism is still the dominant source of livelihood for the Afar people, but agro-pastoralism is promoted by the government. In addition, governmental and private investments have led to large-scale agricultural production in the Middle Awash Valley, particularly in cotton and sugar cane production. Also, parts of the arable land have been abandoned as a result of soil salinity, which resulted from both inappropriate irrigation practices and high evapotranspiration&#x000a0;of <italic>Prosopis</italic> invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study species</title><p id="Par8">The genus <italic>Prosopis</italic> belongs to the family Fabaceae, subfamily Mimosoideae.

Presence and absence plots were purposively selected from invaded and uninvaded areas, respectively. Invaded areas were additionally stratified into areas likely to be highly invaded (around villages, along roads, on riverbanks) and areas likely to be less invaded (outside villages, away from roads and riverbanks). The sampling plots were randomly selected within the different strata and substrata. In order to reduce spatial autocorrelation, sampling plots were selected that had a minimum separation distance of 500 m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. A total of 2,722 field sample plots of 20&#x02009;m by 20&#x02009;m (presence and absence plots) were collected between September 2016 and March 2017. A plot was considered a presence plot if it contained at least one <italic>Prosopis</italic> plant; otherwise it was considered an absence plot. About 70% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1922) of the samples were absence plots and about 30% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;800) were presence plots.

Each geo-referenced sampling plot was recorded together with its level of <italic>Prosopis</italic> coverage, which was estimated visually to the nearest 10%. About 80% of all sampling plots were randomly selected to be used for model calibration and the remaining 20% were used for validation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par11">The spatial datasets (17 independent variables) that we used to explain <italic>Prosopis</italic> distribution were gathered from various sources (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). They differed in terms of spatial resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, projection, and time of acquisition; nearest neighbor spatial resampling and reprojection was applied to obtain a common spatial pixel resolution of 15&#x02009;m. The field plots and the ancillary datasets (explanatory variables) had relatively equivalent pixel size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Spatial resampling was done to match the dataset with the highest spatial resolution, the panchromatic band of the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data was used in this study. In total, nine scenes were needed to cover the study area. They were acquired by the Landsat 8 (OLI) on 26 and 28 January as well as 11 and 20 February 2017 (paths: 167 and 168; rows: 50 to 54). These acquisition dates match the period of field data collection and fall into the study area&#x02019;s dry season, when herbs and grasses are dry and most trees and bushes except <italic>Prosopis</italic> have shed their leaves. The remotely sensed datasets were visually checked for geometric correspondence to all other datasets. Further, these datasets were atmospherically corrected using the Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. We selected the red, the near-infrared and the first shortwave-infrared bands as explanatory variables among image reflectance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Furthermore, we calculated the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which is a ratio of the difference between the near-infrared and the red band to the sum of the near-infrared and the red band of a specific sensor. All selected bands as well as the NDVI have proven suitable for capturing photosynthetic active vegetation, and soil and vegetation moisture content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Additionally, we included two products of the MODIS sensor in our analysis, daytime (LSTd) and nighttime (LSTn) land surface temperatures. In order to have longer term LSTd and LSTn average data we calculated 5-year averages from the monthly LSTd and LSTn products that were generated between 2012 and 2017. The spatial resolution of these data is 1&#x02009;km. Although this seems rather low compared to the other datasets, these day- and night-time temperature datasets have been shown to be useful in species distribution modelling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. We furthermore sought to understand if day- and night-time temperatures are important explanatory or drivers of <italic>Prosopis</italic> distribution.

(Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), has resulted in very low growth and fertility rates of <italic>Prosopis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par43">Using <italic>Prosopis</italic> invasion in the Afar Region, Ethiopia, as a model system, our study suggests that the RF regression can help producing accurate fractional cover maps of IAPS that help explaining their current distribution and abundance as well as predicting future invasion patterns. The incorporation of environmental variables significantly improved the accuracy of the model and revealed that landscape structure variables, such as distance to rivers, road and villages, were more significant drivers of <italic>Prosopis</italic> distribution than climatic variables, suggesting that <italic>Prosopis</italic> is likely to continue spreading and increasing in abundance in the case study area if left uncontrolled. The knowledge gained does not only generate basic knowledge on IAPS invasion processes, it also provides support for the development and implementation of spatially explicit management strategies that may include different management interventions in different parts of the invaded range, and with different priorities. In particular, because of the high accuracy of our model, achieved partly through extensive sampling of field data, our approach allowed identification of numerous areas with low <italic>Prosopis</italic> cover, i.e. areas with early invasion stages that should be targeted for rapid response (removal of isolated patches at the invasion front) to prevent further spread of this IAPS in the case study region. We propose that the establishment and interpretation of fractional cover maps of IAPS should become a key component of IAPS management at the regional or national scale.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec21"><p>
