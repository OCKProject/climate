The CBD Executive Secretary comments &#x02018;These assessments are sobering. &#x02026; if the current trends on biodiversity loss and ecosystems destruction are not reversed, the prospects for life on our planet become quite grim.

As <xref rid="bib97" ref-type="bibr">Sharrock and Wyse Jackson (2017)</xref> comment, &#x02018;there is a continued lack of mainstreaming plant conservation at the national level and a lack of comprehensive information on which plants are threatened and where. With the GSPC reaching the end of its second phase in 2020, it is important to consider how plant conservation can enhance its visibility and generate support in the future&#x02019;. Already, preparations are being made to develop a new strategy and targets for the period up to 2030.</p><p id="p0080">The background to this situation is global change, including notably climate change, whose impacts are being increasingly noticed in virtually all aspects of conservation and sustainable development and which is driving large-scale shifts in the distributions of species and in the composition of biological communities (<xref rid="bib0148" ref-type="bibr">Monzon et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Heywood, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib0163" ref-type="bibr">Stein et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib100" ref-type="bibr">Thomas and Gillingham, 2015</xref>). The recently published paper by <xref rid="bib0153" ref-type="bibr">Steffen et&#x000a0;al. (2018)</xref>, &#x02018;Trajectories in the Earth System in the Anthropocene&#x02019; which postulates that human-induced warming is rapidly approaching levels that may trigger positive climate feedbacks which could have devastating consequences for all of us, should serve as a wakeup call to even the most disinterested political or business leaders.</p><p id="p0085">Current conservation strategies are still largely based on the assumption that we live in a dynamic but slowly changing world. Such an assumption has to be revised in the light of the rapid rate of climate change already being experienced and confidently predicted to continue, if not increase, over the coming decades. Both the projected scale and rate of climate change has wrong-footed us and is forcing us to rethink and recalibrate our conservation responses (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Heywood, 2017</xref>). Recent realization of the scale and likely consequences of global change (demographic, land use and disturbance regimes, climatic) on the maintenance and sustainable use of biodiversity also requires a drastic rethink of our planning horizons: we have to focus on the next 10&#x02013;50 years during which critical actions will have to be taken to avoid irreversible changes. No longer can we take solace in the long-term view as a buffer against harsh reality nor indeed in view of the uncertainties can we usefully plan beyond, say, 25&#x02013;50 years. On the other hand, the actions that we take today will have long-term effects on the lives of future generations.</p><p id="p0090">Resolving the quandary of the continuing loss of biodiversity despite all the efforts and resources that have been invested in its conservation, is an enormously complex issue as it involves socio-economic and political issues as well as scientific and technical problems (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Heywood, 2017</xref>, <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). As we start planning our post-2020 conservation strategies, we have an opportunity to address the failings of the previous CBD and SDG strategies, ensure the more effective integration of the conservation actions proposed, clarify the wording of the targets and provide clearer operational guidance as to how they are to be implemented and their implementation monitored.</p><p id="p0095">In this paper, I shall address the difficulties involved in implementing effective <italic>in situ</italic> conservation of plant diversity both at an area and species/population-based level. Although <italic>in situ</italic> conservation is often interpreted as meaning principally conservation within a protected area, it covers a range of both area- and species-based approaches (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Heywood, 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Heywood, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Heywood, 2017</xref>, <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Heywood et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). I shall discuss the role and effectiveness of protected areas in conserving species <italic>in situ</italic> and also how species may be conserved or at least protected outside protected areas where most plant diversity occurs.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Conservation approaches</title><p id="p0100">Today's approaches to conservation are still basically those that were beginning to be practised as far back as 100 years ago. The main components are: developing a system of protected areas, identifying and listing threatened species, actions to conserve endangered species, storing germplasm <italic>ex situ</italic> of threatened species as an insurance policy, and when all this fails attempting to reintroduce species to areas from which they have been lost and restoring degraded or lost ecosystems. According <xref rid="bib99" ref-type="bibr">Sutherland et&#x000a0;al. (2004)</xref> much of current conservation practice is based upon anecdote and myth rather than upon the systematic appraisal of the evidence but of course we now have vastly greater knowledge and capacity and experience, sophisticated techniques to apply and a considerable body of accumulated experience. Also, as <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adams (2004)</xref> commented &#x02018;The problems facing conservation at the start of the 21st century are&#x02026; mostly &#x02026; the same problems recognized and faced by conservationists a century ago. What is more worrying is that the same is true of conservation's solutions. &#x02026; All of them are evolving, becoming more sophisticated, adapting to changing circumstances. However, none of them promises any kind of scale shift in the endless chess game of extinction&#x02019;. The context in which conservation is practised today is of course dramatically different from its early days as we now live in a period, often labelled the Anthropocene, characterized by massive anthropogenic impacts on the environment and resources (<xref rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr">Steffen et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib95" ref-type="bibr">Seddon et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). It is widely agreed that the need for a transformational approach to conservation has now become urgent although there is no unanimity as to how to proceed.</p><p id="p0105">All the diverse approaches to conservation are interconnected, although this is not necessarily reflected in practice. Calls for integrated or holistic plant conservation, in the sense of applying whatever combination of conservation techniques is appropriate in any particular situation,<xref rid="fn4" ref-type="fn">4</xref> have been made since the middle of the last century (e.g. <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Falk, 1990</xref>) but are difficult to implement because of the way in which conservation as a discipline is organized, with species-based and area-based approaches usually undertaken by different groups of practitioners, each with their own traditions and experience. As I have noted elsewhere (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Heywood, 2017</xref>), the fact that species management and protected areas represent different constituencies in both ecology and biodiversity conservation is partly responsible for the lack of coordination between the two approaches. This is largely a consequence of the way in which ecology developed as a science and practice and is reflected in the separation of <italic>in situ</italic> and <italic>ex situ</italic> in the Convention on Biological Diversity and of area-based targets from species-based targets in its Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC) and in national conservation strategies and action plans.</p><p id="p0110">None of the main conservation approaches is fully effective, especially for plants (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Havens et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Heywood, 2017</xref>) and there is often a failure of interdisciplinarity during their implementation.

In the past much restoration, especially of forests, has been undertaken using well-established reforestation techniques which are not specifically aimed at restoring biodiversity or ecosystem services but rather with timber production as a goal and such approaches are still being adopted in some countries such as China and Vietnam even though the aim is to improve ecosystem services, notably watershed protection (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Lamb, 2018</xref>). Various approaches to ecological restoration such as natural regeneration, full ecological restoration and reforestation using only a limited number of species are discussed by <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Lamb (2018)</xref>. Another factor that needs to be taken into account is the ability of restored forests to persist long-term. As <xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr">Reid et&#x000a0;al.

They are regarded as the primary defence against biodiversity loss, provided they are well maintained and managed. The growth of protected areas in number in the past 25 years to 202,000&#x000a0;at the present day, covering 14.7% of the world's terrestrial area, is rightly acknowledged as an outstanding achievement in global conservation (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Jones et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>) and many countries have met or are on course to meet the Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 [By 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water areas and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well-connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscape and seascape].</p><p id="p0205">There are, however, serious caveats to this apparent success story. For one thing, most biodiversity occurs outside protected areas and it is now widely accepted that the present coverage of such areas is inadequate in terms of extent, ecological representation and key biodiversity areas.<xref rid="fn7" ref-type="fn">7</xref> As <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Maron et&#x000a0;al. (2018)</xref> note, even if Aichi Target 11 is fully achieved, it would leave much of 83% of the land surface without appropriate protection and put at risk its ability to provide the ecological functions and ecosystem goods and services on which we depend. Moreover, as they point out, &#x02018;Achieving the objectives reflected in the other Aichi Targets, and the SDGs, depends heavily on what happens in that 83&#x02013;90%&#x02019; and they regard bolder retention targets as essential. In fact, there is no scientific or logical basis for the 17% target and it has already been bypassed by the 2014 IUCN World Parks Congress which recommended a much higher total area of protected land and connectivity lands than those of current agreed targets.</p><p id="p0210">Another limitation to the effectiveness of protected areas is that about half of them are inadequately managed and as a consequence, their ability to provide a safe and secure haven for the species of biodiversity concern that they contain is compromised, even more so if actions to prevent or mitigate other harmful or threatening factors are not undertaken. Extensive human activity within their boundaries can undermine their role and one-third of global protected land is under intense human pressure according to <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Jones et&#x000a0;al. (2018)</xref> who also found that for protected areas designated before the Convention on Biological Diversity was ratified in 1992, 55% have since experienced increases in human pressure. Not surprisingly, large strictly protected areas suffered least human pressure. They also note that while designated protected areas currently account for about 14.7 percent of land globally, if areas subject to intense human pressure are subtracted, the protected area percentage drops to 10.3 and only 37 of the 111 countries that have met the 17 percent target would still meet that threshold if areas under heavy pressure were removed. It should be noted that the methodology used by Jones et&#x000a0;al. may not fully cover invasive species which are considered a key threat for almost one-quarter of endangered species (<xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Maxwell et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>) and the fourth most frequently reported threat globally according to an analysis by <xref rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr">Schulze et&#x000a0;al.

Unsustainable hunting was the most commonly reported threat and occurred in 61% of all PAs, followed by disturbance from recreational activities occurring in 55%, and natural system modifications from fire or its suppression in 49%.</p><p id="p0215">In addition to the above, it should be noted that there are considerable differences in the ways in which the planning process for protected areas is decided at national level and it varies considerably, especially between developed and developing countries. Problems arise from unclear management systems and lack of consistent legislation, as noted by <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cao et&#x000a0;al.

How far protected areas will continue to be effective in protecting biodiversity under projected climate change scenarios is still uncertain. It is clearly dif&#x0fb01;cult for a system of PAs with &#x0fb01;xed geographical boundaries to respond to the dynamics of global change, in particular climate change, which was not a consideration when they were designed. Protected areas as such cannot migrate, even though some of their component species can do, either within the area or beyond it, nor can they be moved. The impacts will vary from region to region and from country to country. Some protected areas may even virtually cease to function, with catastrophic species loss, while others may survive relatively unscathed and their complement of species even increase in some cases. Many protected areas will suffer moderate to substantial loss of their current biota while other species will migrate into them (including alien invasive species), leading to changes in the assemblages of species that they house.</p><p id="p0225">Just as we have little idea of the latitudinal and altitudinal migration capacity of most individual species to migrate (or not) in the face of climate change, or of their likelihood of persistence under the new ecoclimatic conditions or in the new species assemblages, we simply do not know how far the essential components of protected areas will be able to reassemble in the new ecoclimatic envelopes and in the face of human population pressure and other factors. What is clear is that novel species assemblages or ecosystems will become increasingly common in response to human activity and climate change and these will pose problems for conservation (<xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Lindenmayer et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>) and for protected area policy and practice. Even assuming that new viable ecological assemblages are established, they may not have any status of protection so that the whole legal, social, political, scientific and financial process of reserve establishment, would have to be reinitiated.</p><p id="p0230">The evidence of the impacts on protected areas is still equivocal and is likely to remain so while there is still uncertainty as to the scale and extent of climatic and other change and a lack of detailed local assessments.

Despite some losses of populations and species, PAs have continued to accommodate many species, which have shifted to higher elevations, to polewards-facing aspects, and into cooler microhabitats within PAs as the climate has warmed. Even when species have declined in some PAs, they often remain more abundant inside than outside PAs. The 40-year track record of species responding to environmental change in PAs suggests that networks of PAs have been essential to biodiversity conservation and are likely to continue to fulfil this role in the future. The challenge for managers will be to consider the balance between retaining current species and encouraging colonization by new species&#x02019;.</p><p id="p0240">Climate change will affect the distribution of species in different ways (<xref rid="bib0148" ref-type="bibr">Monzon et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Heywood, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib0118" ref-type="bibr">Garden et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). In the case of plants, areas of suitable habitat may contract within or expand beyond previously occupied areas, so that some species will adapt and survive, sometimes with reduced populations, and some may expand their distributions; or the location of suitable habitat may shift out of the areas and some species will be able to migrate, tracking the changing climate, while those that are unable to adapt or migrate will suffer severe population decline and eventually become extinct or be ousted by invasive alien species. Those species that occur within protected areas may fare better than those without but not necessarily so.</p><p id="p0245">Most projections of the future migrations of species are derived from bioclimatic modelling (also known as single-species bioclimatic 'envelope' models). These are a special case of ecological niche or distribution models, in which the current native range of species is related to climatic variables so as to enable projections of distributions under various future climate change scenarios (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Guisan and Thuiller, 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Elith and Leathwick, 2009</xref>) and while considerable advances have been made in this field, it has severe technical limitations (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Heikkinen et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">Pearson et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Heywood, 2012</xref>) and is hampered by the lack of available georeferenced distribution points for many species, failure to take into account various factors other than climate, such as biotic interactions, evolutionary change and dispersal abilities, and using too coarse a scale to be ecologically meaningful for the species being studied (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Hampe, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib0118" ref-type="bibr">Garden et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Ehrl&#x000e9;n and Morris (2015)</xref> make the point that a disproportionate amount of effort has focused on distribution only, either documenting historical range shifts or predicting future occurrence patterns, and they recommend that simultaneous projections of abundance and distribution across landscapes would be far more useful. Despite these shortcomings, bioclimatic modelling plays an important role in providing a first approximation of likely species' movements in response to climate change and as we understand better the limitations of the models and are able to integrate into them other factors such as biotic interactions, land cover and dispersal mechanisms, we will be in a better position to interpret the results obtained from them. Much further work needs to be done and more empirical data gathered. If more reliable and acceptable modelling approaches are developed, and applied on a much wider scale, we should be able to obtain a more accurate picture of the likely effects of climate change on future species' distributions and ecosystem composition.</p><p id="p0250">As a consequence of range shifts of species, the composition of the biodiversity in protected areas will change and their effectiveness, not just for conservation of biodiversity but for the provision of ecosystem services, may be reduced (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Hole et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). Innovative approaches to conservation will be required to meet these challenges (<xref rid="bib102" ref-type="bibr">Tingley et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). It may be possible to modify the management of protected areas to maintain or increase ecosystem resilience so as to mitigate some of the effects of climate change and also facilitate the adaptation of ecosystems and species to these changes (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Halpin, 1997</xref>, <xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">Shafer, 1999</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Hannah and Salm, 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Lovejoy, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Hannah et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib0163" ref-type="bibr">Stein et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). This may include more flexibility in size and scale so that a connected network of patches of habitats at various scales is created to allow species the possibility to migrate and adjust their ranges in response to climatic and other change. IUCN has published detailed guidance for protected area managers and planners for adapting to climate change (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Gross et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>).

Given that a wide range of interventions may need to be taken aimed at conserving or recovering threatened species so that they no longer need management, it is appropriate to use the terms &#x02018;recovery&#x02019; or recovery plans' in a general sense to refer to such actions.</p><p id="p0365">A review of the literature shows that the process of species recovery is not well understood (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Heywood, 2015</xref>) and the terminology used can be confusing and is not consistently applied (<xref rid="bib110" ref-type="bibr">Westwood et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). Another complication is that a distinction is often not made between the terms species recovery and species reintroduction and the two processes are frequently conflated in practice: although in both cases many of the actions needed are the same and the target area is within the indigenous range of the species, the key distinction is that species recovery refers to situations where there are still conspecific population individuals in the target area whereas in the case of species reintroduction, no conspecific individuals remain in the target area (see discussion in <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Dalrymple et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Heywood, 2015</xref>).

While this may provide a short-term solution, it may just be buying time as it will usually be necessary to follow it up sooner or later with a proper assessment of the conservation situation in terms of distribution, demography, ecology, genetic variation, and a comprehensive threat assessment so that an effective recovery plan can be drawn up and implemented. Of course, one would not wish to discourage rapid conservation action and often guidance as to what is appropriate may be obtained from the local population who can also participate in the work but ultimately there is no substitute for proper assessment and planning.

Similarly, our knowledge of the ability of individual species to adapt to climate change or to migrate and track the changing climate is generally poor. Under these circumstances, in planning species recovery programmes, when reliable information is available about climate change and species' reactions to it, appropriate actions should be included to facilitate either the adaptation of species or their migratory capacity. In the absence of such information, it is essential to put proper monitoring programmes in place, both during the recovery process and afterwards so that any changes in the status of species' populations as a result of climate or other aspects of global change are detected and remedial action planned.</p><p id="p0425">Not all species can be saved as viable populations in the wild but that is no reason for not making every effort to attempt to conserve and recover as many as we can with the information and techniques available to us today.

The range of potential threats to species is extremely diverse and while some of them are obvious such as overexploitation and habitat loss, others can be quite subtle such as changes in phenology and their impact on pollinators. A common error is to rely too much on the information on threats in the IUCN Red List which although a very valuable resource is not intended to provide a detailed threat analysis for the purposes of species recovery.</p><p id="p0480">In some cases, the cause of the threat to a species may appear obvious, such as over-collecting as in the case of some cacti and succulents, medicinal, aromatic and culinary plants, and removal of the threat may allow it to recover without additional action. In many cases, however, it will be found that after eliminating the threat the species is still at risk and a detailed investigation reveals other threatening factors not previously identified. It is probable that most species are affected by a complex of multiple threats whose control or elimination will require considerable effort. These threats may interact in ways that are not easy to predict, and this may only become apparent through monitoring the impacts of recovery actions. Also, as discussed above, we need to take into account as far as possible with available knowledge, the potential impacts of climate change on areas, habitats and species.</p></sec><sec id="sec8.6"><label>8.6</label><title>Recovery may be undertaken under a variety of land management regimes</title><p id="p0485">It is widely considered that species recovery should be undertaken within a protected area. This is neither ubiquitously correct nor possible. While it is true that a majority of recorded cases of plant species recovery have been in protected areas, this is largely because it is easier to undertake as it avoids having to negotiate access to or purchase of land and establish a protection regime. However, the majority of species (threatened or not) do not occur in protected areas, especially in tropical regions, and then it has to be decided whether it is possible or appropriate to create a new protected area for target species or whether there are alternative ways of ensuring their effective recovery in areas that are not subject to formal protection but have a different kind of management regime as in the case of conservation easements. Smaller scale measures such as small reserves (<xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">Parker, 2012</xref>), plant micro-reserves or the protection of vegetation fragments containing the target species may be suitable (<xref rid="bib115" ref-type="bibr">Miandrimanana et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>) and even fencing off an area on otherwise unprotected land to protect it from grazing can play a role.</p></sec><sec id="sec8.7"><label>8.7</label><title>Genetic knowledge is critical</title><p id="p0490">Adequate genetic knowledge is important for the determination of best practice in conservation and potential recovery of species. Genetic variation is at the very heart of species recovery. As a general rule, the more genetic variation that can be captured in the recovery population, the more likely is its long-term survival and contribution to successful recovery of the target species although many plant conservation and recovery initiatives do not include the necessary genetic information (<xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">Pierson et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, care should be taken to ensure that the detailed genetic research and analyses are tailored to providing practical guidance for conservation measures and are not just an academic study. Guidelines for including sufficient genetic diversity of threatened species in recovery programmes are generally inadequate and often simplistic measures which rely largely on intuition are employed. This issue has been addressed for tree species by <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Hoban et&#x000a0;al.

They range from fairly simple actions such as habitat weeding to quite unusual or unexpected actions such as resolving complex seed dormancy mechanisms that may be needed following detailed investigation. The commonest interventions include habitat protection, fencing, habitat weeding, control or eradication of invasive species, control of unregulated livestock grazing or browsing, control of illegal collection of plant material, assisted pollination to increase seed set, control of pests and disease, managing disturbance regimes, predator control, soil improvement, population augmentation. Even apparently simple interventions such as exclusion fencing need to be carefully planned &#x02013; in terms of location, coverage, height, material, potential impact on other species, etc. &#x02013; if they are to be effective.</p><p id="p0500">Management interventions may require considerable resources and are sometimes very costly. In the case of population augmentation to improve population viability by increasing the number of individuals in a population, the choice and location of source materials is critical. The seed or other material used for translocation may be collected from the existing populations or more often from <italic>ex situ</italic> conservation material such as seed from gene banks or from living collections in botanic gardens. In some cases, the numbers of translocated individuals are too low to be effective and insufficient use is made of facilities for the multiplication of individuals from seed. In fact, it has been found that for some species the quantities required for translocation may be very high &#x02013; in some cases tens of thousands &#x02013; and when outplants need to be raised from the seed, or if vegetative propagules have to be multiplied, nurseries are needed for this purpose. Depending on the quantities needed, some botanic gardens have the capacity to grow on such material, but often dedicated conservation nurseries are needed. For example, the Native Plant Biodiversity Conservation Nurseries in North Caicos and in Providenciales, (<xref rid="bib117" ref-type="bibr">Dani Sanchez et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>) nursery and the horticultural expertise acquired by them over the years in growing native plants were crucial to the successful rescue of the Caicos pine <italic>Pinus caribaea</italic> var. <italic>bahamensis</italic>. The Hawaiian Rare Plant Facilities which are part of a state-wide programme Plant Extinction Prevention Programme (PEPP) play a major role in saving Hawai&#x02018;i's rarest native plants from extinction by propagation and outplanting.

Also, when micropropagation is needed to produce material for outplants, appropriate cell or tissue culture facilities are required.</p><p id="p0505">Examples of the enormous diversity of management interventions that have been employed in recovery programmes can be obtained from published recovery plans, e.g. by the US Fish &#x00026; Wildlife Service.<xref rid="fn12" ref-type="fn">12</xref> Apparently, no global database of management interventions has been compiled and urgent consideration should be given to preparing one so as to provide more ready access to the enormously important body of information that has been amassed over the years.</p></sec><sec id="sec8.9"><label>8.9</label><title>The state of the translocation habitat is critical</title><p id="p0510">It is important not to neglect the state of the habitat at the translocation site(s). The detailed conditions of the site such as the topography, soil conditions, hydrology and overall health of the ecosystem and its state of management need to be considered and any necessary remedial actions, such as weeding are undertaken. This is essential to ensure that the outplants have the best possible chance of establishment. Also, it would be pointless attempting to recover a species by population augmentation if there is not sufficient critical habitat available.</p></sec><sec id="sec8.10"><label>8.10</label><title>Monitoring is essential at all stages of recovery</title><p id="p0515">Monitoring plays a vital role at all stages in the conservation and recovery process yet it is often neglected, and many monitoring programmes are poorly designed and ineffective.</p></sec><sec id="sec8.11"><label>8.11</label><title>Success is not guaranteed</title><p id="p0520">Species recovery is not a short-term process. It may take 10 years or more before the success or failure of recovery programmes can be assessed. It is important to agree recovery objectives and how they are to be measured as a critical part of a recovery plan. It is very difficult to say what percentage of recovery actions are successful since failures tend not to be reported. Many of the failures that are reported are due to inadequate planning. Even when the recovery objectives appear to have been met, it may be found that to maintain viable populations of the target species, continuing management intervention may be needed. Such species have been termed &#x02018;conservation-reliant&#x02019;. As discussed above, future climate change will have an impact on the effectiveness of some recovery programmes and require additional action.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec9"><label>9</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0525">Conservation of plant biodiversity will continue to fail to meet national and global targets unless and until the various approaches are coordinated from the planning stage to implementation, and effective partnerships established with the necessary stakeholders and landowners, including local communities. The widespread failure to integrate species-based and area-based conservation planning, policies and actions is one of the key factors responsible for the continuing loss of biodiversity.</p><p id="p0530">Many countries rely on protected areas as the primary strategy for conserving threatened species <italic>in situ</italic> without any further targeted action to remove threats to species within them and as a consequence, many threatened species continue to be on a trajectory to extinction. All countries need to recognize the need for targeted <italic>in situ</italic> species conservation and invest much greater effort and resources in the recovery of threatened or other important species. Even in countries with well-developed recovery programmes, many action plans for species recovery remain to be completed or even implemented in a timely manner (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Dorey and Walker, 2018</xref>).</p><p id="p0535">Calls for a massive expansion of the existing protected areas estate are seductive although it is difficult to imagine circumstances under which the recently proposed 50 percent target could be reached in the foreseeable future, in view of the massive logistic, political, legal and economic issues that would need to be overcome (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Dudley et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>); but even if it were to happen and the areas were properly protected and maintained &#x02013; also an improbable scenario &#x02013; we would still continue to lose biodiversity within them unless actions were also taken to make as thorough as possible a scientific study of the threats to species at risk and their habitats, followed by actions to remove or contain these threats so that recovery is possible (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Heywood et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib118" ref-type="bibr">Monks et al., 2019</xref>). This in turn would require a radical shift in the balance of actions to conserve plant diversity.</p><p id="p0540">Whatever the reasons for the poor articulation and lack of coordination of the area- and species-based 2020 biodiversity conservation targets, it is to be hoped that in the new iteration of post-2020 targets now under consideration these matters will be remedied. The opportunity should be taken to thoroughly revise and integrate the CBD targets for area- and species-based conservation, and coordinate the actions proposed for their implementation so that they are mutually supportive. As they stand, targets such as &#x02018;at least 75% of known threatened species conserved <italic>in situ</italic>&#x02019;, are doubly defective: many of the 75% of threatened species do not occur in protected areas and so would require an unspecified expansion of the protected area estate, if they were to be included, as well as OECMs. That is not the goal of this target but of other targets and even in the unlikely event that the 50% or Half Earth goal were to be achieved, many threatened species would still fall outside. The omission of the need for conservation actions at the species level, notably to eliminate the factors that cause them to be threatened, is another failing of such targets. There is no ascertainable basis for the requirement in Target 8 of the GSPC for at least 20% of <italic>ex situ</italic> collections to be available for recovery or restoration programmes. This is not to imply that <italic>ex situ</italic> collections are not needed for recovery or reintroduction and indeed for other purposes &#x02013; on the contrary they are essential, even though existing collections are hardly utilized at present. Accordingly, in revising the targets for species- and area-based conservation, I would propose that a key requirement for the implementation of <italic>in situ</italic> species conservation should be &#x02018;<italic>In situ</italic> conservation or recovery plans should be prepared and implemented for 75% [or whatever figure is agreed] of threatened species&#x02019; and in the technical guidance it should be made clear that while this may take place largely in protected areas, other effective measures may be needed for species that occur outside formally protected areas. The requirement for <italic>ex situ</italic> material to be available for <italic>in situ</italic> actions should be for all species deemed to be in need of recovery or reintroduction programmes, rather than setting an arbitrary target, and ideally collected in coordination with the relevant <italic>in situ</italic> agencies, Hanging over all our conservation actions is the threat of climate change and we are still in the throes of learning how to manage it. In the meanwhile, it is important to ensure that our conservation strategies at all levels are as effective as possible so as to slow significantly the current loss of biodiversity and enable our ecosystems and species to adapt to future change.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Adams</surname><given-names>W.M.</given-names></name></person-group><chapter-title>Against Extinction.
