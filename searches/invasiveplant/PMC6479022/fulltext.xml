It remains unclear, however, how consistent, and therefore potentially predictable, such patterns of local adaptation are. One approach to this question is to measure patterns of local differentiation in functional traits and plasticity levels in invasive species in multiple regions. Finding consistent patterns of local differentiation in replicate regions suggests that these patterns are adaptive. Further, this outcome indicates that the invading species likely responds predictably to selection along environmental gradients, even though standing genetic variation is likely to have been reduced during introduction. We studied local differentiation in the invasive annual plant <italic>Erodium cicutarium</italic> in two invaded regions, California and Chile. We collected seeds from across strong gradients in precipitation and temperature in Mediterranean-climate parts of the two regions (10 populations per region). We grew seeds from maternal families from these populations through two generations and exposed the second generation to contrasting levels of water and nutrient availability. We measured growth, flowering time and leaf functional traits across these treatments to obtain trait means and plasticity measures. We found strong differentiation among populations in all traits. Plants from drier environments flowered earlier, were less plastic in flowering time and reached greater size in all treatments. Correlations among traits within regions suggested a coordinated evolutionary response along environmental gradients associated with growing season length. There was little divergence in traits and trait intercorrelations <italic>between</italic> regions, but strongly parallel divergence in traits <italic>within</italic> regions. Similar, statistically consistent patterns of local trait differentiation across two regions suggest that local adaptation to environmental gradients has aided the spread of this invasive species, and that the formation of ecotypes in newly invaded environments has been relatively consistent and predictable.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser"><p>Originally from Europe, <italic>Erodium cicutarium</italic> (redstem storksbill) spread across both North and South America.

The success of broadly distributed species across a wide range of environmental conditions is, in part, determined by their ability to maintain fitness and positive population growth rates across the range of local environmental conditions encountered by individual populations (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Alleaume-Benharira <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). Genetic variation and phenotypic plasticity determine the extent to which trait expression in a population matches local selective optima (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Callaway <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Hereford 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Lazaro-Nogal <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). Both mean trait values and levels of phenotypic plasticity can evolve in response to local selection regimes, enabling a broadly distributed species to maximize fitness and persist across a wider range of environmental conditions than could any single constituent population or ecotype (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Chevin <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>).</p><p>Widespread invasive species are characterized by range expansions following introduction to a new location and often associated with broad ecological distributions across their native and invaded ranges (<xref rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr">Richardson <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>). As a result, invasive species can provide useful case studies for understanding the roles of genetic differentiation and plasticity in the process of range expansion (<xref rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr">Sexton <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">Parker <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Molina-Montenegro <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). Studies of the response of invasive species to novel conditions may also shed light on how established species respond to novel environmental conditions, including climate change, through evolutionary and plastic responses (<xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">Moran and Alexander 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Chown <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Hobbs <italic>et al.</italic> 2018</xref>). An important question in invasion biology is to what extent differentiation of local populations&#x02014;in mean traits, plasticity or both&#x02014;aids exotic invasive species in extending their distributions across varying environments, and how rapidly such differentiation occurs. Because colonization events that begin plant invasions can involve a relatively small number of seeds or plant fragments, rapid differentiation during invasion may be restricted in some cases by low standing genetic variation in the spreading populations (<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Matesanz <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Balogh and Barrett 2016</xref>). A review found that for most invasive species, population differentiation in the invaded range is lower than in the native range, suggesting that introduced populations may not have had time to differentiate fully (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Bossdorf <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). Recent studies have, however, documented many cases of rapid evolution in invaded ranges (<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Maron <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Montague <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">Prentis <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Colautti and Barrett 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">Oduor <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Blossey <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">Moran <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>). It appears that rapid trait differentiation in invasive species is the rule rather than the exception, but it remains unclear whether trait differentiation in the invaded range is due to local selection or other factors, and how differentiation in mean traits relates patterns of plasticity (<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Maron <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">Murren and Dudash 2012</xref>). Evaluating how predictable these evolutionary responses are will require empirical data on among-population functional traits in species introduced in multiple regions, data that remain largely lacking (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Colautti and Barrett 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Colautti and Lau 2015</xref>).</p><p>Adaptive genetic differentiation in mean trait expression has been widely demonstrated in the field (<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Linhart and Grant 1996</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Leimu and Fischer 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Hereford 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Fournier-Level <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). Previous studies have found strong differences in flowering time and growth rate across climatic gradients in both annual (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Franks <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>) and perennial plants (<xref rid="CIT0078" ref-type="bibr">Weber and Schmid 1998</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Colautti and Barrett 2013</xref>); these differences imply that there is strong selection on annual plants to match their phenology to local climate seasonality. Adaptive phenotypic plasticity, the ability of genotypes to match trait expression and selective optima across environments, provides another important mechanism for a broadly distributed species to maximize fitness in response to variable selection pressures (<xref rid="CIT0067" ref-type="bibr">Richards <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Holt and Barfield 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Molina-Montenegro <italic>et al.</italic> 2018</xref>). Greater phenotypic plasticity is expected to be favoured in habitats where populations encounter variation in selection within or across generations as a result of temporal or spatial environmental variation (<xref rid="CIT0075" ref-type="bibr">Van Kleunen and Fischer 2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Alpert and Simms 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Gianoli 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Gianoli and Gonzalez-Teuber 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Baythavong 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">Pratt and Mooney 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Lazaro-Nogal <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>), while selection should tend to favour adaptive genetic differentiation among populations exposed to consistent differences in selection on average trait expression (<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Linhart and Grant 1996</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0074" ref-type="bibr">Sultan and Spencer 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Leimu and Fischer 2008</xref>). Theory suggests that adaptive plasticity may enable persistence in novel environmental conditions and facilitate local adaptation (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Chevin and Lande 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Chevin <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Franks <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>).</p><p>Since individual phenotypic traits are linked through organismal structure and function, they often evolve in a correlated way (<xref rid="CIT0069" ref-type="bibr">Savage and Cavender-Bares 2011</xref>). Suites of functionally related traits are thus expected to co-vary in ways that reflect ecological trade-off axes such as maximum growth rate versus resource efficiency or rapid reproduction versus extended growth. It is also possible, however, that the patterns of correlations among traits could themselves be sensitive to the environment&#x02014;for example, growth rate might be tightly coupled to flowering time in a dry environment, but these traits might be less strongly linked in a mesic environment (<xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">Pigliucci and Schlichting 1995</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Gianoli 2003</xref>). To use an example of trait correlations relevant to this study, if local populations of an exotic plant experience selection for shorter lifespan in environments with short growing seasons, we expect many other traits to co-vary with growing season length and plant lifespan. For example, we expect to see associations between growing season length, growth rate and flowering time, as well as growth-related leaf traits. If an invading species is exposed to similar environmental clines in different invaded ranges, we would expect populations of the species to respond similarly in each new invaded region (assuming sufficient additive genetic variation is present), producing parallel evolution of suites of functional traits and therefore similar sets of ecotypes in each region, as has been found in some other plant and animal species (<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Maron <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Leger and Rice 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Jones <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">Oduor <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>).</p><p>
<italic>Erodium cicutarium</italic> is a broadly distributed annual forb that has invaded a wide range of habitats on all continents except Antarctica, from its native range in Europe (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Fiz-Palacios <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). In California, where the species was introduced around 300 years ago (<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">Mensing and Byrne 1998</xref>), it occurs from the Mojave Desert in the south to Sierra Nevada foothills &#x0003e;500 km to the north. In Chile, 170 years ago it was already referred as extremely abundant throughout the Mediterranean-climate region (30&#x02013;35&#x000b0;S), from the border with the Atacama Desert in the north to the transition with temperate forests in the south (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Barn&#x000e9;oud 1845</xref>). Its introduction date in Chile might therefore be comparable to that in California, though it is possible that it was introduced more recently in Chile.</p><p>These parallel invaded ranges of <italic>E. cicutarium</italic> in Chile and California provide an opportunity to characterize differentiation in mean trait expression and phenotypic plasticity on two continents with similar climates (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Di Castri 1973</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">Mooney 1977</xref>) and to relate potential trait differentiation to environmental gradients and to performance under contrasting conditions. This parallel has been exploited previously to test whether patterns of trait differentiation in the introduced range of <italic>Eschscholzia californica</italic> in Chile are parallel to those in the species&#x02019; native range in California; the study found the patterns were parallel, suggesting adaptive evolution in the invasive range (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Leger and Rice 2007</xref>). Here, we study local differentiation of an exotic species that has been introduced into both of these similar but independent regions. This comparison of parallel invasions gives us a more direct view whether patterns of local adaptation and plasticity variation during invasions are consistent and therefore potentially predictable (<xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">Oduor <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). Observing parallel responses does not, of course, prove that differentiation is adaptive, but consistent patterns of differentiation along two parallel gradients suggest that differentiation has been driven by selection (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Endler 1986</xref>) rather than other evolutionary processes, such as multiple invasions and genotype sorting or genetic drift (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Keller <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0080" ref-type="bibr">Zenni <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>).</p><p>We collected seeds from maternal plants in populations across gradients in latitude, mean annual precipitation and precipitation seasonality (21 populations in California, 14 in Chile). For the greenhouse experiments, we selected 10 populations from each region that represented these gradients well and grew them out for one generation to equalize maternal environments (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). We conducted greenhouse experiments that included exposing a second generation of plants to contrasting water and nutrient treatments to characterize patterns of variation in mean trait expression and phenotypic plasticity. We also characterized climatic conditions and local edaphic and biotic environments in the source populations. We address the following questions: (i) Is there differentiation in flowering time, growth rate and leaf traits, and in the level of plasticity in these traits, among <italic>E. cicutarium</italic> populations from California and Chile? (ii) Are patterns of differentiation among populations in mean trait expression and plasticity associated with characteristics of the source sites? We hypothesize that: (a) flowering time and growth-related functional traits will vary along gradients in mean precipitation, which in these regions is strongly associated with productivity and growing season length (more precipitation leads to higher productivity over a longer growing season); and (b) higher plasticity will be associated with greater temporal and spatial environmental variation in availability of water and nutrients. (iii) What are the patterns of correlation among functional traits, and do these define a suite of traits whose variation along environmental gradients is consistent in the two invaded regions?</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Locations of <italic>Erodium cicutarium</italic> source populations.

family were randomly selected from each field-collected maternal family. Seeds were physically scarified to break dormancy and planted into pots using the same protocol as in previous <italic>E. cicutarium</italic> greenhouse experiments conducted by <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Baythavong (2011)</xref> to minimize differences in maternal environmental effects among families. Seeds produced by these first-generation plants were used in a second-generation greenhouse experiment.</p><p>For each region (California and Chile), we used 10 populations from sites that spanned similar ranges of latitude and precipitation (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Ten maternal families were randomly selected for each population from the set of families included in the first greenhouse generation. Eight brown, filled seeds per family were physically scarified and planted in October, using the same methods described for the first greenhouse generation (8 seeds per family, 10 families per population, 20 populations = 1600 total seeds). After emergence, two seedlings per family were placed into random locations within racks for each of the four treatment types (see below). Within a week after emergence, 147 seedlings were killed by herbivores (fly larvae) under the mist benches; this mortality was spread evenly across sites and source regions with no clear pattern of susceptibility or resistance. After this mortality, sample size ranged from 68 to 76 plants per site (of the initial 80). As a result, some families were represented by only one seedling in each treatment. One population (Bodega Bay, California) experienced anomalously high mortality during the experiment, resulting in a small sample size for estimating treatment effects and a highly unbalanced design when this population was included in experiment-wide analyses. We therefore removed this population from the analysis, leaving 19 populations (9 from California, 10 from Chile).</p><p>Seedlings were top-watered with fertilizer water for 1 week before treatments were imposed. After the first week, racks were randomly assigned to one of four treatments: high and low water, and high and low nutrients. Because fertilizer was delivered with the water, we did not cross nutrient and water treatments in the experiment, but instead conducted separate contrasts for water and nutrients. For the water treatments, we held nutrient concentrations in the water constant and varied the amount of water. For the nutrient treatments, we held the amount of water constant and varied the nutrient concentration.</p><p>High-water treatment racks were top-watered three times per week with 1 gallon of fertigated water throughout the experiment. Low-water treatment racks received a different watering schedule determined by measurements of percent water content of individual pots. Two individuals per low-treatment rack were randomly selected and weighed every other day to calculate percent water content. When the average water content reached 15 % averaged across &#x02018;low-water&#x02019; pots, each rack was top-watered with 1 gallon of water. High- and low-nutrient treatment racks were top-watered three times per week with 1 gallon of fertigated water, with the level of nutrients controlled by the concentration in the fertigated water. Water for the low-nutrient plants was diluted 16 times compared to the water for the high-nutrient plants. High- and low-water treatment racks were watered with fertigated water diluted three times compared to the high-nutrient plants, and were also watered with 1 gallon of water at each watering time. Throughout the entire experiment, racks were rotated two times per week to minimize the effect of microenvironmental variation within the greenhouse on trait expression.</p><p>Surveys of flowering were conducted every other day until the experiment was terminated in late May (~7.5 months after seeds were sown). The number of days from planting to the date at which the first flower opened was recorded as &#x02018;flowering time&#x02019;. At the end of the experiment, the longest stem of each plant was measured to assess plant height. Specific leaf area (SLA) was calculated as the ratio of leaf area (mm<sup>2</sup>) to leaf weight (mg). A single, fully expanded leaf was randomly selected from each individual. The leaf was immediately pressed beneath glass and photographed. This leaf was then dried at 60 &#x000b0;C to a constant weight. Image J (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>) was used to measure leaf area digitally, using hand tracing to deal with residual shadows in the images.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec id="s6"><title>Variation among populations in mean trait expression and plasticity.</title><p>All analyses were done using R version 3.4.3 (<xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">R Core Team 2018</xref>). We summarized the functional trait response variables (flowering time, stem length, SLA and leaf area) to family means within each treatment <bold>[see</bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1"><bold>Supporting Information&#x02014;Dataset S1</bold></xref><bold>]</bold>. To descriptively partition variance, we first used ANOVA to determine the amount of mean trait variation associated with population of origin, with greenhouse treatment, and the interaction of population of origin and treatment. To test for significant differences in traits between treatments, regions (California vs. Chile) and source populations within regions, we fitted linear mixed models. In these models, family mean trait values were the response variables, and we included the fixed effect of treatment (high water, low water, high nutrients or low nutrients) plus random intercepts for source population nested within region. Stem length, SLA and leaf area were log-transformed before analysis to homogenize residual variance.</p><p>We used a model comparison approach to test for significant differences in traits among regions (Chile and California) by using likelihood ratio tests to compare linear mixed models containing region as a random effect to null models containing no explanatory variables. We similarly tested for significant variation in traits among source populations by comparing models that included only treatment (fixed effect) and region (random effect) to models including these variables plus source population random effects nested within region. Finally, we tested for significant differences among treatments by comparing models that included treatment (fixed effect) and nested population and region random effects with models containing only population and region random effects.</p><p>We tested for variation in trait plasticity among regions and among populations in the same way, again using linear mixed models. Plasticity was calculated for each family as the absolute difference in family mean trait values between the high-resource greenhouse treatment (high water or high nutrients) and the corresponding low-resource treatment (low water or low nutrients), divided by the family mean across both treatments (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Davidson <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>).</p><p>We tested the association of the family mean plasticity values with region and population, again using likelihood ratio tests as described above. Because the plasticity response variables are a standardized difference between family means from two contrasting treatments (high vs. low water; high vs. low nutrients), the significance of treatment could not be evaluated for plasticity. We adjusted the sets of <italic>P</italic>-values from these tests for multiple comparisons by using the method of Benjamini and Hochberg to control the false discovery rate to &#x0003c;5 % (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Benjamini and Hochberg 1995</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Association between population-level trait variation and source-site environmental variables.</title><p>To characterize climatic conditions of the source populations, mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation and seasonality in precipitation (standard deviation of average monthly precipitation values from January to December) were obtained from the WorldClim online database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.worldclim.org/">http://www.worldclim.org/</ext-link>). In addition, temporal variation in precipitation was calculated as the coefficient of variation of mean annual precipitation over 30 years, using monthly global interpolated precipitation data for 1981&#x02013;2010 downloaded from the Climatic Research Unit of the University of East Anglia (<xref rid="CIT0040a" ref-type="bibr">Hulme 1992</xref>). We measured characteristics of the soil and the plant community at the locations of at 10 randomly selected <italic>Erodium</italic> maternal plants per source population. Because we did not have a clear hypothesis about which soil properties would likely influence our functional traits, other than general soil fertility, we used a principal component analysis on the standardized values of soil nutrients. The soil properties measured included total N, P and K, as well as pH and the micronutrients Mg, Ca, Na and S, as well as estimates of total organic matter and cation exchange capacity. The first principal component from this analysis accounted for 38 % of the variation in the soil data and was heavily weighted on calcium and magnesium content as well as cation exchange capacity and soil organic matter. Measurements of grass cover and total plant cover were strongly correlated (&#x003c1; = 0.76), so we chose to include only one of these two variables, total plant cover, in the analysis. We summarized the soil principal component and total plant cover to a mean value and a coefficient of variation for each population. Because there was only one value per population for the source-site environmental variables, we also summarized the trait response variables to population means for this analysis.</p><p>To evaluate associations between the trait response variables and candidate sets of environmental variables (see <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; <bold>see</bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2"><bold>Supporting Information&#x02014;Dataset S2</bold></xref>), we used the MuMIn (&#x02018;multimodel inference&#x02019;) library in R to explore all combinations of the explanatory variables and rank the resulting models using the small-sample-corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Barto&#x00144; 2016</xref>).

Despite the independent spread of the species in these two widely separated regions, there were no significant differences in either trait means or plasticity levels between the two regions. In contrast with the lack of divergence in traits <italic>among</italic> regions, there was a strong pattern of parallel divergence in functional traits <italic>within</italic> regions (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Within both Chile and California, populations exhibited strong differentiation in mean traits and plasticity in flowering time, and this variation was associated with various environmental factors, most consistently with gradients in mean annual precipitation. Populations in dry areas on both continents appear to represent parallel evolution of an ecotype characterized by rapid growth during a short growing season, early flowering and relatively low plasticity in flowering time. Populations from wetter areas, in contrast, flower later and also express higher plasticity in flowering time under water limitation. Such strong, environmentally associated patterns in trait variation are consistent with patterns that have been found in other studies of invasive plants that have spread across climatic gradients (<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Maron <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Colautti and Barrett 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0080" ref-type="bibr">Zenni <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). Previous research has shown that relatively rapid evolutionary differentiation is common in spreading invasive species; this study shows that for this invasive annual plant, the outcome of such differentiation is highly consistent in two invaded regions.</p><p>We observed a strong positive relationship between flowering time and mean annual precipitation: families of <italic>E. cicutarium</italic> collected from low precipitation sites in California and Chile flowered significantly earlier than families from high precipitation sites. Annual plants growing in Mediterranean regions worldwide generally emerge soon after the autumn rains begin and complete their life cycle before the onset of the dry, hot summer. Soil moisture levels drop to low levels earlier in the spring in sites with low average precipitation in such winter-rainfall climates, producing shorter growing seasons for plants. Short growing seasons are expected to favour rapid growth rates and early phenology in annual plants to ensure production of viable seeds before the onset of dry summers (<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Levitt 1980</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Debieu <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Donohue 2014</xref>), as also observed in desert regions where growth is strongly water-limited (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Gremer <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). In arid sites, annual plants that delay flowering may not produce any viable seeds if flowering occurs too long after winter rains have ended. In contrast, in wetter sites, annuals that delay flowering may reach greater biomass before flowering, and this larger size may maximize their competitive ability and fitness. Consistent with these expectations, there is evidence that early flowering is often an adaptive response to drought in annuals (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Heschel and Riginos 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0071" ref-type="bibr">Sherrard and Maherali 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Franks <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>) and short-lived perennial forbs (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Anderson <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>).</p><p>Families collected from sites with low mean annual precipitation had leaves with higher SLA, on average, than maternal families from wetter sites. This negative relationship mirrors the effect of precipitation on average flowering time. Higher SLA in drier areas may seem counter-intuitive, given that lower SLA values are often associated with adaptation to tolerate dry climates, particularly in perennial plants (<xref rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr">Stahl <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Dwyer <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). However, <italic>E. cicutarium</italic> is an annual plant which adopts a drought-avoidance rather than a drought-tolerance strategy&#x02014;it grows rapidly during the growth season, then senesces with the onset of drought (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Kimball <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). Consistent with this &#x02018;live fast, die young&#x02019; strategy (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Donovan <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>), it appears that this species is under selection to accelerate its life cycle in sites with lower annual precipitation, and that rapid growth enables it to maximize resource capture during the generally short growing season and rapidly produce seeds. Together, its traits form a correlated axis of variation associated with rapid growth (emergence to flowering in as little as 60 days), including high-SLA leaves that are relatively cheap to produce per unit area, need to be maintained only for a short time and can produce high growth rates (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Galmes <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Angert <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). The ecological strategy of drought avoidance is not limited to annual plants: for example, similar patterns in leaf morphology have been observed in other drought-avoiding plant species, such as drought-deciduous <italic>Pelargonium</italic> species from arid regions of South Africa (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Jones <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>).</p><p>Families from sites with higher precipitation exhibited greater plasticity in flowering time, which in this case means that they flowered later in response to both water and nutrient limitation than families from dry sites (<xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Higher plasticity in flowering time was only weakly associated with temporal variability in precipitation, both within and among years (<bold>see</bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup3"><bold>Supporting Information&#x02014;Fig. S1b</bold></xref>; <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Plasticity (i.e. greater delays) in flowering under water limitation was associated most strongly with mean annual precipitation and soil nutrient levels (<bold>see</bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup3"><bold>Supporting Information&#x02014;Fig. S1</bold></xref>; <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Early flowering time may be a trait in which reduced plasticity is favoured in sites with short growing seasons to maximize resource capture when water is available, and to ensure production of some seeds before the short growing season ends. For instance, another native annual forb from the Mediterranean-climate region of Chile shows null plasticity in flowering time to drought (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Gonzales <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>), even though it is fairly common across semiarid sites and exhibits significant reproductive outputs (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Celedon-Neghme <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0073" ref-type="bibr">Suarez <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). Lower plasticity in days to flowering in response to nutrient limitation (though not to water limitation) was also associated with higher total plant cover, a possible metric of competition intensity, in the source environment (<bold>see</bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup3"><bold>Supporting Information&#x02014;Fig. S1c</bold></xref>; <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). A loss of plasticity in flowering time has also been found in <italic>E. cicutarium</italic> in response to shading in competition experiments, so it is possible there is a more general association between characteristics of biotic environment and flowering time plasticity (<xref rid="CIT0077" ref-type="bibr">Vermeulen 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Heger 2016</xref>).</p><p>Trait plasticity in response to nutrient limitation was often associated with soil nutrient conditions in the source environment, but greater plasticity was not consistently associated with greater local variation in local nutrient availability. Similarly, mean nutrient levels were associated in inconsistent ways with levels of plasticity of different traits (<bold>see</bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup3"><bold>Supporting Information&#x02014;Fig. S1b</bold></xref><bold>and</bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup3"><bold>c</bold></xref>; <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). These results are only weakly consistent with the hypothesis that higher plasticity will be associated with greater temporal variation in resource supply, here measured as the interannual coefficient of variation of precipitation. Interannual precipitation variation was weakly associated with plasticity in flowering in response to both water and nutrient availability, and with plasticity of stem length to nutrient availability, but not with plasticity of other traits in response to water (<bold>see</bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup3"><bold>Supporting Information&#x02014;Fig. S1b</bold></xref><bold>and</bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup3"><bold>c</bold></xref>; <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). A recent review found a consistent pattern of greater plasticity in plant populations from sites with greater temporal heterogeneity in precipitation (<xref rid="CIT0076" ref-type="bibr">Vazquez <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>). However, in this review, the nine species that showed the expected association were all perennial plants, unlike <italic>E. cicutarium</italic>. This result could lead us to reconsider whether the expected positive association between plasticity and temporal variation should be as strong for short-lived plants.</p><p>This greenhouse experiment does not prove that the observed population differentiation in a suite of traits associated with an accelerated life cycle enhances fitness in the field at arid sites, since we have not planted the seeds reciprocally back into the source environments. Nonetheless, the consistency of the population differences and patterns of trait correlations across invaded ranges in both California and Chile suggests these patterns may be driven by selection rather than neutral evolutionary processes (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Endler 1986</xref>). It is nonetheless possible, and has been found in some cases, that founder effects influence clinal variation in invaded ranges (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Keller <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>); we cannot rule such introduction effects out here, though the parallel patterns in the two regions suggest is less likely. The strong population differences in multiple correlated traits in two independent invasive ranges, coupled with potentially major fitness consequences of these traits, suggest that local adaptation to the tempo and length of the growing season has aided the spread of this species on both continents (<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Maron <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Colautti and Barrett 2013</xref>). Despite the relatively short time the species has occupied these invaded ranges, it already displays strong patterns of differentiation qualitatively comparable to local differentiation in annual plant species in their native ranges. This evidence of substantial differentiation over a relatively short time period suggests that standing genetic variation is not necessarily low enough to strongly limit adaptation in small, colonizing plant populations, and that relatively rapid genetic differentiation in average trait values and phenotypic plasticity may play important roles in range expansion of invasive species. Our results provide, at a much shorter time scale, evidence that is consistent with the reported convergent evolution in form and function of vegetation from California and central Chile (<xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">Mooney 1977</xref>). From a different perspective, our results illustrate that invasive plant species may show similar adaptation patterns in comparable habitats, which can be of use for predicting their evolutionary trajectories in new invaded ranges.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s14"><title>Supporting Information</title><p>The following additional information is available in the online version of this article&#x02014;</p><p>Figure S1.
