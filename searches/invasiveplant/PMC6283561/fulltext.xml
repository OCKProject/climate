Transgenerational plasticity that is influenced by epigenetics (heritable changes in gene function that do not result from changes in DNA sequence) during both sexual and asexual reproduction are of major relevance for adaptation of plants to climate change. To understand the transgenerational effects on the responses of vegetatively propagated poplar (<italic>Populus deltoides</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>trichocarpa</italic>) ramets (cuttings) to a changing environment, we tested whether the temperature and photoperiod experienced by the mother trees (genets) persistently affects the phenology of the cuttings grown in a common environment. We weekly monitored the bud phenology of the cuttings collected from the parent trees that have been growing across Europe along a &#x0003e;2100 km latitudinal gradient for at least 18 years. In addition, we asked whether there was variation in DNA methylation as measured by Methylation Sensitive Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (MSAPs) in the clones due to the different environmental conditions experienced by the parent trees. Our results indicate a transgenerational effect on bud phenology in the asexually reproduced offspring (vegetative cuttings). The temperatures experienced by the parent tree clones (from different geographic regions) altered the bud flush of the cuttings in the common garden. However, no significant epigenetic variation was detected in the cuttings of the parent trees within single genotypes growing under different climates. In sum, our results show that trees have the potential to respond to rapid climate change but the mechanism behind these changes needs to be further investigated by more powerful molecular methods like whole-genome bisulphite sequencing techniques.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002749</institution-id><institution>Federaal Wetenschapsbeleid</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Verheyen</surname><given-names>Kris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC Consolidator Grant 614839</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Verheyen</surname><given-names>Kris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC Starting Grant 757833</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Frenne</surname><given-names>Pieter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by the Belgian Science Policy Office (BELSPO) under the project FORBIO Climate-Adaptation potential of biodiverse forests in the face of climate change via the BRAIN-be programme to Kris Verheyen.

Bud phenology (here defined as the timing of bud flush and bud set) in particular is a very important phenotypic trait to assess plant responses to climate change since it controls the growing period available to plants. Along with other phenotypic traits, it received increased attention in the light of global warming [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Bud phenology can be influenced by global warming and interactions between the climate and photoperiod [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208591.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208591.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, the phenology of tree species does not show simple linear responses to warming temperatures [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In the case of a latitudinal transfer from south to north, i.e., if plants experience colder than optimal temperatures, longer time would be required for the duration of bud formation and the cessation of growth can be delayed [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. One component of phenotypic plasticity is transgenerational effects when the parent&#x02019;s environment influences offspring responses to environmental conditions independent of genetic changes [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208591.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], which is also known as transgenerational phenotypic plasticity (TGP). It is particularly important for tree responses to climate change [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Most former studies (on plants) have focused on transgenerational (particularly maternal) effects of sexually reproduced offspring, examining the effects of the maternal environment on seed germination and flowering time [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Various studies, by comparing the performance of the progeny in maternal and non-maternal environments, have shown that maternal effects are likely adaptive [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208591.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, in heterogeneous environments where the progeny environment is hard to predict, the phenotypes with low variance of fitness get a selective advantage which is also known as bet hedging phenomena and in such conditions the advantage of parental effects might not be observed [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Although thus far this effect has been studied mainly in non-clonal plants, transgenerational plasticity is also applicable to asexually generated progeny [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Asexual reproduction lacks the variation-generating mechanisms of meiotic recombination and segregation, which reduces the potential for genetically based adaptation [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Nevertheless, many clonal species persist and successfully expand in a range of different environments. Some of the most successful invasive plant species are clonal [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208591.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Clonal individuals have the advantage of resource sharing (such as water, carbohydrates and mineral nutrients) between the connected ramets, an effect known as clonal integration which is probably one reason of their invasion success [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Furthermore, epigenetic variation might contribute to adaptation of asexual plants in a wide range of, particularly stressful, environments [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It is suggested that, given the absence of meiotic resetting of epigenetic modification in clonal reproduction, vegetative offspring can inherit epigenetic information of previous environmental interactions from the maternal ramet [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Transgenerational effects were observed in clonal offspring of <italic>Festuca rubra</italic> and <italic>Trifolium repens</italic> and some transgenerational effects in clonal plants of <italic>Trifolium repens</italic> were reported as adaptive [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208591.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. DNA methylation, the addition of a methyl group to one of the four bases in the DNA molecule (usually cytosine), is recognized as one of the prime epigenetic mechanisms to correlate with gene expression and might play an important role in transgenerational effects. However, the processes behind transgenerational effects are not well understood [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208591.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208591.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Yet, transgenerational effects in clonal plants are important for forest management, reforestation programmes and nurseries, because many tree species (e.g. poplars, willows and many fruit trees) are reproduced vegetatively by means of cuttings or grafting.</p><p>Poplars (<italic>Populus</italic> sp.), member of the <italic>Salicaceae</italic>, have a wide distribution in the world and can easily be propagated vegetatively. The species therefore serves as an ideal model to study responses of asexually reproducing plants to climate change. <italic>Populus</italic> is a fast growing genus important for biomass production, and can produce 70&#x02013;105 tons of aboveground biomass per hectare after 10&#x02013;15 years [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The hybrid poplars are also planted widely in Europe for wood production, windbreaks and soil protection [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208591.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Here we set up a common garden experiment to assess bud phenology of cuttings collected from genets growing in different climatic environments (further referred to as: parent trees) and representing five different clones of <italic>Populus trichocarpa</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>P</italic>. <italic>deltoides</italic> and <italic>Populus trichocarpa</italic> (further referred to as: genotypes). Parent trees representing a single genotype were grown across a latitudinal gradient of &#x0003e;2100 kilometres (corresponding to a 4.9&#x000b0;C temperature difference and different photoperiods of up to 3.5 hours), and cuttings of these parent trees were then grown in the common garden. We hypothesize a transgenerational effect of temperature experienced by the parent trees on bud phenology of the vegetatively (by stem cuttings) produced offspring within genotypes. Furthermore, we investigated DNA methylation variation as a potential epigenetic mechanism for transgenerational effects (in this case, epigenetic variation in the generations of cuttings) using Methylation Sensitive Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (MSAP) analysis [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The aim of the molecular part of this study was to look for significant natural variation in genome-wide DNA methylation patterns within individuals plants of a single clone (genotype) and vegetatively propagated from parent trees with different histories (that is, grown in contrasting macroclimates across Europe), that lasted after growing for four years in a common environment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Description of the clones</title><p>Between the 1980s to 1990s cuttings of five hybrid poplar genotypes namely Beaupr&#x000e9;, Raspalje and Unal (all <italic>Populus trichocarpa</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>P</italic>. <italic>deltoides</italic>), Fritzy Pauley (<italic>P</italic>. <italic>trichocarpa)</italic>, and Trichobel (<italic>P</italic>. <italic>trichocarpa</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>P</italic>. <italic>trichocarpa</italic>) were produced from adult trees under the renowned poplar breeding programme at the Institute of Forest and Nature (INBO), Geraardsbergen in Belgium.

Previous studies in <italic>Populus</italic> sp. have shown that trees from more southern locations display earlier bud burst and shoot growth cessation later in the summer compared to trees from more northern origins [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208591.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208591.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In this study, the temperatures experienced by the parent trees in different regions across Europe likely altered the bud flush of the cuttings in the common garden. Although growing in a common environment, we found a correlation of earlier bud burst with warmer January, July and mean annual temperatures of the parent environment. This indicates that the parental environment may have played an important role in altering the timing of bud burst. Processes responsible for such transgenerational effects are not yet perfectly understood, but the most important processes are likely the nutrient conditions of the parent plant and epigenetic inheritance [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In Norway spruce, [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] found that an epigenetic memory mechanism affects the timing of bud burst phenology and the expression of bud burst related genes in genetically identical Norway spruce epitypes (an epigenetic alteration in a gene), allowing them to adapt rapidly to a changing environment. The temperature sum experienced by the developing embryo and photoperiod conditions during embryogenesis epigenetically shift the growth cycle of the embryos, giving rise to different epitypes from the same genotype [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Although the latter studies provide evidence for the stable inheritance of epigenetic marks under sexual reproduction, several studies also demonstrate the stable transmission of DNA methylation from parent to clonal offspring in asexually reproducing plant species [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208591.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Significant variability in DNA-methylation patterns as well as significant variation in bud phenology was found in Lombardy poplar, a clone of <italic>Populus nigra</italic> that is worldwide distributed since the 18th century [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. However, in this study using MSAP we did not find evidence for variation in genome-wide DNA methylation patterns within plants of the same genotype and propagated from parent trees with different environmental histories. It is possible that epigenetic variation was (at least partly) erased (e.g. by epigenetic resetting resulting in reduced polymorphisms in DNA methylation) at the time the leaves were collected for molecular analysis (after almost four years in the common environment and two years after the assessment of bud phenology). In addition, the environmental clone history of the parent trees might have been too short to shape strong differences in genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in response to the environmental history. More powerful molecular techniques, such as bisulphite high-throughput sequencing techniques[<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], are needed to further investigate the mechanisms behind the transgenerational effects observed in this study.</p><p>The programming to start spring growth is actually set during fall when the plant enters dormancy. In poplar, it is known that photosynthate amounts present in the stem and root in the late autumn can contribute substantially to growth and overwintering carbohydrate storage [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Increased growth likely influenced the bud burst time, which was suggested with our observation that taller cuttings (after one year of growth) burst buds earlier in the second growing season. Therefore, there was a possibility that the observed phenological changes were a result of developmental plasticity, which could also be considered as within-generational plasticity.</p><p>We did not observe any effect of day length on bud burst. Absent to low photoperiod-sensitivity to bud burst of two poplar species was also reported in [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. However, the photoperiod signal was known to have an influence in reducing the temperature sum requirement to bud burst in European beech [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. If we infer that the genotypes that were exposed to a warmer parental environment might require more accumulated heat for bud burst, then this means that bud burst of these genotypes will be delayed until reaching the sufficient heat sum [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Winter warming can influence the bud burst time via affecting the dormancy and the chilling requirement [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Advancing bud burst with winter warming, therefore suggests that chilling requirement was fulfilled earlier and temperature sum may have played important role in controlling the bud burst time [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].</p><p>We unexpectedly observed earlier bud set with warmer winter (January) and mean annual temperatures experienced by the parent trees, but the difference was observed only on one day during the second growing season. In general, the growth cessation in many temperate species was delayed with global warming and an extension of the growing season was observed [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208591.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Following the report of [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the change in bud phenology detected here might be influenced by origin (effect of tree provenance), parental environment (different geographic regions) and the offspring&#x02018;s environment.</p><p>Earlier bud set in our study was linked to earlier bud burst by allowing the plants an earlier start of dormancy for the chilling accumulation, which can be a trade-off between avoiding late frost damage and extending growing season. Earlier bud break translated into earlier bud set, which was also reported in <italic>Quercus robur</italic> L. and <italic>Fagus sylvatica</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Although, in poplar, a delayed bud set with warming was found by [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Equatorward transfer of a genotype, in general, shortens the period of active growth due to the reduction of the growing-season photoperiod, thereby advancing autumn growth cessation [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208591.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Temperature can also interact with the photoperiod to alter the photoperiodic signal to growth cessation in poplar [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208591.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Though, from the study of [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], we know that the growth cessation in many temperate species is not constrained by photoperiod. In our study, more likely the interactive effect of photoperiod and temperature had an additional influence on the earlier growth cessation [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The phenological changes in our study are probably not adaptive and might change over time. Adaptive plasticity is also dependent on the accuracy of the environmental cues, the degree of environmental heterogeneity and stable epigenetic marks at least within an individual&#x02019;s lifetime [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].</p><p>The shortening of the growing season in cuttings of which the parent trees experienced warmer mean annual temperatures was mostly due to the earlier bud set. In some species including poplar, photosynthesis and biomass growth can be sustained until leaf senescence [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], which plays an important role in winter dormancy and spring growth by providing sufficient resources and root growth. It is likely that the earlier bud set resulted in lower growth thereby providing limited resources for winter storage and subsequent spring growth. Higher January temperatures would then fail to promote growth&#x02014;even though the trees burst buds earlier&#x02014;with limited biomass storage. Unlike our findings, earlier studies reported an extended growing season despite earlier spring growth and leaf senescence [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. However, climate warming may have a positive effect on the length of the growing season as observed by many observational and climate manipulation experiments [<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208591.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208591.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0208591.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec019"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In sum, we show that a latitudinal transfer of poplar clones resulted in contrasting phenological responses to temperature. We further our understanding of the response of trees to climate change because we do show that the parental environment can influence the phenology of the cuttings. Together with other factors such as genetic variability, variable temperature sensitivity among species, the environmental condition of parent trees needs to be taken into account to better predict the response of trees to climate change. Nevertheless, the mechanism behind the shift of the timing of bud phenology remains complex and unclear, which provides the opportunity to further investigate the mechanism behind the phenological shift due to heterogenous parental environments and whether such phenological variation is adaptive.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0208591.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><p>The relationship between mean annual temperature (MAT) and bud burst score in the cuttings of four different clones on 2nd observation (83 days of the year-DOY) where a, b, c and d represents respectively for genotypes Unal, Raspalje, Fritzy Pauley and Trichobel.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0208591.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0208591.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>The relationship between number of days to bud burst in 2015 and the height of the seedlings during end of growing season in December 2014.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0208591.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0208591.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><p>Mean weighted (bootstrapped) slopes of the relationship between the mean bud burst score in 2015 and day lengths on 1 May (a) and 1 January (b) experienced by the parent trees.
