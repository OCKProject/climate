They may compete with native plant species or communities and alter ecosystem properties, which can affect ecological condition, posing challenges to resource managers. As part of the United States Environmental Protection Agency&#x02019;s National Wetland Condition Assessment (NWCA), we characterized the status of nonnative plants in wetlands across the conterminous United States (US). Our primary goals were to (1) document the composition of nonnative taxa at 1138 NWCA sites sampled in 2011 and (2) estimate the areal extent of wetland under stress from nonnative plants within the NWCA 2011 sampled population of ~&#x02009;25 million ha of wetland (represented by 967 sampled probability sites and the NWCA survey design). A total of 443 unique nonnative taxa were observed, encompassing a species pool adapted to diverse ecological conditions. For individual sites, the number of nonnative taxa ranged from 0 to 29, and total absolute cover of nonnatives ranged from 0 to 160%. We devised the nonnative plant indicator (NNPI) as a categorical indicator of stress (low to very high) from the collective set of nonnative plant taxa occurring at a particular location, based on a decision matrix of exceedance values for nonnative richness, relative frequency, and relative cover. Wetland area of the sampled population occurring in each NNPI category was estimated at the scale of the conterminous US and within five large ecoregions and four broad wetland types. Potential stress from nonnative plants, as indicated by the NNPI category, was low for approximately 61% (~&#x02009;15.3 million ha), moderate for about 20% (~&#x02009;5.2 million ha), high for about 10% (~&#x02009;2.48 million ha), and very high for about 9% (~&#x02009;2.2 million ha) of the wetland area in the entire sampled population. Percent of wetland area with high and very high NNPI varied by ecoregional subpopulations: greater within interior and western ecoregions (~&#x02009;29 to 87%) than within ecoregions in the eastern half of the nation (~&#x02009;11%). Among wetland type subpopulations, greater percent of wetland area with high and very high NNPI was observed for herbaceous vs. woody types and for inland vs. estuarine types. Estimates of wetland area by NNPI categories are expected to be useful to policy makers or resource managers for prioritizing management actions by identifying situations where stress from nonnative plants is most extensive. We also considered four exploratory analyses aimed at providing ecological information useful in interpreting NNPI extent results. We conducted three population-scale analyses examining ecoregional and wetland type population means for (1) the three NNPI metrics, (2) absolute cover of growth-habit groups of nonnative plants, and (3) metrics describing human-mediated disturbance. Finally, we examined ecological relationships with site-level NNPI status using a random forest (RF) analysis with NNPI as the response variable and predictor variables including ecoregion, wetland type, and a variety of characteristics describing natural vegetation structure, environment, and human-mediated disturbance.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1007/s10661-019-7317-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Nonnative plant indicator (NNPI)</kwd><kwd>Potential ecological stress</kwd><kwd>Nonnative richness</kwd><kwd>Nonnative relative cover</kwd><kwd>Nonnative relative frequency</kwd><kwd>National Wetland Condition Assessment (NWCA)</kwd><kwd>Conterminous United States</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Center for Environmental Research (NCER) STAR Program of the US EPA</institution></funding-source><award-id>#RD-83425201</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herlihy</surname><given-names>Alan T.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Nonnative plants are recognized as important indicators of stress to wetlands and other ecosystems (Mack and Kentula <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2010</xref>; Magee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2010</xref>; Schweiger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">2016</xref>). Their presence, richness, and abundance are often positively related to stressors of ecological condition caused by human-mediated disturbances (e.g., physical disturbances to vegetation or ground surface, changes in hydrology, nutrient inputs, changes in surrounding land use, and inadvertent introduction) (Lozon and MacIsaac <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">1997</xref>; Magee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">1999</xref>; Mack et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2000</xref>; Magee and Kentula <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2005</xref>; Aguiar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2007</xref>; Ringold et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2008</xref>; Jakubowski et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2014</xref>). Nonnative plants can also be direct stressors to ecological condition, altering native plant communities or ecosystem structure and processes (Vitousek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">1997</xref>; Dukes and Mooney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2004</xref>; Ehrenfeld <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2010</xref>; D&#x02019;Antonio and Flory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2017</xref>) and leading to losses of ecosystem services (Dukes and Mooney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2004</xref>; Hooper et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2005</xref>; Meyerson and Mooney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2007</xref>). Ecological impacts from nonnative species reflect changes to the biota, physical habitat, or processes of an ecosystem, with impact varying in type, direction, magnitude, and over space or time (Ricciardi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">2013</xref>). Reviews and meta-analysis from the literature indicate that nonnative plant species with potential for significant direct and indirect effects to the structure and function of ecosystems are common, and many of these taxa likely have yet to be recognized as harmful (Simberloff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2011</xref>; Vil&#x000e0; et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">2011</xref>). In addition, ecological impacts from nonnative species can occur at the levels of organism (e.g., fitness, mortality, growth), species population (e.g., abundance, genetics), plant community (e.g., species richness, species composition, structure), ecosystem (e.g., physical habitat, nutrient cycling), or region (Simberloff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2011</xref>; Vil&#x000e0; et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">2011</xref>; Ricciardi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">For example, nonnative plants have been linked to (1) increased risk of local extinction or population declines for many rare, native plant species (Randall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">1996</xref>; Lesica <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">1997</xref>; Seabloom et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">2006</xref>; Gilbert and Levine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2013</xref>); (2) changes in species composition and vegetation structure within and among plant community types, and homogenization of local and regional floras (McKinney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2004</xref>; Rooney et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2004</xref>; Magee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2008</xref>); (3) alteration of fire regimes (Dwire and Kauffman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2003</xref>; Brooks et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2004</xref>); (4) alteration of geomorphic and hydrologic processes (Rowantree <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">1991</xref>; Sala et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">1996</xref>; Gebauer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2016</xref>); and (5) alteration of carbon storage patterns (Farnsworth and Meyerson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2003</xref>; Bradley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2006</xref>), nutrient cycling, and soil biota including microbial and mycorrhizal interactions with plants (Belnap and Phillips <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2001</xref>; Ehrenfeld et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2001</xref>; Ehrenfeld <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2003</xref>; Bowen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2017</xref>). In addition, impact from nonnative plants to natural ecosystems may be exacerbated by ongoing global changes, with effects varying by region, ecosystem type, plant community type, and type of modification (e.g., climate, land use, and nutrient dynamics) (Dukes and Mooney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1999</xref>; Dwire et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2017</xref>; Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">As part of the 2011 National Wetland Condition Assessment (NWCA) (USEPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">2016c</xref>; Kentula and Paulsen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2019</xref>), conducted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and its partners, we devised the nonnative plant indicator (NNPI) as an indicator of ecological stress to wetlands (USEPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">2016d</xref>). The vegetation data collected during the 2011 NWCA provide an unprecedented opportunity for characterizing nonnative plants in wetlands across the conterminous United States (US). In addition, the field protocols (USEPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">2011a</xref>) and the probability design (Olsen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2019</xref>) underpinning the NWCA allow for detailed analyses across sampled sites, or, alternatively, for the expression of results as estimates of wetland area (i.e., extent estimates) within a sampled population, at national or regional scales (e.g., this paper, Lomnicky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2019</xref>; Magee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2019</xref>; Nahlik et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">Directly measuring impacts to ecological condition is often not possible because the tools to do so are lacking or are prohibitive in cost and time, especially for large-scale studies. Consequently, stressor indicators have been widely used in large-scale ecological assessments and are typically based on straightforward, easy-to-measure factors that reflect anthropogenic-driven properties related to declining ecological condition, but not necessarily implying direct or causal mechanisms for this decline (e.g., USEPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">2009</xref>; Mack and Kentula <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2010</xref>; Sifneos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">2010</xref>; USEPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">2016a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">d</xref>; Lomnicky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2019</xref>). Similarly, the NNPI is not intended as a direct measure of ecological impact from nonnative plants. Rather, it is a categorical indicator based on a decision matrix, which considers all nonnative plants occurring at a given location using values for three metrics (richness, relative frequency, and relative cover of nonnative plant taxa) that each reflect different pathways of potential ecological impact (USEPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">2016d</xref>). In this paper, we give an overview of the NNPI, including the rationale for (1) considering all nonnatives occurring at a sampled location, (2) the selection of the three NNPI metrics, and (3) the assignment of metric-specific exceedance values for designating four categories (low to very high) of potential stress (hereafter, stressor-level categories).</p><p id="Par6">Following the overview of the NNPI, the remainder of our paper focuses on the characterization of nonnative plant species in wetlands across the conterminous US using data from the 2011 NWCA. We, first, briefly characterize the study area by (1) defining the NWCA sampled population and reporting on estimated wetland area within ecoregional and wetland type subpopulations and (2) describing a variety of ecological attributes for each of these subpopulations. Second, we provide a summary of the individual nonnative species observed across sites sampled in 2011 to illustrate the scope of nonnative taxonomic diversity and abundance. Next, for the 2011 NWCA sampled population, we use the NNPI to estimate the area of wetland that falls into each of the NNPI stressor-level categories (low, moderate, high, very high) at the scale of the conterminous US and within major ecoregions and wetland types. Wetland area estimates within the different NNPI categories are expected to be useful to policy makers or resource managers in identifying situations where impact from nonnative plants is most extensive, and in informing and prioritizing management actions and future research. Finally, to aid in understanding the patterns described by the NNPI extent results, we also conduct and discuss a series of <italic>exploratory</italic> analyses. We consider how (1) the individual NNPI metrics, (2) growth-habit groups of nonnative plants, and (3) human-mediated disturbances might parallel population-scale ecoregional and wetland type patterns for NNPI extent results. We also explore how ecosystem and disturbance characteristics relate to site-scale NNPI stressor-level. These exploratory analyses help identify relationships that can be useful for hypothesis generation to inform future research.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Description of the nonnative plant indicator</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Rationale</title><p id="Par7">Stressor indicators for a large-scale study like the NWCA should be widely applicable across major ecoregions and wetland types. Nonnative plant species meet this criterion because they are not natural components in any ecosystem, are often associated with human-mediated disturbance, and, in many cases, are known to directly impact ecological condition. In addition, the identity and abundance of individual nonnative species or groups of nonnative plants can be readily described using species composition data that are commonly collected in field studies. Many nonnative taxa are known to be particularly invasive or associated with negative ecological impacts in a wide range of plant communities and environments (Randall et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2008</xref>; Magee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2010</xref>; Barney et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2013</xref>; Blackburn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2014</xref>). Rather than focusing only on those nonnative taxa currently documented as highly invasive or impactful, we chose an inclusive approach and based the NNPI on the entire complement of nonnative plants co-occurring at a given location. We did this to retain all useful signal in the nonnative plant data, because consideration of all nonnative species occurring together encompasses a variety of important ecological consequences.</p><p id="Par8">For example, the type and level of impact from nonnatives is often dependent on species traits of invaders, traits of the recipient plant community, and the environmental context (e.g., habitat, biome or region, level of human-mediated disturbance) being invaded (Richardson and Py&#x00161;ek <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2006</xref>; Py&#x00161;ek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2012</xref>; Ricciardi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">2013</xref>). Individual nonnative plant taxa characterized by rapid spread across the landscape or dominance where they occur, or that act as ecosystem engineers (i.e., influence resource availability by altering biotic or abiotic elements of ecosystems), are likely to cause more immediate disruption to ecological condition than infrequent, low cover, or recently naturalized taxa (Richardson and Py&#x00161;ek <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2006</xref>; Baiser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2008</xref>; Ehrenfeld <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2010</xref>; Ricciardi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">2013</xref>). However, the sheer numbers of individual infrequent or low cover nonnative species that occur in natural landscapes (e.g., Seabloom et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">2006</xref>; Py&#x00161;ek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2017</xref>) represent a likely invasion debt (i.e., a delay between introduction and extensive spread (Seabloom et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">2006</xref>; Bennett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2013</xref>; Beauvais et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2016</xref>)); that is, an undetermined subset of such nonnative taxa can be expected to undergo significant expansion in cover and distribution as they come into equilibrium with their introduced ranges, or as shifts in environmental conditions accompanying global change occur (Seabloom et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">2006</xref>; Bennett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2013</xref>). In addition, co-occurring multiple invaders can interact with one another and with native species via direct or indirect facilitative, neutral, or competitive pathways that may alter community composition and environmental conditions; potentially leading to nonnative accumulation or invasional meltdown, i.e., acceleration of nonnative establishment or ecological impact resulting in unrecoverable replacement of native communities (Simberloff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2006</xref>; Kuebbing et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2013</xref>; Kuebbing and Nu&#x000f1;ez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2016</xref>). Taken together, the varied and interactive ecological effects of nonnative plants make it difficult to predict which nonnative species are likely to have the greatest impact in specific environments or plant communities.</p><p id="Par9">In addition to incorporating all nonnative taxa co-occurring at a given location, we based the categorical NNPI on straightforward metrics that can be readily calculated from field observations to allow maximum applicability and ease of use. We selected three complementary metrics for use in the NNPI: (1) relative cover of nonnative species, (2) nonnative species richness, and (3) relative frequency of nonnative species. Formulas for their calculation are provided in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. All three metrics consider all nonnative species at a location and each metric describes different possible avenues to ecological stress. Relative nonnative cover (0 to 100%) reflects preemption of space and resources and is often associated with changes in plant community composition (species identity, richness, and abundance) and vegetation structure (horizontal or vertical), or with alteration of ecosystem processes (e.g., hydrology, nutrient cycling, fire regime). Greater nonnative richness (number of unique nonnative species) increases the risk that individual nonnative taxa are or may become invasive, or act as ecosystem engineers that negatively alter biotic or abiotic properties. Increasing relative nonnative frequency (0 to 100%) across a site reflects increasing numbers of foci from which nonnatives could compete with native species, expand in cover, or spread to new locations.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Nonnative plant species metrics used in the nonnative plant indicator (NNPI)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Metric name</th><th>Calculation<sup>a</sup></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Nonnative relative cover</td><td>(&#x02211; Absolute cover nonnative species<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>/&#x02211; Absolute cover all species<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>)&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;100; where for each unique species <italic>i</italic>: Absolute Cover&#x02009;=&#x02009;0&#x02013;100%</td></tr><tr><td>Nonnative richness</td><td>Number of unique nonnative species</td></tr><tr><td>Nonnative relative frequency</td><td>&#x02211; Frequency nonnative species<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>/&#x02211; Frequency all species<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>)&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;100; where for each unique species <italic>i</italic>: Frequency&#x02009;=&#x02009;0&#x02013;100%, calculated as the percent of Veg Plots in which it occurred.</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>Calculation of metrics based on data collected in the five 100-m<sup>2</sup> vegetation plots at each site (vegetation data collection described in the section &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">Plant data collection and trait assignment</xref>&#x0201d; under &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>&#x0201d;)</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p id="Par10">Relative frequency and relative cover of nonnatives at each site were selected as NNPI metrics, rather than absolute frequency and cover (i.e., the sum of frequencies or cover values across all individual nonnative species occurring at a location). Relative values normalize these two metrics to reflect the proportional influence of nonnatives within the varying vertical structure and species diversity represented by different vegetation types. For example, forested systems have more vertical layers than herbaceous systems (e.g., bottomland hardwood forest vs. seasonal wet prairie) and, therefore, greater total species cover. Likewise, some community types have greater species richness than others (e.g., mountain fen vs. <italic>Spartina alterniflora</italic> salt marsh) and, consequently, greater frequency of species occurrences at a site. In addition, some community types have varying amounts of nonvegetated area, such as bare ground or standing water, as part of their ecosystems. Thus, the same absolute (or total values) for nonnative cover or frequency could reflect very different proportions of the total vegetated component of the ecosystem under consideration.</p><p id="Par11">The NNPI metrics (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) were calculated using R code developed for the NWCA, and site values for each of the three metrics are included in the 2011 NWCA vegetation metric data (USEPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">2016m</xref>).

S:N is the ratio of variance in a metric across all sampled sites (signal) to the variance in the metric based on repeat sampling of individual sites (noise) (Kaufmann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">1999</xref>). Ninety-six probability sites, two per state, were identified in the survey design for repeat sampling during the field season (revisit sites) to gauge within sampling period data variability (noise). Metrics having S:N values greater than 2 are considered useful in making ecological distinctions (Stoddard et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">2008</xref>; Magee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2019</xref>).

This <italic>filter approach</italic> of using multiple metrics to designate the indicator status for individual sites was developed by Herlihy and others (e.g., Herlihy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2008</xref>; Herlihy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2019a</xref>), and we adapted this approach for the NNPI (USEPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">2016d</xref>). No established procedure existed to define boundaries for the stressor-level categories based on specific values of the NNPI metrics. Consequently, as a starting point, we defined exceedance values for the four stressor-level categories for each metric (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) using best professional judgment based on our broad experience with numerous wetland community types and our perceptions of change in plant community composition and structure accompanying varying levels of nonnative cover, frequency, or richness. Major changes in plant community composition and structure are also often associated with impact to other biota and ecosystem properties (e.g., see literature cited in the &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec1" ref-type="sec">Introduction</xref>&#x0201d; and the &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">Rationale</xref>&#x0201d; sections). Exceedance values for the four stressor-levels were assigned to reflect the strong potential influence of nonnative relative cover, with the values for nonnative richness and nonnative relative frequency set to reflect these two metrics as additional sources of ecological stress. We recognize that other researchers might select different exceedance values for the four stressor-level categories; nevertheless, the exceedance values assigned for the three NNPI metrics were received favorably by NWCA partners (wetland scientists and managers) during discussions at analysis workshops and during extensive peer review of the NWCA Technical Report (USEPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">2016d</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Stressor-level category exceedance thresholds for each of the three metrics informing the nonnative plant indicator (NNPI)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Stressor-level category*</th><th>Relative cover nonnative species</th><th>Richness nonnative species</th><th>Relative frequency nonnative species</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Low</td><td>&#x02264;&#x02009;1</td><td>&#x02264;&#x02009;5</td><td>&#x02264;&#x02009;10</td></tr><tr><td>Moderate</td><td>&#x0003e;&#x02009;1&#x02013;15</td><td>&#x0003e;&#x02009;5&#x02013;10</td><td>&#x0003e;&#x02009;10&#x02013;30</td></tr><tr><td>High</td><td>&#x0003e;&#x02009;15&#x02013;40</td><td>&#x0003e;&#x02009;10&#x02013;15</td><td>&#x0003e;&#x02009;30&#x02013;60</td></tr><tr><td>Very high</td><td>&#x0003e;&#x02009;40</td><td>&#x0003e;&#x02009;15</td><td>&#x0003e;&#x02009;60</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*Exceedance of a threshold value for a particular stressor-level category for any of the three component metrics moves the NNPI to the next higher stress level</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p id="Par13">As an example of how the exceedance values for the nonnative metrics (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) are utilized, consider two hypothetical sites. <italic>Hypothetical site 1</italic> has nonnative relative cover of 7%, placing the site in the moderate stressor-level category. However, this site also has nonnative richness of 14 species and relative frequency of 32%, which reflect the high stressor-level for both metrics; thus, the site would be assigned to the high NNPI category. Even though relative nonnative cover is not extensive at this hypothetical site, the number of individual nonnative species and their frequency of occurrence might indicate shifting community composition and strong risk for expansion of nonnative cover. Next, consider <italic>hypothetical site 2</italic> with 80% nonnative relative cover that places the site in the very high stressor-level category, nonnative richness of 1 indicating the low stressor-level category, and nonnative relative frequency of 59% that indicates high stressor-level.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2019</xref>). Sites were identified using a spatially balanced generalized random tessellation stratified design for an area resource (Stevens Jr. and Olsen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2004</xref>) and the US Fish &#x00026; Wildlife Service&#x02019;s National Wetland Status and Trends digital sample frame for wetlands (Dahl and Bergeson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2009</xref>; Dahl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2011</xref>). The target wetland population for the NWCA encompassed tidal and nontidal systems, across the conterminous US, that had rooted vegetation and, when present, open water less than 1&#x000a0;m deep (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Each selected sample point (i.e., coordinates of site location) received a weight reflecting the wetland area within the target population represented by that point (Olsen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2019</xref>). Sample weights for probability sites were used to (1) estimate wetland area with particular characteristics across the nation, regionally, or by wetland type; and (2) to calculate population-weighted means for specific vegetation attributes and environmental metrics (Diaz-Ramos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1996</xref>). Area estimates and population means are calculated with known margins of error (two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI)) based on a local neighborhood variance estimate (Stevens Jr. and Olsen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">2003</xref>). Site selection, weight assignment, wetland area estimation, and calculation of population-weighted means for specific metrics were completed using R statistical software (R_Core_Team <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2017</xref>) and the &#x02018;spsurvey&#x02019; R contributed package (Kincaid and Olsen Jr. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2015</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Definition of NWCA target population and description of the NWCA aggregated wetland types used in analysis</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2">Target population</th><th>NWCA aggregated wetland type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="4">Wetlands across conterminous US representing tidal and nontidal systems with rooted vegetation and, <italic>when present, open water &#x02264;&#x02009;1&#x000a0;m deep</italic></td><td rowspan="2">Estuarine intertidal</td><td>EH&#x02014;estuarine intertidal herbaceous</td><td>Estuarine or intertidal emergent wetlands</td></tr><tr><td>EW&#x02014;estuarine intertidal woody</td><td>Estuarine or intertidal shrub and forested wetlands</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Inland</td><td>PRLH&#x02014;palustrine, riverine, and lacustrine herbaceous</td><td>Emergent, ponded, or previously farmed wetlands in palustrine, shallow riverine, or shallow lacustrine littoral settings</td></tr><tr><td>PRLW&#x02014;palustrine, riverine, and lacustrine woody</td><td>Forest- or shrub-dominated wetlands in palustrine, shallow riverine, or shallow lacustrine littoral settings</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par15">The inference (or sampled) population for the NWCA was described by 967 probability sites that were identified in the survey design and sampled in 2011 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).

We used data from all 1138 sampled sites (probability + other sites) to maximize sample sizes for two site-scale analyses: (1) summarizing the occurrence and abundance of all individual nonnative species observed and (2) examining site-scale relationships of ecological predictors to NNPI stressor-level categories.

Each field crew included a two-member vegetation team, at least one of whom had strong expertise in the flora of the state or region where the crew worked. Plant species data were collected during the peak growing season (determined regionally as the time period when most plants were in flower or fruit) to optimize species identification and characterization of species abundance. At each site, plant data were gathered from five 100-m<sup>2</sup> Vegetation (Veg) Plots that were systematically placed within a typically circular, 0.5&#x000a0;ha assessment area (AA).

Attributes of native vegetation included native species richness (number of unique native species) and the absolute percent cover for native plants by growth habit (forb, graminoid, shrub, tree, and vine). Absolute cover was used to represent the area at each sampled site influenced by each growth-habit group. A wetland index (WI) based on species composition was calculated for each site. The WI is a cover-weighted wetland affinity score based on all plant species observed at a site: the sum of the numeric value (1 to 5) representing wetland indicator status (OBL to UPL) for each species weighted by its absolute cover, divided by the sum of absolute cover values for all observed species (Wentworth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">1988</xref>).

Nonnative trees and shrubs were combined into one group because many individual nonnative woody species occur in both shrub and tree growth habits, and because mean cover values for nonnatives classed only as shrubs were often small. For the growth-habit metrics, we examined absolute percent cover, rather than relative cover, to distinguish the spatial area influenced by each growth-habit group at each sampled site. Differences in population-weighted means between different variables were characterized based on nonoverlapping 95% CIs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Characterization of human-mediated disturbance</title><p id="Par26">We evaluated population-weighted means (&#x000b1;&#x02009;95% CI), calculated using the observed values at the 967 probability sites and the site sample weights, for three attributes of human-mediated disturbance for ecoregions and wetland types. Indicators of human-mediated disturbance included a site-scale index and two landscape metrics (percent agricultural and percent developed land use). The site-level disturbance index summarizes the overall human-mediated disturbance observed on-the-ground at each site at the date of sampling, and was based on combination of eight indices, which describe several disturbance types defined in USEPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">2016d</xref>). These eight disturbance indices were derived from approximately 85 disturbance descriptors that were evaluated at each sampled site within the AA and its associated 100-m radius buffer. Five of these indices summarized categories of physical disturbances (agriculture, residential/urban, industrial, hydrologic, and habitat modifications) in the AA and buffer area, two described the level of hydrologic alterations in the AA (USEPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">2016d</xref>), and one described heavy metal concentrations in the soil of the AA (Nahlik et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2019</xref>). Data for these eight indices are available in USEPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">2016f</xref>). To create the overall site-level disturbance index, we standardized values for each specific disturbance index across all sampled sites to a 0 to 10 continuous scale using the formula: ((observed value&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;minimum)/(maximum&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;minimum)&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10), then summed these scores and multiplied this total by 10/8 to obtain an overall site-level disturbance index value with a possible range from 0 to 100. Percent agricultural and developed land use coverages (within a 1000-m radius surrounding the AA center) were based on the 2006 National Land Cover Database (Fry et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2011</xref>) and are available from the NWCA land use data set (USEPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">2016g</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Ecological relationships to site-level NNPI status</title><p id="Par27">Random forest classification (RF) analysis (Liaw and Wiener <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2002</xref>; Liaw and Wiener <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2015</xref>) was used (1) to determine if the vegetation, environmental, and human-mediated disturbance metrics described in the previous sections, along with ecoregion and wetland type, might usefully predict NNPI stressor-level category; and (2) to examine the relative importance of each predictor variable in the resulting model. Complex ecological processes often involve multiple interactions and nonlinear relationships among variables, and RF analysis performs well with data that reflect these properties (De&#x02019;ath and Fabricius <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2000</xref>; Cutler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2007</xref>; Fox et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2017</xref>). RF reduces model variance and increases prediction accuracy by building numerous decisions trees from bootstrap samples of a data set and averaging the predictions made by each tree in the forest (Cutler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2007</xref>; Fox et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2017</xref>). In addition, RF is robust to the inclusion of variables with low importance (Fox et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2017</xref>), and variable importance is distributed across all the predictor variables in RF models, preventing elimination of ecologically important predictors of the response that might be correlated with other predictors (Cutler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2007</xref>; Fox et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2017</xref>). We constructed our RF model for predicting NNPI status using the R computing language (R_Core_Team <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2017</xref>) and the &#x02018;randomForest&#x02019; package ver. 4.6-12 (Liaw and Wiener <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2015</xref>) with the following options: (1) number of trees used to build the model (ntree) set to 1000 and (2) number of variables randomly selected at each tree node (mtry) set to the package default mtry&#x02009;=&#x02009;<inline-formula id="IEq1"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Thus, the response for the RF classification is the categorization of all NWCA sampled wetland sites (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1138, probability + other sites) as having either low&#x02013;moderate or high&#x02013;very high NNPI stressor-level. We elected to use these combined stressor levels because some wetland type or ecoregion subpopulations had comparatively few sampled sites with high or very high NNPI. Also, preliminary RF analysis results showed greater percent correct classification of sites for the two-combined vs. four separate NNPI stressor-levels. Because the response data were unbalanced, with 72% of sampled sites having LM (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;824) and 28% of sampled sites with high&#x02013;very high (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;314) NNPI status, we used a downsampling approach recommended by Fox et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2017</xref>) to improve predictive accuracy of the minority class. Each tree in the forest was built by drawing a bootstrap sample with the same number of cases from the low&#x02013;moderate and high&#x02013;very high categories based on the size of the minority class (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;314 sites).</p><p id="Par29">Procedures included in &#x02018;randomForest&#x02019; were used to assess model performance based on correct classification of the response for each site (Liaw and Wiener <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2015</xref>), in our case, low&#x02013;moderate vs. high&#x02013;very high stressor-level.

Measures of model performance computed using these OOB predictions are essentially cross-validated accuracy estimates (Cutler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2007</xref>; Fox et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2017</xref>). Here, we consider the following performance measures: percent of all sites (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1138) correctly classified, percent of high&#x02013;very high NNPI sites correctly classified, and percent of low&#x02013;moderate NNPI sites correctly classified.</p><p id="Par30">To determine which predictors were most important in identifying when the NNPI was likely to be high&#x02013;very high, variable importance was calculated as mean decrease in accuracy, and the results were plotted to show relative importance of the variables (using the &#x02018;varImpPlot&#x02019; function in the &#x02018;randomForest&#x02019; package, Liaw and Wiener <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2015</xref>). Mean decrease in accuracy is a permutation measure of variable importance calculated using only OOB data, and higher values indicate greater importance of a predictor variable to the classification (Cutler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2007</xref>).

Second, the complement of individual nonnative plant taxa observed across sites sampled in 2011 is described to illustrate the scope of nonnative taxonomic diversity and abundance. Next, we estimate the wetland area in the 2011 NWCA sampled population that falls into each of the four NNPI stressor-levels across the conterminous US and within major ecoregions and wetland types. To aid in understanding the patterns described by the NNPI extent results, we conduct a series of four <italic>exploratory</italic> analyses. We evaluate how population-scale means for (1) the three individual NNPI metrics, (2) growth-habit groups of nonnative plants, and (3) human-mediated disturbances might parallel NNPI stressor-level extent results. The final exploratory analysis uses RF classification to examine relationships of potentially interacting ecological attributes and disturbance characteristics to site-level NNPI status.</p><p id="Par32">Most of the analyses presented in this paper are based on the 967 probability sites and use sample weights to reflect population-scale patterns (see &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>&#x0201d; for details). All figures and tables reporting population-scale results include 95% CIs. Differences in wetland area, or in metric or attribute means, are recognized based on nonoverlapping CIs (USEPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">2016c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">d</xref>). Although nonoverlapping CIs provide quantification of the level of confidence in the difference for a certain comparison, they do not necessarily equate to significant difference because multiple individual comparisons are considered in these analyses. Note, confidence intervals will tend to be larger where sample sizes are smaller (USEPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">2016c</xref>).</p><p id="Par33">For the characterization of the complement of individual nonnative taxa observed in 2011 and the exploratory RF analysis, sample weights were not used because these analyses considered all sampled sites (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1138), rather than only probability sites. Thus, results for these two analyses reflect the specific sites sampled and should not be extrapolated to the entire NWCA sampled population.</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Characterization of the 2011 NWCA sampled population</title><p id="Par34">The wetland area of the 2011 NWCA target population across the conterminous US was estimated at approximately 38 million ha; however, approximately one third of this area was represented by sites selected by the design, but not sampled due to denial of access by land owners, inaccessibility, or safety constraints (Olsen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2019</xref>). Consequently, the NWCA sampled population, characterized by the 967 sampled probability sites, encompassed a subset of the NWCA target population area and represents approximately 25 million ha of wetland (USEPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">2016d</xref>). In the sampled population, both area and wetland types are unequally distributed across the five major ecoregions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Supplement <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> (S2)&#x02014;Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">A</xref>, and Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). This unequal distribution of wetland area and types was driven, in part, by the survey design, which accounted for the spatial distribution of wetlands across the US, and in part, because access issues precluded sampling some sites identified in the survey design (Olsen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2019</xref>). As a result, the percent of the NWCA target population area accounted for in the sampled population was less in some ecoregions (Xeric West, Western Mountains and Valleys) and some wetland types (EW&#x02014;estuarine woody, PRLH&#x02014;inland herbaceous) than others (Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). Nonetheless, the scale of the overall sampled population and subpopulations, represented by the probability-based 2011 NWCA data set, is unique in areal extent and proportion of the wetland resource described with ecological data.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Estimated wetland area in millions of hectares by wetland type within ecoregions for the National Wetland Condition Assessment sampled population.

Native vegetation structure varied most strongly by wetland type. For example, mean native forb cover was about 20 to 25% in inland wetland types, but only about 5% in estuarine wetland types. In contrast, mean native graminoid cover was greater in herbaceous (EH&#x02009;~&#x02009;75%, PRLH&#x02009;~&#x02009;38%) than woody (EW&#x02009;~&#x02009;28%, PRLW&#x02009;~&#x02009;16%) systems.

Means for native vine cover were generally low, but vines were most prominent in inland woody wetland (PRLW&#x02009;~&#x02009;11%) and in the Coastal Plains (~&#x02009;13%). The distribution of native species cover by growth-habit groups is likely to influence the trait requirements of nonnative species most adapted to invading different plant community types (Weihe and Neely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">1997</xref>; Brewer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2011</xref>; Py&#x00161;ek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2012</xref>).</p><p id="Par37">Not surprisingly, the largest differences in environmental conditions (Table <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>) were observed across ecoregional subpopulations.

Among wetland types, the WI indicated the PRLW had on average somewhat drier conditions compared to other types. Mean annual precipitation was greatest in the Coastal Plains (~&#x02009;135&#x000a0;cm), intermediate in the Eastern Mountains and Upper Midwest (~&#x02009;86&#x000a0;cm) and the Western Mountains and Valleys (~&#x02009;77&#x000a0;cm), somewhat less in the Interior Plains (~&#x02009;67&#x000a0;cm), and least in the Xeric West (~&#x02009;25&#x000a0;cm). WI and annual precipitation means may reflect general differences in available moisture that could facilitate or hinder some nonnative taxa over in situ native taxa, depending on the moisture regimes to which individual nonnative species are adapted (e.g., Magee and Kentula <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2005</xref>; Dwire et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2006</xref>).

Wetlands with more exposed bareground (i.e., lacking vegetation or vegetative litter), whether from natural processes or from human-mediated disturbance, could provide microsites for establishment of nonnative species (e.g., Quinn and Holt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2008</xref>). Mean elevation increased from east to west across the country, beginning in the Coastal Plains at 26&#x000a0;m and ranging to 1953&#x000a0;m in the Western Mountains and Valleys. Elevation represents gradients of temperature, moisture, and growing season length that can be expected to influence establishment or competitive ability of natives and nonnatives and select for nonnatives adapted to specific conditions (e.g., Averett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Characterization of the complement of observed nonnative plant taxa</title><p id="Par38">Across the 1138 sites sampled in the 2011 NWCA, 443 unique nonnative plant taxa were detected (see Supplement <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>&#x02014;Ordered table of nonnative plants) and represented 12% of the total number (3640) of taxa observed (USEPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">2016d</xref>). Based on occurrences at the 2011 sampled sites, 80 of the observed nonnative taxa were found in three or more of the five NWCA ecoregions (see Supplement <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

About 68% of the inland woody (PRLW) wetland area had low NNPI, while about 11% of the area for this type fell in the high or very high categories. Estuarine woody (EW) wetland had the smallest percent area with high or very high NNPI; nearly all of its area was characterized as having low (87%) or moderate (12%) NNPI. In contrast, about 24% of the estuarine herbaceous (EH) wetland area fell into high or very high NNPI categories. Inland herbaceous (PRLH) wetland was the type most influenced by nonnative plants based on the extent estimates, with 43% of the area distributed between high and very high NNPI.</p><p id="Par42">Nearly 90% of the wetland area in the eastern ecoregions (Coastal Plains and the Eastern Mountains and Upper Midwest) had low or moderate NNPI stressor-levels (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). In interpreting these results, it is important to note that the greatest area of PRLW wetland in the sampled population was found in these two eastern ecoregions, and all of the EW and most of the EH wetland occurred in the Coastal Plains (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These three wetland types each had large percent area with low or moderate NNPI (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b) and, thus, contributed strongly to the prevalence of lower NNPI stressor-levels observed in the Coastal Plains and the Eastern Mountains and Upper Midwest (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Although the NNPI stressor-level was low for these two regions in 2011, this could change over time in response to the complement of specific taxa that are present in the regional nonnative species pool (e.g., see Supplement <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and the <xref rid="Sec21" ref-type="sec">&#x0201c;Population means for absolute cover of nonnative growth-habit groups</xref>&#x0201d; section under &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec19" ref-type="sec">Exploratory analyses</xref>&#x0201d;).</p><p id="Par43">The percent area with high and very high NNPI was much greater in three western ecoregions (Interior Plains, Xeric West, and the Western Mountains and Valleys) than in the eastern ecoregions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a).

Greater percent area in the higher stressor-levels for these ecoregions is likely related to greater percent area of PRLH wetlands compared to the Coastal Plains and the Eastern Mountains and Upper Midwest (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), because the inland herbaceous type had the largest percent area with high and very high NNPI (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b).</p><p id="Par44">The sampled subpopulations for the Xeric West and the Western Mountains and Valleys represent about one half (52%) and one fourth (24%) of the target population area in these two regions, respectively (Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>).

Thus, greater mean richness of nonnative species in the western ecoregions vs. eastern ecoregions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a), or in inland herbaceous (PRLH) vs. other wetland types (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d), suggests these subpopulations may be most vulnerable to the risk that one (or more) of the nonnatives present is or will become invasive or an ecosystem engineer. In contrast, lower mean nonnative richness in estuarine wetlands than in inland wetlands (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d) likely relates, in part, to the pool of nonnative taxa able to establish or spread in estuarine wetlands being limited to those adapted to brackish or saline conditions. Nevertheless, salt-tolerant nonnative ecosystem engineers with wide ecologic amplitude pose ongoing threats to estuarine systems. For example, <italic>Phragmites australis</italic> (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. occurred at 108 NWCA sampled sites (Supplement <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), 78 of which were estuarine sites. Although this species has a native component (<italic>Phragmites australis</italic> (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. ssp. <italic>americanus</italic> Saltonst., P.M. Peterson &#x00026; Soreng), the aggressive nonnative subspecies (<italic>Phragmites australis</italic> (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. ssp. <italic>australis</italic>) now dominates many inland and coastal marshes in the eastern US and has been increasingly observed in western locations (Chambers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1999</xref>; Saltonstall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">2002</xref>; Allen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2017a</xref>). <italic>P. australis</italic> ssp. <italic>australis</italic> has the capacity to alter plant community composition and structure and ecosystem function (Silliman and Bertness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">2004</xref>; Meyerson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2010a</xref>; Uddin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">2017</xref>). In addition, the nonnative subspecies has been shown to hybridize with the native subspecies (Meyerson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2010b</xref>; Saltonstall et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par49">In the Xeric West and Interior Plains ecoregions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b) and for herbaceous wetland types (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e), greater mean nonnative relative frequency may represent greater average numbers of nonnative foci per site for these subpopulations. More frequent occurrences of nonnatives can provide more locations from which nonnative taxa might disperse or expand across sites. In addition, higher values for relative frequency of nonnatives at a site could, in some circumstances, reflect increased potential for neighbor-to-neighbor competition between natives and nonnatives, possibly resulting in the reduced resiliency of the native plant community (e.g., Kuebbing and Nu&#x000f1;ez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2016</xref>). High abundance or biomass of nonnative plants results in major changes in community composition and structure, which, in turn, often leads to alteration of ecosystem processes (e.g., Denslow and Hughes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2004</xref>; Hejda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2009</xref>; Ehrenfeld <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2010</xref>). Thus, the greater mean nonnative relative cover observed in 2011 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c) for wetlands of three western ecoregions compared to that observed in the two eastern ecoregions could reflect, on average, greater overall impact from nonnative plants in the western ecoregions. Given observed mean cover values, this is likely to be especially true for the Xeric West and Interior Plains regions. Further, although the mean nonnative relative cover in wetlands in the Western Mountains and Valleys was considerably less than for those in the Xeric West or Interior Plains (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c), similar mean nonnative richness (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a) suggests that wetlands in the Western Mountains and Valleys ecoregion may be at risk for increases in nonnative abundance. For example, some currently low cover nonnative species might transition from a lag phase (delayed or slow spread) to an expansion phase (rapid spread) of invasion (e.g., Simberloff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2011</xref>; Antunes and Schamp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Population means for absolute cover of nonnative growth-habit groups</title><p id="Par50">Plant growth habit (e.g., graminoid, forb, vine, tree/shrub) is often related to other functional traits such as relative growth rate, height, or biomass (Lavorel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2007</xref>), so the growth-habit type of nonnative plants can differentially influence their success in diverse ecosystems and environments (e.g., Herron et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2007</xref>; Tecco et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">2010</xref>; Giorgis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2016</xref>). Across the individual probability sites (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;967) sampled in the 2011 NWCA, there was a wide range in absolute cover values for nonnative forbs (0&#x02013;98%), graminoids (0&#x02013;101%), shrub/trees (0&#x02013;81%), and vines (0&#x02013;34%). However, we wondered if the abundance of growth habits for nonnatives might vary at the scale of wetland populations. Thus, our second exploratory analysis was aimed at examining whether certain growth-habit types of nonnative taxa tended to be more abundant than others in different NWCA subpopulations.</p><p id="Par51">We calculated population-weighted means (&#x000b1;&#x02009;95% CI), for nonnative absolute cover by four growth-habit groups for the five ecoregions and four wetland types (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, S2-Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">C</xref>). Across ecoregions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a), the greatest nonnative cover was observed for the forb (means ranging from ~&#x02009;2 to 13%) and graminoid (means ranging from ~&#x02009;4 to 10%) groups. Nonnative absolute cover in the Western Mountains and Valleys was dominated by graminoids (mean&#x02009;~&#x02009;10%). Although CIs were overlapping in the other four ecoregions, nonnative forbs tended to have greater mean cover than nonnative graminoids in the Interior Plains and Xeric West, whereas the reverse was true in the Coastal Plains and in the Eastern Mountains and Upper Midwest. Forbs and graminoids also made up most of the nonnative cover in the inland and estuarine herbaceous wetland types (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b), with mean nonnative cover of forbs and graminoids about equal (~&#x02009;10%) in the PRLH, and graminoids the most abundant nonnative growth-habit group (~&#x02009;18%) in the EH. In contrast, the nonnative vine and tree/shrub groups had low mean cover (&#x0003c;&#x02009;1 to about 3.5%) across all subpopulations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a, b<bold>)</bold>. Mean nonnative vine cover was greatest in the Coastal Plains (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a) but still represented only a small amount of the nonnative plant cover for wetlands in this region. The greatest values for mean nonnative tree/shrub cover were observed in the Coastal Plains (~&#x02009;1.5%) and Xeric West (~&#x02009;4%) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a) and in inland woody wetlands (PRLW&#x02009;~&#x02009;1.4%) <bold>(</bold>Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). Based on these results, the population-scale means for absolute cover indicate that in 2011, on average, graminoid and forb nonnative taxa had more extensively invaded wetlands across the five ecoregions of the sampled population than taxa in the vine or tree/shrub groups, especially for herbaceous wetland types.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Population-weighted mean and 95% CI for the nonnative absolute percent cover in four growth-habit groups (forbs, graminoids, vines, and trees and shrubs) by ecoregion (<bold>a</bold>) and wetland type (<bold>b</bold>).

Forb species that are tall and capable of forming populations with cover greater than the dominant native species, for example, have been shown to negatively impact plant communities (e.g., Hejda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2009</xref>). Nonnative grasses are particularly successful because of their capacity to colonize, persist, dominate vegetation, and transform environments with impacts on ecosystem processes, resource availability, and local disturbance regimes (Martina and von Ende <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2013</xref>; Gebauer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2016</xref>; Linder et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2018</xref>). Canopy cover from trees and shrubs likely limits the establishment of shade-intolerant nonnative forbs and graminoids in woody wetlands. However, shade-tolerant nonnative taxa of all growth forms are often competitive in forested settings, and many have detrimental long-term impacts (Martin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2009</xref>). Consequently, even though the mean absolute cover for nonnative forbs and graminoids in woody wetlands in the NWCA population was low in 2011, going forward, shade-tolerant nonnative forbs and graminoids may pose greater threat as they come into equilibrium with their potential introduced ranges. For instance, in the 2011 NWCA, the shade-tolerant annual grass, <italic>Microstegium vimineum</italic> (Trin.) A. Camus, was found at 20 sampled sites with a mean importance of 35 at sites of occurrence (Supplement <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). <italic>M. vimineum</italic> forms dense monocultures and alters nitrogen cycling (DeMeester and Richter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2010</xref>) and soil microbial communities (Kourtev et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2002</xref>; North and Torzilli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2017</xref>), and its greatest negative community-level effects occur in shady forested settings (Brewer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2011</xref>; Brewer and Bailey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par53">Although mean absolute cover of nonnative vines (including lianas and species transitional between vines and shrubs) was low across the NWCA sampled population (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), it was greatest in the Coastal Plains and in inland herbaceous wetlands (PRLH), and wetlands in these subpopulations may be at increased risk for expansions of nonnative vine cover in the future. A diverse set of 24 nonnative vine species was observed in the Coastal Plain sites sampled in 2011; many of these vine taxa are strong invaders (see Supplement <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, * next to PLANTS Symbol). Invasive vines can usurp space, overtop other vegetation, alter availability of light and nutrients, change habitat to facilitate other invasive taxa, and alter fire regimes (e.g., <italic>Lonicera japonica</italic> Thunb. (GISD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2018</xref>) and <italic>Lygodium japonicum</italic> (Thunb.) Sw. (CABI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2018b</xref>)). In 2011, <italic>Lonicera japonica</italic> occurred at 41 NWCA sampled sites (35 in the Coastal Plains) and <italic>Lygodium japonicum</italic> was found at 10 sites (all&#x000a0;in the Coastal Plains) (Supplement <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). In addition to the 24 vine taxa primarily observed in the Coastal Plains in 2011, other vine species were found across sampled sites in one or multiple ecoregions, and many of these were also recognized as invasive (Supplement <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). For example, <italic>Solanum dulcamara</italic> L. was found in 46 sampled sites across all five ecoregions and <italic>Rubus armeniacus</italic> Focke was observed only at 4 sites in the Western Mountains&#x000a0;and Valleys; however, both are highly invasive and readily overtop native vegetation (Waggy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">2009</xref>; CABI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2018c</xref>).</p><p id="Par54">Mean absolute cover values for the nonnative tree/shrub group tended to be low; however, inland woody systems had greater mean nonnative cover for this growth-habit group than other wetland types (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). The Coastal Plains and the Eastern Mountains and Upper Midwest ecoregions had the greatest prevalence and percent of woody wetland area (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), and across all 2011 NWCA sites sampled for these two ecoregions, 43 nonnative taxa in the tree/shrub growth-habit group were observed, with 9 of these taxa detected in both regions, and all 43 are recognized as invasive, noxious, weedy, and/or known invaders of natural areas (Supplement <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Thus, it will be important to watch for changes over time in the amount of woody wetland area with high or very high NNPI. Due to tall stature, canopy structure, and longevity, nonnative trees and shrubs are often ecosystem engineers that can alter overall plant community structure and composition, nutrient inputs, soil biota, and light regimes (Reinhart et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2006</xref>). As a result, nonnative trees and shrubs may have potential for increased expansion in cover and impact over time in both herbaceous and woody systems, as lag times related to height growth and reproductive age are overcome (e.g., Martin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2009</xref>). Nonnative tree or shrub species with wide ecologic amplitude could have potential impacts on a variety of wetland types. For instance, the introduced tree <italic>Triadica sebifera</italic> (L.) Small thrives in fresh to saltwater and in sunny to shady conditions, displaces native plant species, forms monotypic stands, and alters nutrient cycles (GISD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2015</xref>), and&#x000a0;it was observed in the Coastal Plains ecoregion at 41 NWCA sampled sites encompassing all four NWCA wetland types. Among ecoregions, the Xeric West had the highest population mean for absolute nonnative tree/shrub cover (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a), and this result likely reflects occurrences of <italic>Tamarix chinensis</italic> Lour. and <italic>Elaeagnus angustifolia</italic> L., which were the two most commonly observed species in this growth habit for sampled sites in this ecoregion (Supplement <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Both species are aggressive invaders and ecosystem engineers of riparian wetlands, altering successional trajectories as well as soil and hydrologic conditions (Lindgren et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2010</xref>; CABI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2018a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Characterization of human-mediated disturbance in the sampled population</title><p id="Par55">Although not all nonnative plant species require disturbance to invade natural plant communities, human-mediated disturbances (either at the site level or in the surrounding landscape) are often linked to increased levels of invasion by nonnative plant species (e.g., Alpert et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2000</xref>; Silliman and Bertness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">2004</xref>; Ehrenfeld <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2008</xref>; Ringold et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2008</xref>; Brewer and Bailey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2014</xref>; Herlihy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2019b</xref>).

This is most evident for site-level disturbance and percent surrounding agriculture, where the three ecoregions (Interior Plains, Xeric West, and Western Mountains and Valleys) with high means for these two disturbance metrics also have the greatest percent area with high and very high NNPI status (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In the Interior Plains, the high mean percent surrounding agriculture for wetlands may result in (1) propagule and colonization pressure from nonnative taxa associated with agricultural settings, (2) changes in wetland nutrient dynamics or influx of contaminants through fertilizer or pesticide run-off, and (3) changes in hydrology due to farming practices (e.g., tiling, irrigation run-off, or direct water extraction), all processes that can enhance the success of nonnative taxa. Overall site-level disturbance observed in 2011 was greatest for wetlands in the Xeric West and the Western Mountains and Valleys (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a). Key elements of the site-level disturbance for these two regions are reflected in related NWCA work for the combined wetland area of the Xeric West and the Western Mountains and Valleys subpopulations, where approximately 61, 70, and 75% of this area were estimated to have high stressor-levels for vegetation removal (e.g., grazing, mowing), soil hardening (e.g., animal trampling, trails, impervious surfaces), and ditching, respectively (USEPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">2016c</xref>). These three physical stressors are likely to alter ecosystem properties (e.g., hydrology, vegetation structure, resource availability) and facilitate spread and establishment (e.g., via grazing animals, trail or road corridors, water transport of propagules) of nonnatives. Among the wetland type subpopulations, inland herbaceous wetland (PRL), in addition to having the greatest percent area in high or very high NNPI status (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), also exhibited the greatest means for both site-level disturbance and percent agriculture (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>d, e).</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Ecological relationships with site-level NNPI status</title><p id="Par58">In our final exploratory analysis, we shifted from the population-scale to a site-scale focus to evaluate which ecological attributes might be most strongly associated with site-level NNPI status.

The wetland index (WI) had the greatest variable importance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), with the likelihood of a site having high&#x02013;very high NNPI status increasing with larger WI values (S3-Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">A</xref>). Higher WI reflects lower abundance of obligate (OBL) or facultative wetland (FACW) indicator species and typically drier conditions (Wentworth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">1988</xref>). Among the 443 nonnative taxa observed across the 1138 sampled sites (Supplement <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), only 105 taxa had OBL or FACW indicator status. More than 75% of the observed nonnative taxa were facultative (FAC, no. of taxa&#x02009;=&#x02009;88), facultative upland (FACU, no. of taxa&#x02009;=&#x02009;117), or upland (UPL, no. of taxa&#x02009;=&#x02009;116) indicators, suggesting that many of these nonnative taxa might be more prevalent at drier wetland sites. In addition, mean annual precipitation was the fourth most important predictor of NNPI status (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), with probability of high&#x02013;very high NNPI status greatest for sites where annual precipitation was less than 50&#x000a0;cm (S3-Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">D</xref>).</p><p id="Par62">Elevation and percent bareground, the two other environmental metrics evaluated, were among the weaker predictors in the suite of ecological attributes included in the RF, with variable importance at the 12th and 14th positions, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). However, elevation greater than about 2500&#x000a0;m was associated with lower probability of having high&#x02013;very high NNPI than lower elevations (S3-Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">L</xref>). The 23 sampled sites with elevations greater that 2500&#x000a0;m were distributed in mountains across Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah. Higher elevations often are related to more extreme environments and to greater distance from nonnative propagule sources which could limit nonnative establishment; however, the growth form of invading nonnatives can differentially influence invasibility at higher elevations (Giorgis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2016</xref>). Sites with less than about 25% bareground had much lower probability of having high&#x02013;very high NNPI than sites with more bareground (S3-Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">N</xref>), suggesting that in some situations greater amounts of available bareground may represent unexploited habitat for nonnatives (e.g., Quinn and Holt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2008</xref>).</p><p id="Par63">Native vegetation structure is an ecosystem property that can influence the influx of nonnative plants (see discussion in the &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">Characterization of the 2011 NWCA sampled population</xref>&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec21" ref-type="sec">Population means for absolute cover of nonnative growth-habit groups</xref>&#x0201d; sections). This was reflected in absolute cover of native trees and native graminoids having the second and third highest variable importance in the RF analysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). The probability of high&#x02013;very high NNPI was greatest when there was no tree cover, decreased steadily as native tree cover increased from 0 to about 60%, then dropped precipitously until native tree cover exceeded 100%, where the probability of high&#x02013;very high was lowest (S3-Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">B</xref>). Greater cover of native trees can limit establishment and abundance of many shade-intolerant nonnatives. However, shade-tolerant nonnatives, including invasive shrubs, trees, graminoids, and vines, did occur in forest-dominated locations (Supplement <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), and, over time, these taxa might be expected to expand both their site-level cover and regional occurrence. Considering native graminoid cover alone (S3-Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">C</xref>), the likelihood of having high&#x02013;very high NNPI was least where native graminoids were abundant (e.g., 75 to 200% absolute cover), but increased more or less linearly as graminoid cover dropped from 75 to 0%. Greater native graminoid cover can contribute to exclusion of some nonnatives through competition and physical barriers where sod or thatch are formed.</p><p id="Par64">Native absolute shrub and forb cover were the fifth and ninth most important predictors (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), with the probability of having high&#x02013;very high NNPI steadily increasing as native cover declined, beginning from about 50% cover for native shrubs (S3-Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">E</xref>) and at about 100% for forbs (S3-Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">I</xref>). Native shrubs may limit shade-intolerant nonnatives. Native vine cover was 13th in variable importance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), and the partial dependence plot did not indicate a clear response of NNPI to native vine cover alone (S3-Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">M</xref>), possibly because native vine absolute cover tended to be low except in the Coastal Plains ecoregion (Table <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>). In our RF model, native species richness was the seventh most important predictor (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), with its partial dependence plot <bold>(</bold>S3-Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">G</xref><bold>)</bold> showing a complex pattern in relation to the probability of occurrence of high&#x02013;very high NNPI stressor-level, which was greatest when native richness was low (e.g., about 15 or fewer species), least when native richness ranged from about 20 to 70 species, and intermediate when native richness was greater.</p><p id="Par65">Human-mediated disturbance was related to increased probability of high&#x02013;very high NNPI status. The disturbance metrics included in the RF analysis varied in importance. Percent agriculture in the 1000&#x000a0;m surrounding a site was the sixth most important predictor in the RF (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), but among the three disturbance metrics, it had the strongest relationship to increasing likelihood of high&#x02013;very high NNPI. The site-level disturbance index and the percent developed land in the 1000&#x000a0;m surrounding a site were the tenth&#x000a0;and 15th most important predictor variables in the RF model, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Nevertheless, the partial dependence plots show marked increase in probability of occurrence of high&#x02013;very high NNPI with increasing values for all three of the disturbance metrics (percent agriculture, S3-Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">F</xref>; site-level disturbance, S3-Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">J</xref>; percent developed land, S3-Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">O</xref>), suggesting that increases in any of these disturbance measures are likely to be associated with greater stress from nonnatives.</p><p id="Par66">This exploratory RF analysis effectively classified site-level NNPI status; so, the relative importance of predicator variables in this exploratory model is likely to be a useful starting point in informing monitoring or management efforts. For example, for a given ecological setting, NNPI status and site-level values for specific predictor variables might suggest possible pathways of risk for increasing impact from nonnative plants or management actions that could potentially aid in reducing nonnative success.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Summary and next steps</title><p id="Par67">As part of the 2011 NWCA, this study is unique in scope. It characterizes the status of nonnative plants in wetlands for a sampled population representing approximately 25 million ha of wetland and allows results to be viewed at a variety of scales, e.g., nationally, or for major ecoregional and wetland type subpopulations. To provide an ecological context for our work, we described the sampled population in terms of (1) estimated area by wetland type within ecoregions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) and (2) population-weighted means for a variety of ecological attributes describing natural vegetation structure and environmental characteristics by ecoregion and wetland type (Table <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>). We used several approaches to evaluate nonnative plants in wetlands. First, we characterized the complement of nonnative plant species observed during the 2011 NWCA. The 443 nonnative plant taxa observed across NWCA sampled sites (Supplement <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) reflected a species pool adapted to many ecological conditions, thus providing diverse opportunities for continued invasion and potential impact to wetlands and other ecosystems.</p><p id="Par68">Next, we considered potential impact from nonnative species, as indicated by the NNPI, by examining the extent of the 2011 NWCA sampled population (percent area and hectares of wetland) that fell into the four NNPI stressor-level categories (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Results at the scale of the conterminous US indicated nearly 20% of wetland area in the sampled population had high to very high NNPI. However, ecological stress from nonnatives varied markedly by ecoregion and wetland type. The extent patterns for NNPI stressor-levels observed at the national scale were driven by the large wetland area in the eastern ecoregions (the Coastal Plains and the Eastern Mountains and Upper Midwest) where nearly 90% of the wetland area was estimated to have low to moderate NNPI, which likely relates to the prevalence of woody wetland types in these two regions. Woody wetland types had greater percent area in lower NNPI stressor-level categories than herbaceous wetland types across the NWCA sampled population. In contrast, although the overall wetland area was much smaller in the western ecoregions (Interior Plains, Xeric West, and the Western Mountains and Valleys) than in eastern ecoregions, a much greater percent of the wetland area in the western regions had high to very high NNPI (ranging from about 27 to 87%). This pattern is related, at least in part, to the greater proportion of the wetland area in inland herbaceous types in the western ecoregions.</p><p id="Par69">We also conducted a series of exploratory analyses that provide ecological information that aids in interpreting patterns described by the NNPI extent results. Three population-scale analyses examined ecoregional and wetland type population means for (1) the three NNPI metrics (nonnative richness, relative frequency, and relative cover, Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), (2) absolute cover for four growth-habit groups of nonnative plants (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), and (3) three metrics describing human-mediated disturbance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Results from these three analyses highlight some potential avenues of impact from nonnative plants, which vary ecoregionally and by wetland type and could suggest associations with the 2011 observed patterns for NNPI or suggest risks for future incursions of nonnatives. In addition, qualitative comparisons of the NNPI results with results of population-scale exploratory analyses suggested interactions between NNPI stressor-levels and ecoregion, wetland type, natural vegetation attributes, environmental characteristics, and human-mediated disturbance. Consequently, we examined ecological relationships with site-level NNPI status using a RF analysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, Supplement <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>) and NNPI as the response variable with predictor variables including ecoregion, wetland type, and a variety of characteristics describing natural vegetation structure, environment, and human-mediated disturbance. This exploratory RF correctly classified site-level NNPI for a combined high&#x02013;very high class 77% of the time; thus, the relative importance of variables in this exploratory model may be useful in informing future research or monitoring efforts.</p><p id="Par70">Examination of the NNPI patterns and the ecological relationships indicated by the exploratory analyses can help inform national or regional management and conservation priorities for wetlands, or suggest research questions that would support management needs. Moving forward, as additional data are collected in future NWCA assessments, changes over time in the NNPI stressor-levels can be used to assess whether impact from nonnative plants in wetlands is increasing. The second iteration of the NWCA was implemented in the field during the summer of 2016, with an expanded survey design to allow more complete representation of the wetland area across the conterminous US, particularly for the western part of the country (Olsen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2019</xref>). As the 2016 data are considered, it will be possible to evaluate changes in wetland area within NNPI stressor-levels between 2011 and 2016. Finally, the results for the NNPI from the 2011 and 2016 assessments are likely to suggest a variety of specific questions that might be addressed in future research using NWCA data (USEPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">2016e</xref>). For example, modeling approaches (e.g., Seabloom et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">2006</xref>; Thuiller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">2006</xref>; Schweiger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">2016</xref>; Hill et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2017</xref>) might be used to elucidate ecological correlates or mechanisms associated with stress from nonnative plants, or to predict and map locations with low or high stress from nonnatives at varying geographic scales.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec25"><p>
