It is unknown if the range expansion has a genetic and/or epigenetic basis, or merely an environmental basis due to a warming climate. To test these possibilities, we used an RNAseq approach with a common greenhouse design to examine gene expression in individuals from the northern edge and central portion of alligator weed range from China to determine if there were differences in their responses to cold temperatures. We hypothesized that if the recent range expansion was primarily environmental, we would observe few differences or only differences unrelated to low-temperature adaptations. We assembled over 75,000 genes of which over 65,000 had long open reading frames with similarity to sequences from arabidopsis. Differences in expression between northern and southern populations that were both exposed to low temperatures showed similar expression among genes in the C-REPEAT/DRE BINDING FACTOR (CBF) regulon. However, gene set and sub-network enrichment analysis indicated differences in the response of photosynthetic processes and oxidative stress responses were different between the two populations and we relate these differences to cold adaptation. The transcriptome differences in response to cold between the individuals from the two populations is consistent with adaptations potentiating or resulting from selection after expansion into colder environments and may indicate that genetic changes have accompanied the recent northward expansion of <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> in China. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of epigenetic changes may have a role in this expansion.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>invasive plant</kwd><kwd><italic>Alternanthera philoxeroides</italic></kwd><kwd>local adaptation</kwd><kwd>cold hardiness</kwd><kwd>RNA sequencing</kwd><kwd>range expansion</kwd><kwd>North China</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="61"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Biological invasions are becoming a major global environmental and economic problem (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Cohen and Carlton, 1998</xref>), and intentional or unintentional human activities have increasingly resulted in the introduction of invasive species far outside their native or naturalized range. The fact that invasive species are introduced to new areas that differ from their native range provide a valuable insights into how ecological and evolutionary processes are influenced under novel environmental conditions (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Sax et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Lachmuth et al., 2010</xref>). Understanding the mechanisms driving successful adaptation and invasion in novel environments is a key issue in ecology, evolution, and conservation biology (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Vandepitte et al., 2014</xref>). Physiological and phenotypic plasticity, evolution, and admixtures have all been linked to local adaptation resulting in range expansion and invasiveness (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bock et al., 2014</xref>). Next-generation sequencing is an ideal tool for examining adaptive responses and genetic differences resulting in range expansion and is uniquely suited for non-model species (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Prentis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Stapley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Ekblom and Galindo, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Puzey and Vallejo-Marin, 2014</xref>). However, sequence evidence of adaptation during the invasion process is currently scant for most invasive plants due to the lack of genomic resources in weedy species (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Stewart et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Vandepitte et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Recently, the invasive plant, <italic>Alternanthera philoxeroides</italic> (alligator weed), has recently expanded it range northward by nearly 5&#x000b0; of latitude beyond what was its predicted range in China (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). This expansion occurred despite evidence that <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> in China has limited genetic variation(<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, this observation offers an opportunity to look for genetic and/or epigenetic factors associated with this recent northward range expansion.</p><p><italic>Alternanthera philoxeroides</italic> weed (<italic>A. philoxeroides</italic>) belongs to family Amaranthaceae (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Mabberley, 1997</xref>), order Caryophyllales, subclass Caryophyllidae (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Cronquist, 1988</xref>), and it is an invasive semi-aquatic weed (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Julien and Bourne, 1988</xref>). It originated in the Parana River region of South America (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Maddox, 1968</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Vogt et al., 1979</xref>), and was spread to the other areas of South America, North America, Asia, Australia and some adjacent island countries (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Julien et al., 1995</xref>). It is a very difficult to manage invasive weed, and in all cases <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> has become invasive in its introduced habitats (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Julien et al., 1995</xref>). This weed grows in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats and can also invade farm lands. Its stems are hollow, buoyant, and its floating mats can expand over surfaces of all types of waterways making them difficult to navigate, clogging drainage canals and waterways, reducing water flow (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Buckingham, 2002</xref>), and disrupting economies (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Holm et al., 1997</xref>). <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> is a polyploid species with a genome size that varies on the ploidy level between 2 and 6 n (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Telesnicki et al., 2011</xref>). Yet, despite its world-wide invasiveness, less than 100 genes have been sequenced and made public<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn01">1</xref></sup>.</p><p><italic>Alternanthera philoxeroides</italic> was introduced to China mainland in 1940 by the Japanese in Shanghai (N31.4, E121.5) (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Diao, 1990</xref>), and cultivated widely as a forage in southern China in the 1950&#x02013;60s. It subsequently escaped cultivation and currently inflicts serious damage to agriculture (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Yin, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Huang, 2002</xref>), causing annual losses of 600 million Chinese Yuan Renminbi (equivalent to 98 million US dollars) (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Li and Xie, 2002</xref>). This weed is on the first shortlist of the invasive species requiring special control in China (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">State Environmental Protection Administration of China and Chinese Academy of Sciences, 2003</xref>). A recent survey indicated that <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> has now invaded the Xiaqing River in Jinan (N36.6, E117.1), 500 km north of the Shanghai in northern China (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). This invasion is more extensive than the 32&#x000b0; north latitude northern range limit predicted for <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> in China (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Julien et al., 1995</xref>). It is unknown if the recent ability of this weed to survive winters in this northern region is due to selection for genes that have increased the cold hardiness of this species, or if the range expansion was due primarily to a warming climate.</p><p>Increased cold hardiness can result from either avoidance mechanisms such as production of underground propagules or repression of ice nucleation and crystal growth, or from resistance mechanisms such as changes in expression of genes involved in altering membrane lipid saturation, resistance to oxidative stress by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production through reduced photosynthesis from unadapted thylakoid membranes, or induction of free radical scavenging enzymes such as APX1, SOD1, NPX1, etc. (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Gusta and Wisniewski, 2013</xref>). Many cold tolerant plant species can cold acclimate in response to chilling temperatures (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Gusta and Wisniewski, 2013</xref>). Induction of these protective responses are orchestrated through several cold-responsive &#x02018;regulons&#x02019; (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Fowler and Thomashow, 2002</xref>). Specific transcription factors such as the C-REPEAT/DRE BINDING FACTOR (CBF) family of transcription factors and the transcription factor RESPONSIVE TO HIGH LIGHT 41 (ZAT12) are often induced upon exposure to chilling temperatures (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Thomashow, 2010</xref>). These in turn alter the expression of downstream genes required for modifying the cellular physiology to withstand cold. Such co-regulated clusters of genes and their regulators are often referred to as regulons. The best characterized is the CBF2 regulon which can work with or without integrating information from hormones such as abscisic acid (ABA). Another regulon associated with and augmented by subset of cold responses is controlled by the ABSCISIC ACID RESPONSIVE ELEMENTS-BINDING FACTOR (ABRE) family of transcription factors (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Shinozaki and Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, 2007</xref>). Both the CBF and ABRE regulons are responsive to, and provides feedback to transcription factors that control circadian responses in plants (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Cao et al., 2005</xref>). Likewise, ZAT12 regulates a smaller but still important set of genes (including <italic>CBF2</italic>) (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Vogel et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>ZAT12</italic> is also regulated by circadian genes and in particular blue light signals through CYR1 and CRY2 (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Kilian et al., 2007</xref>). ZAT12 has been specifically linked to responses involved in high light stress responses (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Davletova et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Many of the studies described above utilized microarray analysis for gene expression resulting from cold treatments. However, the reduced cost of next generation sequencing has made it possible to combine transcriptomics analysis with gene sequencing and discovery in non-model systems such as wild invasive weeds. Indeed, recent studies on cold stress in tea (<italic>Camellia sinensis</italic>) (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2013</xref>), and <italic>Chrysanthemum nankingense</italic> (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Ren et al., 2014</xref>) highlight the power of this new technology for identifying cold-responsive genes. Because such studies produce large numbers of gene sequences, they also provide a source of gene sequences from non-model plants suitable for phylogenetic analyses (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Puzey and Vallejo-Marin, 2014</xref>). Additionally, such sequence databases provide a rich source of genetic markers including potential simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).</p><p>Here we examine the differences in cold-responsive gene expression in <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> between three individuals each from two populations, one from the northern edge of its range in Jinan, North China and the other from the central portion of its range in Shanghai, South China. If the recent range expansion was primarily environmental, we would expect few differences in gene expression between cold-treated plants from the northern and central populations, or only differences unrelated to low-temperature adaptations. We test this hypothesis by looking for differences in transcriptome responses indicative with a response to cold using a common garden experimental design. Thus, any such differences, if observed, would be attributed to genetic and/or epigenetic differences between the individuals from the two populations. Additionally, we expected to develop a database of expressed sequences tags (ESTs) for <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> and eventually identify polymorphisms that have potential as genetic markers for more cold-adapted populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant Material</title><p>50&#x02013;60 individual wild <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> plants were collected in November 2013 from local rivers of Jinan and Shanghai. Jinan, the provincial capital of Shandong, is located in North China in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, the second longest river in China. The average annual temperature in Jinan is 14.7&#x000b0;C with an average of -0.4&#x000b0;C in January and 27.5&#x000b0;C in July. The average annual rainfall is 672.7 mm.

The average annual temperature in Shanghai is 16.6&#x000b0;C with an average of 4.7&#x000b0;C in January and 28.0&#x000b0;C in July. The average annual rainfall is 1184.4 mm.

Plants were allowed to grow in the greenhouse with night and day temperatures of 16&#x02013;31&#x000b0;C, respectively, under natural light condition and photoperiod for 4 weeks prior to treatment. Plants were first subjected to 2 day of interim temperatures (11&#x02013;19&#x000b0;C night/day) in a non-temperature controlled greenhouse with natural light condition and photoperiod in the Jan 2014, and then moved to an unheated open-air concrete building and subjected to 2 weeks of cold temperatures (daytime 6&#x02013;13 C, nighttime 4&#x02013;9 C) with natural lighting supplemented during the day with incandescent lighting to increase ambient light intensity within the building. Three representative individual <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> plants were selected from each location, and the top 2nd and 3rd leaf pairs were excised between 10:00 am&#x02013;12:00 am and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for future RNA extraction and sequencing library construction.</p></sec><sec><title>RNAseq Library Construction and Sequencing</title><p>A total amount of 3 &#x003bc;g RNA per sample was used as input material for the RNA sample preparations. Sequencing libraries were generated using NEBNextUltra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, United States) following manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations and index codes were added to attribute sequences to each sample. Briefly, mRNA was purified from total RNA using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads. Fragmentation was carried out using divalent cations under elevated temperature in NEBNext First Strand Synthesis Reaction Buffer (5X). First strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primer and M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase RNaseH-. Second strand cDNA synthesis was subsequently performed using DNA polymerase I and RNase H. Remaining overhangs were converted into blunt ends via exonuclease/polymerase activities. After adenylation of 3&#x02019; ends of DNA fragments, NEBNext Adaptor with hairpin loop structure were ligated to prepare for hybridization. In order to select cDNA fragments of preferentially 150&#x0223c;200 bp in length, the library fragments were purified with AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter, Beverly, United States). Then 3 &#x003bc;l USER Enzyme (NEB, United States) was used with size-selected, adaptor-ligated cDNA at 37&#x000b0;C for 15 min followed by 5 min at 95&#x000b0;C before PCR.

The trimming parameters were: quality scores greater than 20 with a minimum trimmed read length of 70 bases.

We identified 330,642 transcripts with reading frames over 90 amino acids in length in the combined 745,348 contigs assembly. These 330,642 transcripts represented about 75,000 genes. Of these, 58,000 were also assembled from both population-specific sequences as determined by aligning the resulting assembled contigs using BlastN of. Overlap between the different the contig assembles can be visualized in the Venn diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Of the 75,000 open reading frame-containing transcripts, 64,000 had BlastX hits (E &#x0003c; 10<sup>-5</sup>) to the arabidopsis TAIR10 database. These blast hits were used for the primary functional annotation of the transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). BlastX against the non-redundant database was performed for differentially expressed transcripts and genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">Supplementary Tables S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S3</xref>) as well as from a random set of 4000 open reading frame-containing contigs. Of the 5,429 differentially-expressed transcripts for which a source organism was identified by BlastX against the non-redundant database, 4241(77%) had the top hit corresponding to a known plant gene, 267 had a top hit corresponding to an animal gene (247 of which were to arthropods), 11 were likely bacterial genes, 6 were from plasmodium 3 from protists, and 1 from fungi. If the gene list was trimmed to include only those transcripts that had expression values greater than 10 transcripts per million (TPM) in all three biological replicates of either of the two treatments (populations), over 99% of the differentially accumulating transcripts with species information were annotated as plant genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">Supplementary Tables S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S3</xref>). Far fewer non-plant hits with only 2% of non-plant origin (data not shown) were observed in a random set of 1000 open-reading-frame-containing transcripts with hits to the non-redundant database than from the differentially expressed set.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Venn diagram showing the numbers of uniquely assembled contigs in each of the three assemblies and the number of contigs which were assembled in more than one assembly process.

Of the significantly differentially expressed sequences, 46% of the contigs and 33% of the genes were more highly expressed in the northern populations in response to cold temperatures. We also examined the differential expression using separate assemblies from either the northern or central populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). When fragments were mapped to the assembly constructed only from sequences derived from the central population, we observed 4,566 differentially expressed genes with only 66 genes also identified as being differentially expressed when the transcripts were mapped to the combined assembly. Likewise, 7,318 genes were differentially expressed when transcripts were mapped to the northern population assembly of which 1,653 were also significantly differentially expressed in the combined assembly. Of the 66 genes common to the mapping to both the central population assembly and the combined assembly, only 18 were found to be differentially expressed when mapped to all three assemblies. Among the differentially expressed sequences, approximately 251 transcripts and 12 genes encoded putative transcription factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Gene Set Enrichment Analysis</title><p>Gene set enrichment analysis (GESA) was used to identify over-represented terms from the AraCyc (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">M&#x000fc;ller et al., 2003</xref>) and GO (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Ashburner et al., 2000</xref>) ontologies for those genes with arabidopsis homologues and with expression values greater than 10 TPM in all three biological replicates from either treatment group.

One population from Jinan in northern China and appear to have gained the ability to flourish in a more northern climates previously uninhabitable by this weed. The other individuals were from a central population near Shanghai in the center of its established range. The goals of these experiments were to develop a sequence database of genes from <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic>, and to determine if these two populations differ in their transcriptomic response to cold temperature treatments. The cold treatments did not appear to result in obvious physical differences between the two populations, but transcriptome differences were detected between the tested individuals from the two populations. Further studies are needed to determine if either population is better able to survive and reproduce in the more northerly latitudes. However, differences in gene expression were observed between the individuals from these two populations and the changes in gene expression are consistent with cold resistance mechanisms. These observations are most consistent with the hypothesis that the northward expansion of <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> into Northern China is not simply the result of global warming, but is likely due to evolution of adaptations to colder environments.</p><p>We identified over 75,000 genes with long open reading frames of which &#x0003e;85% were significantly similar to known arabidopsis genes. BlastX searches against the non-redundant database of the differentially expressed transcripts (5,429) indicated that &#x0223c;25% might result from contamination of the samples from other organisms (mostly arthropods). A search of the literature suggests that most RNAseq assemblies contain about 1&#x02013;3% non-plant sequences, although one study in rubber tree (<italic>Heveabrasiliensis</italic>) indicated that 17% of the assembled transcripts were from non-plant sources (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Mantello et al., 2014</xref>). However, the percentage of non-plant genes identified from differentially expressed contigs, as was done in our case, is likely to be over-represented. Low abundance genes such as those likely coming from contaminating organisms such as insects, bacteria and fungi, are more likely to be classified as differentially expressed (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Trapnell et al., 2013</xref>). This possibility is supported by an assessment of non-plant transcripts from a random sample of 1000 open-reading-frame-containing transcripts with hits to the non-redundant database from the combined assembly in which only 2% were suspected as coming from non-plant sources. Regardless, our results provide a rich set of gene sequences from this invasive weed which could be used as source for SSR or SNP markers for further population genetic analyses.</p><p>Although a majority of the genes from the combined assembly were represented in assemblies generated from the individual populations, there were clearly unique contigs that were assembled from a single population. Some of these are likely to be poorly represented sequences, perhaps from contaminating DNA from non-<italic>Alternanthera philoxeroides</italic> sources or from otherwise low abundant sequences. This hypothesis is bolstered by the fact that, of the 1978 contigs from the complete assembly that were represented only in the assembly of the central population, only 128 had expression levels &#x0003e;10 TMP in all biological replicates of either treatment group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Surprisingly, 258 of these 1978 transcripts were classified as differentially expressed with 4 transcripts expressed at &#x0003e;10 TPM in all three biological replicates from the northern population. The later observation suggests that even though these genes were not assembled in the northern population assembly, a modest number of RNAseq reads from the northern samples still mapped to the assembled contigs. This observation underscores the potential problem of false positives resulting from differential mapping rather than true differential expression when comparing gene expression among two different accessions.</p></sec><sec><title>Differential Expression Suggests Genetic Changes Provide Enhanced Cold Tolerance of Individuals From Northern Populations</title><p>Because of the observed high number of differentially expressed non-plant transcripts we limited further GSEA and SNEA to a subset of genes with &#x0003e;10 TPM and which has reliable BlastX hits to known arabidopsis genes. A large number of genes were identified as differentially expressed (<italic>q</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.05) between the central and northern populations in response to the cold treatment. The most notable differences were involved in photosynthesis, which appear repressed in the tested individuals from northern populations. This observation is supported from both an examination of the most differentially expressed genes and from the gene set and sub-network enrichment analyses. One of the primary causes of damage due to chilling stress is the production of oxidative radicals produced when the electron transport chain is disrupted by altered membrane fluidity that prevent proper association of the proteins involved in the electron transport in the chloroplast stroma (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Wise, 1995</xref>). One mechanism through which plants survive cold treatments is by modifying or repressing the photosynthetic apparatus under chilling conditions. In another study, two isogenic lines of wheat in which a single point mutation resulted in reduced cold tolerance (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Wells et al., 1969</xref>) were used in a transcriptomics analysis analogous to our study on <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Sutton et al., 2009</xref>). A comparison of the GSEA results from differences between the two lines following cold treatment also implicated altered photosynthesis as potentially underlying the differences in cold tolerance (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Karki et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In our study, very little evidence points to alterations in the CBF regulon between the northern and central populations. Neither &#x0201c;neighbors of CBF&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;response to cold&#x0201d; were indicated as over-represented ontologies by SNEA or GSEA. Likewise, no known targets of CBF were indicated as significantly differentially expressed &#x02013; despite the presence of putative sequences of targets (such as a <italic>COR47</italic>-like gene) among the contigs and genes that were assembled. However, we observed up-regulation of other cold-responsive regulons in the northern population. Genes such as a <italic>COR27</italic>-like and <italic>RAV1</italic>-like that in arabidopsis are modulated through circadian clock and ABA signaling (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">deMontaigu et al., 2010</xref>) were found to be significantly up-regulated in northern populations. This observation is consistent with alterations in upstream genes involved in responses that integrate ABA and circadian signaling required for non-CBF-regulated cold-induced gene expression in the northern populations.</p><p>In addition to non-CBF regulated cold inducible circadian-responsive genes, GSEA identified numerous genes in biotic defense responses, such as salicylic acid and flavonoid biosynthesis, as up-regulated in the northern population. These processes have been associated with growth inhibition in Arabidopsis and other plants (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Besseau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Rivas-San Vicente and Plasencia, 2011</xref>We have changed &#x0201c;Rivas-San Vicente and Plasencia, 2001&#x0201d; as &#x0201c;Rivas-San Vicente and Plasencia, 2011&#x0201d; inside the text as per the reference list. Kindly confirm if this is fine.). Conversely, processes linked to photosynthesis and growth such as cellulose biosynthesis, photosynthesis - light reaction, and fatty acid biosynthesis were over-represented among genes preferentially expressed in the tested central population individuals. As noted above, photosynthesis during cold treatment is associated with production of damaging oxidative radicals (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Wise, 1995</xref>). Likewise, continued growth in the presence of oxidative radicals could result in increased damage to DNA (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Cadet et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, although no obvious CBF regulon modification are indicated, a potentially protective down-regulation in photosynthetic activity and an increase in pathways that are protective to reactive oxygen species are observed in the northern population individuals but not the central population individuals.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have demonstrated there are differences in gene expression associated with response to cold treatments between tested individuals from populations of <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> in the central portion of its range in South China and individuals from a population in North China which has recently expanded its range northward. These results are most consistent with the development and/or selection of genetic and/or epigenetic differences that enhance the cold-tolerance of the northern populations. Further work using a population genetics approach will be needed to determine if the differences observed in these individuals is representative of the whole population, and to identify loci associated with these differences. However, the differences we observed in gene expression point towards alteration in the cold-responsive regulon controlling circadian/ABA signaling rather than alterations in the CBF regulon. Importantly, our results also provide the first large-scale database resource of <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> gene and transcript sequences. Such sequences should serve as a rich source for markers needed to examine the population genetics of a species that has proven invasive on at least three continents.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>LD, LP, and LW performed the experiments and collected samples.
