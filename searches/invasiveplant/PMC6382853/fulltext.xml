In order to examine the temporal and spatial dynamics of past invasion, and to predict future invasion, we developed a broad array of species distribution models (SDMs). In particular, we constructed sequential SDMs throughout the invasion history and asked how well those predicted future invasion (1970 to present). We showed that invasion occurred from a restricted set of environments in the native range to a diverse set in the invaded range. Spatial autocorrelation analyses indicated that rapid range expansion was facilitated by stochastic, long-distance dispersal events. Regardless of SDM approach, all SDMs built using datasets from early in the invasion (1970&#x02013;2010) performed poorly and failed to predict most of the current invaded range. Together, these results suggest that climate is unlikely to have influenced early stages of range expansion. SDMs that incorporated data from the most recent sampling (2011&#x02013;2017) performed considerably better, predicted high suitability in regions that have recently become invaded, and identified mean annual temperature as a key factor limiting northward range expansion. Under future climates, models predicted both further northward range expansion and significantly increased suitability across large portions of the U.S. Overall, our results indicate significant challenges for SDMs of invasive species far from climate equilibrium. However, our models based on recent data make more robust predictions for northward range expansion of <italic>A. palmeri</italic> with climate change.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Environmental and Natural Resources Trust Fund via the Minnesota Invasive Terrestrial Plants and Pests Center at the University of Minnesota</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Invasive species are marked by rapid range expansion and dramatic population growth that negatively affects communities and ecosystems outside of their historical range<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.

For invasive species, SDMs can be a useful tool for identifying potential habitat requirements and environmental limitations of future range expansion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Further, the models provide testable hypotheses that can be evaluated with field experiments and long-term observation of population dynamics. However, because invasive species often violate key assumptions of SDMs, we do not fully understand the extent to which they are reliable for predicting potential invasive species&#x02019; range expansion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In this study, we leveraged detailed historical records for the rapid invasion of Palmer amaranth (<italic>Amaranthus palmeri</italic>) to assess if and how SDMs predict the explosive range expansion during the invasion process. Because <italic>A. palmeri</italic> is among the most problematic emerging threats to natural (e.g. prairies, grasslands) and agricultural ecosystems in the United States, accurate SDMs may be particularly valuable for preventing and mitigating future invasion.</p><p id="Par3">Developing SDMs for invasive species can be considerably more challenging than for native species. SDMs operate under the assumption that a species is at equilibrium with the environment and that there are not large areas that are suitable but unoccupied; however, invasive species are, by definition, not at equilibrium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. SDM methods have been adapted to ameliorate some of the inherent problems of invasive species modelling but these methods can have differing effects on invasion projections and interpretation. For example, because environments (and correlations among environmental variables) may differ outside of the range compared to inside, modelers may retain more environmental variables to capture this variation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In addition, it is unclear whether models built using invaders&#x02019; native ranges improve or hinder predictions of future range expansion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Developing SDMs for invasive species can be especially problematic in cases where adaptation and/or admixture influence niche breadth over the course of invasion history<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In these cases, the genetic composition of populations, and thus the environmental factors that determine reproductive success, may differ between the native and invaded ranges. As a result, both ecological (dispersal limitation) and evolutionary factors (gene flow, adaptation) violate key assumptions of SDMs.</p><p id="Par4">Although invaders often arrive from other continents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, they can also emerge within a single continent and exhibit rapid range expansion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Similar to trans-continental invaders, within-continent invaders often exhibit explosive demographic expansions and can cause similarly disruptive ecosystem effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. At the same time, these invaders may possess a unique subset of characteristics (e.g. association with anthropogenic change) and management challenges that are vital to document and model in order to develop effective management strategies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Modelling within-continent invaders offers the opportunity to study how SDMs perform when an invasion occurs directly from a native range to adjacent ecosystems and across continuous environmental gradients. Investigations of native invasion can more readily distinguish among the alternative causes of sudden range expansion including climate, biotic interactions (e.g. competitive environment), or dispersal limitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5"><italic>Amaranthus palmeri</italic> is an annual, dioecious plant with a relatively narrow native range that includes the desert Southwest of the United States (especially Arizona and New Mexico) and northwest Mexico (Sonora)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.

Despite the enormous economic impact and continued range expansion, the environmental controls of its distribution and predictions for its future spread remain poorly resolved.</p><p id="Par6">In this study, we examined the range expansion dynamics of <italic>A. palmeri</italic> from its historical to current range and used SDMs to predict the distribution of suitable habitat across North America throughout the invasion process and under future climates. To determine whether SDMs would have been successful if implemented at early versus late stages of the invasion, we took advantage of the detailed record of invasion and abundant occurrence dataset to construct SDMs at five time points in the invasion process. Because rapidly-expanding invasive species can be challenging to model, we used a broad array of modeling approaches (native&#x02009;+&#x02009;invaded range vs. invaded range only, Maxent vs. boosted regression trees, alternative climate datasets, downsampling overreported areas, etc.) to determine their consequences for model accuracy and discrimination ability under both current and future climates. We also determined which environmental factors most influenced projected habitat suitability and potentially limit range expansion into unoccupied regions. Finally, we examined the contribution of stochastic long-distance dispersal to range expansion using spatial autocorrelation analyses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Niche breadth and overlap between the native versus invaded ranges</title><p id="Par7">We characterized the climate niche breadth of <italic>A. palmeri</italic> and quantified the extent to which the climate niche has shifted and/or expanded in the invaded range.

SDMs performed better when we used occurrences only from the invaded range, rather than including the native range as well. Under future climate scenarios, our models predicted northward range expansion and increased suitability in regions that are already occupied but of moderate suitability (e.g. upper Midwest). Unfortunately, SDMs performed quite poorly when we attempted to predict the current invaded range from earlier phases of the invasion history (e.g. occurrences until 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010). Analyses of invasion dynamics suggest that stochastic movements across the landscape have contributed importantly to rapid range expansion, rather than a wave-like spread, alone. Our models make robust predictions about incremental expansion in the future but suggest caution when employing SDMs to predict the potential geographic range of invasive species that are far from equilibrium with the environment.</p><p id="Par24">We used a diverse set of modelling approaches and all of them had modest discrimination ability. This was evident by low AUC scores (but TSS indicated moderate to high accuracy),&#x000a0;weak signal in individual environmental variables, and predictions of low habitat suitability in currently occupied regions at the range margin. Discrimination ability and predictions of habitat suitability were consistent across all versions of our models, suggesting that the modelling approach was not the likely cause. Instead, the climate datasets along with the biology and invasion history of <italic>A. palmeri</italic>, may have contributed to limited SDM discrimination. First, the climate datasets used (CliMond and PRISM) are constructed based on mean data over a 30-year timeframe (CliMond: 1961&#x02013;1990; PRISM: 1970&#x02013;2010). Therefore, it is possible that our models are conservative with respect to predictions of habitat suitability, and occurrences along the range margin, particularly in the north, may reflect recent warmer than average years. Second, it is possible that climate has not been the main driver of distributional limits but rather that they have been caused by other factors (e.g. dispersal or biotic interactions). For example, range expansion may have been limited by the availability of disturbed, low-competition habitats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> that have become more common in the past 70+ years with industrialized agriculture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Third, annual plants such as <italic>A. palmeri</italic> can often exploit a broad range of climates by exploiting only the fraction of the year that is suitable via altered timing of germination and reproduction (i.e. niche construction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>). Last, populations may have adapted to novel environments during range expansion, which has resulted in a broad set of suitable climates across the species&#x02019; range and a weakened signal of individual environmental variables in SDM construction. Together, these historical and biological factors may contribute to modest model discrimination/accuracy but also provide important insight for future work on the causes of distributional limits. We consider each of these issues in detail below.</p><p id="Par25"><italic>Amaranthus palmeri</italic> remained within the bounds of its native range until the middle of the twentieth century but quickly began to spread by the 1970s and 1980s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. We took advantage of the detailed time series of occurrence data to ask how SDMs performed at sequential stages of the invasion process. Models built with occurrence records until 1970, which were primarily from the native range and early invasion, predicted very little of the extent of the eventual invaded range. Models built using occurrence records until 1980, 1990, and 2000 also performed poorly in forecasting the eventual invaded range. Qualitative inspection of projections indicate that models were successful in predicting the invasion of geographic regions immediately adjacent to the occupied range (i.e. short periods into the future) but failed to predict over broader geographic areas (and longer time scales). These results imply that climate was not an important factor in the early stages of the invasion and that dispersal limitation contributed to limits on range expansion. Our models that incorporated land cover made similar predictions about the extent of invasion, but also emphasized that human disturbance was likely an important factor in range expansion. Similarly, a meta-analysis by Simberloff <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> found that most invasions of native plants are not limited by climatic variables and instead are associated with anthropogenic change, such as alteration of grazing and fire regimes. The association of <italic>A. palmeri</italic> with natural and human-caused disturbed habitats may in part explain the original restriction and current movement of the species.</p><p id="Par26">Our results also suggested that stochastic long-distance dispersal contributed to rapid range expansion throughout the invasion process. The total area of occupancy for <italic>A. palmeri</italic> in North America increased linearly during most of the invasion history but began to accelerate rapidly approximately in the last decade (2010&#x02013;2017). We also found that occurrences in the invaded range were not spatially-autocorrelated at fine spatial scales (nearest neighbors) indicating that stochastic movement (e.g. long-distance dispersal events) has likely been important. This result is consistent with observations from other systems, and theoretical models, which have suggested that rapidly expanding ranges often spread via short-distance dispersal at range margins coupled with rare long-distance stochastic dispersal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Such rapid and stochastic invasion is most likely to occur when an invader is far from equilibrium with the environment (e.g. climate), with large amounts of suitable but unoccupied territory.</p><p id="Par27">Although we detected a recent acceleration in invasion speed and stochastic spread, our models suggest that <italic>A. palmeri</italic> is closer to reaching the boundaries of its potential range. Models built with the most recent datasets (2017) best predicted large geographic areas that have recently been invaded but do not have occurrences included in model building (e.g. Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, and portions of the Southeast and Upper Midwest; USDA Plant Database; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://plants.usda.gov">https://plants.usda.gov</ext-link>); whereas, models built with older datasets underpredicted areas at risk for future invasion. Similar to our results, V&#x000e1;clav&#x000ed;k and Meentemeyer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> found that early in the invasion history of <italic>Phytophthora ramorum</italic>, models underpredicted areas at risk for future invasions, but that late in the invasion more models readily predicted unoccupied areas that were later invaded. Therefore, our models based on current datasets may likely make more robust predictions about future invasion than those based on data from earlier in the invasion process.</p><p id="Par28">One of the difficult decisions faced by modellers of invasive species is whether and how to use occurrence information from the native range in modelling and projecting invasive ranges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In many cases, using native plus invasive records overpredicts habitat suitability in unoccupied areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>; whereas, using only the invaded range better predicts potentially suitable unoccupied areas. In our models, we found that using occurrences from the native&#x02009;+&#x02009;invaded range underpredicted some areas that have already been invaded (i.e. the Midwest, Southeast, and Mid-Atlantic; Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A,C</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S8</xref>). These newly-invaded regions had higher predicted habitat suitability when models were built using data from only the invaded range. Therefore, like many other invasive species, newly-invaded areas are best predicted by models built only with invaded occurrences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. This is likely because the native range is a narrow subset of climates compared to the invaded range. Indeed, our niche analyses showed that the native and invaded ranges occupied different, but overlapping, climatic niche space, which is common for many invasive species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. This niche shift makes it potentially problematic to model invaded regions using native-only models or models where a high density of native occurrences might heavily bias the SDM.</p><p id="Par29">Range expansion may have been facilitated by adaptation and/or admixture. <italic>Amaranthus palmeri</italic> may have adapted to novel environments (e.g. temperature and precipitation regimes) during northern and eastern range expansion and thus differentiated from native genotypes. Thus far, there is evidence that resistance to glyphosate application quickly evolved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, which has greatly enabled its spread into agricultural fields<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Because SDMs assume that all populations have the same climate niche, local adaptation across the range violates this assumption and may produce biologically unrealistic predictions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. This may make it more important to build detailed, regionally-informed models to capture patterns of relevant environments and genotypes. In addition to adaptation from standing genetic variation, admixture from closely-related species could also contribute to range expansion and confuse SDMs. Admixture has been documented with <italic>A. tuberculatus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, a widespread species in the central United States (ranging from Canada to Mexico) but it&#x02019;s importance for adaptation to northern and eastern environments remains unclear.

First, to characterize the fine-scale rate of spread across North America, we calculated the Area of Occupancy (AOO) as the number of grid cells (30 arcsecond size) with records. We also built SDMs at each time point (same methods as for the datasets described above) to visually compare projections and to quantify the proportion of grid cells with a predicted probability of occurrence &#x02265;0.5. We evaluated these models in two ways. First, we calculated evaluation metrics using a testing dataset withheld during model building. Second, we evaluated the models&#x02019; ability to predict future invasion by calculating evaluation metrics (AUC and TSS) using all future occurrence records found in analogous climate space. For sequential historical models, only subsets of the US contained analogous climates. Therefore, only occurrence records that occurred within those regions were used to calculate evaluation metrics base on future prediction of occurrences.</p><p id="Par45">Second, we examined whether the pattern of range expansion was more consistent with wave-like versus stochastic movement. Wave-like movement causes higher levels of spatial autocorrelation than stochastic movement among occurrences because the bulk of propagule movement is local<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>. We used the filtered dataset (2017) to assess spatial autocorrelation at three spatial scales: single nearest neighbor, ten nearest neighbors, and all neighbors within a 50&#x02009;km radius. To determine the extent of spatial autocorrelation, we calculated the join-count statistic which tallies the number of links between nearest neighbors (i.e. presence-presence, presence-absence, absence-absence). To determine number of same-type joins that would be expected by chance we generated 999 permuted datasets and calculated the join-count statistic for each. To determine if patterns of spatial autocorrelation were different between native and invaded ranges, we performed analyses separately for each region. We used the &#x02018;spdep&#x02019; package to perform spatial autocorrelation analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Projected future distributions</title><p id="Par46">To make predictions about potentially suitable future habitats, we obtained the same bioclimatic variables for CliMond from the general circulation models (GCM) CSIRO-Mk3.0 and MIROC-H for the A1B and A2 SRES climate scenarios (A1B is based on lower CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, CH<sub>4</sub>, and SO<sub>2</sub> emissions than A2) for 2030 and 2070 (IPPC IV SRES 2007<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup>).
