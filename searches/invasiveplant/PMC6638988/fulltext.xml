In arid and semi-arid ecosystems, soil mesofauna is adapted to temporary drought events, but, until now, we have had a limited understanding of the impacts of the different magnitudes and frequencies of drought predicted to occur according to future climate change scenarios. The present study focuses on how springtails and mites respond to simulated repeated drought events of different magnitudes in a field experiment in a Hungarian semi-arid sand steppe. Changes in soil arthropod activities were monitored with soil trapping over two years in a sandy soil. In the first year (2014), we applied an extreme drought pretreatment, and in the consecutive year, we applied less devastating treatments (severe drought, moderate drought, water addition) to these sites. In the first year, the extreme drought pretreatment tended to have a negative effect (either significantly or not significantly) on the capture of all Collembola groups, whereas all mite groups increased in activity density. However, in the consecutive year, between the extreme drought and control treatments, we only detected differences in soil microbial biomass. In the cases of severe drought, moderate drought and water addition, we did not find considerable changes across the microarthropods, except in the case of epedaphic Collembola. In the cases of the water addition and drought treatments, the duration and timing of the manipulation seemed to be more important for soil mesofauna than their severity (i.e., the level of soil moisture decrease). We suggest that in these extreme habitats, soil mesofauna are able to survive extreme conditions, and their populations recover rapidly, but they may not be able to cope with very long drought periods.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>European Union&#x02019;s LIFE project</institution></funding-source><award-id>LIFE13 ENV/HU/001092</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dombos</surname><given-names>Mikl&#x000f3;s</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Hungarian TALAJBIOM project</institution></funding-source><award-id>GINOP-2.3.2-15-2016-00056</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7585-6709</contrib-id><name><surname>Fl&#x000f3;ri&#x000e1;n</surname><given-names>Norbert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>J&#x000e1;nos Bolyai Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences</institution></funding-source><award-id>OTKA (K112576)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kr&#x000f6;el-Dulay</surname><given-names>Gy&#x000f6;rgy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>Premium Postdoctoral Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences</institution></funding-source><award-id>PPD2018-001/2018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gerg&#x000f3;cs</surname><given-names>Veronika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution>European Union&#x02019;s LIFE project</institution></funding-source><award-id>LIFE13 ENV/HU/001092</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7585-6709</contrib-id><name><surname>Fl&#x000f3;ri&#x000e1;n</surname><given-names>Norbert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award006"><funding-source><institution>Hungarian TALAJBIOM project</institution></funding-source><award-id>GINOP-2.3.2-15-2016-00056</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dombos</surname><given-names>Mikl&#x000f3;s</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award007"><funding-source><institution>Hungarian TALAJBIOM project</institution></funding-source><award-id>GINOP-2.3.2-15-2016-00056</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Szili-Kov&#x000e1;cs</surname><given-names>Tibor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award008"><funding-source><institution>Hungarian TALAJBIOM project</institution></funding-source><award-id>GINOP-2.3.2-15-2016-00056</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mucsi</surname><given-names>M&#x000e1;rton</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by: NF, MD, European Union&#x02019;s LIFE project [LIFE13 ENV/HU/001092], <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&#x00026;n_proj_id=5030">http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&#x00026;n_proj_id=5030</ext-link>, data collection NF, MD, TSZ-K, Hungarian TALAJBIOM project [GINOP-2.3.2-15-2016-00056], <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.agrar.mta.hu/hu/ginop_palyazatok">http://www.agrar.mta.hu/hu/ginop_palyazatok</ext-link>, data collection, preparation of the manuscript GYK-D J&#x000e1;nos Bolyai Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, OTKA [K112576], <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mta.hu/bolyai-osztondij/bolyai-janos-kutatasi-osztondij-105319">https://mta.hu/bolyai-osztondij/bolyai-janos-kutatasi-osztondij-105319</ext-link>, data collection, study design.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="4"/><page-count count="16"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All raw data files are available from the DRYAD database (doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.6c642t3">10.5061/dryad.6c642t3</ext-link>.).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All raw data files are available from the DRYAD database (doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.6c642t3">10.5061/dryad.6c642t3</ext-link>.).</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Climate change is one of the most current issues in soil protection. Global temperature is rising, and a 2.5&#x02013;3&#x000b0;C summer temperature increase is predicted to occur by 2021&#x02013;2040 relative to the 1981&#x02013;2000 period [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Different climate change factors act differently among climate zones: more warming is predicted in the northern region, whereas in addition to an elevated level of CO<sub>2</sub> [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], drought seems to have high importance in temperate areas. Due to climate change, an increased intensity and frequency of extreme events, such as severe droughts, heavy rains, and heat waves, is expected [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Soil mesofauna (mostly microarthropods of 0.2&#x02013;4 mm in body size) occupy a central position in the soil food web eg. [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], especially in semi-arid areas, where earthworms are rare [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Among them, springtails and oribatid mites, as the most abundant groups, can influence the process and regulate the speed of decomposition and exert strong feedback on plants [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. They are also often used as bioindicators because of their rapid reaction to environmental shifts [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Moreover, soil mesofauna have a small activity range; therefore, compared to macroinvertebrates, they are better suited for small-scale experiments [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Soil moisture is one of the most important factors affecting soil communities [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Drought can be separated from warming effects [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and has direct or indirect effects on soil microarthropods [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Desiccation, through dehydration, has a direct effect on mesofauna, influencing their survival and inducing physiological and behavioural changes eg. [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, indirect effects of drought seem to be more important in soil ecosystems. Drought may decrease the decomposition rate [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], alter soil characteristics [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and change the quantity and quality of plant litter, influencing bottom-up effects [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Changes in the decomposition rate and pathway also influence vegetation structure and productivity through soil animal communities [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>The precipitation regime of a region may determine the biological responses to drought events [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Different levels of soil moisture caused by rain pulses are reported to influence the activity patterns of macroarthropods, but our knowledge regarding the effects on microarthropods is limited [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The reaction of soil mesofauna to drought can be rapid, but their population sizes may recover over a short time [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Most soil-dwelling microarthropods live in a stable environment. However, they can survive under dry conditions eg. [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], especially in arid and semi-arid areas, where drought occurs regularly for a certain period and with different intensities [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. According to Nielsen and Ball [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], changes in the intensity and frequency of climate events influence the ecological functioning of soil invertebrates and may affect the carbon and nutrient pool of the soil. However, only a few studies have focused on alterations to the magnitude or frequency of precipitation in arid or semi-arid ecosystems [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In previous experiments, a high amount of precipitation increased the abundance of soil mesofauna [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], whereas a high frequency had no [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] or variable effects [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] depending on the animal group considered. Moreover, we have a limited understanding regarding how an extreme or altered intensity of repeated drought events affects soil communities and how rapidly their populations recover after drought shock.</p><p>In our field experiment, we investigated how an extreme event (extreme drought) and subsequent moderate changes in precipitation, in accordance with climate change scenarios, affect the soil microbial biomass and soil microarthropods in a semi-arid ecosystem. With a new sampling method, we measured the activity density (AD; i.e., the number of individuals in the traps derived from their abundance and activity [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]) and species richness of different soil microarthropod groups in sandy soils in a manner similar to that used for pitfall traps. The treatments included four different levels of drought: extreme (5 months) drought as a pretreatment in the first year and severe (2 months) drought, moderate (1 month) drought and water addition in the second year.

We hypothesized that the different drought treatments (from modest to extreme) would negatively influence the AD of soil microarthropods, whereas for the extra-precipitation treatment, a positive response of soil fauna was hypothesized to occur.

Therefore, we selected six blocks, ca. 12 x 6 m in size, that were internally homogeneous in these factors. In each block, there were eight 3 x 3 m plots, with four plots being adjacent to one another and thus comprising a 6 x 6 m area and another four plots comprising another 6 x 6 m area, with the plots ca. 2 m apart (Figure A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0219975.s002">S2 File</xref>). Within each block in the first year (2014), we applied an extreme drought pretreatment (two levels: extreme drought (X) vs. control (C)). In the consecutive year (2015), we applied mild precipitation at four levels: severe drought (S), moderate drought (M), control (C, ambient precipitation) and water addition (W) in both of the previously X- and C-treated plots. In this way, the two factors (i.e., extreme drought and mild precipitation change) were combined in a full factorial design, resulting in eight treatment combinations (CC, CS, CM, CW, XC, XS, XM, XW) with six replicates for a total of 48 study plots.</p><p>The extreme drought was simulated by excluding all rain from 24 April 2014 to 18 September 2014 by permanently covering these plots with transparent polyethylene roofs. The height of the roofs in all treatments varied from 80 to 100 cm depending on the topography. Severe drought was simulated by covering the respective plots for two months in 2015 (23 June to 25 August in 2015), while moderate drought was simulated by covering these plots for one month in 2015 (from 20 July to 25 August). Water addition was applied four times: 25 May, 22 June, 21 July and 25 August. We added a total of 98.5 mm of water (which is the mean value of two months of the mean summer precipitation in the area) in four approximately equal parts, imitating the amount of precipitation received during a thunderstorm. This amount was 18.8% of the ambient precipitation in that year. During water addition, we applied the collected rainwater with sprinklers from ca. 70 cm height. At the time of sprinkling, side-curtains were used to prevent irrigation water from falling into the neighbouring plots. While all treatments were applied to the 3 x 3 m plots, we designated the inner 2 x 2 m parts as the core area: all measurements were conducted there, and the outer 0.5 m zones were considered buffers.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Environmental variables and biological sampling</title><sec id="sec006"><title>Measurement of environmental variables</title><p>Soil humidity was measured at each plot in situ at a 0&#x02013;30 cm soil depth with a Campbell CS616 soil moisture sensor.

We did not convert the SIR values to soil microbial biomass because of the uncertainty regarding the proper conversion factors used by many studies. Soil samples were taken monthly from May to November, corresponding to the same timeframe as the treatments. Sampling always occurred a few days before the treatments were conducted each month. We took small subsamples of soil from all of the plots using plastic tubes of 12 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter. This method allowed us to take soil samples from the upper 10 cm of the soil with a small disturbance effect. From each plot, we took ten subsamples, incorporating as much heterogeneity as possible, and they were mixed. In that way, we obtained approximately 30 g of soil representing the whole plot. The gravimetric water content of the samples was set to 50% of their water holding capacity. Two grams from each sample was measured in 25 cm<sup>3</sup> vials, and the vials were hermetically covered with butyl rubber plugs and kept in a water bath at 22&#x000b0;C for a 3-day pre-incubation period. The vials were then opened, and the headspace of each was ventilated, ensuring that the starting CO<sub>2</sub> concentration was the same in all vials. The SIR measurements were carried out by adding a 200 &#x003bc;l 80 mg/cm<sup>3</sup> glucose solution to each sample, then closing the vials again with the butyl plugs. After 3 h of incubation, the headspace CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were determined using the same method as for methane by injection of 250 &#x003bc;l gas samples into a flame ionization gas chromatograph (FISONS GC 8000) along with a methanizer. The SIR rates were calculated as &#x003bc;g CO<sub>2</sub>-C*g soil<sup>-1</sup>*h<sup>-1</sup>.

[<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] suggested using pitfall traps, although this method may underestimate euedaphic species. In our experiment, the mesofauna was sampled with EDAPHOLOG probes. In this probe, commercially available horticultural clay granules are used as the medium between the soil and the trapping part, which collects animals from the upper 0&#x02013;10 cm of the soil based on pitfall trapping and the horizontal movement of soil-living animals. The EDAPHOLOG monitoring system continuously detects microarthropods falling down into the trap with an opto-electronic sensor and records the body sizes and the time of capture [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Due to the sandy soil, especially in the drought treatments, sand particles falling into the traps resulted in several miscounts in opto-electronic sensing; therefore, in this study, we used only the biological samples from the traps, i.e., the captured animals stored in 70% ethanol in the plastic tube at the bottom of the trap. Repeated core samplings should be avoided in fine-scaled climatic experiments. EDAPHOLOG, unlike traditional soil extraction methods, is able to sample and monitor mesofauna from sandy soils for a longer time in a non-invasive way. To catch animals with EDAPHOLOG requires microarthropods to actively move into the trap horizontally, as in the case of pitfall traps; therefore, the activity density of the animals (the number of individuals in the traps derived from their abundance and activity) was detected during the experiment. Although the use of this tool was proven to be comparable with traditional methods (Dombos et al., 2017), the capture efficiency of EDAPHOLOG probes in sandy areas was compared with that of traditional sampling methods (soil extraction and pitfall traps) in an additional short field test (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0219975.s003">S3 File</xref>). Although the capture of animals was low in this field test, the rates of animal AD values did not significantly differ among the different climate conditions, showing that EDAPHOLOG did not affect the response of soil animals to the climatic treatments. In addition, all the AD data were detected with the same type of EDAPHOLOG trap; therefore, all the data are comparable within the experiment.</p><p>The probes were placed close to the centre of each plot to prevent the effects of cross-treatment migration. The first year (2014) was considered as the pretreatment year; the traps were inserted into the soil at the beginning of July, and the traps were emptied at the end of November. The traps were monitored throughout this period to prevent errors resulting from failures or clogging of the probes. AD values were obtained for 5 months. In 2015, the traps were emptied every month from April to November following the time schedule of the experimental actions in the treatments; therefore, the AD values refer to one-month-long collections.</p><p>Collembola and Oribatida were identified to the species level under a Leica MZ75 microscope according to Bretfeld and Dunger [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], Fjellberg [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], Hopkin [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], Jordana [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], Mahunka [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], P&#x000e9;rez-I&#x000f1;igo [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], Potapow [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] Stach and Stach [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], Thibaud et al.

Up to 2018, approximately 30% of publications on climate change experiments focused on water regime changes, which resulted in diverse responses. In most field experiments, precipitation reduction induced a negative change in the abundance or density of soil Collembola [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], and adding extra precipitation induced positive responses among soil animals [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In this study, due to the extreme drought treatment (X), the activity density was reduced among all collembolan groups (significant only in the case of vegetation-living Collembola). The observed overall decrease in AD was what we expected and was consistent with other short- and long-term experiments that quantify abundance or density [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, unlike Collembola and our expectation, all Acari groups showed an increase in their AD in the extreme-drought plots. Opposite responses of mites and Collembola have been reported in several cases [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], but in many other cases, they responded in the same direction eg.

Extreme dry conditions or summer drought may have little effect on mite assemblages living in dry ecosystems. Moreover, Liu et al. (2017) suggested that the AD of oribatid mites decreases with increasing soil moisture. This mite group had a higher abundance in a drier grassland than in a wetter grassland [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], and the main Acari groups were also not significantly influenced by summer drought treatments in other grasslands [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] or in a dry heathland [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].

The abovementioned results (except Wu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]) were found in soils with good water retention ability, whereas our study addresses sandy soil, and this condition may have modified the effects of drought on soil fauna in comparison to those found in related studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Effects of mild precipitation changes</title><p>Moderate drought is characteristic of the experimental area. In the second-year treatments, although the degree of drought reached the soil moisture content level of the extreme drought (X) pretreatment plots in the previous year, soil-living Collembola and Acari did not show any change in response to moderate or severe drought, contrary to our expectations. We did not find any differences in the species richness of Collembola. Only epedaphic Collembola showed a negative response to the severe drought treatment. The lack of response is common in drought experiments, and the abundance of mesofauna showed little response to the treatments in several cases. Neutral results were found for springtail and mite communities in a fescue field, Mediterranean shrubland and temperate heath, grass and moorland [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Even in a poplar shrubland close to our research area, Petersen [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] did not find any changes in collembolan assemblages in drought or warming treatments. This suggests that soil animals can cope well with low levels of environmental fluctuations, especially in areas where natural disturbance is frequent, such as in semiarid sand steppes.</p><p>In the water-addition plots, 18.8% of the annual precipitation was added, but the mean monthly soil moisture did not change during the year. Although soil biota require a constant amount of moisture, unlike our expectations, water addition did not increase the microbial biomass or the AD of mesofauna, as in the study of Lindberg and Persson [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In several cases, the activity density of invertebrates has been reported not to be influenced by increased precipitation [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. In the case of soil mesofaunal abundances and even activity densities, further examples exist for the lack of changes in irrigation treatments in arid ecosystems [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Our study and previous works demonstrate that sporadic extra precipitation in semiarid sandy ecosystems cannot compensate for the effects of drought and is not sufficient to increase microbial biomass or mesofaunal AD. However, precipitation experiments usually have a larger effect over the long term [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and our experiment may have been too short to detect changes.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Legacy effects of the extreme drought pretreatment</title><p>Although extreme drought had a considerable effect on the soil arthropod assemblages in the pretreatment plots, in the subsequent year, contradictory to our expectations, we did not find any significant effect in AD or richness between the previously treated and control sites. Surprisingly, in the second year, soil moisture was higher at the previously extreme drought-treated sites than at the other sites. This result might have been caused by the mulching effect of dead plant material on the ground and from decreased evapotranspiration because many perennial plants died. This moisture surplus and increased dead material could have caused the higher microbial biomass (SIR) found in the X-treated sites in the second year. Detritus and increased microbial biomass as food resources could have a positive bottom-up effect [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We suggest that the higher moisture and resource content of the soil led to a higher activity and number of individuals of Collembola. Mite assemblages may be more affected by actual conditions than by previous climatic changes [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. For each Acari group, the advantage of the drought treatment in terms of causing a higher AD in the first year disappeared in the second year, i.e., drought in the previous year did not apparently influence the activity density values in the second year. In addition, the drought treatment in the second year was not as long as the treatment in the first year; therefore, it should have had lower effects on the Acari groups.</p><p>Contrary to our expectations, repeated drought, i.e., severe drought (S), did not amplify the effects of previous extreme drought. However, considering that no similar study has addressed the activity density of microinvertebrates, our findings are consistent with the results of Holmstrup et al. [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. They found the same patterns in the abundance of enchytraeids.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Timing and duration are more important than severity of the treatment</title><p>In our experiment, the different effects of extreme, moderate and severe drought can be attributed to the duration of the treatments rather than their severities, i.e., the changes in soil moisture contents themselves. The extreme drought treatment was conducted for five months and overlapped the seasonal dynamics and peaks of the AD of all soil mesofauna groups investigated. In contrast, moderate and severe drought events lasted for one and two months, respectively, and overlapped with the peak of epedaphic Collembola but were out of the climate window of other species. Independent of treatment duration, the decrease in soil moisture in the different drought treatments (X, M, and S) similarly reached permanent wilting points in terms of soil moisture content. Even after extra precipitation, the water infiltrated or evaporated rapidly. According to the results from the water addition treatment, we suggest that precipitation quantity is not the only limiting factor in these ecosystems, and the frequency and timing of precipitation events seem to also influence the assemblages of soil mesofauna.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Additional methodological and ecological aspects</title><p>In most studies on soil microarthropods, the usual practice is sampling after or at the end of the treatments only a few times. However, environmental anomalies and extremities may affect different species in different time windows throughout the year. Thus, inappropriate sampling may result in a lack of responses. Soil extraction is only capable of presenting a temporary picture and cannot show changes in soil mesofauna communities continuously. The use of continuous, non-invasive, standardized methods for monitoring soil mesofauna is lacking so far. In our experiment, we used a new sampling method, which involves the continuous monitoring of AD changes among soil mesofauna in sandy soils, where other traditional methods are difficult to implement and not effective. With this non-invasive method, we were able to follow the activity density processes of different microinvertebrate assemblages throughout the whole year, especially in the activity period of arthropods, and this method can be utilized in long-term climate change experiments with minimal disturbance.</p><p>Drought influences the soil mesofauna community in two ways: reduced soil moisture acts as a main factor, while higher temperature usually serves as a side effect. In our experiment, different increases in soil temperature occurred during drought treatments; however, we considered them to be negligible. Warming has considerable effects on soil-dwelling biota in northern ecosystems or over the long term [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], whereas it has fewer effects in temperate ecosystems [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

Such traps mainly measure the activity densities of species with good locomotory ability [<xref rid="pone.0219975.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Changes in the activity density of microinvertebrates may be the result of two factors: microarthropods disappearing from the community or remaining in the area but in an inactive state. By using pitfall-like trapping, it is not possible to clearly distinguish the two processes. However, in both cases, their ecological functioning in the community can be evaluated with this method because their ecological functioning (i.e., feeding on resources) is correlated with their activity density. These changes in arid ecosystems should be further investigated.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec024"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Groups of soil mesofauna in fluctuating environments, such as dry sand steppes in central Hungary, are adapted to extreme conditions. Although extreme events can change their activity densities, they seem to be able to cope with changes over a short time. Extreme drought had a greater effect on the activity density of soil mesofauna than severe or moderate drought. However, as the soil moisture in all cases reached the same minimum level, we can state that the timing and duration of a drought event seem to be more important in affecting soil biota than the degree of soil moisture decrease. Because of its low water holding capacity, water does not remain in the sandy soil for a long time, so extra precipitation does not have a positive effect on the soil mesofauna or microbial biomass. The fact that soil moisture and microbial biomass increased at previously disturbed sites may be an example of why climate change factors are reported to have different effects over the short and long term.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec025"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0219975.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Data transformations and analysis related to the article.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0219975.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0219975.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Figures and tables supporting the results of the article.</title><p>Fig A Spatial layout of plots at the experimental site Fig B Temporal dynamics of soil moisture in the different treatment plots Table A Collembola species captured at the study site during the experiment Table B Oribatida species captured at the study site during the experiment Table C Mean number of captured Collembola individuals in 2015 across 4 treatment levels Table D Mean number of captured Acari individuals in 2015 across 4 treatment levels Table E Mean (SD) values for the collembolan species in 2014</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0219975.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0219975.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>Supplementary experiment to evaluate the catchability of EDAPHOLOG probes in sandy soils.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0219975.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0219975.s004"><label>S4 File</label><caption><title>Species-specific responses related to the article.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0219975.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AD</term><def><p>activity density</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RAD</term><def><p>relative activity density</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SM</term><def><p>soil moisture</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0219975.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">IPCC (2014) Climate change 2014: synthesis report.
