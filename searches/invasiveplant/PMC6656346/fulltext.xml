Papua New Guinea&#x02014;comprising the eastern half of the island&#x02014;plans to nearly double its national road network (from 8,700 to 15,000 km) over the next three years, to spur economic growth. We assessed these plans using fine-scale biophysical and environmental data. We identified numerous environmental and socioeconomic risks associated with these projects, including the dissection of 54 critical biodiversity habitats and diminished forest connectivity across large expanses of the island. Key habitats of globally endangered species including Goodfellow&#x02019;s tree-kangaroo (<italic>Dendrolagus goodfellowi</italic>), Matchie&#x02019;s tree kangaroo (<italic>D</italic>. <italic>matschiei</italic>), and several birds of paradise would also be bisected by roads and opened up to logging, hunting, and habitat conversion. Many planned roads would traverse rainforests and carbon-rich peatlands, contradicting Papua New Guinea&#x02019;s international commitments to promote low-carbon development and forest conservation for climate-change mitigation. Planned roads would also create new deforestation hotspots via rapid expansion of logging, mining, and oil-palm plantations. Our study suggests that several planned road segments in steep and high-rainfall terrain would be extremely expensive in terms of construction and maintenance costs. This would create unanticipated economic challenges and public debt. The net environmental, social, and economic risks of several planned projects&#x02014;such as the Epo-Kikori link, Madang-Baiyer link, Wau-Malalaua link, and some other planned projects in the Western and East Sepik Provinces&#x02014;could easily outstrip their overall benefits. Such projects should be reconsidered under broader environmental, economic, and social grounds, rather than short-term economic considerations.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>We acknowledge funding from an anonymous philanthropic organization to William F.

It contains about 328,000 km<sup>2</sup> tropical forests [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]&#x02014;among the largest tropical forest estates of any nation. PNG forests have exceptionally high species endemism, with many species still not scientifically described [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and are some of the most carbon-rich forests on the planet. Many of the 8 million inhabitants of PNG rely on these forests either directly or indirectly for their livelihood or subsistence incomes [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219408.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>The historical trends of forest management in PNG are attributed to forest exploitation in several forms&#x02014;commercial logging, large forest concessions for agricultural development, large-scale mining, expanding oil palm plantations, and a long history of swidden farming by its indigenous peoples [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219408.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219408.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Via these trends, PNG has lost about 3,750 km<sup>2</sup> of rainforest since 2002, and a further 7,700 km<sup>2</sup> is experiencing various forms of degradation [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Road development in forest frontiers leads to several primary and secondary impacts. The primary impacts include local deforestation for road construction, some greenhouse gas emissions, local changes in abiotic and biotic conditions caused by edge effects, increased erosion and stream sedimentation, and wildlife roadkill [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The secondary impacts include incursions of hunters and poachers; legal and illegal logging, mining, forest fires, and land encroachment; landslides and impeded water flows; invasions of disturbance-favoring species; and land speculation; among other impacts [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219408.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219408.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>PNG plans to dramatically increase its current road extent in the coming years to promote economic development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219408.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Overall, the current ~8,700 km of national road length will be increased to 15,000 km by the end of 2022. This development is planned under two different umbrella projects&#x02014;&#x0201c;Missing Links&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Other Planned Roads&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219408.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The missing link projects are articulated as national priorities and are planned to connect the current disjoined national roads to build economic-development corridors.</p><fig id="pone.0219408.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0219408.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Road development corridor in Papua New Guinea.</title><p>Existing national roads, planned missing links, and other planned road-route data (from [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0219408.g001"/></fig><p>The missing links projects are still evolving. However, six priority missing-link projects are listed in the Medium Term Development Plan for PNG [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]: Vanimo&#x02014;Aitape, 105 km; Bogia&#x02014;Angoram, 101 km; Wau&#x02014;Malalaua, 132 km; Kupiano&#x02014;Raba-Raba, 142 km; Epo&#x02014;Kikori 105 km (partial); and Madang-Baiyer, 263 km. The other planned projects particularly focus on construction of national roads in areas where there are few roads, such as western PNG, New Britain Province, and the Autonomous Region of Bouganville [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219408.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p><p>The road expansion agenda is intended to enhance near-term economic growth and regional connectivity in PNG. However, the environmental and broader societal impacts of this massive infrastructure expansion are still unknown. Here we investigate the potential impacts of planned road expansion on overall environmental, economic, and social integrity in the region, specifically on forest connectivity, biodiversity, carbon storage, deforestation and industrial development. We conclude by discussing different options that could improve the road expansion process in PNG, facilitating economic, environmental, and social benefits while reducing environmental degradation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Planned road expansion</title><p>We obtained the latest map of planned road network development from the Medium Term Development Plan III 2018&#x02013;2022, of the PNG government [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The map contained the planned roads&#x02014;&#x02018;missing links&#x02019; and &#x02018;other routes&#x02019;&#x02014;along with existing national roads across PNG. We digitized all these roads in the GIS interface following Alamgir et al. [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and Sloan et al. [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The digitization procedure entailed geo-referencing the map and then tracing the road layers in a GIS. Subsequently, we retraced the digitized GIS layer in Google Earth aiming to achieve maximum accuracy with reference to alignment of existing roads. The estimated locational error of the final digitized features was &#x0003c;200 m relative to Google Earth imagery.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Landscape connectivity and deforestation</title><p>Landscape connectivity assesses the linkages between different forest patches in a landscape. To evaluate the potential impacts of planned roads on current landscape connectivity of forests across PNG, we conducted a morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA). The MSPA analysis was performed using Graphical User Interface for the Description of Image Objects and their Shapes (Guidos Toolbox 2.6 version 4) [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219408.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The MSPA analysis segmented the forests of PNG into distinct forest-landscape elements, namely core forest patches (forest &#x02265; 600 m from the nearest forest edge), edge forest (forest &#x0003c; 600 m from an edge), and connectivity forest (forest corridors connecting different core-forest patches or different sections of a core-forest patch). Subsequently, we identified areas where planned roads will intersect distinct forest-landscape elements, particularly core forests and connectivity forests. In MSPA, we used forest data from the updated (v.1.5.) annual 30-m Landsat classifications of Hansen et al. [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Areas with &#x0003c;50 percent tree cover were excluded from the analysis, considering the tropical forest attributes in the region. Data were resampled at a 200-m resolution for the purpose of processing. MSPA capture changes to both fragmentation and connectivity across a forest landscape while retaining a spatially explicit focus on critical forest patches [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219408.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], unlike other approaches in fragmentation analysis. Our 600-m threshold defining edge effects is taken as a conservative indicator of potential edge effects on forest patches; a 1000-m threshold has been widely used in other road-impact research [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219408.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In fact, edge effects can extend from a few meters to several kilometers from the forest periphery to its interior [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and include both abiotic and biotic components of the forested ecosystems. Some biotic effects include unwanted changes of plant and animal communities such as increased abundance of lianas and rattans, and decreased abundance of mammals and birds [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219408.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Some abiotic effects include increased wind disturbances, reduced soil moisture, and increased air temperatures [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Edge effects may become weaker with time if the forest is subsequently undisturbed, but in the case of road building, edge effects are likely to become worse with time as road development facilitates further disturbances, such as the expansion of agriculture, settlements, mining, logging, and the construction of secondary and tertiary roads.</p><p>We calculated average deforestation in PNG since 2000 within a 3-km radius of a pixel following Sloan et al. [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. For this process, we used deforestation data between 2000 and 2017 from the updated (v.1.5.) annual 30-m Landsat classifications of Hansen et al. [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Data were resampled to 200-m resolution for consistency with our other analyses.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Protected areas, peatlands, slope, and mining concessions</title><p>To spatially evaluate the planned roads with respect to conservation areas, peatlands, and industrial development, we overlaid the planned routes over protected areas, biodiversity-conservation priority areas, peatlands, intact forest, slope data, and mining-concession areas across PNG. Protected area-data were obtained from the World Database on Protected Areas [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and complemented by the protected areas map of PNG [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and the manual addition of a recently declared protected area [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The protected areas are listed under various forest designations, including national parks and wildlife management areas (WMAs). In WMAs, local communities are allowed regulated hunting and other forms of land uses because land is customarily owned. Biodiversity-conservation priority areas designate an area (forest/wetland) with significant biodiversity values that require immediate conservation attention, presumably candidates for future protected areas (if not currently protected). The areas are classified into &#x02018;very high priority&#x02019; and &#x02018;high priority&#x02019; considering overall biodiversity values and conservation significance, integrating biophysical data (such as climate and vegetation) and expert opinions [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These biodiversity-conservation priority areas [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] data were obtained from the Remote Sensing Centre, University of Papua New Guinea.

The Epo-Kikori missing link project would be the most risky, traversing 34 km of peatlands, followed by the Bogia-Angoram (17 km) and Wau-Malalaua (8 km) missing links. The Bogia-Angoram missing-link would dissect a large block of very deep peatland (&#x0003e;9m deep) impacting ~1,000 ha in this category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219408.g004">Fig 4a</xref>) while the Epo-Kikori missing link would dissect one of the largest continuous blocks of peatlands in PNG, impacting ~7,000 ha of peatlands in total (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219408.g004">Fig 4b</xref>).

As carbon storage in peatlands is high, it would also make remaining peatlands vulnerable to future disturbances such as fire, facilitating further emissions that would vary with peat depth. (ii) Road construction and subsequent maintenance costs of road segments in peatlands will be high. This necessitates more expenses in the absence of sufficient future investment for road maintenance. The current road network in PNG is in poor condition due to the lack of investment in road maintenance [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], mirroring the likely future condition of these roads. (iii) Road construction and associated disturbances can change peatland hydrology, potentially draining peatlands and lowering their water table, thereby increasing peat fires and peat oxidation, both major sources of carbon emissions [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In Southeast Asia, the burning of peatlands during droughts has created regional environmental catastrophes, including extremely degraded air quality from haze [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

A major scandal in PNG has been the &#x0201c;Special Agricultural and Business Leases&#x0201d; (SABLs), which allowed clear-felling of forests for large-scale agricultural development, particularly oil-palm plantations [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In most cases, companies holding SABLs did not establish plantations but used the SABLs to facilitate land grabbing and bypass forestry regulations to conduct unregulated logging [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. New leases under the SABL policy have now been abandoned because of recurring allegations of land grabbing and substantial irregularities [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Several planned road projects in provinces such as West Sepik, East Sepik, West New Britain, and East New Britain are a strong indicator of further schemes to expand oil palm in the region [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219408.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], placing many lowland forests in severe danger. An example is the Managalas conservation area, which was recently declared to protect it from logging and industry-scale agriculture [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], but which could be opened up for mining by planned construction of a major new road (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219408.g002">Fig 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Low-carbon development and SDGs</title><p>Low-carbon development is a national development strategy that aims for low greenhouse gas emission or a national development plan resilient to climate change [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The current road development plan in PNG effectively ignores low-carbon development, not taking into consideration the huge carbon stock in peatlands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219408.g004">Fig 4</xref>) and hyperdense rainforests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219408.g005">Fig 5</xref>). PNG contains the second largest peatland in Asia after Indonesia, with ~45,000 km<sup>2</sup> of peatlands [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These peatlands are an important global carbon pool [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Heavy logging is also a major source of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The current road development agenda in the peatlands and hyperdense rainforest areas will release substantial carbon to the atmosphere and set the stage for future emissions.</p><p>PNG has put substantial efforts into the development of a REDD (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) program [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and aspires to achieve carbon-neutral development by 2050 [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The current road development plan in peatlands and high-carbon rainforests, and the major increases in forest loss and fragmentation they would foment, are clearly inconsistent with such commitments. Similarly, road development followed by clear-felling of intact forests for industial-scale development (e.g. SABLs [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]) are contrary to PNG&#x02019;s commitment to REDD and low-carbon development.</p><p>With its planned road development, PNG would also not honor its international commitments towards the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). PNG is enthusiastically working with the global community to achieve SDGs [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], and in many cases is leading Pacific nations to progress towards the SDGs [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. If road development occurs as currently planned, it will have substantial impacts on terrestrial ecosystems, biodiversity, and carbon storage. PNG&#x02019;s vision to sustainable development is clear but lacks an ecosystem-based development pathway [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Current road-development plans would undermine key SDG aspirations and targets.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Risks of economic impacts</title><p>Surging long-term debt is an alarming possibility in the aftermath of planned road development in PNG. Road construction and maintenance costs are high in PNG because of difficult topography and high rainfall, the remoteness and high transportation costs for getting material to worksites, and substantial corruption costs from road-construction cartels. A number of planned road segments are set to cross extreme terrain, contributing to even higher construction costs (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219408.g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219408.g007">7</xref>). As our study reports, these segments would be extremely vulnerable to landslides during heavy rainfall events and earthquakes. These impacts would extend beyond environmental to social and economic sectors. For instance, large-scale landslides and flash floods in PNG [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] and Papua, Indonesia [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] exacerbated by road construction recently cost millions of dollars to their national economies. Along with high road-construction costs, PNG would need major budget allocations for maintenance to keep the roads in useable condition. However, only 33% of the current national roads in PNG are in useable condition [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], with the remainder in very poor condition due to inadequate funding for maintenance [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Conclusions and recommendations</title><p>PNG needs to upgrade and establish key road segments to advance its current development agenda. However, such projects need to be economically feasible, socially equitable and realistic, and environmentally sustainable. Our study suggests that current plans for many road segments have not adequately considered the unique environmental values, economic risks, and social settings of PNG. Many road segments will create large overall risks and potentially return only marginal benefits. Therefore, we suggest the following based on our informed and detailed analysis:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Cancelling the planned road segments that will pass through protected areas, key habitats of endangered and iconic wildlife species, and major peatlands. These specifically include the Madang-Baiyer missing link, Bogia-Angoram missing link, Wau-Malalaua missing link, the planned road in East Sepik Province connecting Pogera and Ambunti, and the planned roads dissecting the YUS and Managalas conservation areas.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Road segments set to bisect interior-forest areas and biodiversity conservation-priority areas will diminish forest connectivity and create imminent deforestation frontiers. These should be recognized as having particularly high environmental risks. Special safeguards, including increased law enforcement, impact-mitigation strategies, and initiatives to expand new protected areas along road routes, are highly advisable.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Both missing links and proposed road segments identified to occur at &#x0003e;30 degrees slope in intact forest areas should be cancelled or greatly minimized, following the logging guidelines of PNG, which prohibits logging of such steep slopes. Such roads will have exceptionally high construction and maintenance costs, and severe environmental risks for local and downstream ecosystems and landowners.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Planned roads in the periphery of the Kamula Doso rainforest&#x02014;the missing link connecting Kikori and Kagua (part of Epo-Kikori missing link), and other road projects in Western Province&#x02014;should be re-evaluated considering their high ecological and carbon-emissions risks. These areas might be better protected under the REDD+ initiative.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Investment by foreign financiers should largely focus on upgrades and maintenance of existing roads, rather than new road construction. The Australian government&#x02019;s current policy is exemplary&#x02014;prioritizing investment on road maintenance in PNG rather than new road building, to keep the national road network in workable condition [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. This is an urgent and realistic priority, as some 67% of current national roads in PNG are in very poor condition [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>International support is direly needed to help PNG explore more sustainable development pathways. At present, heavy foreign investment, especially from China [<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219408.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], is promoting many high-risk and potentially predatory development projects in PNG and elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region.</p></list-item></list></sec></body><back><ack><p>The following organizations provided logistical and other support: PNG Conservation and Environment Protection Authority (CEPA), Wildlife Conservation Society-PNG, WWF-PNG, and the Remote Sensing Centre, University of Papua New Guinea.
