Alternatively, concordance may result if differences in climate, soils, and species pools are spatially confounded with differences in human population density and land conversion. Further, we expect that land cover within catchment boundaries will be more predictive than land cover in symmetrical buffers if runoff is a major pathway. We measured concordance between land cover, wetland vegetation and physicochemical conditions in 48 prairie pothole wetlands, controlling for inter-wetland distance. We contrasted land-cover data collected over a four-year period by multiple extraction approaches including topographically-delineated catchments and nested 30 m to 5,000 m radius buffers. After factoring out inter-wetland distance, physiochemical conditions were significantly concordant with land cover. Vegetation was not significantly concordant with land cover, though it was strongly and significantly concordant with physicochemical conditions. More, concordance was as strong when land cover was extracted from buffers &#x0003c;500 m in radius as from catchments, indicating the mechanism responsible is not topographically constrained. We conclude that local landscape structure does not directly influence wetland vegetation composition, but rather that vegetation depends on 1) physicochemical conditions in the wetland that are affected by surrounding land cover and on 2) regional factors such as the vegetation species pool and geographic gradients in climate, soil type, and land use.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Alberta Innovates</institution></funding-source><award-id>2094A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3956-7210</contrib-id><name><surname>Rooney</surname><given-names>Rebecca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>RCR received award 2094A from Alberta Innovates (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://albertainnovates.ca/">https://albertainnovates.ca/</ext-link>).

Through regulation of propagule composition, abundance, and dispersal into the wetland, adjacent land covers can exhibit strong controls on wetland plant communities resulting in changes to community composition or structure [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The composition of surrounding land cover may also affect wetland biota by altering the growing conditions within the wetland. For example, the type of land cover within a wetland&#x02019;s catchment may alter the volumes of snowdrift and snowmelt that enter the wetland [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]; modify evapotranspiration rates e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]; or affect the transport and accumulation of sediments [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], nutrients [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], salts [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and contaminants [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. As aquatic plant communities are structured by local environmental conditions e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] which &#x0201c;filter&#x0201d; the local species pool sensu [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], land cover-driven changes in wetland physicochemical conditions likely influence wetland species composition and function e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Regional biogeographical processes, local landscape composition and <italic>in situ</italic> physicochemical conditions and biotic interactions may all serve as important controls on community assembly [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, these factors operate at different spatial scales, and their relative influence on community composition varies according to the region, ecosystem and taxa under consideration e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. As such, the scale of analysis may critically affect the identification of which mechanism (regional controls such as species pool membership and climate, local controls such as the adjacent land cover types, or <italic>in situ</italic> controls such as water chemistry or ponded-water duration) is a stronger determinant of vegetation community composition, and even whether the mechanism is detectable [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Distinguishing between the effects of regional and local processes can be further complicated by heterogeneous landscapes, where changes in land cover may interact with or supersede the aforementioned processes to structure wetland communities [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Identifying the spatial scale (i.e. scale of effect) at which these processes are occurring is thus a necessary step in elucidating the local- and regional-level controls on community composition.</p><p>At the local scale, the spatial extent and symmetry of boundaries within which surrounding land cover influences wetland conditions remains in contention [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], with most studies using nested and symmetrical buffers to identify the scale of effect e.g.,[<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] despite recognition of the importance of surface runoff processes in wetlands e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A major criticism of the nested and symmetrical buffer approach is that the choice of buffer radius is typically arbitrary, with little ecological relevance [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Further, the buffer approach presumes that there exists a discrete and critical distance at which land cover and land use affect wetland conditions that is universal for all wetlands in a specific study e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], ignoring differences in catchment size. Moreover, the approach presumes that the impact of land cover and land use is isotropic (i.e., the same in all directions) for all study sites. Yet, wetlands sit at the bottom of their catchments, not the geometric centre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0216343.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Given that the spatial influence of runoff is anisotropic, the influence of surrounding land cover and land use on local physicochemical conditions within wetlands is also likely anisotropic.</p><fig id="pone.0216343.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0216343.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Different spatial extents used to characterize land-cover composition around study wetlands.</title><p>Depicted is a 0.37 ha wetland situated in the Grassland natural region of Alberta, with land cover from 2014 (30 m pixels).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0216343.g001"/></fig><p>A benefit of using symmetrical buffers for empirical analysis is that buffers around wetlands can be easily generated and visualized using a geographic information system (GIS). In contrast, delineating wetland catchments is challenging [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This is especially true in areas where low relief topography can hinder accurate delineation of catchments using digital elevation models (DEMs) [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In such areas, the resolution of the DEM used in catchment delineation has an influence on the catchment size and shape (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0216343.g001">Fig 1</xref>), with higher resolution DEMs typically yielding smaller catchments. Yet, it is not clear whether high-resolution DEMs are necessary or beneficial in interpreting or predicting ecological patterns. For example, higher resolution DEMs have been shown to have little effect on watershed scale simulation modeling for streams [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Additionally, high-resolution DEMs tend to represent barriers to water flow (e.g., roads) which may not be present on lower-resolution DEMs, further complicating catchment delineation.</p><p>We test the hypothesis that land-cover composition in the surrounding landscape influences both the physicochemical conditions and vegetation composition of prairie pothole wetlands. We explore the concordance between land cover and <italic>in situ</italic> wetland conditions and vegetation independent of the relative locations of those wetlands within the larger region by working in two adjacent natural regions (the Parkland and the Grassland) and by controlling for inter-wetland geographic distance in our analyses. Significant concordance between land cover and physicochemical conditions within a wetland, even after controlling for inter-wetland distances, would support our hypothesis that wetlands are affected by their surrounding landscape via the direct effect of local land covers on hydrology, chemistry, and habitat connectivity. However, understanding the sensitivity of these relationships to landscape delineation method, landscape extent, and data resolution are necessary conditions for advancing the study of wetland-landscape interactions. To help us detect any influence of temporal lag, we also test the hypothesis that land cover has an anisotropic zone of influence on wetlands driven by their catchment boundaries, using data extracted from a time series of land cover. We undertake this test by contrasting the magnitude of concordance between land cover and measures of physicochemical conditions or wetland vegetation when land cover is defined by nested and symmetrical buffers vs. when land cover is defined by topographically-delineated catchments. Finally, to determine whether wetland communities are more strongly regulated by <italic>in situ</italic> physicochemical conditions than by local landscape conditions (i.e. adjacent land cover) or regional factors (i.e., inter-wetland distance), we also evaluated the strength of concordance between a broad suite of physicochemical conditions and the vegetation community composition at each wetland.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study region and sites</title><p>We sampled the Grassland and Parkland natural regions of Alberta, Canada, within the glaciated plains (&#x0201c;Prairie Pothole Region&#x0201d;) of North America (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0216343.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Both regions have undulating topography, with poorly-drained soils comprising clay-rich glacial tills [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Graminoid marshes form in the resulting topographic depressions (prairie potholes). Groundwater recharge occurs at some wetlands, but most infiltrated water is retained in upland soils [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These prairie pothole marshes receive most of their water from snowmelt runoff since the semi-arid climate creates a moisture deficit the rest of the year (i.e., potential evapotranspiration typically exceeds precipitation), and thus summertime runoff is very low [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The pattern of potholes combined with temperature and precipitation regimes limit surface-water connectivity to infrequent summer deluge conditions, in which a &#x0201c;fill-spill&#x0201d; effect may occur between adjacent basins [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Due in part to the low surface-water connectivity among wetlands and the semi-arid climate, wetland water levels draw down gradually over the growing season through evapotranspiration and soil infiltration. Many prairie pothole wetlands dry out completely every summer, producing a seasonal cycle of spring fill and summer draw down. The periodicity of ponding serves as the basis of a classification system that categorizes the prairie pothole wetlands as ephemeral, temporary, seasonal, semi-permanent, or permanent, reflecting the duration of ponded water [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0216343.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0216343.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Distribution of wetlands sampled in 2014 (<italic>n</italic> = 48) within six major sub-watersheds in the Grassland and Parkland natural regions of southern Alberta, Canada.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0216343.g002"/></fig><p>Climatic conditions differ between the more northern Parkland (mean annual temperature 2.3&#x000b0;C, precipitation 441 mm) and southern Grassland (mean annual temperature 4.2&#x000b0;C, precipitation 371 mm) [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], supporting different natural and anthropogenic land covers in each region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0216343.g003">Fig 3</xref>); <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0216343.s001">S1 Table</xref>). Agriculture is a dominant land use in both natural regions: primarily cereal and oilseed cultivation in the Parkland, and a mix of irrigated cropping and rangeland for cattle in the Grassland. Forests and shrublands are more prevalent in the Parkland, whereas these habitats are scarce in the Grassland. Instead, the majority of the Grassland natural region is occupied by native grassland (albeit subject to grazing pressures). Urban areas and oil and gas exploration are also present in both natural regions.

Despite these differences in species composition, wetland vegetation zonation in both natural regions generally reflects typical prairie pothole configurations, where zones are distributed concentrically within the wetland basin and are strongly tied to the permanence of ponded water [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0216343.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0216343.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><p>Comparison of a) average pond maximum depth measured in May 2014; and b) pond seasonal amplitude (i.e., seasonal maximum depth minus seasonal minimum depth, measured at the wetland&#x02019;s deepest point) of wetlands in the Grassland (<italic>n</italic> = 24) and Parkland (<italic>n</italic> = 24) natural regions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0216343.g004"/></fig><fig id="pone.0216343.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0216343.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><p>Comparison of a) species richness; and b) evenness of vegetation in wetlands in the Grassland (<italic>n</italic> = 24) and Parkland (<italic>n</italic> = 24) natural regions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0216343.g005"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Site selection</title><p>We selected three sub-watersheds from each natural region that were mainly composed of glaciolacustrine or glaciofluvial landforms.

Four years of land cover data were selected to determine whether using data that coincide with field measurements or recent historical data affects the strength of detected landscape-wetland condition concordance. Due to the high thematic resolution of the AAFC data (comprising 44 land-cover classes of which 30 are agricultural variants), we reclassified the data into the following nine land-cover classes based on ecological function or similar land use and land management activities: forests, wetlands, native grassland, shrubland, cropland, pasture/hay, developed, water bodies, or exposed/barren land.</p><p>For each of our 48 study sites, we produced eight nested buffers of varying radii (30, 100, 200, 300, 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 5,000 m) extending from each wetland&#x02019;s perimeter, as defined by our vegetation mapping.

To explore the physicochemical and vegetation data visually and to inform our approach to concordance analysis, we also employed ordination methods to visually explore and summarize the vegetation and physicochemical data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0216343.s003">S1 File</xref>).</p><p>Mantel tests evaluate the correlation (<italic>r</italic><sub>M</sub>) between two dissimilarity matrices and describe the extent to which the two dissimilarity matrices exhibit the same pattern of redundancy. Because geographic proximity and concepts such as spatial autocorrelation among samples may artificially inflate <italic>r</italic><sub>M</sub> values [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], we used partial Mantel tests [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0216343.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] to quantify the effect of location and proximity among sites. The partial Mantel test allows us to statistically control for the linear effect of inter-wetland distances before calculating the Mantel correlation between another pair of distance matrices [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Mantel <italic>r</italic><sub>M</sub> values are usually much smaller than the Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficients produced for the same sample size [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]: <italic>r</italic><sub>M</sub> coefficients &#x02265; 0.1 usually indicate a strong association between the two dissimilarity matrices e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0216343.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The statistical significance of the Mantel correlation (<italic>r</italic><sub>M</sub>) is determined by repeated randomization of the rows and columns of one matrix, where the resulting <italic>p</italic>-value represents the proportion of randomized permutations with a correlation score larger than the observed score. However, our purposes are comparative; therefore, we are more interested in the relative magnitude of Mantel <italic>r</italic><sub>M</sub> values derived using different catchment or buffer sizes to extract land cover than we are in the statistical significance of individual <italic>r</italic><sub>M</sub> values.</p><p>Our comparison between land cover and physicochemical variables used Euclidean distances to construct the dissimilarity matrices, because these datasets exhibited bivariate linearity and low sparsity. To generate the dissimilarity matrix describing physicochemical variation among sites to use in our partial Mantel tests, we standardized the 45 physicochemical variables by relativizing each measurement by the variable&#x02019;s maximum observed value [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Repeated <italic>in situ</italic> measurements were averaged across site visits to provide one value per wetland. We also consolidated pesticide data by type, yielding the incidence of herbicide, insecticide and fungicide detections in water and soil. We took the average of soil nutrients, ions and physical parameters across quadrats to obtain wetland-level soil-quality data.</p><p>In contrast, we used the Bray-Curtis distance measure [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] to calculate the dissimilarity matrices when comparing vegetation relative abundance to land cover or to physicochemical conditions, because vegetation community datasets typically possess high sparsity and because species vary naturally in their maximum abundance [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] To produce a dissimilarity matrix describing variation in vegetation community composition among sites, we used the relative cover of each plant species at a wetland, averaging across all quadrats sampled at each site. While rare species may be important from a conservation perspective, they may skew the results of concordance analysis [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. When a plant species was observed in only one of the 150 mapped assemblages, we excluded it from the dissimilarity calculations to reduce dataset sparsity. This left 121 plant species for analysis.</p><p>Latitudinal trends in climate and land cover types associated with the natural regions spanning our study may violate the Mantel test assumptions of monotonicity and homoscedasticity between the dissimilarity matrices, resulting in a loss of statistical power [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. To ensure that the underlying spatial structure in our data was linear and that the partial Mantel test would thus be appropriate, we first analyzed our data spatially by reducing the number of physicochemical and vegetation variables down to four principal components (PCs), each with an eigenvalue greater than one (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0216343.s003">S1 File</xref>). We identified a slight positive global spatial autocorrelation for each principal component using Moran&#x02019;s I (PC1 0.17, PC2 0.26, PC3 0.19, and PC4 0.22) GIS [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. We then fit an experimental variogram to a semivariance point cloud for each principal component using 12 lags, size 0.0634966, to 8 mathematical models (circular, spherical, tetraspherical, pentaspherical, exponential, guassian, rational quadratic, and stable) with GIS [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Results of the experimental variograms identified slight directionality to the spatial autocorrelation in a north-south direction with some variability by mathematical model and PC axis. The calculated range varied between 27 and 57 km, along the major axis of autocorrelation, and the farthest distance among sites was 358 km. Despite our sampling efforts to ensure spatially independent samples (obtained at a distance greater than 3.5 km as determined by spatial autocorrelation among wetland land cover data), our measurements show slight linear spatial autocorrelation along the North-South latitudinal gradient.</p><p>This is appropriate because the underlying spatial structure followed a linear North-South latitudinal gradient [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. We compared 40 land-cover dissimilarity matrices with each of the physicochemical and vegetation dissimilarity matrices, using the inter-wetland distances as a third &#x0201c;control&#x0201d; matrix, for a total of 80 partial Mantel tests. Each partial Mantel test used 10,000 permutations of a Monte Carlo randomization test to quantify the significance of the calculated <italic>r</italic><sub>M</sub> value [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].

Bootstrapping involved 5,000 iterations at a resampling rate of 0.7, without replacement. A partial Mantel test was also used to test for concordance between physicochemical and vegetation dissimilarity matrices after controlling for inter-wetland distance, using the Bray-Curtis distance measure for all three dissimilarity matrices.

Thus, our primary focus is the relative strength of concordance between dissimilarity in surrounding land cover from different landscape extents and dissimilarity in physicochemical conditions among wetlands.</p><p>We had expected that the vegetation community in a wetland would be influenced both by its physicochemical conditions [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0216343.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and by the direct effects of land cover on species dispersal and propagule sources [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0216343.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We found that wetland vegetation was most concordant with land cover within 500 m of the wetland boundaries, though this concordance was weak (<italic>r</italic><sub>M</sub> &#x0003c; 0.05) and non-significant. This was surprising, as prior variance partitioning relating vegetation-based measures of wetland integrity to surrounding land cover in the Parkland natural region of Alberta found that even after factoring out the influence of inter-wetland distance, land cover within 500 m of wetland margins explained &#x0003e;40% of the variance in wetland integrity scores [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Yet, perhaps this should have been anticipated, as land-cover data in that study was able to explain &#x0003e;75% of the variance in wetland integrity scores when variations in location were not factored out. Notably, though not significantly different from 0, the <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub> values among the buffers were highest at the 500 m buffer size, in agreement with the optimal buffer size identified by [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Because the reduction in concordance between land cover and vegetation was so large, especially at the largest buffer extents, we hypothesize that biogeographical factors have a comparatively strong influence on vegetation community composition in these wetlands. This is likely through differences in regional species pools and higher local immigration rates, which result in more distant wetlands possessing more dissimilar vegetation communities [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0216343.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0216343.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p><p>In contrast, physicochemical conditions were strongly (<italic>r</italic><sub>M</sub> ~ 0.1&#x02013;0.2) and significantly concordant with land cover from within 200&#x02013;500 m of the wetland boundary. In other words, we found strong evidence that surrounding land cover within 500 m influences wetland physicochemical conditions, but weak evidence to support a direct link between land cover and wetland vegetation, regardless of landscape extent. This contention is supported by previous research concluding that the relationship between land cover and wetland physicochemical conditions is limited in spatial extent [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0216343.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Symmetrical buffers vs. hydrologic catchments</title><p>We hypothesized that wetland catchments reflecting the actual contributing area would show stronger concordance between land cover composition and physicochemical and vegetation variables than symmetrical buffers, as others have indicated e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We therefore contrasted the strength of concordance with land cover extracted from symmetrical buffers vs. land cover extracted from topographically delineated catchments. Interestingly, for both vegetation composition and physicochemical conditions, there was little material difference in the strength of concordance with land cover from catchments and land cover extracted from symmetrical buffers between 200 and 500 m in radius. While the catchments are representative of the hydrologically contributing area around the wetlands [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0216343.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], it is possible that surface runoff is not the major delivery vector of sediments, nutrients and contaminants to our prairie pothole wetlands. Due to naturally high infiltration rates in prairie soils and a semi-arid climate, little overland runoff is believed to reach prairie pothole wetlands during the active growing season [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Instead, most of the runoff occurs as snowmelt over frozen soil, when infiltration is low [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This may explain differences between our conclusions and those of [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] who were working in central Europe where the climate is less arid (mean annual precipitation of 840+ mm), resulting in more summertime runoff within wetland catchments and thus a stronger influence of catchment-scale land cover on water and sediment conditions. Similarly, the weak concordance we observed between local land cover and vegetation composition may be a consequence of minimal water-mediated propagule transport during the growing season, which can be a significant transportation vector for both upland and aquatic plants in regions with greater surface runoff [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Of course, snowmelt may be an important source of contaminants in agricultural landscapes e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], but processes not constrained by catchment boundaries, such as groundwater connections [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] or aerial deposition of sediments [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], may serve as important vectors influencing physicochemical conditions and vegetation in our prairie pothole wetlands. Regardless, our results indicate that the associations between land cover and wetland conditions are quite robust to spatial extent and less sensitive to runoff processes than anticipated. Though we are surprised by this conclusion, it does allay concerns around reliance on buffers in homogenous landscapes, or where high resolution DEMs or catchment polygons are not available.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Role of <italic>in situ</italic> physicochemical conditions</title><p>To contrast the importance of local landscape condition with the importance of <italic>in situ</italic> physicochemical conditions on vegetation composition, we also measured the concordance between dissimilarity in wetland physicochemical conditions and dissimilarity in wetland vegetation communities directly. The strong (<italic>r</italic><sub>M</sub> = 0.195) and significant concordance between these dissimilarity matrices suggests that, as others have previously indicated [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0216343.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], wetland vegetation is more strongly influenced by <italic>in situ</italic> physicochemical conditions than by land cover in the local landscape (<italic>r</italic><sub>M</sub> &#x0003c; 0.1), regardless of landscape extent or delineation method. We cannot infer the causal direction of this strong association, but suggest it is most likely due to the direct influence of chemical and hydrologic conditions on the composition of vegetation e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], reflecting resource limitations and other environmental constraints of the capacity of plants to establish, compete and persist in their wetland habitat [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Yet, the physicochemical-vegetation association may also reflect the capacity of wetland vegetation to modify water and sediment conditions e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], or some unmeasured factor which controls both biotic and abiotic wetland conditions.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Role of regional differences and inter-wetland distance</title><p>Our study wetlands span a latitudinal gradient that encompasses two natural regions with distinct climates, species pools, and land use patterns.

Thus, before we could explore patterns in the strength of concordance among the land cover, physicochemical and vegetation dissimilarity matrices, it was necessary to first factor out the influence of inter-wetland distances that more likely reflect geographic gradients in land cover and pertinent climate and soil characteristics or species distributions and dispersal rates [<xref rid="pone.0216343.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].

Despite the difference in catchment size, we observed similarity in land cover composition between the two catchments. We attribute this to the relatively coarse resolution of the land-cover data (30 m pixels). The result of this spatial mismatch is that many of the same land cover pixels were included in both 10 m and 25 m catchments (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0216343.g001">Fig 1</xref>).
