(common ragweed), a North American native species, alien and invasive in Europe, is one of the most important seasonal allergenic plant in many regions of the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">In the United States, its highly allergenic pollen affects more than 36 million people each year and the prevalence of sensitization is growing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Also in Europe the prevalence of ragweed sensitization is relevant and rising. The mean sensitization prevalence is about 14%, with remarkable differences between the countries: it ranges from around 60% in Hungary to 19.5% in Southern Bavaria and it is virtually absent in certain biogeographical regions such as Mediterranean (e.g. Spain), Atlantic (e.g. UK) and Boreal (e.g. Sweden) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In any case, in all other European countries except Finland, the prevalence for ragweed sensitization is above 2.5% that was suggested as a cut-off for high prevalence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">A synergy of anthropogenic and bioecological factors was suggested to be responsible for the observed rising prevalence of ragweed sensitization. The globalization of commerce and land use changes have dramatically favored the spread of the species in both America and Europe. At the same time, climate changes have prolonged the ragweed flowering season, and increased the growth of the plant and the pollen production, extending, on the whole, the geographical area and the period/intensity of exposure to its allergens. Indeed, greenhouse experimental simulations of climate change by increasing temperature and/or CO<sub>2</sub> were demonstrated to determine an earlier flowering, larger floral numbers and a greater pollen production in common ragweed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Similar effects were observed by Ziska et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and by Rodr&#x000ed;guez-Rajo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] for ragweed plants grown at urban locations where the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> and temperature were higher than in rural areas.</p><p id="Par29">Moreover, a few studies suggested that environmental changes can also contribute to the increase of sensitization prevalence by increasing the allergenic potential of ragweed pollen through the modulation of allergen synthesis and structure. Specifically, Ghiani et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] suggested that changes in climatic environmental factors (light, humidity and temperature) during plant development affect the pollen content of the major common ragweed allergen, Amb a 1. In keeping, El Kelish et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] demonstrated that both an elevated level of CO<sub>2</sub> and drought stress affect <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> pollen allergenicity because expressed sequence tags encoding allergenic proteins increased under those conditions. Zhao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] showed the direct influence of elevated NO<sub>2</sub> on the increased allergenicity of ragweed pollen and Ghiani et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] demonstrated that traffic-related pollution enhances ragweed pollen allergenicity, showing that pollen collected along high-traffic roads shows a higher whole allergenicity than pollen from low-traffic roads and vegetated areas.</p><p id="Par30">Due to the ongoing global climate change, the current situation is expected to worsen in the next few decades. Species Distribution Models (SDMs) for <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> predict that its potential distribution will increase globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For Europe, Rasmussen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] suggest that, by the year 2100, the distribution range of ragweed will increase toward Northern and Eastern Europe under all climate scenarios and consequently the high allergy-risk areas will expand in the continent.</p><p id="Par31">Despite this warning, to our knowledge there are no data or very few studies deepen the specific effect of temperature on common ragweed growth and pollen allergenicity. In this work we analyzed the variation in morpho-functional traits, total pollen allergenicity and allergen profile/IgE (Immunoglobulin E) reactivity of ragweed plants germinated and grew in controlled conditions at the following three thermal regimes: &#x0201c;Low&#x0201d; (LT: 18&#x02013;14&#x02009;&#x000b0;C light-dark), &#x0201c;Intermediate&#x0201d; (IT: 24&#x02013;20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C light-dark) and &#x0201c;High&#x0201d; (HT: 30&#x02013;26&#x02009;&#x000b0;C light-dark).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Effect of temperature on seed germination and plant development</title><p id="Par32">A trait-based approach for defining the species responses to environmental changes was applied to determine the effect of temperature on plant development.

In our experiment <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> showed a great development plasticity leading to a broad temperature tolerance. All germinated seeds developed in plants showing thermomorphogenic changes of shoot architecture useful for facing temperature changes. Indeed, as observed in the model species <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, ragweed growth at HT resulted in striking elongation of stems and increased leaf elevation from the soil surface, that are architectural adaptations representing a strategy to minimize heat damages by enhancing evaporative leaf cooling in well-watered environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This is in agreement with the study of Bazzaz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] on ragweed photosynthesis, who demonstrated that increasing temperature increases transpiration rates in this species maintaining appreciable level of photosynthesis even at 35&#x02009;&#x000b0;C.</p><p id="Par42">On the contrary, at LT our ragweed plants were shorter and more laterally expanded, likely to avoid heat dispersion, as happen for perennial plants living at high latitudes or altitudes that usually grow in a cushion form to minimize the loss of heat and moisture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">In any case, although the shoot architecture, the growth rate and flowering were temperature-dependent (slower at LT), in our experimental conditions all the ragweed plants successfully completed their life cycle flowering and producing a similar final dry biomass. It suggests that common ragweed can diffuse in regions where the minimum and maximum temperature range between 14 and 26&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and between 18 and 30&#x02009;&#x000b0;C during the vegetative summer season. However, in warm climate the lack of seed stratification, due to too high winter temperature, may prevent germination and then the plant spreading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Moreover, it must be taken into account that in many warm regions other different factors severely constrains <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> development such as the low rainfall during the summer months in Mediterranean area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Then, even if common ragweed can tolerate high temperature it is unlikely that it may spread in warm climate region with high winter temperature and/or low rainfall during vegetative season. On the other hand, a further prolonged pollen season may be expected in the already suitable climatic regions for common ragweed where the species is naturalized or invasive, raising the period of exposure to allergens. Furthermore, in those regions such as Central/Norther Europe and mountains, where now common ragweed cannot complete its life cycle because of the mean low temperature of the vegetative summer season [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], the global warming may allow its growth and reproduction extending the area of allergen exposure. In this type of environments, although germination may be partially affected by low temperature (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), the currently casual common ragweed populations may become naturalized and even invasive because temperature would be no more the principal climatic limiting factor. This agrees with all the distribution models developed for <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] predicting that this species will expand globally and specifically northward and uphill in Europe increasing the allergens-exposure areas. In addition, we observed a higher production of male inflorescence at LT. It should increase pollen production in relatively cold climates contributing to enhance subject exposure to allergens. Nevertheless, our results about pollen allergenicity show that it is lower at LT, decreasing the expected impact on allergy rise determined on the basis of the sole plant distribution and pollen production. In fact, in addition to the temporal and spatial magnitude of the exposure, pollen allergenicity is widely recognized as a major determinant of the prevalence and/or severity of allergic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">Previously, Ghiani et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] demonstrated that the allergenic potency of ragweed pollen is mainly governed by climatic changes occurring during plant development and flowering. By our experiment, we confirmed that pollen allergenicity is an epigenetic controlled trait and we demonstrated that it is highly responsive to temperature. Both the synthesis of allergenic proteins and the Amb a 1 &#x02013; IgE binding were governed by ambient temperature leading to a positive correlation between total pollen allergenicity and temperature.</p><p id="Par45">Specifically, the major changes in allergen synthesis between LT and HT pollen were related to the enolase (Amb a 12), and UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase-like proteins, that were highly expressed in LT pollen, and to a desiccation related protein PCC13&#x02013;62-like that was more abundant in LT pollen as well.</p><p id="Par46">The synthesis of all these allergenic proteins was previously demonstrated to be enhanced by low temperature and likely involved in temperature change tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Particularly, enolase was demonstrated to act as a positive regulator of cold-responsive gene transcription in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. It functions as a transcriptional repressor of STZ/ZAT10, which is a repressor of cold-inducible CBF (C-repeat binding factor) pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Among the cold-responsive genes, the other two allergenic proteins mainly synthetized in LT pollen, the UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and the desiccation related proteins PCC13&#x02013;62, are listed. They were described as regulatory factors closely involved in the homoeostatic readjustment of plant responses to environmental signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase is a key enzyme producing UDP-glucose, which is involved in an array of metabolic pathways concerned with, among other functions, the synthesis of sucrose and cellulose. It was also suggested to play a critical role in plant growth and reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. PCC13&#x02013;62 proteins were instead first identified in the resurrection plant <italic>Craterostigma plantagineum</italic> and suggested to act in plant desiccation tolerance. However both the protein families appear to respond to a broad range of adverse environmental conditions and their specific role still needs to be clarified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In any case, the increased synthesis of these three allergens in LT pollen should have increased its total allergenic potency, but this was not the case in our experiments because in LT pollen the major <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> allergen, Amb a 1, although normally synthetized, was only partially recognized by specific IgE; the result was a lower total allergenicity than the one measured for HT pollen normally showing the usual Amb a 1 - IgE binding.</p><p id="Par47">Pollen flavonoids were identified as the responsible factor for the reduction of the Amb a 1 - IgE binding: the pollen concentration of flavonoids increased with the decrease of temperature and was positively correlated to the increase of allergenicity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). Moreover, the addition of the flavonoid rutin to pollen extracts led to decreased allergenicity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p><p id="Par48">Interestingly, literature suggests that quercetin-type flavonols are implicated in temperature change responses and their concentration increases at low temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Moreover it suggests that quercetin-type flavonols naturally bind some allergens such as the strawberry and birch pathogenesis-related 10 (PR-10) proteins Fra a 1 and Bet v 1, inducing protein conformational changes in critical loop regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However the relevance of these interactions both for plant funtion and allergenic potential needs to be further studied. Indeed, concerning the influence on allergenic potency, Seutter von Loetzen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] investigated the role of quercetin-type ligands on Bet v 1 allergenicity showing that ligand binding to three different isoforms of Bet v 1, strikingly different in their immunological and allergenic properties, is diverse and highly dependent on the composition of their sugar moieties. However, although conformational changes of Bet v 1 structure were observed, the authors did not find a direct ligand effect on IgE recognition of Bet v 1, opening the possibility of indirect influences on sensitization in their experimental context. On the contrary, we observed a clear and significant influence of quercetin-type flavonoids on the Amb a 1 - IgE binding. We can speculate that the association of high amounts of flavonoid with Amb a 1 may have covered allergen epitopes and/or induced Amb a 1 structural conformational changes that altered the epitopes partially affecting IgE recognition. Anyway, further experimental proofs and studies are needed to determine the biological role of flavonoids &#x02013; Amb a 1 complexes in plant under normal and ambient temperature changes. At this regards, noteworthy, Casa&#x000f1;al et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] reported that Fra a 1 proteins control flavonoid biosynthesis through binding to metabolic intermediates. As flavonoids participate in many aspects of plant biology including pollen germination and cell protection during biotic and abiotic stresses, we can speculate that the pectate lyase Amb a 1 binds intermediates of flavonoid biosynthesis to modulate the amount of these secondary metabolites within pollen to face ambient thermal changes. Furthermore, based on the hypothesis by Seutter von Loetzen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] suggesting a role for Bet v 1:querceitin-type-flavonols complexes in recognition processes during fertilization, Amb a 1 - querceitin-type flavonols complexes may also have specific roles in common ragweed reproduction. Experiments to clarify the role of the Amb a 1-rutin complexes are underway.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par49">Overall, our results show that <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> responds to temperature variation mainly by changing shoot architecture and by modulating growth rate, the number of male inflorescences and the synthesis of pollen allergenic proteins and flavonoids. Although the molecular mechanisms are still to be clarified and further experiments are needed, these morpho-functional modifications make the species tolerant to environmental temperature changes favoring its spreading and reproduction under temperature variations. As a consequence, such global change factor strongly influences the prevalence and severity of <italic>A. artemisiifolia</italic> allergy by modulating not only the temporal and spatial magnitude of subject exposure to pollen but also the allergenic potency of pollen itself. It support the idea that the ongoing climate change will increase the global ragweed impact on allergy, although specific experiments testing the genetic adaptation of ragweed to new ambient temperatures are needed to understand the long-term effect of climate change on allergy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Plant growth conditions and traits measurement</title><p id="Par50"><italic>Ambrosia artemisiifolia</italic> seeds from a rural site near Milan, Italy (45&#x000b0;35&#x02032;59.0" N; 8&#x000b0;52&#x02019;29.0" E) were cold stratified at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 3&#x02009;months under continuous darkness, sterilized for 10&#x02009;min in 5% sodium hypochlorite, rinsed with three changes of sterile distilled water and then germinated and grown in controlled conditions.
