  <p>Seismic profile across the central Ross Sea showing the unconformity RSU4 (middle Miocene, green thick line on line drawing, top frame) truncating a thick progradational feature (yellow shade on line drawing, top frame), interpreted as glacial delta. The vertical scale is in two way travel time (in milliseconds). See supplementary Material and Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a> for more information about RSU4. The thickness of the glacial delta is 250 meters assuming an acoustic waves travel time velocity of about 1700 m/s (based on stack velocity from the nearest multichannel seismic profiles). The glacial delta documents the expansion of ice sheet over the central Ross Sea continental shelf during the middle Miocene with large erosion rates and sediment transport, culminating with the subglacial surface RSU4, a basin-wide erosional event dated 16.7–14.2 Ma at DSDP sites 272 and 273
