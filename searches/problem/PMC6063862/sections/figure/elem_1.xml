   </span>. DSDP sites 270, 271, 272 and 273 are also located. Paradoxically, in the Ross Sea, as in the other Antarctic marine basins, SHALLOW_MIO displays deeper bathymetry than in DEEP_MIO. “Shallow” here refers to the West Antarctic subglacial topography that is mostly emerged and thus shallower than in DEEP_MIO. Because the West Antarctic topography is mostly emerged in SHALLOW_MIO, the Ross-Sea and Weddell-Sea basins (and other marine basins of East Antarctica like the Wilkes Land, for example) are not yet filled by erosion and sediment transport as in DEEP_MIO, in which the West Antarctic topography is mostly below sea level (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c,d</a>).
