 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On geological timescales, the dynamic changes of the AIS are likely to be the result of the combination of global climate cooling, the expansion and deepening of the continental shelf, and changes in ocean circulation and temperature. Although the extent of the AIS is primarily determined by the orbital configuration of a given time period

  </span>. The lack of detailed knowledge of the modern subglacial morphology, especially in key sectors of the AIS, induces large uncertainties in the prediction of the Marine Ice Sheet instability of highly sensitive outlet glaciers or ice shelves around Antarctica

  </span>. Past ice sheet reconstructions provide useful information on the response of the AIS to warm and cold climate fluctuations of different magnitudes. However, uncertainties in the AIS contribution to past sea level changes or other forcing mechanisms during key periods, such as the middle Miocene, the middle Pliocene or the Last Interglacial, are still large

  </span> using a reconstruction of the Eocene-Oligocene topography, proposed that a terrestrial West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), grounded mostly above sea level, was able to form much earlier than previously thought because of the shallower topography. Other numerical reconstructions of the mid -Pliocene (3 Ma) and present-day AIS volumes also account for the uncertainties linked with bedrock reconstruction

  </span>. In particular, recent simulations of the AIS forced with Miocene climate conditions and using an idealized mid-Miocene bathymetry
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span> show that grounded ice volumes and AIS vulnerability to marine instabilities are strongly influenced by the reconstructed subglacial topography. Similarly, simulated transient expansion of the AIS during the last glacial cycle occurs faster on shallower bathymetries that are shallower than today. Those simulations also show that the timing of expansion depends on the interplay between the magnitude of inland accumulation, ocean warming and calving

 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Determining when continental margins deepened sufficiently to change the AIS dynamics and how the ice sheet reacted subsequently to atmospheric and oceanic condition changes is important in identifying useful analogues to future climate change. In this study, we use an ice-sheet model to investigate the impact that the gradual deepening of the Antarctic continental margin had on both Miocene and Pleistocene AIS response to changes in ocean forcing. We show that the AIS amplified its own sensitivity to ocean forcing, by gradually eroding the continental margins. Our results also show that eustatic sea level fall and glacial-isostatic adjustment (GIA) modulate the capability of the ice sheet to pin on bathymetric highs and that the importance of pinning points increases with the deepening of the continental margins. Finally, our simulations show a gradual expansion of the cold-based ice area from the middle Miocene to the Pleistocene that causes fundamental differences in the AIS dynamics. We conclude that as a result of the gradual deepening of the continental margins, ocean forcing became a first-order factor in the AIS expansion and retreat after the middle Miocene.</p>
