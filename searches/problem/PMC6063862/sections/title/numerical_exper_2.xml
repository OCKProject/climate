  <sub>2</sub> concentration during mid-Miocene glacials (&gt;280 ppm), combined with major oceanic and atmospheric circulation changes, led to mid-Miocene glaciations that were characterized by warmer and wetter conditions than during the late-Pleistocene glaciations when CO2 concentrations were significantly lower (&lt;200 ppm) (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>). To explore the significance of these differences in climate and subglacial topography, ice sheet sensitivity simulations are performed for two end-member case studies, a mid-Miocene glaciation and a late-Pleistocene glaciation (here the Last Glacial Maximum, LGM), starting from their respective interglacial conditions.

 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each of the four topographies and starting from the warm spin-up simulations, four glacial simulations differing in the ocean-induced sub-ice-shelf melt rates and calving criterion (hereafter referred to as ocean forcing) are carried out (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). In the first group of simulations (control, Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>), ocean sub-ice-shelf melt rates are set to the spatially uniform value of 0.05 m/yr above 1000 meters depth and 1 m/yr below. Although some previous studies
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span> impose 0 m/yr in their glacial simulations, recent ocean modeling of the LGM
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span> shows that ocean water nearby the AIS margins is not at freezing point everywhere which is why we impose a minimal sub-ice-shelf melt rates over the continental shelf. Calving thickness thresholds are prescribed based on literature estimates varying between 150 meters
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span> and 200 meters
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>. These studies agree on the fact that the re-expansion of the AIS after a collapse is almost impossible if the calving threshold remains larger than 150 meters. Therefore, in our simulations we test intermediate ad-hoc calving threshold values of 120 meters and 160 meters (OF2, Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>).

Simulations are repeated by inhibiting glacial isostasy (black bars) or by enhancing the impact of basal hydrology (grey bars).

 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recent idealized LGM ocean simulations using the present-day Antarctic configuration
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span> show that, despite global cold climate conditions, sub-ice-shelf melt rates in the vicinity of the Antarctic continental shelf break remain relatively high, close to present-day values, and penetration of warm Circum Polar Deep Water on the continental shelf occurs only in specific locations of the continental shelf edge. Therefore, in a second group of simulations (OF3 and OF4, Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a> using the two different calving thresholds described above), a quadratic temperature-depth relationship on sub-ice-shelf melt rates is used
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>. These simulations yield very low melt rates for shallow depths and larger melt rates at the grounding line, which on average leads to a value of 0.06 m/yr, close to that imposed in the first group of simulations using OF1.

 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To disentangle the effect of climate from the effect of eustatic sea level change, three different sets of simulations (using the settings outlined in the preceding paragraph) are carried out: (1) mid-Miocene glaciation (with mid-Miocene glacial climate
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>) and eustatic sea level prescribed at 70 meters below present-day global mean sea level from a previous study
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>); (2) full late-Pleistocene (with LGM climate
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>) and eustatic sea level set at −120 m (mean LGM sea level fall over various reconstructions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a>); (3) a set of late-Pleistocene simulations using mid-Miocene glacial eustatic sea level of −70 m (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>). Thereby, the comparison between the Miocene and the later set of simulations gives the impact of atmospheric forcing on the AIS dynamics (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3d</a>), and the comparison between the full late Pleistocene and the later experiments provide the effect of eustatic sea level (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3e</a>). Those simulations are considered as the standard simulations (with GIA but no prescribed basal sediments) throughout this study. All those simulations are repeated by inhibiting GIA to investigate its impact on the AIS dynamics in the various simulations. Simulations are carried out once again (with GIA) prescribing basal sediments and thus enabling the acceleration of ice flow if basal sediments are thick (see Supplementary Information). All simulations settings are detailed in Tables 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>. In total, 180 simulations are carried out, varying sub-shelf melting, calving threshold, eustatic sea level and atmospheric forcing (surface air temperature and precipitation) for each topography.
