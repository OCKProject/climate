 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results show that the gradual deepening of the outer continental shelf from EOT to RBEDMAP2 induces an overall gradual decrease in ice volume along with increasing calving and sub-ice-shelf melting. This is particularly marked for DEEP_MIO and RBEDMAP2 in all three sets of simulations (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). This decrease is independent of the atmospheric forcing or prescribed eustatic sea level. This is because a larger portion of the ice sheet is gradually exposed to the oceanic conditions (hereafter represented by sub-ice-shelf melting and calving) during the AIS advance on the continental shelf. However, the AIS dynamical behaviour differs between mid-Miocene and late-Pleistocene simulations. Sensitivity to ocean forcing increases notably when using RBEDMAP2 topography under mid-Miocene climate conditions. The large accumulation simulated in the Miocene experiments compensates for the ocean forcing, while this is not the case in the late-Pleistocene experiments.

 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, the Miocene wet climate leads to higher simulated ice volumes than under the dry late-Pleistocene glacial climate conditions (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b,c</a>). But as a consequence of our steady-state experiments, the LGM final ice volumes (despite lower accumulation rates) are comparable to that of the middle Miocene when using fixed low sub-ice-shelf melting rates. As a result of the difference in accumulation between the mid-Miocene and the late-Pleistocene simulations, the mechanisms causing the discrepancies in ice volume differ when using the most over-deepened bathymetry, i.e. RBEDMAP2. When an ice sheet is in dynamical equilibrium, ice fluxes through the grounding line partly compensate for sub-ice-shelf melting, dampening the thinning of the ice shelves. In fact, the mid-Miocene simulations exhibit a higher sensitivity to calving than to sub-ice-shelf melting (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a>). The opposite occurs in the late-Pleistocene simulations in which ocean basal melting prevails on calving because ice fluxes through the grounding line are weaker than in the mid-Miocene simulations (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>). Finally when using RBEDMAP2, and with a sea level set at −70 m, the grounding line is located upstream to that simulated with a lower sea level (−120 m) because the ice sheet starts floating earlier than in the full late-Pleistocene simulations. Consequently, in the full late-Pleistocene simulations, the AIS can advance farther on the outer shelf and ice volumes are larger than when sea level is set to −70 m, but the AIS results more sensitive to oceanic conditions (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>).

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The capability of the AIS to anchor on bathymetric highs and pinning points is essential to its expansion. The weight of the ice sheet modulates the elevation of the bathymetric highs, and hence its ability to expand through glacio-isostatic adjustment (GIA). It has been recently shown that the fast rebound of the lithosphere in specific areas can partly compensate for the Marine Ice Sheet Instability by increasing the bed elevation, thereby providing new pinning points to the ice sheet

  </span>. In our ice sheet model, GIA follows an Elastic-Lithosphere-Relaxing-Astenosphere (ELRA) parameterization
  <span class="sup">

  </span>, which is a simplified version of the fully self-gravitational GIA theory used in recent studies

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span>. Nevertheless, the ELRA has been shown to satisfactorily capture the essential effect of GIA
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span> and is enough to illustrate the first order feedback between GIA, bathymetry and ice dynamics. In our mid-Miocene simulations, inhibiting GIA (black bars) yields lower ice volumes and reduces the sensitivity to ocean forcing (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>) because the AIS is not able to pin and expand. This is particularly striking for the late-Pleistocene simulations using RBEDMAP2 while in the mid-Miocene simulations, the large accumulation rates again allow the AIS to advance on the outer continental shelf. With an intermediate eustatic sea level, the ice sheet starts floating earlier than in the full late-Pleistocene simulations (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>), which prevents the expansion of the AIS on the outer continental shelf and limits the impact of inhibiting GIA.

 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, we examine the role of basal hydrology on the AIS dynamics. It has been observed that the presence of water -saturated soft sediments or basal meltwater at the base of the AIS can trigger an acceleration of the ice flow and induce large ice discharges to the ocean
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>. In our ice -sheet model, the presence of saturated sediments is used as a trigger to accelerate basal velocities (see Methods). As a result, in our mid-Miocene and late-Pleistocene simulations the acceleration of the ice flow leads to a smaller grounded ice volume (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>, grey bars). The largest discrepancies with the mid-Miocene and late-Pleistocene standard simulations occur when using mostly emerged topographies (EOT and SHALLOW_MIO). Basal hydrology indeed, applies only to the grounded part of the ice sheet and thus depends on the extent of the grounded area, which is likely to be larger over mostly emerged topographies. The main difference between mid-Miocene and late-Pleistocene simulations over EOT and SHALLOW_MIO resides in the extent of the area of saturated sediments. Relatively warm glacial mid-Miocene climate conditions yield thicker ice sheets, higher amount of basal meltwater and larger warm-based area than in the late-Pleistocene simulations (shown and discussed below). Because the ice flow over EOT and SHALLOW_MIO topographies is mostly driven by the basal hydrology conditions in both mid-Miocene and late-Pleistocene simulations, the sensitivity to ocean and atmospheric forcing is weaker than in the standard simulations. This holds for all cases.
