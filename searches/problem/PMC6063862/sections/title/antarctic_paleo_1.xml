 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the absence of pan-Antarctic paleo-topography and paleo-bathymetry reconstructions for the middle-Miocene, previous studies investigating the impact of past subglacial topography on AIS dynamics artificially increased or decreased elevation

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. Partial regional reconstructions of the mid-Miocene glacial paleo-bathymetry exist though, for example for the Ross Sea
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span> or for the Weddell Sea
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. Both reconstructions suggest that large progradation of the continental shelf occurred until about the mid-Miocene Climate Optimum (MCO, ≈17–14.3 Ma). Subsequent glaciations caused a widespread erosional event, documented in several locations around Antarctica, that led to the truncation of the stratal units that were deposited before the MCO. This event is dated around 16.7–14.2 Ma in the Ross Sea
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. Those reconstructions (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>) only exist for a limited spatial domain whereas pan-Antarctic paleo-topography and bathymetry are required as boundary conditions for ice sheet models. Furthermore, the age of those reconstructed mid-Miocene paleo-bathymetries is still uncertain. Following the philosophy of previous studies

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first mid-Miocene topography, SHALLOW_MIO, assumes that most of the deepening of WAIS and of East Antarctica (EAIS) marine basins, including the filling and expansion of the outer-most margins, occurs after the MCO (upper bound of the mid-Miocene glacial erosional event). It therefore still has very shallow bathymetry (most of West Antarctica is emerged) and relatively-smaller continental shelves at 15 Ma (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>). Conversely, the second topography DEEP_MIO tests the hypothesis that part of the deepening of the WAIS and of the EAIS marine basins, as well as filling and expansion of the margins, occurs before the MCO (upper bound of the mid-Miocene glacial erosional event) and has deeper bathymetry and broader continental shelves than SHALLOW_MIO (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1d</a>). As expected from geological evidence

  </span> and in the Ross Sea
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span> and our interpolated mid-Miocene bathymetries reveals that DEEP_MIO is in better agreement with data-based reconstructions than SHALLOW_MIO (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). The MCO is probably a time with little erosion because the AIS extent is probably small and restricted to the inner continent. Substantial erosion of the continental shelf restarted from the MCT, when atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> started dropping again. In the following analysis, SHALLOW_MIO is considered as an earlier stage of continental shelf expansion relatively to DEEP_MIO. We use these four topographies (EOT, SHALLOW_MIO, DEEP_MIO, and RBEDMAP2) as boundary conditions for ice sheet simulations to test the impact of the gradual deepening and expansion of the continental shelf on the AIS dynamics and its response to mid-Miocene and late-Pleistocene glacial climate conditions as well as to different sub-ice-shelf melting and calving conditions.

     </span>. DSDP sites 270, 271, 272 and 273 are also located. Paradoxically, in the Ross Sea, as in the other Antarctic marine basins, SHALLOW_MIO displays deeper bathymetry than in DEEP_MIO. “Shallow” here refers to the West Antarctic subglacial topography that is mostly emerged and thus shallower than in DEEP_MIO. Because the West Antarctic topography is mostly emerged in SHALLOW_MIO, the Ross-Sea and Weddell-Sea basins (and other marine basins of East Antarctica like the Wilkes Land, for example) are not yet filled by erosion and sediment transport as in DEEP_MIO, in which the West Antarctic topography is mostly below sea level (Fig. 
     <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c,d</a>).
