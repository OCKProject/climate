 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The analysis above aptly illustrates the feedback between topography, ice volume and ocean and atmospheric forcing. Using those conceptual simulations, we next attempt to draw a timeline for the various feedbacks in response to bathymetry changes in which SHALLOW_MIO can be considered as an earlier stage of the Miocene continental shelf evolution than DEEP_MIO. Likewise, RBEDMAP2 represents the last stages of the continental shelf aggradation during the Plio/Pleistocene simulations. Simulations performed over EOT are discarded from the following discussion. Our simulations show a gradual increase in the sensitivity to ocean and atmospheric forcing of the main marine basins of the WAIS and of the EAIS. This is supported by the geological interpretation of the long-term AIS evolution from the middle Miocene to the late Pleistocene (Fig.

  <span class="bold">Pre-MCO glacial stages</span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>). SHALLOW_MIO is mostly emerged or shallow. As such, the AIS sensitivity to ocean forcing is low, except in Victoria Land where the bathymetry is deeper than in the Eastern Ross Sea (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>) and thus exposes the ice sheet to ocean forcing more than in other sectors. Evidence from south Victoria Land
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span> suggests that this sector remained wet-based at least until the mid-Miocene Climatic Transition (MCT, ≈14 Ma Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). Recent seismic reflection analysis
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span> and ANDRILL sediment core records
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span> indicate large sediment supply to the western Ross Sea continental shelf until the late Miocene that is indicative of dynamic glacier activity. In our simulations, most of the AIS is wet-based, except in the central part of the EAIS (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4f</a>), which promotes large erosion potential in the main ice streams areas of the EAIS and over the entire WAIS (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4k</a>). Seismic reflection analysis of different transects across the eastern Ross Sea document large sediment transport from both EAIS and WAIS and fast progradation of the continental shelf until about 16.7–14.2 Ma, abruptly eroded by a subsequent intense glacial activity (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). Our simulations over SHALLOW_MIO and under the mild mid-Miocene glacial climate conditions yield a thick wet-based WAIS (14 m sea level equivalent, SLE, Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>), as inferred from geological evidence
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. Similar to the Ross Sea, most of the Weddell Sea sector is also wet-based in our simulations, which also implies large erosion and transport of sediments to the continental shelf (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4k</a>). This is compatible with the expansion of the continental shelf during the Miocene observed from seismic reflection analysis in both sectors
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. In our simulations, the AIS is stable in Prydz Bay and reaches the continental shelf break, in agreement with observations
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. Finally, in our simulations, the EAIS is massive as a result of the mild mid-Miocene climatic conditions (67 m SLE, Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Over SHALLOW_MIO, in fact, the mean simulated AIS volume exceeds 80 meters SLE, about 22 m SLE larger than current AIS volume (Table

  <span class="bold">First noticeable continental shelf filling and deepening around the MCO</span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b</a>). In DEEP_MIO, the main marine basins around Antarctica are slightly deeper and steeper than in SHALLOW_MIO, especially in Prydz Bay (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1d</a>). Steeper slopes induce a slight inland retreat of the grounding line, in agreement with observations
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. It also exposes a larger part of the ice sheet to the ocean, which amplifies the sensitivity to ocean conditions, increases the discharge, and yields lower simulated EAIS volumes (62 m SLE) than over SHALLOW_MIO. Deeper marine basins also enhance ice streams activity and as a result of elevated basal friction, the amount of basal meltwater increases compared to that simulated over SHALLOW_MIO (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4g</a>). The reduction in sensitivity over the upstream part of Victoria Land results from changes in the bed elevation that probably provide topographic constraints to the ice flow. The deepening of the eastern Ross Sea leads to steeper slopes and thus to a more active WAIS in our simulations. Therefore, the sensitivity of the WAIS in the Ross Sea increases slightly compared to the simulations carried out over SHALLOW_MIO but mean ice volumes are still large (13 m SLE, Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). There is no noticeable expansion of the cold-based area in those simulations (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4g</a>). This is because atmospheric forcing is similar to that prescribed over SHALLOW_MIO (geothermal heat fluxes are also identical in all the simulations). Consequently, erosion potential remains as high as that simulated over SHALLOW_MIO, although it is more focused in the marine basins in response to the deepening of the bathymetry in DEEP_MIO. Over this subglacial topography, the simulated mean AIS volume reaches about 75 meters SLE (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>).

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>. In the absence of a late Miocene simulation with low CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations, we discuss our conceptual simulation carried out over DEEP_MIO, with mid-Miocene eustatic sea level (−70 m) but using the late-Pleistocene glacial atmospheric forcing with low CO
  <sub>2</sub> (i.e., 180 ppm for LGM). Although synoptic circulation may have changed between late Miocene and late Pleistocene, the simulations illustrate the first order impact of low CO
  <sub>2</sub> on the AIS dynamics over a bathymetry not as deep as today. With the cooling and drying of atmospheric forcing, the sensitivity of the entire WAIS, and that of the EAIS at Wilkes and Aurora Basins to ocean forcing increases substantially compared with previous steps (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a>). This highlights the interplay between accumulation and ocean forcing on the ice dynamics. With the lowering of CO
  <sub>2</sub>, climate dries and simulated low accumulation rates yield lower ice fluxes at the grounding line in general, which allows the ocean forcing to have a larger effect along the AIS margins. Recent analysis have shown that, indeed, after the MCO, Wilkes Land remained highly sensitive to ocean forcing
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>. Low air temperatures also induce a substantial expansion of the overall cold-based area especially below the WAIS (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4h</a>). With the expansion of the cold-based area, the basal meltwater production occurs in the narrow valleys, further amplifying the impact of ocean forcing on the AIS dynamics. The AIS then is more prone to fluctuate on the outer continental shelf, further eroding the bed in the narrow valleys (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4k</a>). As a consequence, erosion occurs more intensively along the EAIS margins while it largely diminishes below the WAIS and in the new cold-based areas. Simulated ice volume decreases over both the WAIS (to 10 m SLE, Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>) and the EAIS (to 54 m SLE) compared to the mid-Miocene simulations.

  <span class="bold">Plio/Pleistocene glaciations</span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4e</a>). With deeper but more expanded continental shelves and larger eustatic sea level drops (−120 m), the AIS is able to easily reach the continental shelf edge in the Weddell Sea and in the Ross Sea. Compared with previous simulations on shallower mid-Miocene bathymetries, with an overdeepened bathymetry such as RBEDMAP2, large sea level drops allow the AIS to fluctuate on a larger area of the outer continental shelf. As a result, the AIS is highly sensitive to ocean forcing, more than previously over the shallower mid-Miocene bathymetries. In this case, glacio-isostatic adjustment, combined with a larger sea level drop, is essential to the expansion of the AIS as shown previously (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>). No further expansion of the cold-based area occurs relatively to the previous step (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4j</a>) since prescribed atmospheric forcing are similar (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a> uses LGM climate forcing). As a result, erosion potential is highly similar to the one simulated in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a>. Because accumulation is low, the simulated AIS volume decreases to 66 m SLE (WAIS = 12 m SLE; EAIS = 55 m SLE) but is slightly larger than in the previous simulations. This is because in DEEP_MIO, the continental shelves are not as expanded as in RBEDMAP2, which limits the expansion of the AIS.

  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4g,h</a>. Results also suggest that mid-Miocene ice volumes might have been significantly larger as a result of wetter climate conditions during Mid-Miocene glaciations than during late-Pleistocene glaciations (Table
