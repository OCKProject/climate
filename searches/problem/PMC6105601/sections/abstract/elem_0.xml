  <sub>3</sub> δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O is a commonly employed paleomonsoon proxy. However, inferring local rainfall amount from speleothem δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O can be complicated due to changing source water δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O, temperature effects, and rainout over the moisture transport path. These complications are addressed using δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O of planktonic foraminiferal CaCO
  <sub>3</sub>, offshore from the Yangtze River Valley (YRV). The advantage is that the effects of global seawater δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O and local temperature changes can be quantitatively removed, yielding a record of local seawater δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O, a proxy that responds primarily to dilution by local precipitation and runoff. Whereas YRV speleothem δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O is dominated by precession-band (23 ky) cyclicity, local seawater δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O is dominated by eccentricity (100 ky) and obliquity (41 ky) cycles, with almost no precession-scale variance. These results, consistent with records outside the YRV, suggest that East Asian monsoon rainfall is more sensitive to greenhouse gas and high-latitude ice sheet forcing than to direct insolation forcing.
