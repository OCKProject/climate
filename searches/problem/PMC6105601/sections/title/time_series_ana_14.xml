For model-proxy comparisons, the bandwidth is 0.0167, non-zero coherence is &gt;0.3844, and the error estimation on the power spectrum is 0.6255. For proxy–proxy comparisons, the bandwidth is 0.0127, non-zero coherence is &gt;0.3844, and the error estimation on the power spectrum is 0.6255.

 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Individual linear spectra were calculated using the Analyseries periodogram function and a Bartlett window. The periodogram produces an unsmoothed spectrum (equivalent to the Blackman–Tukey with a 100% lag). It is useful in that it does not smooth away side lobes that may be present due to, for example, time scale inaccuracies. Since Analyseries does not have a means of assessing confidence, the Periodogram tool on the NASA Exoplanet Archive site (
