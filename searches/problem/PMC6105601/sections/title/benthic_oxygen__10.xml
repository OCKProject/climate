 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">U1429 was sampled at 10, 15, 25, or 30 cm. Samples were dried in an oven at 40 °C, wet-sieved at 63 μm, and dried in an oven at 40 °C. Three to ten well-preserved tests (
  <span class="italic">Uvigerina</span> spp, 
  <span class="italic">C. wuellerstorfi</span> depending on availability) were broken into large fragments, cleaned in alcohol in an ultrasonic bath, then dried at 40 °C. In a few samples, where foraminiferal density was low, only 1–2 specimens were analyzed. Measurements were made with the Finnigan MAT 251 mass spectrometer at the Leibniz Laboratory, Kiel University. The instrument is coupled on-line to a Carbo-Kiel Device (Type I). Samples were reacted by individual acid addition (99% H
  <sub>3</sub>PO
  <sub>4</sub> at 73 °C). Standard external error is better than ±0.07‰ and ±0.05% for δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O and δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C, respectively. Replicate measurements on ~5% of samples indicate mean reproducibility better than ±0.11‰ and ±0.13‰ for δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O and δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C, respectively. Results were calibrated using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (Gaithersburg, Maryland) carbonate isotope standard NBS 19 along with three internal standards, and are reported on the PeeDee belemnite (VPDB) scale.
