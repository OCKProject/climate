 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">U1429 was sampled at 5 cm resolution from 0 to 25 m below sea floor (mbsf), at 5 or 10 cm resolution from 25 to 35 mbsf, and at 5, 10, or 15 cm resolution from 35 to 181 mbsf. Samples were freeze-dried, wet-sieved at 63 μm, and dried in an oven at 50 °C. The &gt;63 μm fraction was then sieved into four size fractions, 63–150, 150–250, 250–355, and &gt;355 μm. Approximately 50 individual 
  <span class="italic">G. ruber</span> (white, sensu stricto) were picked from the 250–355 μm size fraction for both stable isotope (δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O, δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C) and Mg/Ca analysis. Approximately 30 and 20 individuals were used for Mg/Ca and stable isotope analyses respectively. Samples for stable isotope analyses were sonified in ethanol to remove fine clays, homogenized, and subsampled (~80 μg CaCO
  <sub>3</sub>) for analysis on the Brown University MAT252 IRMS coupled to a Kiel III carbonate device. Samples were reacted by individual acid addition (99% H
  <sub>3</sub>PO
  <sub>4</sub> at 70 °C). A total of 2031 
  <span class="italic">G. ruber</span> samples and a total of 314 standards (BYM and Carrara) were analyzed. Repeated analyses of Brown Yule Marble (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 116, 1σ) yields −2.27 ± 0.03 for δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C and −6.48 ± 0.07 for δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O. Carrara Marble (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 198, 1
  <span class="italic">σ</span>) yield 2.03 ± 0.03 for δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C and −1.89 ± 0.05 for δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O. Replicate analysis of homogenized foraminifera samples (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 42, 1
  <span class="italic">σ</span>) yields ± 0.05 for δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O and ± 0.03 for δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C. All results were calibrated to National Institute of Standards and Technology (Gaithersburg, Maryland) carbonate isotope standard NBS 19 and are reported as ‰ VPDB.
