The metal/Ca ratios of most of samples were determined with a Thermo Scientific ELEMENT XR, a double focusing sector field inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP–MS) at the Mutsu Institute for Oceanography (MIO); 87 samples in MIS 5 were determined with an ELEMENT 2 at the University of Toyama

The precision of the measurement was checked by replicate measurement (every five to six samples) of working standards produced at MIO from high purity standards (1000 ± 3 mg/L) SPEX Claritas PPT. Relative standard deviation (RSD) of the working standards was &lt;2.6% at MIO. The CaCO

  <span class="italic">Porites</span> standard material JCp-1, whose Mg/Ca values was internationally determined (4.199 ± 0.065 mmol/mol
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">69</a>

  <span class="italic">N</span> = 11) mmol/mol at the University of Toyama. Based on the difference of Mg/Ca between two laboratories, 0.0131 mmol/mol was added for the Mg/Ca data measured at the University of Toyama. In addition to Mg/Ca, Mn/Ca were measured to monitor the contamination by diagenetic coating. Mn/Ca of 99% of the samples were less than 0.5 mmol/mol. As there was no positive relationship between Mg/Ca and Mn/Ca (&gt;0.5 mmol/mol), we did not eliminate high Mn/Ca samples.
