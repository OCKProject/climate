 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study of orbital-scale climate change during the late Pleistocene is unique in that the signal-to-noise ratio is large, the external forcing (insolation) is known, and the critical internal forcings (greenhouse gases and terrestrial ice volume) are extremely well constrained. As such, it should be possible to assess the underlying mechanisms driving climate change at this time scale, as well as the relative sensitivity to these forcings. The orbital time scale (10
  <span class="sup">4</span> to 10
  <span class="sup">5</span> yr) is also important because the frequency and amplitude of abrupt, centennial, and millennial-scale events may vary with changes in the longer-term mean state

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>. Here the focus is on orbital-scale variability in the East Asian Monsoon (EAM), defined as variance concentrated at periods (period = 1/frequency) associated with the eccentricity (~100 ky), obliquity (~41 ky), and precession (~23 and ~19 ky) characteristics of the Earth–Sun orbital geometry
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. Understanding changes in monsoon precipitation as function of changing insolation, global ice-volume, and greenhouse gases is a primary goal of paleoclimate research given the prospect of climate-induced changes in summer-season rainfall impacting agriculture, and food production.

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An extensive array of paleomonsoon proxies has been developed and applied throughout the Indian Monsoon and EAM regions in an effort to reconstruct and understand the mechanisms driving changes in rainfall as recorded in loess, lake, cave, and marine archives

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. Most EAM proxy records contain variance associated with eccentricity, obliquity, precession, and heterodynes thereof; usually with the largest concentrations of variance at eccentricity, obliquity, or orbital-associated heterodynes

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. This indicates that the EAM responds strongly to global ice volume and greenhouse gasses

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span> (also dominated by eccentricity-band and obliquity-band variance), as well as insolation forcing (dominated by precession-band variance). Heterodyne variance in EAM and other records
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span> arises from incorporation of variance from climatic processes operating at different primary orbital periods
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span> and can be calculated by adding and subtracting primary orbital frequencies (frequency = 1/period). For example, the interaction of variance at eccentricity periods of 130.6, 123.8, 98.7, and 94.7 ky with obliquity at 41.1 ky yields heterodyne spectral peaks at periods ranging from 28.7 to 31.3 ky and from 60 to 72.6 ky (e.g., 1

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A primary exception is the composite speleothem δ

 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here four new highly-resolved records from International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Site U1429 in the East China Sea (ECS) are presented and used to reconstruct local seawater δ
