 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A traditional marine chronostratigraphy (benthic age model) was established by mapping the U1429 benthic δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O to the global benthic stack
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>
  </span> over the past 400 ky (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). This was accomplished by correlation of structure in the two records using the Linage function in Analyseries

  </span>. Cross-spectral analysis documents high coherence (&gt;0.95CI) and near-zero phase at the eccentricity (−2 ± 0.7 ky), obliquity (0.5 ± 0.5 ky) and precession bands (−0.7 ± 0.3 ky) (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>). The 100- and 41-ky variance was then removed from planktonic δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O (benthic age model) by notch filtering the 100- and 41-ky variance (Methods). The result was then mapped to the Cheng et al.

  <span class="sup">18</span>O record using the Analyseries Linage function (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). This fine-tuning of the U1429 benthic age model (cave-based age model) is justified on the basis that benthic δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O on the two age models are highly coherent (&gt;0.99 CI) with near-zero phase at the eccentricity (0.08 ± 0.35 ky), obliquity (−0.23 ± 0.29 ky) and precession (0.23 ± 0.17 ky) bands.
