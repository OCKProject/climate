At the end of each year of the simulation, the orbital parameters and the atmospheric greenhouse gases were advanced by 100 years. When the model boundary conditions changed (e.g., land-ocean boundaries changing due to sea level rise or fall equivalent to 40 m), all the components of the model were reconfigured manually and the model was restarted using the previous year as the initial conditions. This acceleration technique, similar to those used in other paleoclimatic modeling studies

  <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The experiment consisted of three separate simulations, beginning with an insolation only simulation, followed by addition of greenhouse gasses, followed by addition of ice-volume and sea level (Fox-Kemper et al., manuscript in preparation). Successively adding boundary conditions is a useful method for understanding the sensitivity of the model response to these forcing mechanisms. Results in this manuscript are from the simulation using the full set of boundary conditions. Model precipitation data were averaged for the regions depicted in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>. Monthly maximum, minimum, and annual average model output were used in comparison with proxy data. Use of monthly maximum and minimum values (as opposed JJA, DFJ) accounts for the fact that the timing of maximum insolation, in the northern hemisphere (for example), can occur in May, June, or July depending on the orbital configuration and is thus, not tied to any single orbital configuration (e.g., June 21 Perihelion).

  <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Currently, accelerated models assume that Earth’s orbit is fixed, meaning that changes in the length and strength of Earth’s seasons due to changes in Earth’s orbital parameters are not accounted for in the definition of the calendar upon which monthly values are computed. While this is not a major issue for Holocene-scale studies

The periodogram produces an unsmoothed spectrum (equivalent to the Blackman–Tukey with a 100% lag). It is useful in that it does not smooth away side lobes that may be present due to, for example, time scale inaccuracies.
