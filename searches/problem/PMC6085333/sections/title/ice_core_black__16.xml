  </span> at 77.5° N, 51.2° W and 2480 m above sea level. The Colle Gnifetti (CG) Swiss-Italian Alps ice core
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span> at 45.6° N, 7.5° E and 4450 m above sea level. Each site has BC measurements for different historical periods: D4 1788 to 2002; NEEM 78 to 1998; CG has a single year PI measurement at 1750 and an average PD measurement between 1950 and 1980. The CG site is located within a heterogeneous alpine environment and BC concentrations in both time periods are calculated as the average concentrations from the model level matching the ice core site over six grid cells: the grid cell containing the CG site plus the grid cells directly to the east, west, south, southeast and southwest, those adjacent to the north were not included as it is assumed the Alps would provide a barrier to continental air flow. As the Greenland sites are within a more homogenous Arctic environment BC concentrations in both time periods are calculated at the ground level within the closest four grid cell containing the site.

 <p id="Par50" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While our model does not directly calculate BC concentrations in snow, as the processes involved are not represented, deposition data was retrieved from the model in a previous study
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span> and tested offline within the Community Land Model, which does represent the relevant processes. Results from this study showed that GLOMAP simulates BC deposition close to the mean for the Arctic region
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>. We therefore expect relative BC changes in air and in ice to be approximately comparable. Ice core measurements of fire emission tracers are sparse, limiting our analysis to BC, levoglucosan and vanillic acid (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). We therefore assume that as the trends in these three species are generally similar pre-1880 (wide scale industrialisation) that POM and SO
  <sub>2</sub> will follow similar trends. Limitations in comparing PI ice core measurements to PI modelled atmospheric concentrations centre on a lack of understanding of how the PI atmospheric state was behaving
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>
  </span>. For example, there are uncertainties in aerosol transport and residence time, chemical transformation and deposition processes to Arctic regions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" href="#CR92">92</a>
  </span>. Furthermore, in this study we assume that these processes are the same in the PI as the PD, although some could be different
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93" href="#CR93">93</a>
  </span>, and by using a single year’s meteorology we do not capture possible changes to modelled deposition process (e.g., precipitation rates) at the ice core location. Another issue is relating the modelled regional aerosol emissions and processes to the point measurements of a single ice core, which can also capture emissions from varying sources. To account for uncertainties in the PI period caused by natural variability in fire activity and atmospheric circulation, the Greenland and Wyoming ice core BC concentrations in the PI were calculated as a 20-year mean (D4: 1788–1807, NEEM: 1740–1759, Wyoming: 1747–1766). In the PD Greenland ice core BC concentrations are also heavily influenced by industrial emissions that have been decreasing in strength over the past decades. We therefore calculate Greenland ice core means over a shorter 5-year period (D4: 1998–2002, NEEM: 1994–1998), and the Wyoming ice core over a 10 year period (1970–1979). The PD/PI ratio range was calculated using the standard error of the mean. The mean PD/PI BC, ratio for 5, 10 and 20-year averages in both time periods, and the standard errors, are shown in Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>. Mean PI BC concentrations from the Wyoming ice core are highly sensitive to the chosen PI start year; altering from 1747 (first year in the record) to 1750 (first year in the fire emission datasets) would increase mean PI BC concentrations by 23%, further reducing the measurement-based PD/PI BC ratio. For model M and observation O the symmetric bias factor was calculated as: For M &gt; O: (M/O)−1; For O &gt; M: –(O/M) + 1. Uncertainty in the CMIP6 industrial BC emission inventory used to calculate the decrease in BC emissions from anthropogenic activity in the region of the WY (factor of 1.6) and CG (factor of 2) glacier ice cores could be up to a factor of two
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">78</a>
  </span>, however as the uncertainties in European and American BC emission datasets are much lower than other regions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>
  </span> we estimate the uncertainty at ±25%.

 <p id="Par51" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Specific fire emission tracers are also recorded within the Greenland ice cores: yearly measurements of Vanillic acid (VA) at D4 and sub-decadal (~2 measurements decade
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) Levoglucosan (LG) measurements at NEEM. The mean PD/PI VA and LG ratio for 5, 10 and 20-year averages in both time periods, and the standard errors, are shown in Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>. The sub-decadal NEEM data has a large fire year within the 20-year mean (155 ng/g LG compared to a mean of 44 ng/g LG without that year) and therefore the PD/PI ratio is shown both with and without this year included. Measurements of LG and VA show that PD fire emissions deposited to Greenland have decreased since the PI, further supporting the fire model emission data (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>).
