  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> shows annual mean PI cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations simulated by the aerosol model for the four fire emission scenarios (see Methods). Global monthly mean PI CCN concentrations at 915 hPa (approximately low-level warm cloud base) are 110 cm
  <span class="sup">−3</span> when using CMIP6 emissions; this is a factor of 1.1 higher than those calculated using AeroCom emissions. Compared to using CMIP6 emissions, CCN concentrations are a factor of 1.3 higher when using SIMFIRE-BLAZE emissions and a factor 1.7 higher when using LMfire emissions (see Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a>). Over continental regions, the increases in CCN concentrations are even greater relative to using the CMIP6 emissions, a factor of 1.5 higher using SIMFIRE-BLAZE emissions and a factor of 2.1 higher using LMfire emissions. A large portion of this difference is due to substantially increased fire emissions in the NH mid-latitudes (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). In general, using CMIP6 emissions results in increases in CCN concentrations in all regions compared to using AeroCom emissions, the exceptions being near the high PD deforestation regions of Brazil and both polar regions. Over Africa, CCN concentrations are higher in extra-tropical regions but lower in tropical regions when incorporating LMfire or SIMFIRE-BLAZE fire emissions compared to CMIP6. Over Indonesia and northern Australia CCN concentrations are higher when incorporating LMfire emissions compared to using CMIP6 emissions, while using SIMFIRE-BLAZE emissions yields lower CCN concentrations. Downwind of southern Australia and Patagonia both fire model emission datasets lead to higher CCN concentrations than when using CMIP6 fire emissions, but similar or lower CCN concentrations are calculated over most of the Southern Ocean when using the two fire models. Incorporating SIMFIRE-BLAZE and LMfire emissions results in marine CCN concentrations that are 1.2–1.5 times higher than when using CMIP6 emissions, due to long-range aerosol transport. The current study shows that pre-industrial fire emissions cause larger uncertainty in CCN (and hence pre-industrial to present-day aerosol indirect forcing) than the combined estimate in Hamilton et al.
