Estimates of historical fire emissions are derived by merging the satellite record with fire proxy records (fire tracers contained within snow and ice and the charcoal record) in regions with suitable proxy coverage (North America and Europe), and by using the mean of six fire models in regions of limited proxy record coverage. Within the tropical rainforest regions of Equatorial Asia (including Indonesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia) and South America fire emissions are held constant back in time from 1960 and 1970, respectively. Agricultural fires are also kept relatively constant over time. Here we use the mean of emissions from 1750 to 1770 to represent the PI and the mean of emissions from 2006 to 2015 to represent the PD. The CMIP6 PI dataset is presented here as a lower bound to, and likely underestimates, the magnitude of PI fire emissions because the fire models used to construct the main part of the inventory are unable to reproduce the observed 24% decrease in global burned area over the last 18 years due to human impact

Next, a climate driver dataset was generated from a 1080-year climate dataset by dividing the 140-year detrended climate anomalies into twelve 30-year blocks at 10-year intervals. Anomalies were then sampled using a pseudo-random scheme where once a block was chosen it was not selected again until all of the other remaining blocks have been selected. In order to generate a 1080-year timeseries 36 blocks were selected, i.e., each block was used three times but appeared in a different order each time. Finally, each anomaly timeseries was added to its complementary baseline climatological mean climate field, and used the resulting 1080-year (12960-month) climate data input file to run LMfire. For the PI simulation in LMfire, we used only the last 150 years of this model run, i.e., years 931–1080, as this is the period where all of the model pools are considered to be in equilibrium, although we acknowledge that the actual state of the terrestrial biosphere in the late preindustrial Holocene may have been far from equilibrium in many regions

   </span>, and burning on used land is largely eliminated in many parts of the world, the PD simulation of LMfire still overestimates mean annual burned area in parts of the world, notably in the western United States, southern Europe, and the Middle East. Because these are PD regions known to be subject to large-scale industrial fire suppression efforts, we accounted for this fire suppression by further correcting the LMfire output in a model postprocessing step. To identify regions affected by potential model bias, we compared modelled burned area with GFED4s at the level of GFED regions, with Europe further subdivided into North and South at 45° N (Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>). Within those regions where the discrepancy between modelled and observed burned area was ≥90%, i.e., the USA, southern Europe, and Middle East, we assumed that the primary reason for the discrepancy was active fire suppression. To correct this model PD bias in these regions, we scaled the modelled BC emissions by the ratio of GFED4s observed to LMfire modelled burned area calculated at the GFED regional level. This resulted in a slightly &lt;10% decrease to the global BC annual emission flux. In all other regions, we used modelled BC emissions without bias correction because the discrepancy was smaller and we could not justify industrial fire suppression as being the potential primary cause of model-data mismatch. The primary region where simulated burned area remains overestimated by LMfire is in the tropical seasonal forests of South America. This is both a region of rapid land use change over recent decades where anthropogenic influences on burning may not be well captured in the PD LMfire simulation, and where it has already been identified

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>

Each site has BC measurements for different historical periods: D4 1788 to 2002; NEEM 78 to 1998; CG has a single year PI measurement at 1750 and an average PD measurement between 1950 and 1980. The CG site is located within a heterogeneous alpine environment and BC concentrations in both time periods are calculated as the average concentrations from the model level matching the ice core site over six grid cells: the grid cell containing the CG site plus the grid cells directly to the east, west, south, southeast and southwest, those adjacent to the north were not included as it is assumed the Alps would provide a barrier to continental air flow. As the Greenland sites are within a more homogenous Arctic environment BC concentrations in both time periods are calculated at the ground level within the closest four grid cell containing the site.

  <p id="Par50" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While our model does not directly calculate BC concentrations in snow, as the processes involved are not represented, deposition data was retrieved from the model in a previous study
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
   </span> and tested offline within the Community Land Model, which does represent the relevant processes. Results from this study showed that GLOMAP simulates BC deposition close to the mean for the Arctic region
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
   </span>. We therefore expect relative BC changes in air and in ice to be approximately comparable. Ice core measurements of fire emission tracers are sparse, limiting our analysis to BC, levoglucosan and vanillic acid (Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). We therefore assume that as the trends in these three species are generally similar pre-1880 (wide scale industrialisation) that POM and SO
   <sub>2</sub> will follow similar trends. Limitations in comparing PI ice core measurements to PI modelled atmospheric concentrations centre on a lack of understanding of how the PI atmospheric state was behaving
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>
   </span>. For example, there are uncertainties in aerosol transport and residence time, chemical transformation and deposition processes to Arctic regions
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" href="#CR92">92</a>
   </span>. Furthermore, in this study we assume that these processes are the same in the PI as the PD, although some could be different
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93" href="#CR93">93</a>
   </span>, and by using a single year’s meteorology we do not capture possible changes to modelled deposition process (e.g., precipitation rates) at the ice core location. Another issue is relating the modelled regional aerosol emissions and processes to the point measurements of a single ice core, which can also capture emissions from varying sources. To account for uncertainties in the PI period caused by natural variability in fire activity and atmospheric circulation, the Greenland and Wyoming ice core BC concentrations in the PI were calculated as a 20-year mean (D4: 1788–1807, NEEM: 1740–1759, Wyoming: 1747–1766). In the PD Greenland ice core BC concentrations are also heavily influenced by industrial emissions that have been decreasing in strength over the past decades. We therefore calculate Greenland ice core means over a shorter 5-year period (D4: 1998–2002, NEEM: 1994–1998), and the Wyoming ice core over a 10 year period (1970–1979). The PD/PI ratio range was calculated using the standard error of the mean. The mean PD/PI BC, ratio for 5, 10 and 20-year averages in both time periods, and the standard errors, are shown in Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>. Mean PI BC concentrations from the Wyoming ice core are highly sensitive to the chosen PI start year; altering from 1747 (first year in the record) to 1750 (first year in the fire emission datasets) would increase mean PI BC concentrations by 23%, further reducing the measurement-based PD/PI BC ratio. For model M and observation O the symmetric bias factor was calculated as: For M &gt; O: (M/O)−1; For O &gt; M: –(O/M) + 1. Uncertainty in the CMIP6 industrial BC emission inventory used to calculate the decrease in BC emissions from anthropogenic activity in the region of the WY (factor of 1.6) and CG (factor of 2) glacier ice cores could be up to a factor of two
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">78</a>
   </span>, however as the uncertainties in European and American BC emission datasets are much lower than other regions
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>
   </span> we estimate the uncertainty at ±25%.

  <p id="Par51" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Specific fire emission tracers are also recorded within the Greenland ice cores: yearly measurements of Vanillic acid (VA) at D4 and sub-decadal (~2 measurements decade
   <span class="sup">−1</span>) Levoglucosan (LG) measurements at NEEM. The mean PD/PI VA and LG ratio for 5, 10 and 20-year averages in both time periods, and the standard errors, are shown in Supplementary Table

The sub-decadal NEEM data has a large fire year within the 20-year mean (155 ng/g LG compared to a mean of 44 ng/g LG without that year) and therefore the PD/PI ratio is shown both with and without this year included. Measurements of LG and VA show that PD fire emissions deposited to Greenland have decreased since the PI, further supporting the fire model emission data (Supplementary Table
