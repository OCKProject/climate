 <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dry biomass burned from both fire models is used to calculate fire emissions (mass of aerosol species emitted per mass of dry matter burned) in each grid cell using carbonaceous aerosol emission factors from Li et al.

 <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Total biomass available as fuel (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>) is calculated for SIMFIRE-BLAZE as the sum of carbon in living vegetation and the carbon in litter, and for LMfire as the sum of living vegetation in herbaceous vegetation and the carbon in litter. The spatial distribution of PI biomass is largely similar to the PD

  </span> with peak biomass amounts simulated in SH tropical and NH boreal regions and appreciable biomass amounts in NH mid-latitudes (particularly around the Mediterranean and Eastern USA and China regions). Burned area (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>) is defined as the annual mean fraction of the grid cell which burns over the studied simulation time frame. Burned area in LMfire is calculated based on the well-established Rothermel equations of rate of fire spread, so fires spread only when fuel is available. Globally, modelled maxima in burned area for both LMfire and SIMFIRE-BLAZE do not exceed PD maxima observed burned areas within African Savannah regions

 <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Different representations of anthropogenic land cover and land use change over the industrial period in each fire dataset contribute significantly to the difference in PI emissions at northern mid-latitudes (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). The AeroCom and CMIP6 datasets assume that anthropogenic land cover does not change much over time, which is unrealistic
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" href="#CR76">76</a>
  </span>, and therefore PI emissions are spatially co-located with observed PD emissions. The SIMFIRE-BLAZE simulation incorporates the HYDE 3.1 dataset
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" href="#CR77">77</a>
  </span> within the host LPJ-GUESS vegetation model, which linearly extrapolates historical land cover change based on 1961 land use, and results in increases to anthropogenic land use in western Europe at 1750

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>
  </span>. The LMfire simulation incorporates the KK10 dataset
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>
  </span> within the host LPJ vegetation model, which assumes a Boserupian view of non-linear land use intensification where low population densities lead to fast anthropogenic land expansion
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>
  </span>. The LMfire simulation therefore features significantly more anthropogenic land use in the early PI period than SIMFIRE-BLAZE, particularly over Eurasia, India, southeast Asia and Africa
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>
  </span>. As LMfire incorporates a dedicated modelling scheme for simulating post-harvest agricultural fires, the extra impact of agricultural fires on emissions from cropland areas are contributing to the larger emissions in these regions compared to SIMFIRE-BLAZE. In these simulations 10% of the annual agricultural biomass is assumed to be left on the field post-harvest and subsequently burned each year.
 </p>
 <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">LMfire emissions are approximately a factor 2 higher than SIMFIRE-BLAZE while CMIP6 approximately a factor of 2 lower. This level of uncertainty in fire emissions is half that reported in Lee et al.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">78</a>
  </span> and common place when comparing modelled fire-related aerosol optical depth (AOD) to measured AOD. For example, Reddington et al.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" href="#CR79">79</a>
  </span> found that discrepancies between modelled aerosol and measured AOD and surface PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> from biomass burning can be resolved by scaling fire emissions by a factor of 1.5–3.4, depending on dataset. They also note that other models require a scaling as high as a factor of 6, although 2–3 is more common. We therefore suggest that our uncertainty (factor of 2) in PI emissions reflects this current PD uncertainty—but is not higher and hence not unrealistic.
