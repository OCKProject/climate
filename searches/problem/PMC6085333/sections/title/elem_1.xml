  <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To quantify how assumptions concerning PI fire emissions affect historical aerosol concentrations, and how this change in the PI aerosol baseline affects anthropogenic radiative forcing, we use four datasets of black carbon (BC), particulate organic matter (POM) and sulphur dioxide (SO
   <sub>2</sub>) fire emissions in a global aerosol model (Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). We define the PI to be 1750 and fire emissions are defined as the sum of emissions from natural wildfires as well as fires resulting from anthropogenic activity.

  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The principal fire modelling dataset is calculated using the LPJ-GUESS-SIMFIRE-BLAZE model. To calculate burned area BLAZE incorporates the empirically optimised SIMFIRE (SIMple FIRE) model

The CMIP6 dataset for both the PI and PD combines information from satellite measurements, fire emission proxy records and six fire models from the Fire Model Intercomparison Project (FireMIP; see Methods). To assess how the CMIP6 fire dataset and our new fire models compare to earlier understanding of PI fire emissions we also compare to the Dentener et al.

We also calculate the effect on the aerosol radiative forcing between the PI and PD assuming a common observation-based fire emission dataset for the PD, which is also used in CMIP6 (see Methods).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evaluation of fire emissions</div>
  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The four PI fire emission datasets (AeroCom, CMIP6, SIMFIRE-BLAZE and LMfire) produce a wide range of aerosol and trace gas emissions (Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). Figure 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> shows that when assuming a positive relationship between human population and fire occurrence (AeroCom scenario), fire emissions are consistently lower in the PI than the PD, because emissions are scaled only by population changes in most regions. Global annual mean PI CMIP6 carbonaceous fire emissions are 48% higher than in the AeroCom dataset, with major increases over Northern Hemisphere (NH) mid-latitudes and tropical Africa, but are still lower than the PD. In contrast, although the LMfire and SIMFIRE-BLAZE modelled PI fire emissions differ substantially, they are both much higher than PD emissions at almost all latitudes outside the tropics, where continental pristine aerosol environments are both spatially and temporally rare
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
   </span>. The majority of PD fire emissions originate in tropical savannah and grassland regions
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
   </span> where herbaceous biomass accumulates during the wet season and provides large quantities of finely structured fuel that can readily burn during the dry season. In the PI a significant fraction of global emissions also originate from NH mid-latitudes, while in the PD passive and active human fire suppression is highly active (e.g., &gt;99.5% fire ignitions are actively suppressed in the US
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
   </span>). Different representations of anthropogenic land cover and land use change over the industrial period between the two fire models (see Methods) contribute to the significant differences in modelled estimates of PI burned area (Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>) and emissions (Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>); particularly between 30° N and 45° N where agricultural emissions present in LMfire but not SIMFIRE-BLAZE are estimated to contribute up to 25% (Eurasia: 37%, North America: 1%) of total fire emissions, and during the boreal spring season. Recent studies suggest that mid-latitude Eurasian post-harvest agricultural burning emissions have been strongly underestimated in both the PI
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
   </span> and PD
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
   </span>, so the inclusion of these sources in LMfire, but not SIMFIRE-BLAZE, adds significantly to the total emissions between 30° N and 45° N, but further research is needed to determine their accuracy.
  </p>
  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Depending on the emitted species, modelled total global fire emissions in the PI are estimated to be between approximately two-and-a-half and five times higher than those in the CMIP6 dataset (Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>), reflecting the large contribution to the uncertainty in fire emissions from fire modelling processes and assumptions about land use change (see Methods). These differences also lie well outside the perturbations assumed in multi-model sensitivity studies
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
   </span>, and have a different spatial distribution due to differences in fire emissions corresponding with changes in the location of PI fire occurrence rather than a uniform global increase. Seasonal patterns in fire emissions are similar between fire models, except in spring where LMfire simulates significantly more emissions than SIMFIRE-BLAZE in both hemispheres (Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>). Overall, the fire model simulations suggest that a large source of PI aerosol emissions is currently missing from climate models and the CMIP6 experiments.
  </p>
  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> also compares SIMFIRE-BLAZE and LMfire modelled BC emissions for the PD climate (see Methods) along with the range in BC emissions derived from all three commonly used fire inventories (The Global Fire Emissions Database: GFED4, The Global Fire Assimilation System: GFAS and the Fire INventory from NCAR: FINN). SIMFIRE-BLAZE and LMfire emissions generally lie within the decadal-mean emission range of the three observation-based datasets, although LMfire emissions are consistently higher in SH regions compared to decadal mean values from all other datasets. We also note that the two observation-based inventories can differ by up to a factor 3 themselves, and therefore a factor 2 difference at mid-latitudes between SIMFIRE-BLAZE and LMfire emissions in the PI reflects the uncertainty which also hinders accurate estimates of PD emissions.
  </p>
  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ability of a model to reproduce PD emissions does not necessarily mean that it also produces realistic results under a different past climate using different boundary conditions and where emissions are controlled by different processes. Hence, we advocate that model performance is best evaluated against what we know about the PI, rather than the PD.</p>

Using CMIP6 emissions results in a PD/PI BC ratio that is a factor of 1.3–1.9 higher at NEEM and a factor of 2.9–4.5 higher at D4 than the measured BC ratio. Using LMfire emissions results in a PD/PI BC ratio that is a factor 1.7–2.4 lower at NEEM and between a factor of 1.3 higher and a factor of 1.1 lower at D4, while using SIMFIRE-BLAZE emissions results in a PD/PI BC ratio that is between a factor of 1.0–1.5 higher at NEEM and a factor of 2.0–3.1 higher at D4, than the measured BC ratio.

The global aerosol model with AeroCom fire emissions results in a PD/PI BC ratio at the altitude of the measurement site that is a factor 21.2 (15.7–26.2) larger than the measured ratio in the ice core (0.6), again consistent with the hypothesis of fire emissions being too low in the PI with a positive scaling of fire occurrence with population density. Using CMIP6 emissions results in a PD/PI ratio that is a factor of 11.5 (8.5–14.2) higher than the measured BC ratio. Using LMfire emissions results in a PD/PI BC ratio that is a factor 1.2 (1.0–1.6) lower than measured, while using SIMFIRE-BLAZE emissions results in a PD/PI BC ratio that is 2.2 (1.6–2.7) higher than measured. Aerosol model results using fire model estimates of PI fire emissions are much closer to the measured PI to PD change in BC concentrations than the aerosol model results using the AeroCom and CMIP6 datasets, which predict far larger increases in BC from PI to PD.

The global aerosol model with AeroCom fire emissions results in a PD/PI BC ratio, at the altitude of the measurement site, that is a factor 4.1 (3.1–5.2) larger than the PD/PI BC ratio recorded in the ice core; again, consistent with AeroCom PI emissions being too low. Using CMIP6 emissions results in a PD/PI ratio that is a factor of 2.7 (2.0–3.3) higher. Using LMfire emissions results in a PD/PI BC ratio that is a factor 1.6 (1.3–2.2) lower than the ratio recorded in the ice core, while using SIMFIRE-BLAZE emissions results in a PD/PI BC ratio that is 1.3 (1.0–1.6) higher than the ratio recorded in the ice core.

  <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to the short atmospheric lifetimes of aerosol and soluble gases, ice cores store local-to-hemispheric-scale changes and contain many uncertainties as a proxy for fire emissions (see Methods). Nevertheless, we find that the changes in BC recorded in ice cores at four sites in very different environments are inconsistent with the assumption that fire emissions were significantly lower in the PI than in the PD, especially over North America and Europe. Compared to using fire emissions from the CMIP6 dataset, incorporating fire model emissions within the aerosol model results in closer agreement with the measured PD/PI ratio of total BC.</p>

   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). Emissions from SIMFIRE-BLAZE in the PI are based on a burned area of 641 Mha, while emissions from LMfire are based on a burned area of 1180 Mha (Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). This would suggest that burned area in SIMFIRE-BLAZE is below the lower end of the range in PI burned area and LMfire is above the upper end of the range. However, Arora and Melton state that their burned area estimates do not include contributions from agricultural burning, which are a significant proportion of emissions at mid-latitudes in LMfire, suggesting that LMfire represents the plausible upper limit of PI emissions in many regions. A regional comparison of modelled burned area with the Arora and Melton dataset

  <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, the CMIP6 fire emission inventory does not capture the trends in these proxies, which are more closely in agreement with the overall trends in fire occurrence calculated from fire modelling, which specifically incorporates information on the non-linear relationship between fire occurrence and human population density. In terms of fire model performance, neither model outperforms the other in all regions and each has its own strengths (see Methods). Based on currently available measurements and the limited comparison with ice core records, we suggest that LMfire represents what is likely to be an upper limit to the plausible range of PI fire emissions in many regions, particularly in the extra-tropics.</p>

Global monthly mean PI CCN concentrations at 915 hPa (approximately low-level warm cloud base) are 110 cm

Over continental regions, the increases in CCN concentrations are even greater relative to using the CMIP6 emissions, a factor of 1.5 higher using SIMFIRE-BLAZE emissions and a factor of 2.1 higher using LMfire emissions. A large portion of this difference is due to substantially increased fire emissions in the NH mid-latitudes (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). In general, using CMIP6 emissions results in increases in CCN concentrations in all regions compared to using AeroCom emissions, the exceptions being near the high PD deforestation regions of Brazil and both polar regions. Over Africa, CCN concentrations are higher in extra-tropical regions but lower in tropical regions when incorporating LMfire or SIMFIRE-BLAZE fire emissions compared to CMIP6. Over Indonesia and northern Australia CCN concentrations are higher when incorporating LMfire emissions compared to using CMIP6 emissions, while using SIMFIRE-BLAZE emissions yields lower CCN concentrations. Downwind of southern Australia and Patagonia both fire model emission datasets lead to higher CCN concentrations than when using CMIP6 fire emissions, but similar or lower CCN concentrations are calculated over most of the Southern Ocean when using the two fire models. Incorporating SIMFIRE-BLAZE and LMfire emissions results in marine CCN concentrations that are 1.2–1.5 times higher than when using CMIP6 emissions, due to long-range aerosol transport. The current study shows that pre-industrial fire emissions cause larger uncertainty in CCN (and hence pre-industrial to present-day aerosol indirect forcing) than the combined estimate in Hamilton et al.

   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>), driven primarily by NH anthropogenic industrial emissions. We estimate the LMfire cloud albedo forcing to lie between −0.06 and −0.17 W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span>, based on four emission scenarios representing the mean decadal maximum and minimum in tropical and extra-tropical fire emissions simulated by LMfire (see Methods, Supplementary Table

   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8</a>). This suggests that in order to improve the accuracy of radiative forcing estimates in climate models, it is more important to reduce the structural uncertainty between fire models than to improve our understanding of natural variability in PI fire emissions.

   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> also shows the aerosol direct radiative forcing between the PI and PD for each fire emission scenario. Each PI fire emission experiment results in a similar spatial pattern of direct forcing. The global mean differences are much smaller than for the cloud albedo forcing, ranging from −0.68 W m

This is caused by (i) the more linear response of the natural aerosol direct radiative effect compared to its cloud albedo effect
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>

  <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The revised assumptions about PI fire emissions lead to substantial changes in the regional magnitude and pattern of the net aerosol radiative forcing over the industrial period. Our modelling results imply a substantial change in our understanding of the way the energy balance of the atmosphere has evolved over the industrial period, particularly over the Atlantic, with several possible implications for climate studies. In particular, compared to the simulation using CMIP6 fire emissions, we estimate that the revised fire emissions reduce the magnitude of the net (cloud albedo and direct) aerosol radiative forcing contrast between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres by 0.2 W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span> for both the SIMFIRE-BLAZE and LMfire simulations, but with very different spatial distributions (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). In many coupled atmosphere-ocean climate models, the inter-tropical convergence zone would likely be positioned further southward in the PI compared to models participating within CMIP6, as tropical precipitation patterns are sensitive to changes in the gradient in the inter-hemispheric aerosol forcing

  <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The inclusion of more realistic PI fire emissions in climate and Earth system models is likely to cause a general reduction in the magnitude of the aerosol radiative forcings that they simulate

  <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A realistic lower bound for PI fire emissions is currently unknown, but analysis of ice cores, charcoal records and tree-rings suggests it will be nearer to SIMFIRE-BLAZE modelled estimates than those within the AeroCom or CMIP6 datasets. LMfire emissions are approximately double SIMFIRE-BLAZE in most mid-latitude regions due to the addition of agricultural emissions and a longer fire season, which both increase annual mean burned area and hence modelled emission estimates. We therefore suggest that in many extra-tropical regions LMfire represents a plausible upper limit, particularly in the Arctic and semiarid regions of the mid-latitude NH. The exception is temperate North America, a region important for the baseline forcing, where reconstructions based on paleoenvironmental archives are in closest agreement with LMfire of all examined datasets. However, LMfire emissions from Australia are close to an order of magnitude higher than SIMFIRE-BLAZE and should be treated cautiously in the absence of supporting evidence, in particular the impact that colonisation has had on fire activity within Australia which could be large. The upper limit of potential fire activity in most tropical regions is also currently unknown.</p>

  <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several lines of evidence, aside from more realistic fire models, point to PI fire emissions being greater than previously assumed: ice core records of the PI to PD change in BC at several independent sites in different environments; ice-core records of tracers of fire activity; recent analyses of fire occurrence revealing declining burned area with increasing population density (e.g., refs.

   </span>); and indirect evidence from the charcoal record and tree-rings. Nevertheless, evidence to support new model estimates currently contains many uncertainties, including: the modelling of aerosol deposition on snow, in particular the extent to which models can simulate trends even if absolute deposition is very uncertain; the ability to simulate deposition to high-altitude sites using low-resolution models; the extent to which deposition scales with emissions and concentrations on a long-term mean; the effect of PI to PD changes in aerosol processing, atmospheric circulation and precipitation patterns; uncertainties in the different records of fire emissions themselves; uncertainty in land cover and land use change over the industrial period, and how this translates to uncertainty in aerosol emission and deposition rates; uncertainty in the impacts of European colonisation on fire regimes influenced by aboriginal land use practices; uncertainty in fire emission factors, which also may have been different in the PI environment; spatial and temporal variability in fire emissions, including the fire return interval, and how this affects the optimum length of model simulations; and the uncertainty in a single model analysis. These are clear tasks for future research to help reduce uncertainty in PI to PD changes in fire emissions, as well as the associated uncertainty in radiative forcing estimates over the Industrial Era, noting that any future constraints are not automatically equivalent within each time-period.
  </p>
  <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results highlight the importance of developing a much deeper understanding of how fires evolved over the industrial period, especially since global fire models have mostly been evaluated against PD data
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
   </span>. The exponential increase in human population over the Industrial Era has restructured the fire landscape on all inhabited continents and created a permanent change in the energy balance of the atmosphere that has not been fully accounted for in climate models. Furthermore, it is highly likely that models participating in CMIP6 would simulate smaller anthropogenic aerosol radiative forcings over the industrial period if they used higher PI fire emissions.
  </p>
  <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The climate impacts of fires will also extend beyond changes in aerosol emissions, and includes many other important processes

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
   </span> such as changes in CO
   <sub>2</sub> exchange, surface albedo, ozone and methane concentrations, as well as other smoke-induced adjustments to clouds and regional meteorology that were not explored here.
