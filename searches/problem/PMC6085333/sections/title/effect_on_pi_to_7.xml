 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Changes in PI CCN concentrations alter both the size and number of cloud drops in the PI, and therefore the magnitude of the cloud radiative perturbation caused by anthropogenic emissions over the historical period

  </span>. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> shows the radiative forcing due to changes in cloud albedo between the PI and PD using PI fire emissions from the CMIP6 dataset or the fire model datasets (see Methods). Other cloud adjustments caused by the changes in aerosol were not included, but are likely to enhance the albedo effect we calculate

  </span>. The global annual mean cloud albedo forcing in the simulation with CMIP6 emissions is −1.1 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> in this model, a decrease of 16% compared to using the AeroCom PI and PD fire emission datasets (see Methods and Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>), but is reduced to −0.73 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> in the SIMFIRE-BLAZE simulation and to −0.10 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> in the LMfire simulation. All simulations show a similar latitudinal distribution in the forcing (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>), driven primarily by NH anthropogenic industrial emissions. We estimate the LMfire cloud albedo forcing to lie between −0.06 and −0.17 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>, based on four emission scenarios representing the mean decadal maximum and minimum in tropical and extra-tropical fire emissions simulated by LMfire (see Methods, Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a> and Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8</a>). This suggests that in order to improve the accuracy of radiative forcing estimates in climate models, it is more important to reduce the structural uncertainty between fire models than to improve our understanding of natural variability in PI fire emissions.

  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> also shows the aerosol direct radiative forcing between the PI and PD for each fire emission scenario. Each PI fire emission experiment results in a similar spatial pattern of direct forcing. The global mean differences are much smaller than for the cloud albedo forcing, ranging from −0.68 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> for CMIP6 PI fire emissions to −0.62 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> for LMfire PI fire emissions (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). The sensitivity of the direct radiative forcing to PI fire emissions is weaker than for the cloud albedo forcing. This is caused by (i) the more linear response of the natural aerosol direct radiative effect compared to its cloud albedo effect
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span> and also by (ii) the smaller direct radiative efficiency of fire aerosol compared to other natural aerosol

 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The revised assumptions about PI fire emissions lead to substantial changes in the regional magnitude and pattern of the net aerosol radiative forcing over the industrial period. Our modelling results imply a substantial change in our understanding of the way the energy balance of the atmosphere has evolved over the industrial period, particularly over the Atlantic, with several possible implications for climate studies. In particular, compared to the simulation using CMIP6 fire emissions, we estimate that the revised fire emissions reduce the magnitude of the net (cloud albedo and direct) aerosol radiative forcing contrast between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres by 0.2 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> for both the SIMFIRE-BLAZE and LMfire simulations, but with very different spatial distributions (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). In many coupled atmosphere-ocean climate models, the inter-tropical convergence zone would likely be positioned further southward in the PI compared to models participating within CMIP6, as tropical precipitation patterns are sensitive to changes in the gradient in the inter-hemispheric aerosol forcing

 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The inclusion of more realistic PI fire emissions in climate and Earth system models is likely to cause a general reduction in the magnitude of the aerosol radiative forcings that they simulate
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>

 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A realistic lower bound for PI fire emissions is currently unknown, but analysis of ice cores, charcoal records and tree-rings suggests it will be nearer to SIMFIRE-BLAZE modelled estimates than those within the AeroCom or CMIP6 datasets. LMfire emissions are approximately double SIMFIRE-BLAZE in most mid-latitude regions due to the addition of agricultural emissions and a longer fire season, which both increase annual mean burned area and hence modelled emission estimates. We therefore suggest that in many extra-tropical regions LMfire represents a plausible upper limit, particularly in the Arctic and semiarid regions of the mid-latitude NH. The exception is temperate North America, a region important for the baseline forcing, where reconstructions based on paleoenvironmental archives are in closest agreement with LMfire of all examined datasets. However, LMfire emissions from Australia are close to an order of magnitude higher than SIMFIRE-BLAZE and should be treated cautiously in the absence of supporting evidence, in particular the impact that colonisation has had on fire activity within Australia which could be large. The upper limit of potential fire activity in most tropical regions is also currently unknown.</p>
