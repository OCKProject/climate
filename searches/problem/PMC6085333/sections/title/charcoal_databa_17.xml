 <p id="Par53" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Global Charcoal Database (GCD version 3.0.3) was used within the paleofire R package (

The GCD contains 736 charcoal records (NH: 436, SH: 300). Following Marlon et al.

  </span> charcoal accumulation records in the GCD are transformed in a 3 step process prior to examination to allow comparison of records that are based on a wide range of sampling techniques. Step 1: minimax transformation to rescale values. Step 2: Box-Cox transformation to homogenise the variance within individual time series. Step 3: rescaling values to Z-scores. A LOcally WEighted regression Scatter plot Smoother (LOWESS) smoothing of the data was employed with a 10-year window half-width (i.e., a 20 year smoothing). Bootstrap analysis (1000 samples by site) gives a 97.5% confidence interval. The main difference in the charcoal analysis presented here compared to those in previous studies
