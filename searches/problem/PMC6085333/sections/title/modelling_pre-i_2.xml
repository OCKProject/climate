 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To quantify how assumptions concerning PI fire emissions affect historical aerosol concentrations, and how this change in the PI aerosol baseline affects anthropogenic radiative forcing, we use four datasets of black carbon (BC), particulate organic matter (POM) and sulphur dioxide (SO
  <sub>2</sub>) fire emissions in a global aerosol model (Supplementary TableÂ 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). We define the PI to be 1750 and fire emissions are defined as the sum of emissions from natural wildfires as well as fires resulting from anthropogenic activity.

 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The principal fire modelling dataset is calculated using the LPJ-GUESS-SIMFIRE-BLAZE model. To calculate burned area BLAZE incorporates the empirically optimised SIMFIRE (SIMple FIRE) model

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>. SIMFIRE-BLAZE is then configured to run under PI conditions, but does not explicitly simulate PI agricultural burning. We also calculate PI fire emissions using the LPJ-LMfire

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span>. We compare PI fire emissions from these two fire models with emissions from the CMIP6 dataset
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>, which is the most recent fire emission dataset for use within global climate and Earth system models. The CMIP6 dataset for both the PI and PD combines information from satellite measurements, fire emission proxy records and six fire models from the Fire Model Intercomparison Project (FireMIP; see Methods). To assess how the CMIP6 fire dataset and our new fire models compare to earlier understanding of PI fire emissions we also compare to the Dentener et al.

  </span> 1750 dataset adopted by AeroCom. A global aerosol model was then used to quantify the changes in PI aerosol concentrations resulting from each fire emission dataset. We also calculate the effect on the aerosol radiative forcing between the PI and PD assuming a common observation-based fire emission dataset for the PD, which is also used in CMIP6 (see Methods).
