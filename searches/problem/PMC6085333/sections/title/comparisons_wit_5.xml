 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other proxies for fire occurrence and emissions provide further evidence for the likely changes in fire occurrence from the PI to the PD. Arora and Melton
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span> recently reported a 28% decline in global burned area from the PI (1850–1870) to PD (2005–2010). Applying this change to PD estimates of burned area from GFED4s (~475 Mha)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span> and FINN (~725 Mha)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span> results in an estimated PI range in burned area from 679 to 1040 Mha (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). Emissions from SIMFIRE-BLAZE in the PI are based on a burned area of 641 Mha, while emissions from LMfire are based on a burned area of 1180 Mha (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). This would suggest that burned area in SIMFIRE-BLAZE is below the lower end of the range in PI burned area and LMfire is above the upper end of the range. However, Arora and Melton state that their burned area estimates do not include contributions from agricultural burning, which are a significant proportion of emissions at mid-latitudes in LMfire, suggesting that LMfire represents the plausible upper limit of PI emissions in many regions. A regional comparison of modelled burned area with the Arora and Melton dataset
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span> suggests that the distribution of burned area, and hence emissions, in LMfire is appropriate, although the magnitude of the emissions is high.

 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The charcoal record (see Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>) suggests that fire occurrence in the tropics (30° S to 30° N) increased slightly from the PI to the PD. Moreover, in general agreement with Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>, fire occurrence in the extra-tropical regions (&gt;30° S and N) in the PI was similar to or larger than in the year 2000
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. The charcoal record suggests fire occurrence in the NH mid-latitude region (25–45° N) is lower in the PD compared to the PI, due mainly to a decrease in charcoal deposition occurring over the last few decades, the same region in which the fire models (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>) predict the largest decrease in PD emissions compared to the PI, and where tree-ring-based reconstructions of fire activity for western North America also suggests a very rapid decline in fire occurrence from the PI to the PD
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Greenland ice core measurements of unique chemical tracers of fires are also consistent with a decrease in fire emissions since the PI (see Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a> and Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). We note that CO measurements in Antarctic ice cores
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span> also suggest that PI fire emissions are higher over the Southern Hemisphere than are currently estimated in inventories. Although the measured quadrupling of the enhancement in PI CO from fires cannot be reproduced from PD fire distributions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>, a significant change in fire emissions from nearby regions such as Patagonia and Australia (such as shown within the fire modelling presented here) could significantly enhance PI CO from fires transported to Antarctica.
 </p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, the CMIP6 fire emission inventory does not capture the trends in these proxies, which are more closely in agreement with the overall trends in fire occurrence calculated from fire modelling, which specifically incorporates information on the non-linear relationship between fire occurrence and human population density. In terms of fire model performance, neither model outperforms the other in all regions and each has its own strengths (see Methods). Based on currently available measurements and the limited comparison with ice core records, we suggest that LMfire represents what is likely to be an upper limit to the plausible range of PI fire emissions in many regions, particularly in the extra-tropics.</p>
