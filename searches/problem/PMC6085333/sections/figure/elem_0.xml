  <p>Fire carbonaceous aerosol emissions. 
   <span class="bold">a</span> Pre-industrial (PI) and present-day (PD) carbonaceous fire emissions (sum of black and organic carbon) as a function of latitude. PI fire emissions derived from four fire datasets: LMfire, SIMFIRE-BLAZE, CMIP6 and AeroCom. PD fire emissions are from the CMIP6 dataset. The range around LMfire represents a plausible range in the natural variability of PI fire emissions derived from the maximum and minimum in fire emissions from the four distinct decadal mean fire climatologies. Seasonal PI carbonaceous aerosol emission maps are shown in Supplementary Figure

   <span class="bold">b</span> Black carbon emissions for PD from five datasets: LMfire, SIMFIRE-BLAZE, GFED4, GFAS and FINN (mean of 2003–2012 for all except LMfire which is the mean over 1991–2000). Shaded area represents the minimum and maximum in decadal emissions from within all three observation datasets
