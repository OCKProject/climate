 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our mid-Holocene simulation, Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) in summer-autumn decreases by 30–35% over wide areas of the Arctic relative to the pre-industrial climate (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), which is consistent with the multi-model averaged SIC anomalies in the mid-Holocene
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a> shows the annual-mean response of mid-Holocene surface air temperature (SAT) to Arctic sea ice loss. The substantial warming over and around Greenland, which also appears in proxy data
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>, has previously been reported as a response to Arctic sea ice loss
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. The impact of Arctic sea ice loss is not limited to high latitudes: sea ice loss warms the North Pacific Ocean and North America, but slightly cools the North Atlantic Ocean. The longitude–time Hovmöller plot of SAT averaged between 45°N and 62°N (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>) shows that the warming over the Pacific and North America persists throughout the season, whereas cooling over Central and East Asia appears in winter, especially in December and January. The amplitudes of these ice melting-induced annual-mean SAT anomalies (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>) are comparable to those of the direct insolation forcing (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>). The insolation forcing warms the North Atlantic and Europe, and cools North America. The warming over Europe is usually driven by anomalously strong summer insolation forcing
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span> and this is supported by multiple pollen records
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>. Indeed, the Hovmöller plot (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a>) verifies that the mid-Holocene insolation forcing causes strong summer warming and winter–spring cooling over the entire longitude circle. While the seasonal impact of insolation forcing on SAT in the mid-latitudes is about twice as large as that of sea ice loss (compare Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c, d</a>), the annual-mean SAT anomalies driven by insolation forcing and sea ice loss are comparable with each other (compare Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a, b</a>).
