 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These atmospheric circulation and SAT changes are also associated with sea surface temperature (SST) changes. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a> shows that the direct insolation forcing increases the annual-mean North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea SSTs by around 0.2–0.3 K. This SST warming likely contributes to the increase in annual-mean SAT over Europe (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>). The Hovmöller plot of the North Atlantic SSTs averaged between 55°W and 10°W indicates that the SST anomalies increase rapidly in summer because of anomalously strong summer insolation, but quickly subside in autumn and become slightly negative in spring (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4d</a>). In contrast, Arctic sea ice loss produces seasonally persistent SST anomalies in the mid-high latitudes. Arctic sea ice loss increases the annual-mean North Pacific SSTs by around 0.4–0.5 K and produces a localized ~0.5 K decrease in annual-mean SSTs in the central North Atlantic (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>). The Hovmöller plot of North Atlantic SSTs shows that the sea ice loss decreases (increases) the mid-latitude (subpolar) North Atlantic SSTs throughout the season (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b</a>), and that these anomalies exhibit far less seasonality than those of the insolation forcing. The summed effects of insolation forcing and sea ice loss exhibit a pattern of North Pacific–subpolar North Atlantic warming and tropical ocean cooling (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>). This is qualitatively consistent with the PMIP3 multi-model average (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>), with the exception of the North Pacific warming.

  </span>, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5b</a> shows that Arctic sea ice loss weakens the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC); the northward mass flux systematically decreases all the way from the subtropics to the subpolar North Atlantic. The decrease in the northward mass flux in the Atlantic Ocean is largest around 35°N–50°N (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5b</a>) and the poleward margin of this region is where the annual-mean SSTs decrease by around 0.5 K (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a, b</a>). However, the AMOC strength slowly recovers to the control simulation (i.e. mid-Holocene climate with preindustrial sea ice) strength after about 180 years (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a</a>). After year 200, the AMOC strength anomalies are mostly smaller than 1 Sverdrup (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a, c</a>), which is consistent with a previous study
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span> showing that the AMOC weakening is a transient response to the Arctic sea ice loss. Therefore, it is unlikely that the AMOC weakening and the associated North Atlantic cooling persisted throughout the mid-Holocene. While the AMOC weakening signal substantially diminishes after year 200, the North Atlantic cooling still persists (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5g</a>), suggesting that the AMOC weakening is not the only factors causing the North Atlantic cooling. The sea surface height (SSH) anomalies show that Arctic sea ice loss decreases SSH over the mid-North Atlantic (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5d, e</a>), which weakens the Gulf Stream by reducing the meridional gradient of the SSH. The reduced strength of the Gulf Stream is likely to be a factor for the North Atlantic cooling, which is qualitatively consistent with a previous study
