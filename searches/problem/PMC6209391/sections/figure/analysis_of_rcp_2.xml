  <div class="title">Analysis of RCP8.5 future projections (JJA seasonal means).</div>
  <p>Included are both (
   <span class="bold">A</span> to 
   <span class="bold">C</span>) full multimodel ensemble and (
   <span class="bold">D</span> to 
   <span class="bold">F</span>) AIE-only sub-ensemble (JJA seasonal means). (A and D) Time series of multimodel average zonal mean temperature anomalies. (B and E) Comparison of multimodel mean midlatitude (25째N to 60째N) and high-latitude (65째N to 75째N) mean temperature anomalies. (C and F) AA index defined as high-latitude minus midlatitude series (colored curves, individual simulations; black curves, multimodel mean).
