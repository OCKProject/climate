 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our previous work (M17) demonstrated a greenhouse warming–related increasing trend in occurrence of QRA-favorable conditions associated with devastating recent extreme summer weather events including the 2003 European heat wave, the 2010 Pakistan flood and Russian heat wave, and the 2011 Texas and Oklahoma heat wave and drought. The analysis we have presented here indicates that anthropogenic warming will likely lead to future increases in these events under business-as-usual burning of fossil fuels, keeping in mind our assumption that the historically defined fingerprint remains valid in the future climate. How substantial those increases are, and the historical path they follow—particularly during the first half of the 21st century—depends substantially on the prominence of midlatitude warming arising from decreasing aerosols. Given the divergent nature of the CMIP5 multimodel simulations with regard to this feature, any evaluation of risk should take into account not only the mean expected increase (~50%) in events but also the possibility of a far larger (i.e., roughly tripling) number of events, as suggested by some of the model simulations. An important implication of our findings is that a reduction in aerosol load may provide the additional benefit of preventing or ameliorating changes in midlatitude temperature gradients that favor an increase in persistent extreme summer weather events.</p>
