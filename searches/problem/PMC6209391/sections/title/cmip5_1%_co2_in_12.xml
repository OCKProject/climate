 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the CMIP5 1% per year CO
  <sub>2</sub> experiment multimodel simulation ensemble (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 35 realizations, 
  <span class="italic">M</span> = 26 models; table S2). Each physics version of a model was considered a separate model. The simulations are all initialized using a preindustrial control simulation and are of varying length. The analysis was limited to the maximum length (140-year) time interval common to all but one simulation in the archive. We used a simple area-weighted average to create zonal means at a 5Â° interval.
