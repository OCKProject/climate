 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the CMIP5 RCP 8.5 (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 73 realizations, 
  <span class="italic">M</span> = 39 models; table S3) multimodel simulations for the analyses in the main article. Each physics version of a model was considered a separate model. The analysis was limited to the common time period of overlap for all models and realizations (2006–2099). We used a simple area-weighted average to create zonal means at a 5° interval. We did separate analyses using only the subset of (AIE) simulations that include both first and second indirect effects (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 28 realizations, 
  <span class="italic">M</span> = 15 models). We did additional analyses (see the Supplementary Materials) using the CMIP5 RCP 2.6 simulations (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 58 realizations, 
  <span class="italic">M</span> = 29 models; table S4) and the subset of AIE simulations (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 25 realizations, 
  <span class="italic">M</span> = 11 models).
