 <p>(
  <span class="bold">A</span>) JJA 1000-hPa meridional temperature anomalies over the extratropical region 25°N to 75°N associated with QRA-favorable conditions (i.e., QRA fingerprint) based on composite of events from ERA reanalysis data (1979–2015) along with the actual JJA meridional surface temperature anomalies corresponding to three selected QRA events (July/August 2003, July/August 2010, and August 2010). (
  <span class="bold">B</span>) Upper-troposphere (300 hPa) meridional wind, zonal wave number spectra (computed for the meridional average over 37.5°N to 57.5°N; the climatological mean spectra and associated 1.5σ upper limit are shown for comparison by red solid and red dashed curves, respectively), and zonal mean zonal wind profiles associated with each of the three aforementioned events.
