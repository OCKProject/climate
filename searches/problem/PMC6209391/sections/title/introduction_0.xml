 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A series of persistent, extreme, and costly summer weather events over the past decade and a half, including the 2003 European heat wave, 2010 Pakistan flood/Russian heat wave, 2011 Texas drought, 2013 European floods, 2015 California wildfires, and 2016 Alberta wildfires have led to ongoing discussion in the scientific literature regarding the relationship between anthropogenic climate change and warm-season weather extremes (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A specific mechanism involving the characteristics of atmospheric Rossby (or “planetary”) waves may be implicated in some of these cases (

  <a rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" href="#R29">
   <span class="italic">29</span>

  </a>) and Hoskins and Ambrizzi (
  <a rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" href="#R31">
   <span class="italic">31</span>

   <span class="italic">22</span>
  </a>) demonstrated that planetary waves within the synoptic wave number range (wave numbers 6 to 8) can become effectively trapped in a latitudinal waveguide depending on the meridional profile of the midlatitude westerly jet, thus providing a mechanism for the time dependence of resonant behavior, because that profile exhibits substantial variability in time. If these waveguide conditions hold, then a pronounced amplification of waves that are excited by orographic or thermal forcing can occur (
  <a rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" href="#R32">
   <span class="italic">32</span>
  </a>). This phenomenon is referred to as quasi-resonant amplification (QRA).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The key observation is that 
  <span class="italic">l</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> can exhibit two turning points, i.e., zero crossings near latitudes of roughly 30°N and 45°N. These conditions occur for certain meridional profiles of 
  <span class="italic">ū</span>—particularly for a double-peaked westerly jet characterized by strengthened westerlies in subtropical and subpolar latitudes and weakened westerlies in midlatitudes—and over the restricted wave number range 
  <span class="italic">k</span> = 6 to 8. Outside the turning points, 
  <span class="italic">l</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> becomes negative and meridionally propagating solutions are not permitted, preventing dispersion of wave energy to higher or lower latitudes and yielding a zonally directed waveguide for 
  <span class="italic">k</span> = 6 to 8. A persistent subtropical turning point can be created when the zonal mean westerlies are in a double jet state (

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">
   <span class="italic">28</span>
  </a>). This state is characterized by a high-latitude Arctic front jet and a confined and steep subtropical jet, which is instrumental in creating a subtropical turning point. It is well documented that these jet configurations are efficient waveguides (
  <a rid="R33" ref-type="bibr" href="#R33">
   <span class="italic">33</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If the waveguide is (almost) circumglobal, then wave energy is efficiently trapped and waves constructively interfere with the forcing, leading to resonance. Trapped planetary waves with 
  <span class="italic">k</span> = 6 to 8 that are excited by thermal or orographic forcing will tend to grow in amplitude. The waveguide condition depends only on the zonal wave number 
  <span class="italic">k</span> and the shape of the zonal mean zonal wind (
  <span class="italic">ū</span>) profile. Through the thermal wind relationship, this profile can, in turn, be tied to meridional temperature gradients in the lower troposphere. Although a zonal mean approach neglects regional variations in the zonal flow, it has shown to be suitable for assessing the “waveguidability” of jets (

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the derivation of the fundamental equations requires a certain degree of idealization, there are some caveats with this conceptual development. As QRA-related disturbances grow sufficiently in amplitude, they become baroclinically unstable and the barotropic assumption (and WKB approximation) is violated. Our zonal mean approach neglects longitudinal variations in the zonal flow and the possibility of meridionally oriented waveguides. Nonetheless, the theoretical framework presented above is useful for understanding the conditions under which QRA is likely to arise. The reader is referred to the studies of Petoukhov

They also showed that planetary waves amplified by QRA exhibit specific preferred phases due to the characteristic stationary orographic forcing of the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudinal orographic profile. Their analysis shows that central United States and western Europe are specifically susceptible for persistent heat waves during QRA episodes (

  </a>) argued that an increase in QRA events during the satellite reanalysis era (1979–2011) coincides with a measure of Arctic amplification (AA) of warming. This amplification is expected from various feedbacks including the ice-albedo feedback associated with anthropogenic greenhouse warming. While both the polar and subtropical boundaries of the waveguide are important, it is the former that is strongly affected by this amplified warming. Because upper-level westerlies are tied to a negative meridional gradient (i.e., colder toward the pole) in lower tropospheric temperatures through the thermal wind relationship, AA of warming would seem to imply reduced upper-level midlatitude westerlies (

  </a>), there is a robust relationship between surface/lower atmosphere temperature gradients and upper-level zonal winds in the regions critical to QRA, and there is a clear signature for the various key QRA events noted of the past few decades. These profiles are governed substantially by large-scale radiative forcing and are likely to yield a robust metric when applied to climate model simulations, yet are closely tied to QRA through the thermal wind mechanism as discussed above.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test whether this indirect approach to assessing QRA in models is more reliable than a direct analysis of QRA events in the model simulations, we have performed an analysis across the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) multimodel historical ensemble used in this study (see Materials and methods) to examine the relative faithfulness with which the two respective quantities, i.e.,

  <span class="italic">dT</span>(ϕ)/
  <span class="italic">d</span>ϕ]. For comparison, we obtain a quite large 344% error for

  <span class="italic">T</span>(ϕ) profile is used as a proxy for QRA behavior in the models, can yield meaningful results, while direct assessment of QRA behavior is not possible using currently available multimodel ensemble simulations. One assumption of our approach, of course, is that the fingerprint as established in historical observations remains valid in the future. Related to that assumption is the assumption that the structure of planetary waves excited by orographic or thermal forcing remains similar in the future.

  </a>), M17 produced a composite of boreal summer [June to August (JJA)] zonally averaged near-surface (1000 hPa) temperature profiles associated with QRA-favorable time intervals. Differencing the QRA-favorable and climatological mean profiles, they defined an anomalous meridional temperature “fingerprint” associated with QRA conditions, onto which polar-amplified warming projects positively (although there is additional structure in the fingerprint related to, e.g., land/ocean contrast). Examining the trend over time in this fingerprint in both long-term historical observations and the CMIP5 historical model simulations (table S1), they found consistent evidence for an increase in QRA-favorable conditions.
