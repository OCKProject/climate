  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F7" href="#F7">Figure 7C</a> shows a map of least-squares regression temperature changes due to TSI forcing for 5° × 5° boxes in 2001–2010, the decade when we reconstructed the strongest TSI cooling influence on the recent slowdown. REML calculations are too time-consuming for such a large data set. A worldwide cooling signal is fairly consistent over the oceans but very patchy over land. Its average global magnitude of −0.13°C is larger than the REML estimate of −0.08°C, partly because calculations are made separately for each 5° × 5° box, and REML estimates are likely more accurate for short periods. Nevertheless, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F7" href="#F7">Fig. 7C</a> supports the plausibility of a substantial cooling influence of TSI forcing on GST over 2001–2010. The reconstructions described above of solar cooling of GST using REML are consistent in magnitude with the larger responses of GST to TSI forcing simulated by CMIP5 models over 11-year cycles (
