 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have shown that much of the variability and trends in GST since 1891 can be reconstructed skillfully down to interannual, annual, and, sometimes, subannual time scales. We have highlighted two warming periods, 1911–1940 and 1976–1997, and three slowdown periods, 1896–1910, 1941–1975, and 1998–2013. For each slowdown, we reconstructed slightly longer periods to show how the periods started and ended. For each slowdown, the regression equations used training data that were independent of the period studied. For warming periods, we relied on the same cross-validation procedure used for slowdowns but used all the GST and forcing data for training the regression method. Although we have allowed for many uncertainties, a full analysis requires a better understanding of the uncertainties in forcings. In this regard, estimates of TSI forcing before the satellite era have evolved considerably (

   <span class="italic">20</span>
  </a>), but the increasing trend in TSI before 1960 is probably still not known well. Finally, we have not used recent estimates of a small estimated cooling in recent decades due to global greening (

   <span class="italic">47</span>
  </a>). This effect is small over land; globally, it is smaller still because the ice-free land surface covers only about 25% of the globe.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From soon after the Second World War, there are no serious failures of the reconstructions. However, many monthly and some multimonthly variations in observed GST are not reconstructed well. Some of these apparent errors are due to observational noise, with observed monthly GST uncertainties throughout the period since 1891 being about twice as large as simultaneous annual GST uncertainties (

   <span class="italic">8</span>
  </a>). The lack of observed warming of GST over 1951–1975 is well reconstructed, as is strong warming from 1976 to 1997 and the observed warming peak in 1998 due to the 1997–1998 El Niño and the subsequent GST slowdown. Renewed warming in 2014–2015 is also reconstructed well. Less expected is the relatively large reconstructed influence of TSI forcing on the 1998–2013 slowdown, especially when compared to ENSO and IPO forcing. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Figure 6</a> (B and C) shows that uncertainties arising from the use of three quite different assumptions about the delayed GST response time to TSI forcing did not stop reconstructed TSI influences from being significant from 2001 onward, although uncertainties arising from these markedly varying response times are included in REML calculations of temperature change and trend. Recent research (
  <a rid="R46" ref-type="bibr" href="#R46">
   <span class="italic">46</span>
  </a>) tends to favor a 4-year GST response time, the middle value of our three response times (see also fig. S8), as this corresponds well to the approximately 2-year lag of GST to TSI forcing found there.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite important influences of natural variability, since 1891, the net warming effects of increasing greenhouse gases and anthropogenic aerosols on GST have been dominant, shown most clearly by 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1B</a> (e). Even over 1891–1950, net anthropogenic warming was clearly important, although natural effects played a comparable role. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Figure 6D</a> compares drivers of each warming (a) and slowdown period (b) in the form of reconstructed GST trends to aid comparison. The first warming period 1911–1940 is unlike the second, with warming in the first period being about equally due to GA forcing on the one hand and four natural forcings on the other. However, in 1976–1997, GA forcing dominated the warming. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Figure 6D</a> (b) shows the greatly increasing influence of GA warming on GST trends from the first slowdown period to the third. In all slowdowns, GA warming is fully or partly offset by natural cooling. The first slowdown, a nominal pronounced cooling, was probably dominated by natural ENSO/IPO cooling, but its magnitude and that of the overall cooling remain uncertain. The second slowdown, at least in 1951–1975, is much more securely reconstructed; here, GA warming was mostly offset by natural cooling owing to a decline in the AMO and increased volcanic forcing. In the third slowdown, as measured over 2001–2013, the strongest of all GA warming signals is partly offset by several natural cooling factors: solar cooling, an increasing tendency to La Niña events compared to El Niño events, and a small signal due to increasing volcanic activity. By contrast, since the end of the 20th century, the CMIP5 GST warming rate is likely to be almost all caused by GA warming where its forcing of CMIP5 GST may be a little too fast at 0.23° ± 0.06°C per decade. Given, say, another decade of observed GST data, REML trend methods could be used to test stringently whether CMIP5, or forthcoming CMIP6, rates of early 21st-century warming really significantly differ from observations globally or hemispherically.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Progress to better understand worldwide surface temperature variations partly depends on improving the instrumental database. It is clear that a large number of historical observations not yet digitized exist back to before 1800 (
  <a rid="R48" ref-type="bibr" href="#R48">
   <span class="italic">48</span>
  </a>) and especially in much of the period studied here. They await extraction and digitization through projects like the international Atmospheric Circulation Reconstructions over the Earth Project (
  <a rid="R48" ref-type="bibr" href="#R48">
   <span class="italic">48</span>
  </a>), which has already delivered a useful fraction of these data (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.met-acre.net/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.met-acre.net/</span>). In conclusion, the mostly high reconstruction skill of observed monthly GST shown here is consistent with the general veracity of the GST record since 1891 and a good understanding of the multiple causes of its variations and trends.
