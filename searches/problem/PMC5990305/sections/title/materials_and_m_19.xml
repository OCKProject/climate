 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used cross-validated linear regression to relate monthly GST deseasonalized anomalies relative to 1961–1990 from each of three records (
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">
   <span class="italic">5</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">
   <span class="italic">8</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" href="#R29">
   <span class="italic">29</span>
  </a>) to a set of monthly forcing factors. These were also expressed relative to 1961–1990 but standardized over 1891–2015. Linearity in the response of GST to the sum of combinations of forcing factors remains a widespread assumption in climate change attribution (
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">
   <span class="italic">10</span>
  </a>). The forcing factors were transformed to reflect the character of GST responses to these factors, often using a delayed e-folding response profile. We included a range of response times to account for their uncertainties, and some new estimates of the forcings, to create 54 main regression equations for each period studied. Each main equation for warming periods 1911–1940 and 1976–1997 averages 1500 constituent cross-validated regression equations, the number of months in the training period 1891–2015. Table S2 shows the 18 combinations of forcing factors used in each main equation for a given record of the three records contributing to WMO GST. For the slowdown period 1896–1910, part of a longer study period 1891–1913, training data for 1914–2015 were used in the same way to create 54 main regression equations, each the average of 1224 cross-validated regression equations. For 1941–1975, training data combined the periods 1891–1938 and 1976–2015 in a similar way, and for 1998–2013, the training period was 1891–1996. This procedure minimized biases in the calculations of regression coefficients. The symmetrical cross-validation window centered on a given month was 49 months long for all equations, although necessarily asymmetrical at the beginning and end of GST data sets.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We only chose those predictors known to physically affect GST using published literature. The GA predictor (
  <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">
   <span class="italic">20</span>
  </a>) was based on the sum of all the anthropogenic forcing factors listed and thus included all factors listed such as land surface forcing estimates. Because these GA data ended in 2011, they were updated to 2015 in two ways, consistent with the evolution of the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 forcing time series, respectively, and the average was taken. The TSI predictor used new data compiled for CMIP6 using data for the CMIP6 Historical Simulation until 2014 and the first year of data (2015) for simulations of the future (
  <a rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" href="#R21">
   <span class="italic">21</span>
  </a>). For the AMO predictor, we used an average of an index based on an eigenvector analysis of worldwide SST (
  <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
   <span class="italic">26</span>
  </a>) and one calculated from North Atlantic minus global SST using HadISST1 (
  <a rid="R33" ref-type="bibr" href="#R33">
   <span class="italic">33</span>
  </a>). Twelve-month running means of the AMO indices were used, leading monthly GST by 1 year (
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">
   <span class="italic">12</span>
  </a>). For ENSO, we used a Niño 3.4 index leading GST by 4 months [leads in the range 3 to 6 months were observed (
  <a rid="R49" ref-type="bibr" href="#R49">
   <span class="italic">49</span>
  </a>) and gave similar regression coefficients], calculated using HadISST2.1.0.0 (
  <a rid="R50" ref-type="bibr" href="#R50">
   <span class="italic">50</span>
  </a>) until 2010. This contains more tropical Pacific data than HadISST1 but had to be updated with HadISST1 from 2011 to 2015. For the IPO, whose time series is highly correlated with that of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (
  <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
   <span class="italic">26</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
   <span class="italic">30</span>
  </a>), we created an unfiltered monthly index using a published IPO pattern (
  <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
   <span class="italic">26</span>
  </a>) and HadISST1. This also leads GST by 4 months. Monthly Niño 3.4 (ENSO) and IPO indices were separately used in 9 of the 18 main regression equations for each period (section S5). The AMO and IPO (and approximately the related ENSO) indices are independent of global mean SST via the eigenvector analysis that mainly created them and thus are largely independent of GST, minimizing circularity with GST in regression equations (
  <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
   <span class="italic">26</span>
  </a>). The volcanic index is an update (
  <a rid="R51" ref-type="bibr" href="#R51">
   <span class="italic">51</span>
  </a>) of data used to study the recent GST slowdown (
  <a rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#R1">
   <span class="italic">1</span>
  </a>). This finishes in 2014; thus, values for months in 2015 were persisted, using the value for December 2014. The average delayed e-folding time of the response of GST to tropical volcanic eruptions was estimated at 8 months from published data (
  <a rid="R35" ref-type="bibr" href="#R35">
   <span class="italic">35</span>
  </a>). We have also used 6 and 12 months; this range of short e-folding times reflects the likelihood that climate responses to short-term sharp cooling are substantially less than those for the slower GA or TSI forcing changes. The average observed GST response time to major volcanoes is generally longer at near 15 months; this is consistent because negative volcanic forcing takes time to develop fully after an eruption (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1B</a>, c). We have used the same delayed e-folding times for periods when negative radiative volcanic forcing increased in magnitude and when it decreased. The AO index was calculated using the 20th Century Reanalysis (
  <a rid="R52" ref-type="bibr" href="#R52">
   <span class="italic">52</span>
  </a>) as the time series of the first eigenvector of pressure at mean sea level over 30° to 90°N in December to March. It was set to zero otherwise.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the regression procedure, 18 of the 54 equations each use e-folding times of GST to TSI forcing of 2 years, 4 years, and 10 years (table S2). There are widely varying estimates of this response time from less than a year (
  <a rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" href="#R13">
   <span class="italic">13</span>
  </a>) to near a decade (
  <a rid="R53" ref-type="bibr" href="#R53">
   <span class="italic">53</span>
  </a>). Section S9 shows the effects on TSI forcing of using different e-folding response times. For the response to GA forcing, our delayed e-folding time of 4 years partly derives from a published model (
  <a rid="R54" ref-type="bibr" href="#R54">
   <span class="italic">54</span>
  </a>) forced with changing greenhouse gases alone. We also used a 10-year GA response time; supporting this are estimated e-folding times of near 8 years for the HadCM3 model (
  <a rid="R54" ref-type="bibr" href="#R54">
   <span class="italic">54</span>
  </a>) and also of 10 years (
  <a rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" href="#R14">
   <span class="italic">14</span>
  </a>). An e-folding GST response time of 4 years is nevertheless consistent with the most comprehensive study so far (
  <a rid="R46" ref-type="bibr" href="#R46">
   <span class="italic">46</span>
  </a>) where the average lag of CMIP5 model responses of near 2 years of GST to TSI forcing is also consistent with this value. Finally, we added a “recalcitrant response” of GST to multicentury changes in forcing (
  <a rid="R54" ref-type="bibr" href="#R54">
   <span class="italic">54</span>
  </a>), using an e-folding time of 200 years; an e-folding time of 500 years gives little difference. Recalcitrant forcing was added to transformed GA series with both 4- and 10-year e-folding response times. Recalcitrant forcing 
  <span class="italic">r</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">i</span>
  </sub> was calculated from all external forcing factors, including volcanic forcing, using data back to 1750 (
  <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">
   <span class="italic">20</span>
  </a>) and projected back to 1290 using average forcing for 1760–1800 to represent forcing throughout the Little Ice Age. The response of GST to recalcitrant forcing

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For modeled GST, we used all available CMIP5 models. The model global means were not masked by the observational coverage. The GST were first averaged across the members of each model ensemble (for models for which such an ensemble was available) and then across the multimodel ensemble. The RCP8.5 CMIP5 simulations were used to cover the 2006–2015 period not covered by the historical CMIP5 simulations.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For observed GST, we separately used three data sets: HadCRUT4.6 updated from HadCRUT4 (
  <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">
   <span class="italic">8</span>
  </a>) (

  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">
   <span class="italic">5</span>
  </a>) (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/monitoring-references/faq/anomalies.php" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.ncdc.noaa.gov/monitoring-references/faq/anomalies.php</span>, as of 28 November 2017). We also used the average of these three data sets, known as the WMO average. Further details are given in section S10. Furthermore, we used an adjusted version of published ERA Interim GST (
  <a rid="R41" ref-type="bibr" href="#R41">
   <span class="italic">41</span>
  </a>) during 1997–2015, which has a physically consistent coverage of the whole globe. We adjusted the ERA Interim GST anomalies, published relative to 1981–2010, to make them consistent with those of WMO GST anomalies relative to 1961–1990, using overlapping monthly data for 1983–1996. ERA Interim GST data in 1979–1982 were not used as they are inhomogeneous with later data (
  <a rid="R41" ref-type="bibr" href="#R41">
   <span class="italic">41</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To create global regression maps, we used the mean of the three temperature data sources (

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" href="#R29">
   <span class="italic">29</span>
  </a>) with a 5° × 5° spatial resolution. For a given period mapped, we used the same training period and cross-validation method as for the corresponding time series analysis. We simplified the calculations by using a single set of cross-validation equations taking appropriate averages of predictors used in the 18 equations (not 54 because we are using just average WMO GST). A separate regression was created in this way for each 5° × 5° region, whether land or ocean; this simplification was adequate as uncertainties were not used. We then reconstructed 5° × 5° box temperatures over periods longer than a month by averaging constituent months. Finally, the contribution of each predictor to temperature in each 5° × 5° box was mapped by multiplying the spatially varying regression coefficients for that predictor by the average predictor time series for that box for the period covered.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cross-correlation significance calculations account for autocorrelations (
  <a rid="R55" ref-type="bibr" href="#R55">
   <span class="italic">55</span>
  </a>). Successive autocorrelations with increasing lag for each series were used to calculate cross-correlation degrees of freedom until one time series has a lagged autocorrelation of &lt;0.10, approximately the threshold of autocorrelation significance at the 5% level. Calculation of trends or linear temperature changes and their significance uses REML, particularly appropriate for short data sets (section S3) (
  <a rid="R56" ref-type="bibr" href="#R56">
   <span class="italic">56</span>
  </a>). REML allows for persistence in monthly residuals through their first serial correlation values. Uncertainties in the monthly GST reconstructions resulting from using 54 different equations or from uncertainties in observed GST were included in REML calculations. For observed GST, uncertainties for HadCRUT4.6 GST were used (
  <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">
   <span class="italic">8</span>
  </a>), increased by taking account of differences between the three WMO data sets for each month. For the CMIP5, GST average published uncertainties were used. Data or model uncertainties only slightly affect the calculation of GST trend or change but reduce trend significance, often quite appreciably, when compared to regression methods neglecting this source of uncertainty. Finally, section S11 and tables S4 (A and B) show cross-correlations between predictor forcings for 1891–2015 and for 1951–2015. Appreciable colinearity between TSI and GA forcing disappears after 1950 but is appreciable over the period as a whole, although it does not usually cause large uncertainties. The other predictors do not have correlations large enough to cause significant problems.
