 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The period 1941–1975 (the big slowdown) is the longest (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4A</a>), with an observed linear cooling of −0.08° ± 0.10°C, although this is not significant. CMIP5 simulates the big slowdown quite well with almost no overall warming at 0.02° ± 0.28°C. Most other details of the big pause simulated by CMIP5 are poor except for cooling due to the eruption of Mt. Agung in 1963 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4A</a>). Reconstructions also show slight overall warming at 0.03° ± 0.04°C (see also below) but reproduce many of the pronounced annual to interannual fluctuations, including the cooling due to the eruption of Mt. Agung (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4B</a>, a to j). 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Figure 4B</a> also shows, as for 1911–1940, that ENSO and the IPO (g) are important for reconstructing interannual GST variations. However, as with CMIP5, a major problem occurs during much of the Second World War. The reconstruction is skillful in 1940, but the observations were warmer than the reconstruction for the next 5 years, especially in 1944 and 1945. This likely arises from observational biases owing to a major change from mainly bucket-based measurements of SST early in the war, adjusted to be warmer than raw observations, to unadjusted ships’ engine intake measurements (

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R33" ref-type="bibr" href="#R33">
   <span class="italic">33</span>
  </a>). The latter likely became dominant quite suddenly from December 1941 (

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" href="#R34">
   <span class="italic">34</span>
  </a>) and are likely to be biased warm. This provides the most prominent discrepancy between observed and reconstructed GST. The warm bias in the observations ends suddenly in late 1945 when there was also a sudden partial reversion to bucket-based measurements (

  </a>). We return to this problem in the section, “Using global maps to investigate reconstruction biases in 1907–1910 and 1944–1945,” below.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because of doubtful Second World War data and sparse data immediately after the Second World War, we concentrate the remaining discussion on 1951–1975. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Figure 4C</a> shows that the linear component of the observed GST temperature change was almost zero over 1951–1975 (0.02° ± 0.13°C). The reconstruction also shows no overall warming at −0.01° ± 0.04°C, as does CMIP5 GST at 0.02° ± 0.31°C. Thus, both very well reconstruct and simulate the lack of trend in the more secure part of the big slowdown. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Figure 4C</a> shows that an essentially zero change in reconstructed GST is the residual of a significant reconstructed warming of 0.14° ± 0.03°C due to GA and small but significant reconstructed cooling influences due to the AMO (−0.05° ± 0.02°C) and volcanic forcing (−0.04 ± 0.01°C), with perhaps a small insignificant cooling due to ENSO and the IPO (−0.02° ± 0.03°C). Thus, net warming of GST from GA continued very slowly during much of the big slowdown due to an increasing influence of anthropogenic aerosols at that time (
  <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">
   <span class="italic">20</span>
  </a>) but accelerated after 1970 [
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figs. 1B</a> (e) and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">4B</a> (a)]. GA warming just cancelled the small signals from several natural forcing factors that collectively modestly cooled GST.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The good correlation skill of reconstructed GST over 1951–1975 is reflected in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">Table 1C</a>, which also shows the poor skill of CMIP5 GST. Most reconstruction correlation statistics with observed GST are significant at better than the 1% level, but no CMIP5 statistics reach this level. Reconstruction statistics are particularly good for low-pass multiannual and for high-pass interannual time scales at 0.80 and 0.81, respectively, although much smaller, high-pass seasonal correlations are still significant at the 0.05% level with a correlation of 0.36, reflecting interseasonal skill contributed by ENSO and the IPO. Table S3 shows correlations for 1941–1975 that are, as expected, generally lower but still show some skill.
