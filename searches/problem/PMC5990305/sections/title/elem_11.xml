 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This warming period shows rather larger multiannual fluctuations in the rate of warming of GST than does 1911–1940 (compare 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5A</a> with 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3A</a>). Observed fluctuations in GST in the early 1980s and 1990s are caused by volcanic forcing (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5B</a>, j) due to the eruptions of El Chichón and Mt. Pinatubo (

   <span class="italic">35</span>
  </a>). Cooling in the late 1980s arises from ENSO and the IPO (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5B</a>, g), particularly because a moderately strong El Niño in 1987 was followed by a very strong La Niña in 1988–1989 (

CMIP5 GST reflects the volcanic cooling signals skillfully and the stronger GA influence than in 1911–1940, but of course, it cannot capture the ENSO-related cooling between 1987 and 1989.

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Figure 5C</a> shows that the warming of observed and reconstructed GST over 1976–1997 (0.38° ± 0.15°C and 0.36° ± 0.04°C, respectively) was both significant at the 0.01% level and similar. CMIP5 gives a slightly smaller warming of 0.31° ± 0.22°C to that observed, a rate of 0.14° ± 0.10°C per decade significant at the 1% level, compared to the observed rate of 0.17° ± 0.07°C per decade. A key result (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5</a>, B and C) is that, although there was a small but significant reconstructed warming influence from the AMO (0.02° ± 0.01°C) and a somewhat larger but small overall reconstructed cooling influence from volcanic forcing (−0.05° ± 0.03°C), much of the dominant influence was net warming due to GA at 0.35° ± 0.02°C. This is a reconstructed rate of 0.16° ± 0.01°C per decade. Reconstruction correlation skill with observed GST was high or very high (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">Table 1D</a>) and generally higher for both low-pass and interannual high-pass correlations than in the previous periods. Thus, low-pass multiannual correlation of reconstructed and observed GST reached 0.94, with a high-pass interannual correlation of 0.87. Shorter time scale high-pass skill estimates were much lower but still significant. CMIP5 correlation skill is higher than that for previous periods but markedly less than the reconstruction skill, with a low-pass multiannual correlation with an observed GST of 0.76 and an interannual high-pass correlation of 0.50.
