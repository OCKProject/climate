 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the first slowdown period 1896–1910, reconstructions for the subperiod 1907–1910 were too warm. To investigate this further, global maps combining surface air temperature anomalies over land with SST were reconstructed for 1907–1910 using the monthly WMO data set at 5° latitude × 5° longitude resolution (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F7" href="#F7">Fig. 7A</a>). For each 5° × 5° box, significance of the differences between reconstructions and observations was calculated at the 1% level using a two-sided 
  <span class="italic">t</span> test. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F7" href="#F7">Figure 7A</a> (a to c) shows that the main cause of the reconstruction warm bias is relative observed coolness of much of the global oceans. Accordingly, most of the oceans are observed to be significantly (at the 1% level) cooler than reconstructions. By contrast, land surface temperatures do not show large-scale differences of either sign. Besides possible observed SST cold biases and most SSTs being strongly positively bias-corrected at this time (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A bigger problem, but of opposite sign, occurs during the Second World War where reconstructed GST is much colder than observations, especially in 1944 to 1945. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Figure 4A</a> suggests that this offset lasted from about 1942 until late 1945 or the start of 1946. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F7" href="#F7">Figure 7B</a> (a to c) shows similar global maps for reconstructions and observations averaged over 1944 and 1945. Observed SST, which is currently not bias-adjusted, is warmer than reconstructions almost worldwide. As mentioned above, a possible reason is a major increase in engine intake SSTs that are often biased warm (

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R33" ref-type="bibr" href="#R33">
   <span class="italic">33</span>
  </a>). This may have been a particular problem with the mix of warships and merchant ships reporting SST during the Second World War. Soon after the war, an opposite problem rapidly developed due to an increase in the fraction of SSTs measured using cold-biased uninsulated buckets (

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R45" ref-type="bibr" href="#R45">
   <span class="italic">45</span>
  </a>). Therefore, the fact that the warm bias problem did not last beyond 1946 is consistent with a warm SST bias caused by dominant engine intake data. Another possibility is that reconstructed AMO warming was underestimated during the Second World War. Against this possibility, AMO warming usually affects the North Atlantic and North Pacific, while the Southern Hemisphere tends to be near or slightly cooler than normal (
