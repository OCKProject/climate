 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this first main warming period, observed GST warmed steadily (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3A</a>), with the observed linear component of warming over 1911–1940 of 0.38° ± 0.18°C being more than that reconstructed (0.25° ± 0.04°C) but less certain in magnitude. Both changes are highly significant. The estimated differential warming trend (observed minus reconstructed) of 0.08° ± 0.07°C is not significant at the 1% level, but slower reconstructed warming results from warmer than observed GST at the beginning of the period. Warming simulated by CMIP5 was also less than observed (0.19° ± 0.16°C) and is only significant at the 2% level. This is explained partly by CMIP5 GST also being warmer than observed at the beginning of the period; significance is further reduced by a high serial correlation of CMIP5 trend residuals. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Figure 3B</a> (a to j) shows reconstructions from the 54 main regression equations for individual or combinations of forcing factors for 1911–1940. Most reconstructed warming arises from a combination of GA (a), AMO (h), TSI (i), and volcanic forcing (j), while most of the interseasonal and interannual variability arises from ENSO and the IPO (g). 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Figure 3C</a> shows that these factors, except the last, appear to contribute significantly to warming over 1911–1940, but none dominates. Allowing for uncertainties, the largest warming factor appears to be GA, giving a warming of 0.12° ± 0.01°C. The AMO contributes 0.05° ± 0.01°C, with a TSI contribution of 0.04° ± 0.01°C. Volcanic forcing is smaller at 0.03° ± 0.01°C but is still significant at the 1% level. Accordingly, increases of greenhouse gases contribute significantly to the early 20th-century GST warming trend but by no means fully explain it, with a more modest TSI influence than in early climate model simulations (
  <a rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" href="#R18">
   <span class="italic">18</span>
  </a>). An AMO warming due to the increasing positive state of the AMO, which a CMIP5 multimodel average cannot capture, is consistent with previous suggestions (
  <a rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" href="#R31">
   <span class="italic">31</span>
  </a>), at least for the Northern Hemisphere component of AMO warming. ENSO and the IPO appear to contribute little to overall warming (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3C</a>), consistent with alternative instrumental IPO reconstructions (
  <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
   <span class="italic">30</span>
  </a>) not used here. However, this conclusion may disagree with paleoclimate reconstructions of the IPO (
  <a rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" href="#R32">
   <span class="italic">32</span>
  </a>) where the suggestion was made that the relative lack of Pacific SST data at this time creates an erroneous estimate of IPO changes. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Figure 3</a> (A and C) leaves room for additional warming from the IPO and ENSO should future digitized historic instrumental SST data support this (see Discussion and Conclusions).

  <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">Table 1B</a> shows the correlation skill and significance of reconstructed and CMIP5 GST with observed GST. Reconstruction skill levels are similar to those for 1896–1910 for low- and high-pass skill (for example, low-pass correlation skill for multiannual periods is 0.78), although high-pass reconstruction interannual skill is less than that for 1896–1910 at 0.59. All reconstruction skill measures are nevertheless significant or highly significant. The smaller high-pass interannual skill in these reconstructions than in 1896–1910 mainly arises from three periods of about a year where reconstructions are poor (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3A</a>), one of the worst being in much of 1911. Observed GST was markedly cooler then than reconstructions, continuing the warm bias in the reconstructions over 1907–1910 noted above. Apparent poor skill around 1915 is also notable when observations were markedly warmer than reconstructions. CMIP5 GST shows some correlation skill (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">Table 1B</a>) as it picks up the warming trend in observed GST moderately well, but skill as a whole is considerably less than for reconstructions. CMIP5 high-pass skill is low or negative on interannual time scales. Overall, the reconstructions are much more skillful than CMIP5 simulations over 1911–1940 and demonstrate the several causes of observed early 20th-century warming, including increasing greenhouse gases, but none dominates.
