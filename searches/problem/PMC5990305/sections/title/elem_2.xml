   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1A</a> shows monthly WMO GST and its constituent HadCRUT4.6, NCDC, and GISTEMP GST anomalies relative to a 1961–1990 average, together with 95% confidence ranges around the WMO average for each month. The year 1891 is chosen as the first year analyzed as uncertainties in GST increase quite rapidly before then. On decadal time scales, the only periods of obvious observed GST cooling after 1891 are around 1896–1910 and 1941–1950. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1B</a> shows the average influences of the various forcings on GST using the multiple regression reconstructions where cross-validation is carried out over the whole period 1891–2015. This particular reconstruction uses the average of 81,000 fairly similar regression equations throughout the record (see Materials and Methods). The total of 81,000 equations first results from the use of separate regression equations for each of the 1500 months over 1891–2015. In addition, there are 18 predictor combinations for each of the three GST series. The 18 predictor combinations are derived from two or three variants of the ENSO or IPO, volcanic, TSI, and GA forcings, as well as fixed AMO and AO forcings. These combinations are shown in table S2 of section S5. 
   <a ref-type="disp-formula" rid="E1" href="#E1">Equation 1</a> is an example, calculated from the average of 1272 cross-validated equations (training period 1891–1996) for 1998–2013, based on a typical set of the 54 GST and predictor combinations used for this period

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Monthly forcing values are normalized over 1891–2015 so that regression coefficient magnitudes can be compared directly. The other 53 equations vary sufficiently to be used to estimate uncertainties in the reconstructions. ENSO and unfiltered IPO are highly correlated (monthly 
   <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.76) and thus are each used in 9 (of 18) different predictor combinations for each version of GST (Materials and Methods and section S5). Furthermore, VOLC has a positive value at times when negative volcanic forcing is less than the average for 1961–1990, while the AO is set to zero from April to November (Materials and Methods) as its sign and magnitude do not relate clearly to higher-latitude Northern Hemisphere surface temperature anomalies at these times of the year. The dominant factor in all equations is GA. 
   <a ref-type="disp-formula" rid="E1" href="#E1">Equation 1</a> is quite similar to that published for standardized annual forcing and GST data over 1947–2006 (
   <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">
    <span class="italic">12</span>
   </a>), although the AO was not included.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1B</a> (b), ENSO influences are combined with those of the IPO. Much of the influence of the December–March AO is intermonthly, but interannual fluctuations also occur, including a decadal decline in the Northern Hemisphere winter AO around 2000–2010 previously highlighted (
   <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">
    <span class="italic">27</span>
   </a>). A larger than usual influence of the TSI 11-year cycle that reduces GST from about 2001 to 2010 by about 0.08°C (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1B</a>, d) is also notable. Changing GA increases GST at all times, most slowly in the two decades after the Second World War, but increases GST at its strongest and nearly constant rate from the late 1970s. In the early 21st-century slowdown of 1998–2013, the SD of the monthly regression residuals (observed GST minus reconstructed GST) using all the chosen forcing factors is very similar to the assessed uncertainties in monthly observed GST itself (section S6 and fig. S5). However, the structure of the mean residuals (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1B</a>, g) is complex before 1950, reflecting poorly reconstructed cold conditions around 1907–1910, a short sharp peak of unexplained observed warmth in the sparse observed data of the First World War and a peak in unexplained observed warmth during the Second World War (see the “Using global maps to investigate reconstruction biases in 1907–1910 and 1944–1945” section). After 1950, mean residuals appear quasi-random, although they have an intermonthly correlation near 0.5 falling to near zero at 6 months lag.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1C</a> (a) provides an overview of the GST reconstructions using all data. It shows high reconstruction skill on interannual time scales (2- to 5-year high-pass–filtered period; correlation, 0.78 with observed GST; significance, &lt;0.01%) and for the whole spectrum (correlation, 0.93; significance, 0.5%). Materials and Methods describes correlation significance calculations. For the average GST from the 40 CMIP5 models (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1C</a>, b), its correlation with observed GST over 1891–2015, dominated by trend, is only modestly less at 0.89 (significance, 0.5%), but there is relatively little high-pass 2- to 5-year skill (correlation, 0.06; significance, 2%). High-pass skill results almost entirely from skillful simulations of episodic volcanic forcings of GST around 1902–1906, 1965–1969, 1983–1985, and 1991–1995. The cool period before 1915 is missed by CMIP5 but is somewhat better in the reconstructions (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1C</a>, a), although the cold conditions in 1907–1910 are underestimated by the reconstructions. The observed rate of warming from 1911 to 1940 is markedly better reconstructed than simulated by CMIP5, with CMIP5 simulating this warming trend too weakly. The CMIP5 models reproduce the observed slowing of GST warming from about 1940 to 1975, but the observed peak of warmth during the Second World War is missed, just as it is by the reconstructions (see the “Using global maps to investigate reconstruction biases in 1907–1910 and 1944–1945” section). The warming from around 1976 to 1997 is well reconstructed and well simulated by CMIP5, but the slowdown in GST around 1998–2013, particularly 2001–2013, is missed entirely by CMIP5 but is very well reconstructed. The rate of simulated warming by CMIP5 of 0.22° ± 0.06°C per decade over the period 1976–2015 is somewhat greater than that observed at 0.17° ± 0.02°C. By contrast, the reconstruction gives the same rate of warming as observed, 0.17° ± 0.01°C per decade. This CMIP5 overestimate of recent observed warming in GST, although not quite significant at the 10% level using CMIP5 uncertainties, is shown below to derive from a relatively large overestimate of warming in the recent slowdown since 1998. This overestimate is at least partly due to missing natural forced and internal variability. For obvious reasons, CMIP5 models were unable to simulate the observed changes in the IPO/ENSO, AMO, and the AO, and they were also not provided with observed solar and volcanic forcings for much of this period.

 <sec disp-level="2" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Period 1896–1910</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reconstructions are made for 1891–1913 to give a longer perspective. This period shows a marked overall cooling in GST (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2A</a>). The reconstruction is surprisingly good for 1891–1906, but overestimates observed GST thereafter, especially during 1907–1910. CMIP5 average GST is also skillful until about 1902 but much less skillful thereafter (section S6 discusses apparent annual cycles in CMIP5 GST anomalies). As for other slowdown and warming periods, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2B</a> shows the level of agreement between the 54 main regression reconstructions. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figure 2B</a> (a to j) shows how the contributions to reconstructed GST of the forcing factors build up. For example, the joint influence of ENSO and the IPO is very important for reconstructing interannual and subannual GST over this period (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2B</a>, g). 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figure 2C</a> shows the linear change in GST over 1896–1910 and changes derived from the components and all the forcing factors. These reconstructions are generally less successful than for other periods. However, although the observed linear cooling of GST over 1896–1910 is large at −0.34° ± 0.28°C, its uncertainty is also large. Accordingly, the observed cooling just fails significance at the 1% level, partly due to relatively large observed GST uncertainties included in the REML trend method. Reconstructed cooling is underestimated at −0.08° ± 0.07°C, which is also not significant at the 1% level, but the differential cooling error of −0.27° ± 0.09°C is significant at the 1% level. CMIP5 gives only a nominal cooling of −0.05° ± 0.19°C. Although the reconstruction underestimates observed cooling, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2C</a> shows that ENSO and the IPO contribute significantly to cooling (−0.09° ± 0.05°C over 1896–1910), with perhaps a very small, if significant, cooling contribution from the AMO. The IPO fluctuated quite strongly but moved to a negative phase toward the end of the period (
   <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
    <span class="italic">30</span>
   </a>). Volcanic eruptions in 1902 also cool GST shortly afterward (
   <a rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" href="#R7">
    <span class="italic">7</span>
   </a>) and perhaps, to a small extent, after an eruption in 1907 (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2B</a>) (
   <a rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" href="#R7">
    <span class="italic">7</span>
   </a>), but volcanic cooling over 1896–1910 is only significant at the 2% level. The fact that observed GST becomes somewhat cooler than the reconstruction from 1902 to 1905 hints that the 1902 volcanic forcing might be underestimated, although the larger 1907–1910 underestimate likely requires additional causes (see the “Using global maps to investigate reconstruction biases in 1907–1910 and 1944–1945” section).

   <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">Table 1A</a> shows the correlation skill and significance of reconstructed and CMIP5 GST with observed GST over 1896–1910 using low- and high-pass correlations on several time scales. All reconstruction correlations are significant at the 2% level or better, whereas for CMIP5, only the high-pass–filtered seasonal time scale shows significant skill. CMIP5 GST is anticorrelated with observed GST for all low-pass correlations and for multiannual high-pass correlations. However, CMIP5 GST does show a slight overall cooling trend over 1896–1910, although it is much smaller in magnitude than observed. The CMIP5 GST behavior may be explained by a combination of a weak anthropogenic forcing during this period and some of the high-frequency variability being driven by ENSO/IPO and volcanic forcings (that is, the 1902 Santa Maria eruption). In contrast to CMIP5 GST and despite problems with the magnitude of the trend, reconstructed multiannual low- and high-pass correlations (0.78 and 0.80) are nearly as high as values in 1976–1997 and 1998–2013 discussed below.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Period 1911–1940</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this first main warming period, observed GST warmed steadily (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3A</a>), with the observed linear component of warming over 1911–1940 of 0.38° ± 0.18°C being more than that reconstructed (0.25° ± 0.04°C) but less certain in magnitude. Both changes are highly significant. The estimated differential warming trend (observed minus reconstructed) of 0.08° ± 0.07°C is not significant at the 1% level, but slower reconstructed warming results from warmer than observed GST at the beginning of the period. Warming simulated by CMIP5 was also less than observed (0.19° ± 0.16°C) and is only significant at the 2% level. This is explained partly by CMIP5 GST also being warmer than observed at the beginning of the period; significance is further reduced by a high serial correlation of CMIP5 trend residuals. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Figure 3B</a> (a to j) shows reconstructions from the 54 main regression equations for individual or combinations of forcing factors for 1911–1940. Most reconstructed warming arises from a combination of GA (a), AMO (h), TSI (i), and volcanic forcing (j), while most of the interseasonal and interannual variability arises from ENSO and the IPO (g). 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Figure 3C</a> shows that these factors, except the last, appear to contribute significantly to warming over 1911–1940, but none dominates. Allowing for uncertainties, the largest warming factor appears to be GA, giving a warming of 0.12° ± 0.01°C. The AMO contributes 0.05° ± 0.01°C, with a TSI contribution of 0.04° ± 0.01°C. Volcanic forcing is smaller at 0.03° ± 0.01°C but is still significant at the 1% level. Accordingly, increases of greenhouse gases contribute significantly to the early 20th-century GST warming trend but by no means fully explain it, with a more modest TSI influence than in early climate model simulations (
   <a rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" href="#R18">
    <span class="italic">18</span>
   </a>). An AMO warming due to the increasing positive state of the AMO, which a CMIP5 multimodel average cannot capture, is consistent with previous suggestions (
   <a rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" href="#R31">
    <span class="italic">31</span>
   </a>), at least for the Northern Hemisphere component of AMO warming. ENSO and the IPO appear to contribute little to overall warming (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3C</a>), consistent with alternative instrumental IPO reconstructions (
   <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
    <span class="italic">30</span>
   </a>) not used here. However, this conclusion may disagree with paleoclimate reconstructions of the IPO (
   <a rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" href="#R32">
    <span class="italic">32</span>
   </a>) where the suggestion was made that the relative lack of Pacific SST data at this time creates an erroneous estimate of IPO changes. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Figure 3</a> (A and C) leaves room for additional warming from the IPO and ENSO should future digitized historic instrumental SST data support this (see Discussion and Conclusions).

   <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">Table 1B</a> shows the correlation skill and significance of reconstructed and CMIP5 GST with observed GST. Reconstruction skill levels are similar to those for 1896–1910 for low- and high-pass skill (for example, low-pass correlation skill for multiannual periods is 0.78), although high-pass reconstruction interannual skill is less than that for 1896–1910 at 0.59. All reconstruction skill measures are nevertheless significant or highly significant. The smaller high-pass interannual skill in these reconstructions than in 1896–1910 mainly arises from three periods of about a year where reconstructions are poor (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3A</a>), one of the worst being in much of 1911. Observed GST was markedly cooler then than reconstructions, continuing the warm bias in the reconstructions over 1907–1910 noted above. Apparent poor skill around 1915 is also notable when observations were markedly warmer than reconstructions. CMIP5 GST shows some correlation skill (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">Table 1B</a>) as it picks up the warming trend in observed GST moderately well, but skill as a whole is considerably less than for reconstructions. CMIP5 high-pass skill is low or negative on interannual time scales. Overall, the reconstructions are much more skillful than CMIP5 simulations over 1911–1940 and demonstrate the several causes of observed early 20th-century warming, including increasing greenhouse gases, but none dominates.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Periods 1941–1975 and 1951–1975</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The period 1941–1975 (the big slowdown) is the longest (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4A</a>), with an observed linear cooling of −0.08° ± 0.10°C, although this is not significant. CMIP5 simulates the big slowdown quite well with almost no overall warming at 0.02° ± 0.28°C. Most other details of the big pause simulated by CMIP5 are poor except for cooling due to the eruption of Mt. Agung in 1963 (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4A</a>). Reconstructions also show slight overall warming at 0.03° ± 0.04°C (see also below) but reproduce many of the pronounced annual to interannual fluctuations, including the cooling due to the eruption of Mt. Agung (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4B</a>, a to j). 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Figure 4B</a> also shows, as for 1911–1940, that ENSO and the IPO (g) are important for reconstructing interannual GST variations. However, as with CMIP5, a major problem occurs during much of the Second World War. The reconstruction is skillful in 1940, but the observations were warmer than the reconstruction for the next 5 years, especially in 1944 and 1945. This likely arises from observational biases owing to a major change from mainly bucket-based measurements of SST early in the war, adjusted to be warmer than raw observations, to unadjusted ships’ engine intake measurements (
   <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">
    <span class="italic">28</span>
   </a>, 
   <a rid="R33" ref-type="bibr" href="#R33">
    <span class="italic">33</span>
   </a>). The latter likely became dominant quite suddenly from December 1941 (

   </a>, 
   <a rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" href="#R34">
    <span class="italic">34</span>
   </a>) and are likely to be biased warm. This provides the most prominent discrepancy between observed and reconstructed GST. The warm bias in the observations ends suddenly in late 1945 when there was also a sudden partial reversion to bucket-based measurements (
   <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">
    <span class="italic">28</span>
   </a>). We return to this problem in the section, “Using global maps to investigate reconstruction biases in 1907–1910 and 1944–1945,” below.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because of doubtful Second World War data and sparse data immediately after the Second World War, we concentrate the remaining discussion on 1951–1975. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Figure 4C</a> shows that the linear component of the observed GST temperature change was almost zero over 1951–1975 (0.02° ± 0.13°C). The reconstruction also shows no overall warming at −0.01° ± 0.04°C, as does CMIP5 GST at 0.02° ± 0.31°C. Thus, both very well reconstruct and simulate the lack of trend in the more secure part of the big slowdown. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Figure 4C</a> shows that an essentially zero change in reconstructed GST is the residual of a significant reconstructed warming of 0.14° ± 0.03°C due to GA and small but significant reconstructed cooling influences due to the AMO (−0.05° ± 0.02°C) and volcanic forcing (−0.04 ± 0.01°C), with perhaps a small insignificant cooling due to ENSO and the IPO (−0.02° ± 0.03°C). Thus, net warming of GST from GA continued very slowly during much of the big slowdown due to an increasing influence of anthropogenic aerosols at that time (
   <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">
    <span class="italic">20</span>
   </a>) but accelerated after 1970 [
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figs. 1B</a> (e) and 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">4B</a> (a)]. GA warming just cancelled the small signals from several natural forcing factors that collectively modestly cooled GST.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The good correlation skill of reconstructed GST over 1951–1975 is reflected in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">Table 1C</a>, which also shows the poor skill of CMIP5 GST. Most reconstruction correlation statistics with observed GST are significant at better than the 1% level, but no CMIP5 statistics reach this level. Reconstruction statistics are particularly good for low-pass multiannual and for high-pass interannual time scales at 0.80 and 0.81, respectively, although much smaller, high-pass seasonal correlations are still significant at the 0.05% level with a correlation of 0.36, reflecting interseasonal skill contributed by ENSO and the IPO. Table S3 shows correlations for 1941–1975 that are, as expected, generally lower but still show some skill.

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3A</a>). Observed fluctuations in GST in the early 1980s and 1990s are caused by volcanic forcing (

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5B</a>, g), particularly because a moderately strong El Niño in 1987 was followed by a very strong La Niña in 1988–1989 (

CMIP5 GST reflects the volcanic cooling signals skillfully and the stronger GA influence than in 1911–1940, but of course, it cannot capture the ENSO-related cooling between 1987 and 1989.

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Figure 5C</a> shows that the warming of observed and reconstructed GST over 1976–1997 (0.38° ± 0.15°C and 0.36° ± 0.04°C, respectively) was both significant at the 0.01% level and similar. CMIP5 gives a slightly smaller warming of 0.31° ± 0.22°C to that observed, a rate of 0.14° ± 0.10°C per decade significant at the 1% level, compared to the observed rate of 0.17° ± 0.07°C per decade. A key result (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5</a>, B and C) is that, although there was a small but significant reconstructed warming influence from the AMO (0.02° ± 0.01°C) and a somewhat larger but small overall reconstructed cooling influence from volcanic forcing (−0.05° ± 0.03°C), much of the dominant influence was net warming due to GA at 0.35° ± 0.02°C. This is a reconstructed rate of 0.16° ± 0.01°C per decade. Reconstruction correlation skill with observed GST was high or very high (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">Table 1D</a>) and generally higher for both low-pass and interannual high-pass correlations than in the previous periods. Thus, low-pass multiannual correlation of reconstructed and observed GST reached 0.94, with a high-pass interannual correlation of 0.87. Shorter time scale high-pass skill estimates were much lower but still significant. CMIP5 correlation skill is higher than that for previous periods but markedly less than the reconstruction skill, with a low-pass multiannual correlation with an observed GST of 0.76 and an interannual high-pass correlation of 0.50.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This third slowdown period is often known as the pause or hiatus. It is not easy to define, but it started in about 1998 and can currently be regarded as finishing in 2013 (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1A</a>). Besides taking an overview of the slightly longer period 1997–2015, we investigate the three overlapping slowdown periods 1998–2013, 2001–2010, and 2001–2013. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Figure 6A</a> shows that reconstructed GST from the beginning of 1997 until the end of 2015 follows observed GST quite closely on interannual and some subannual time scales. Monthly observed GST often deviates strongly from the reconstructions, and as elsewhere in the record, observed monthly GST values have a much larger uncertainty than annual values [1σ uncertainties in HadCRUT4 average near 0.09° and 0.05°C, respectively, over 1997–2015 (

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Figure 6B</a> (a) reflects a steady average reconstructed warming due to GA averaging 0.17°C per decade, about the same as 1976–1997 despite the observed slowdown. This indicates that no slowdown occurred in background GA warming. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Figure 6B</a> (b) shows that adding reconstructed TSI forcing markedly improves the shape of reconstructed GST from GA forcing alone. Adding all other forcing factors, especially ENSO and the IPO, considerably increases this correspondence on all time scales down to the subannual. The match between observed and average reconstructed GST is now quite close throughout 1997–2015 (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Figure 6C</a> shows the reconstructed GST changes. In all three periods (1998–2013, 2001–2010, and 2001–2013), the observed but insignificant GST changes (0.11° ± 0.17°C, 0.07° ± 0.15°C, and 0.07° ± 0.13°C, respectively) are quite well (1998–2013) or very well (2001–2010 and 2001–2013) matched by corresponding reconstructed changes (0.17° ± 0.06°C, 0.04° ± 0.10°C, and 0.10° ± 0.08°C), although reconstructed warming over 1998–2013 is significant. The CMIP5 GST change over 1998–2013 is, by contrast, highly significant at 0.36° ± 0.10°C, a rate of 0.23° ± −0.06°C per decade that varies little over the period (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Fig. 6A</a>). This is markedly higher than the 1976–1997 rate of GST increase shown by CMIP5. The reconstructed component of GST change due to GA alone over 1998–2013 is 0.27° ± 0.01°C. This is not only much more than the total observed warming of 0.11°C but also distinctly less than the total warming shown by CMIP5. The latter, of course, will have been unable to simulate changes in the IPO, ENSO, and the AO, and CMIP5 models did not have observed volcanic and solar forcings for much of this period. A key published finding for the 1998–2013 slowdown, partly based on model simulations, is a cooling influence of ENSO/IPO (

   </a>, 
   <a rid="R37" ref-type="bibr" href="#R37">
    <span class="italic">37</span>
   </a>). However, over the early part of the period 1999–2008, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Fig. 6B</a> (g) is consistent with a slight overall warming of GST from ENSO/IPO (
   <a rid="R38" ref-type="bibr" href="#R38">
    <span class="italic">38</span>
   </a>). Nevertheless, reconstructed cooling due to ENSO/IPO is seen in the three subperiods (1998–2013, −0.05° ± −0.05°C; 2001–2010, −0.03° ± −0.08°C; 2001–2013, −0.04° ± −0.06°C). However, none of these ENSO/IPO cooling influences is significant at the 1% level, although the 1998–2013 cooling is significant at the 5% level. By contrast, the TSI cooling influence is significant at the 0.1% level or better in 2001–2010 and 2001–2013 and at the 2% level in 1998–2013. Except in 1998–2013, when solar forcing actually causes some warming of GST between 1998 and 2002, overall solar cooling is larger than that due to the ENSO/IPO [
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Figs. 6B</a> (i) and 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1B</a> (d)]. Over 1998–2013, 2001–2010, and 2001–2013, TSI cooling of GST is reconstructed as −0.03° ± 0.03°C, −0.08° ± 0.04°C, and −0.06° ± −0.04°C, respectively, with the largest TSI cooling influence over 2001–2010. The “Using global maps to investigate reconstruction biases in 1907–1910 and 1944–1945” section provides further evidence of a TSI cooling signal. A consistent but small significant volcanic cooling influence in each subperiod (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Fig. 6C</a>) agrees with previously reported volcanic cooling influences (
   <a rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#R1">
    <span class="italic">1</span>
   </a>). Finally, although the influence of the AO is always small and not significant, it gives a visible cooling of −0.015° ± 0.025°C in 2001–2010 (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Fig. 6C</a>). This is caused by a distinct trend in December to March toward a more negative AO over this period, creating increasingly cold winter conditions over mid- and high-latitude Eurasia (
   <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">
    <span class="italic">27</span>

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There remain doubts about the measurement of GST during the recent slowdown because rapidly increasing Arctic warming may be underestimated (
   <a rid="R39" ref-type="bibr" href="#R39">
    <span class="italic">39</span>

   <a rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" href="#R40">
    <span class="italic">40</span>
   </a>). An offsetting problem is that Antarctica as a whole has been warming much more slowly than the global average, and it is also poorly sampled. The GST data sets do not represent either region very well. This problem has recently been investigated (
   <a rid="R41" ref-type="bibr" href="#R41">
    <span class="italic">41</span>
   </a>) using the ERA Interim Reanalysis (
   <a rid="R42" ref-type="bibr" href="#R42">
    <span class="italic">42</span>
   </a>) to estimate better recent values of GST. ERA Interim estimates near-surface air temperature in data-sparse regions in a physically consistent way with the help of a weather forecasting model. Use of ERA Interim, however, does not lead to significantly different conclusions about the causes of the 1998–2013 slowdown (see Materials and Methods and section S8). The observed warming of ERA Interim GST over 1998–2013 is rather larger than that for WMO GST at 0.20° ± 0.20°C, although still not significant at the 1% level, mainly because it represents the rapidly warming Arctic better and agrees somewhat better with the reconstructed GST warming of 0.17° ± −0.06°C. However, ERA Interim GST warming increases after 2001 only slightly more than WMO GST at 0.11° ± 0.26°C (2001–2010) and 0.10° ± 0.20°C (2001–2013) (see figs. S6 and S7), so our analysis does not detect any significant differences in the influences of the forcing factors on the 1998–2013 slowdown when using ERA Interim GST in place of WMO GST, although ERA Interim does hint at more observed warming.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our main conclusion is that the most robust influence on the 1998–2013 slowdown resulted from the cooling effects of reduced TSI forcing between 2003 and 2011 (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Fig. 6B</a>, i) followed by a trend toward increasing La Niña conditions and a negative IPO in its second half. The negative IPO is in turn likely to have been enhanced by regional anthropogenic aerosol forcing (
   <a rid="R43" ref-type="bibr" href="#R43">
    <span class="italic">43</span>
   </a>). Cooling throughout the slowdown was slightly but significantly enhanced by persistent but small increases in volcanic forcing. Previous studies (

    <span class="italic">44</span>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the first slowdown period 1896–1910, reconstructions for the subperiod 1907–1910 were too warm. To investigate this further, global maps combining surface air temperature anomalies over land with SST were reconstructed for 1907–1910 using the monthly WMO data set at 5° latitude × 5° longitude resolution (

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F7" href="#F7">Figure 7A</a> (a to c) shows that the main cause of the reconstruction warm bias is relative observed coolness of much of the global oceans. Accordingly, most of the oceans are observed to be significantly (at the 1% level) cooler than reconstructions. By contrast, land surface temperatures do not show large-scale differences of either sign. Besides possible observed SST cold biases and most SSTs being strongly positively bias-corrected at this time (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A bigger problem, but of opposite sign, occurs during the Second World War where reconstructed GST is much colder than observations, especially in 1944 to 1945. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Figure 4A</a> suggests that this offset lasted from about 1942 until late 1945 or the start of 1946. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F7" href="#F7">Figure 7B</a> (a to c) shows similar global maps for reconstructions and observations averaged over 1944 and 1945. Observed SST, which is currently not bias-adjusted, is warmer than reconstructions almost worldwide. As mentioned above, a possible reason is a major increase in engine intake SSTs that are often biased warm (

   <a rid="R33" ref-type="bibr" href="#R33">
    <span class="italic">33</span>

Another possibility is that reconstructed AMO warming was underestimated during the Second World War. Against this possibility, AMO warming usually affects the North Atlantic and North Pacific, while the Southern Hemisphere tends to be near or slightly cooler than normal (

REML calculations are too time-consuming for such a large data set. A worldwide cooling signal is fairly consistent over the oceans but very patchy over land. Its average global magnitude of −0.13°C is larger than the REML estimate of −0.08°C, partly because calculations are made separately for each 5° × 5° box, and REML estimates are likely more accurate for short periods.
