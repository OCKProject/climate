 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This third slowdown period is often known as the pause or hiatus. It is not easy to define, but it started in about 1998 and can currently be regarded as finishing in 2013 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1A</a>). Besides taking an overview of the slightly longer period 1997–2015, we investigate the three overlapping slowdown periods 1998–2013, 2001–2010, and 2001–2013. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Figure 6A</a> shows that reconstructed GST from the beginning of 1997 until the end of 2015 follows observed GST quite closely on interannual and some subannual time scales. Monthly observed GST often deviates strongly from the reconstructions, and as elsewhere in the record, observed monthly GST values have a much larger uncertainty than annual values [1σ uncertainties in HadCRUT4 average near 0.09° and 0.05°C, respectively, over 1997–2015 (
  <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">
   <span class="italic">8</span>
  </a>)]. CMIP5 GST, by contrast, fails to capture the slowdown at all, much as previously noted (
  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </a>). CMIP5 average GST also shows artificial fluctuations on the annual time scale in this period (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Fig. 6A</a>). Again, see section S6 for a discussion of apparent annual cycles in CMIP5 GST anomalies. These can cause artificial high-frequency correlations between observed and CMIP5 GST.

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Figure 6B</a> first shows that reconstruction uncertainty tends to increase after 2010. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Figure 6B</a> (a) reflects a steady average reconstructed warming due to GA averaging 0.17°C per decade, about the same as 1976–1997 despite the observed slowdown. This indicates that no slowdown occurred in background GA warming. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Figure 6B</a> (b) shows that adding reconstructed TSI forcing markedly improves the shape of reconstructed GST from GA forcing alone. Adding all other forcing factors, especially ENSO and the IPO, considerably increases this correspondence on all time scales down to the subannual. The match between observed and average reconstructed GST is now quite close throughout 1997–2015 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Fig. 6A</a>), except on monthly time scales and for some multimonth periods.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Figure 6C</a> shows the reconstructed GST changes. In all three periods (1998–2013, 2001–2010, and 2001–2013), the observed but insignificant GST changes (0.11° ± 0.17°C, 0.07° ± 0.15°C, and 0.07° ± 0.13°C, respectively) are quite well (1998–2013) or very well (2001–2010 and 2001–2013) matched by corresponding reconstructed changes (0.17° ± 0.06°C, 0.04° ± 0.10°C, and 0.10° ± 0.08°C), although reconstructed warming over 1998–2013 is significant. The CMIP5 GST change over 1998–2013 is, by contrast, highly significant at 0.36° ± 0.10°C, a rate of 0.23° ± −0.06°C per decade that varies little over the period (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Fig. 6A</a>). This is markedly higher than the 1976–1997 rate of GST increase shown by CMIP5. The reconstructed component of GST change due to GA alone over 1998–2013 is 0.27° ± 0.01°C. This is not only much more than the total observed warming of 0.11°C but also distinctly less than the total warming shown by CMIP5. The latter, of course, will have been unable to simulate changes in the IPO, ENSO, and the AO, and CMIP5 models did not have observed volcanic and solar forcings for much of this period. A key published finding for the 1998–2013 slowdown, partly based on model simulations, is a cooling influence of ENSO/IPO (
  <a rid="R36" ref-type="bibr" href="#R36">
   <span class="italic">36</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R37" ref-type="bibr" href="#R37">
   <span class="italic">37</span>
  </a>). However, over the early part of the period 1999–2008, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Fig. 6B</a> (g) is consistent with a slight overall warming of GST from ENSO/IPO (
  <a rid="R38" ref-type="bibr" href="#R38">
   <span class="italic">38</span>
  </a>). Nevertheless, reconstructed cooling due to ENSO/IPO is seen in the three subperiods (1998–2013, −0.05° ± −0.05°C; 2001–2010, −0.03° ± −0.08°C; 2001–2013, −0.04° ± −0.06°C). However, none of these ENSO/IPO cooling influences is significant at the 1% level, although the 1998–2013 cooling is significant at the 5% level. By contrast, the TSI cooling influence is significant at the 0.1% level or better in 2001–2010 and 2001–2013 and at the 2% level in 1998–2013. Except in 1998–2013, when solar forcing actually causes some warming of GST between 1998 and 2002, overall solar cooling is larger than that due to the ENSO/IPO [
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Figs. 6B</a> (i) and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">1B</a> (d)]. Over 1998–2013, 2001–2010, and 2001–2013, TSI cooling of GST is reconstructed as −0.03° ± 0.03°C, −0.08° ± 0.04°C, and −0.06° ± −0.04°C, respectively, with the largest TSI cooling influence over 2001–2010. The “Using global maps to investigate reconstruction biases in 1907–1910 and 1944–1945” section provides further evidence of a TSI cooling signal. A consistent but small significant volcanic cooling influence in each subperiod (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Fig. 6C</a>) agrees with previously reported volcanic cooling influences (
  <a rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#R1">
   <span class="italic">1</span>
  </a>). Finally, although the influence of the AO is always small and not significant, it gives a visible cooling of −0.015° ± 0.025°C in 2001–2010 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Fig. 6C</a>). This is caused by a distinct trend in December to March toward a more negative AO over this period, creating increasingly cold winter conditions over mid- and high-latitude Eurasia (
  <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">
   <span class="italic">27</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There remain doubts about the measurement of GST during the recent slowdown because rapidly increasing Arctic warming may be underestimated (
  <a rid="R39" ref-type="bibr" href="#R39">
   <span class="italic">39</span>
  </a>), possibly even relegating the recent slowdown to statistical insignificance (
  <a rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" href="#R40">
   <span class="italic">40</span>
  </a>). An offsetting problem is that Antarctica as a whole has been warming much more slowly than the global average, and it is also poorly sampled. The GST data sets do not represent either region very well. This problem has recently been investigated (
  <a rid="R41" ref-type="bibr" href="#R41">
   <span class="italic">41</span>
  </a>) using the ERA Interim Reanalysis (
  <a rid="R42" ref-type="bibr" href="#R42">
   <span class="italic">42</span>
  </a>) to estimate better recent values of GST. ERA Interim estimates near-surface air temperature in data-sparse regions in a physically consistent way with the help of a weather forecasting model. Use of ERA Interim, however, does not lead to significantly different conclusions about the causes of the 1998–2013 slowdown (see Materials and Methods and section S8). The observed warming of ERA Interim GST over 1998–2013 is rather larger than that for WMO GST at 0.20° ± 0.20°C, although still not significant at the 1% level, mainly because it represents the rapidly warming Arctic better and agrees somewhat better with the reconstructed GST warming of 0.17° ± −0.06°C. However, ERA Interim GST warming increases after 2001 only slightly more than WMO GST at 0.11° ± 0.26°C (2001–2010) and 0.10° ± 0.20°C (2001–2013) (see figs. S6 and S7), so our analysis does not detect any significant differences in the influences of the forcing factors on the 1998–2013 slowdown when using ERA Interim GST in place of WMO GST, although ERA Interim does hint at more observed warming.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our main conclusion is that the most robust influence on the 1998–2013 slowdown resulted from the cooling effects of reduced TSI forcing between 2003 and 2011 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Fig. 6B</a>, i) followed by a trend toward increasing La Niña conditions and a negative IPO in its second half. The negative IPO is in turn likely to have been enhanced by regional anthropogenic aerosol forcing (
  <a rid="R43" ref-type="bibr" href="#R43">
   <span class="italic">43</span>
  </a>). Cooling throughout the slowdown was slightly but significantly enhanced by persistent but small increases in volcanic forcing. Previous studies (
  <a rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#R1">
   <span class="italic">1</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R44" ref-type="bibr" href="#R44">
   <span class="italic">44</span>
  </a>) pointed out this modest contribution to the recent slowdown from small volcanic eruptions, and our results add to this evidence. Despite this, the background net influence of GA warming continued at a nearly constant rate of 0.17° ± 0.01°C per decade.
