  <div class="title">Reconstructions for slowdown period 1, 1896–1910, where time series include the overlapping longer period 1891–1913 and the observed series 1890–1914.</div>
  <p>(
   <span class="bold">A</span>) Average reconstruction of GST for 1891–1913. Shown are reconstructions (red), 95% confidence range of GST for the 54 regression equations (light blue), and average CMIP5 simulation of GST (blue) and WMO GST (black). Linear trends are shown from 1896 to 1910 using the REML trend method. (
   <span class="bold">B</span>) Reconstruction of WMO GST for 1891–1913. Shown for each panel are averaged observed GST (black) and each of the 54 regression equation estimates of GST (blue) for the different forcing factors and their combinations and for the three component WMO global temperature data sets. (
   <span class="bold">C</span>) Linear component of total temperature change for slowdown period 1: 1896–1910, for WMO average GST (observations), the reconstruction, its difference from WMO GST, and component forcings. Red lines show ±1σ uncertainties in the temperature changes. Stars denote significance at the 1% level or better. The REML trend method is used.
