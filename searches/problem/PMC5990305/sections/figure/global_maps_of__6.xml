   <span class="italic">t</span> test) are shown by stars. Dark red indicates warmest, and dark blue denotes coldest. (
   <span class="bold">B</span>) (a) Observed maps of temperature anomalies in 1944–1945. (b) Reconstructed anomalies. (c) Observed minus reconstructed anomalies. Otherwise as for (A). (
   <span class="bold">C</span>) Reconstructed linear component of worldwide temperature change due to TSI forcing, 2001–2010. Calculated changes for 5° × 5° boxes are ordinary least-squares trends multiplied by the period length. Dark red indicates warmest, and dark blue denotes coldest.
