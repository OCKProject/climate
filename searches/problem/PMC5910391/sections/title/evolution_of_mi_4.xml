 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mixed layer temperature estimates at Site 1146 exhibit a slight warming trend between 7.3 and 7.1 Ma, increasing from (uncorrected) mean values of 25.0 °C (

  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>). This transient warming is interrupted by a pronounced cooling step of ~2 °C between 7.1 and 6.9 Ma, previously documented at this site by a low-resolution study
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>. This cooling step marks the onset of a long-term trend of cooler temperatures, lasting until ~5.5 Ma, which coincides with a long-term increase in the mean and amplitude variability of seawater δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O (Supplementary Figs.

  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>a and

  <span class="italic">n</span> = 199, 1.0 °C SD). After ~5.7 Ma, uncorrected temperatures generally oscillate between 22.1 and 27.0 °C and exhibit a sustained increase of 0.8 °C in their mean value (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 146, 0.9° SD). Between 6.0 and 5.5 Ma, transient episodes of intense mixed layer cooling by ~2 to ~3 °C coincide with sharp increases in planktic δ

 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we discuss relative changes in mixed layer temperatures rather than absolute values, since the history of Miocene seawater Mg/Ca composition is still poorly constrained (Supplementary Note 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). Furthermore, our interpretations are based on relatively short-term changes in mixed layer temperatures, which are not affected by the long-term variability of seawater Mg/Ca concentration with changes in the order of millions of years due to the long residence time of these elements in the ocean
