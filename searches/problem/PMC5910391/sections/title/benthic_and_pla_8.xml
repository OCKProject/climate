 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All samples were oven dried at 40 °C and weighed before washing over a 63 µm sieve. Residues were oven dried at 40 °C on a sheet of filter paper, then weighed and sieved into different size fractions. We measured δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O and δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C in the epifaunal benthic foraminifers 
  <span class="italic">C. wuellerstorfi</span> and/or 
  <span class="italic">C. mundulus</span> and on the mixed layer foraminifer 
  <span class="italic">G. sacculifer</span>. Well-preserved tests were broken into large fragments, cleaned in alcohol in an ultrasonic bath, then dried at 40 °C. Stable isotopes were measured with a Finnigan MAT 253 mass spectrometer at the Leibniz Laboratory, University of Kiel. The instrument is coupled on-line to a Carbo-Kiel Device (Type IV) for automated CO
  <sub>2</sub> preparation from carbonate samples for isotopic analysis. Samples were reacted by individual acid addition (99% H
  <sub>3</sub>PO
  <sub>4</sub> at 75 °C). On the basis of the performance of international and lab-internal standard carbonates, the precision is better than ±0.09‰. Paired measurements in middle Miocene samples from ODP Sites 1146 and 1237 previously indicated no significant offset in δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O and δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C between 
  <span class="italic">C. wuellerstorfi</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. mundulus</span>

  </span>. Results were calibrated using the National Institute of Standard and Technology (Gaithersburg, MD) carbonate isotope standard and NBS (National Bureau of Standard) 19 and NBS 20, and are reported on the Vienna PeeDee Belemnite scale.
