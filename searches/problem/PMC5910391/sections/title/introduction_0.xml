 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The late Miocene (~11.6 to 5.3 Ma) stands out as a period of exceptional interest within the long-term Cenozoic cooling trend toward icehouse conditions, as it represents a geologically recent interval of relative global warmth that was marked by profound environmental change in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems (e.g., refs. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>). This interval provides a unique opportunity to document climate-carbon cycle dynamics on a warmer-than-modern Earth and, thus, to help guide models and constrain predictions of climate change and sensitivity. The detailed sequence of climate events and the range of natural climate variability through the late Miocene remain, however, poorly understood, mainly due to the scarcity of continuous, high-resolution climate archives. Most available records are adequate for characterizing long-term trends or mean states, but do not capture short-term climate events and orbital-scale phase relationships required to assess, for example, changes in ice volume, monsoon intensity, and carbon fluxes.

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Multiproxy temperature reconstructions indicated that a reduced sea surface temperature (SST) zonal gradient generally prevailed in the tropical Pacific Ocean during the late Miocene, in contrast to the sharper gradient that developed during the late Pliocene to Pleistocene

  </span>. However, it is difficult to reconcile the late Miocene warmth with inferred low atmospheric

  <sub>2</sub> levels, close to preindustrial values (e.g., ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>). This apparent decoupling between climate warmth and atmospheric 
  <span class="italic">p</span>CO
  <sub>2</sub> variations has prompted intense debate about the dynamics of warm climates and the role of 
  <span class="italic">p</span>CO

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>). The widely held view of sustained equable warmth through the late Miocene was recently challenged by SST reconstructions, which revealed that a prolonged global cooling spell occurred between ~7 and ~5.5 Ma

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. During this period, SST dipped below early Pliocene values in the Mediterranean, the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans and the latitudinal thermal gradient intensified

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. Land records also indicate substantial aridification and vegetation changes between ~8 and 5.5 Ma (see compilation in ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span> and references therein) with a reversal of this long-term trend 5.3 Myr ago, at the beginning of the Pliocene period
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>. However, the drivers of these major changes are still enigmatic. It remains unclear, in particular, whether climate cooling occurred as a response to changing climate boundary conditions, such as ice volume, 
  <span class="italic">p</span>CO
  <sub>2</sub>, tectonic setting and ocean–atmosphere circulation and to what extent these changes were coupled to Northern or Southern Hemisphere climate dynamics.

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we reconstruct the detailed evolution of deep and near surface water masses (using stable isotopes and mixed layer temperatures) at Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1146 in the South China Sea (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>) and we investigate relationships to high-latitude climate variability, global ocean circulation changes, and radiative forcing over the interval 9–5 Ma. This work extends published high-resolution benthic isotope and upper-ocean temperature time series from the same site

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. During the late Miocene, the location and water depth of Site 1146 were approximately similar to that of today (19°27.40′ N, 116°16.37′ E, water depth: 2092 m) and the connection between the South China Sea and the western Pacific Ocean remained fully open

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. The benthic isotope signal at Site 1146 is, therefore, representative of Pacific intermediate/deep water masses originating at higher latitudes. Site 1146 is located at the northwestern edge of the western Pacific warm pool (WPWP) and is also ideal to constrain meridional variations in the extent of the WPWP and to monitor changes in southeast Asian monsoon climate. The extended, carbonate and clay-rich succession recovered at this site
