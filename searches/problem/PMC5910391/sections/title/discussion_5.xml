  <span class="sup">18</span>O signals at Site 1146 differ markedly in their long- and short-term trends between 9 and 5 Ma, pointing to a decoupling of regional hydrology and the evolution of the Antarctic ice sheet, which formed the main component of the cryosphere during the middle and late Miocene (e.g., refs.

  </span>). Mixed layer temperature and seawater δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O reconstructions at Site 1146 additionally support that substantial changes in southeast Asian hydroclimate occurred after ~8 Ma, which accelerated at ~7 Ma, but do not appear closely connected with Southern Hemisphere high-latitude climate (benthic δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O) trends.
 </p>
 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Between 7.1 and 6.9 Ma, upper-ocean temperatures at Site 1146 document a sustained cooling (~2 °C mean cooling), which persisted until ~5.7 Ma (Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>b and 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>). This cooling was associated with a long-term increase in the mean and amplitude variability of seawater δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O (Supplementary Note 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>; Supplementary Fig.

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>. These trends signal a change in the amount and/or δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O composition of precipitation and runoff, likely associated with changes in the provenance and/or seasonality of precipitation toward a more pronounced monsoonal seasonality and a more temperature-controlled seasonality of rainwater δ

We attribute these hydrological changes in the northern South China Sea after ~7 Ma to cooling and drying of the Asian landmass and a related southward shift of the average summer position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), resulting in decreased influence of tropical convection and intensified dry winter monsoon over southeast Asia. Drying and cooling on the Asian continent at ~7 Ma are supported by independent lines of evidence including enhanced dust accumulation rates in northern China

 </p>
 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to these major hydrological changes in the Northern Hemisphere, mean benthic δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O suggests only a relatively modest, stepwise glacial expansion of the Antarctic ice sheet and/or deep water cooling at ~7 Ma (Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>c and 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4f</a>). However, the intensification of the southeast Asian winter monsoon after ~7 Ma was associated with a long-term trend toward heavier benthic δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O maxima, which culminated in the most intense maxima (TG22, 20, 14, and 12 between 5.8 and 5.5 Ma) within the entire late Miocene, before reversing in the early Pliocene (Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5f</a>). During these extreme events, benthic δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O hovered close to 3‰ (~0.4–0.6‰ increase), which is in the range of late Pliocene values and of intermediate values between peak Holocene and glacial levels at the same location
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. A previous study
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
  </span> related these intense δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O maxima to episodes of Antarctic ice volume increase. However, the Site 1146 records show that benthic δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O maxima (TG22, 20, 14, 12, 4, and T8) coincide with planktic δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O maxima between 6.0 and 5.0 Ma, indicating concomitant variations in deep water δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O and regional hydrology, which is closely linked to extra-tropical Northern Hemisphere climate variations (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5e, f</a>). Mixed layer temperatures additionally show concurrent sharp decreases of 2–3 °C during these events (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a</a>), implying massive Northern Hemisphere cooling down to subtropical latitudes. The occurrence of ice rafted debris in North Pacific

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span> sediment cores further indicates Northern Hemisphere ice buildups between 6 and 5 Ma. Expansion of Arctic sea ice during these intense cold spells would have increased the positive albedo feedback, amplifying cooling and favoring ice growth. Together these lines of evidence support the development of ephemeral Northern Hemisphere ice sheets (e.g., Greenland, Alaska, Labrador) between 6.0 and 5.5 Ma that were highly susceptible to insolation forcing.

 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Site 1146 records additionally reveal that climate cooling and intensification of the winter monsoon at ~7 Ma coincided with the final stage of a long-term, global benthic, and planktic δ

  <span class="sup">13</span>C decrease was linked to the late Miocene spreading of C4 grasslands, which are better adapted to low 
  <span class="italic">p</span>CO

 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The gradient between benthic and planktic δ

  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>; Supplementary Fig. 10). The equilibration time for δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C in the mixed surface layer of the ocean exhibits a linear correlation to the ratio of dissolved inorganic carbon to

  <span class="sup">

  <span class="italic">p</span>CO
  <sub>2</sub> levels decreased, eventually reaching levels that enabled the formation of transient Northern Hemisphere ice sheets between 6.0 and 5.5 Ma. This steeper gradient also denotes a prolonged interval of substantially enhanced marine productivity and accumulation rates of biogenic components (“biogenic bloom” originally described in ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
  </span>). The strengthening of winds may have in turn fostered upwelling and ocean fertilization, helping to drive intense biogenic blooms through the Pacific Ocean, which enhanced carbon storage and decreased

 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous work showed that the amplitude of the LMCIS differs in ocean basins (e.g., ref.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>

 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This sequence of climatic events, as well as their background orbital configuration were strikingly similar during two previous Miocene cooling episodes: the middle Miocene climate transition at ~13.9 Ma, which resulted in major expansion of the East Antarctic ice sheet and the less pronounced late Miocene cooling step at ~9.0 Ma (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7b</a>). In all three instances, the 41 kyr cycle initially stands out in the benthic δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O signal during a protracted period of high-amplitude variability in obliquity, congruent with low variability in short eccentricity. A marked enrichment in benthic δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O (0.2–0.3‰), indicative of ice growth and/or deep water cooling toward the end of this interval, coincides with prolonged minima in eccentricity, lasting ~100–200 kyr. Subsequent rebounds at peak insolation, linked to changes in eccentricity cadence (from 400 to 100 kyr variability), indicate episodes of transient ice sheet disintegration and deep water warming. This unusual orbital congruence appears propitious to high-latitude cooling in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, although boundary conditions differed markedly during these three intervals of climate change. The middle Miocene cooling step occurred in a much warmer climate phase, characterized by substantially lighter mean benthic δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O (Fig.

Variations in Northern Hemisphere sea ice cover and vegetation in concert with changes in ocean–atmosphere circulation were likely instrumental in driving late Miocene climate, as illustrated by recent modeling simulations of late Miocene climate

  </span>. The dynamic behavior of the ocean–climate system between 9 and 5 Ma suggests a tight coupling between carbon cycle variations and low-latitude climate evolution. In particular, our results show that changes in Antarctic ice volume were not the primary driver of late Miocene climate development and that low-latitude processes, including monsoonal wind forcing of upper-ocean circulation and productivity had a strong influence on climate-carbon cycle dynamics. Inception of colder climate conditions at ~7 Ma during the final stage of the LMCIS coincided with intensification of the Asian winter monsoon and strengthening of the Pacific Ocean’s biological pump, which persisted until ~5.5 Ma. This suggests that changes in the global carbon cycle involved transfer of terrestrial carbon in a cooling, drying climate, as well as fluctuations in the carbon storage capacity of the deep ocean and the sedimentary carbon sink. Ephemeral Northern Hemisphere glaciations between 6.0 and 5.5 Ma additionally indicate that atmospheric 
  <span class="italic">p</span>CO
  <sub>2</sub> levels hovered close to and occasionally reached the threshold necessary for Northern Hemisphere ice sheet growth during this period.
