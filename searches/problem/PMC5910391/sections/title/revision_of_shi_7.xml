 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cores were sampled in ~5 cm intervals (~2 kyr time resolution) from a composite sequence (shipboard splice) of Holes 1146A and 1146C (Cores 1146C-30X to 1146C-39X). After comparison of the shipboard natural gamma ray, color reflectance, magnetic susceptibility data, and overlapping benthic isotope records over the splice tie points, we made the following modification to the original shipboard splice: we defined a new tie point between Cores 1146C-38X and 1146A-39X (1146C-38X-4, 122 cm at 359.52 m below sea floor (mbsf) tie to 1146A-39X-2, 107 cm at 359.87 mbsf), based on the match of isotope data from Holes 1146A and C. This adjustment resulted in the addition of an 80 cm splice segment from Hole 1146A to the meter composite depth (mcd) scale.</p>
