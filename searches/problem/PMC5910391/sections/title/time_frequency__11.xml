  <span class="sup">18</span>O time series in frequency space. We employed the Morlet wavelet and a Monte Carlo count of 300 to establish the statistical significance level (5%). Prior to analysis, both time series were interpolated to 2 kyr time steps and standardized (zero mean and unit standard deviation). Software is available at
