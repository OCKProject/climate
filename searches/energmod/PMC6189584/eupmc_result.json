    "The ability of theoretical chemists to quantitatively model the weak forces between organic molecules is being exploited to predict their crystal structures and estimate their physical properties. Evolving crystal structure prediction methods are increasingly being used to aid the design of organic functional materials and provide information about thermodynamically plausible polymorphs of speciality organic materials to aid, for example, pharmaceutical development. However, the increasingly sophisticated experimental studies for detecting the range of organic solid-state behaviours provide many challenges for improving quantitative theories that form the basis for the computer modelling. It is challenging to calculate the relative thermodynamic stability of different organic crystal structures, let alone understand the kinetic effects that determine which polymorphs can be observed and are practically important. However, collaborations between experiment and theory are reaching the stage of devising experiments to target the first crystallization of new polymorphs or create novel organic molecular materials."
