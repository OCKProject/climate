A common strategy is background matching, resembling the colour and pattern of the environment. This approach, however, may be ineffective in complex habitats where matching one patch may lead to increased visibility in other patches. In contrast, disruptive coloration, which disguises body outlines, may be effective against complex backgrounds. These ideas have rarely been tested and previous work focuses on artificial systems. Here, we test the camouflage strategies of the shore crab (<italic>Carcinus maenas</italic>) in two habitats, being a species that is highly variable, capable of plastic changes in appearance, and lives in multiple environments. Using predator (bird and fish) vision modelling and image analysis, we quantified background matching and disruption in crabs from rock pools and mudflats, predicting that disruption would dominate in visually complex rock pools but background matching in more uniform mudflats. As expected, rock pool individuals had significantly higher edge disruption than mudflat crabs, whereas mudflat crabs more closely matched the substrate than rock pool crabs for colour, luminance, and pattern. Our study demonstrates facultative expression of camouflage strategies dependent on the visual environment, with implications for the evolution and interrelatedness of defensive strategies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Behavioural ecology</kwd><kwd>Evolutionary ecology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>RCUK | Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/L017709/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stevens</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Many animals exhibit visual similarities with their environment, commonly referred to as &#x02018;phenotype-environment associations&#x02019;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. It has long been appreciated that these associations are a product of natural selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, with individuals camouflaged against the prevailing visual environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Indeed, selection has driven correlations in appearance between individual phenotypes and backgrounds in a wide range of animals, from rodents and lizards in terrestrial habitats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> to crabs in marine habitats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, and even in plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. These examples of phenotype-environment associations are highly suggestive of a camouflage function, but past work has rarely demonstrated or quantified the actual camouflage resulting from any match to the local environment; that is, phenotype-environment matching (but see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>). Nonetheless, camouflage, and its effectiveness, is widely appreciated to involve an interaction between the appearance of the organism and that of its background. This poses the question of how camouflage should be tuned to work best in different visual environments and contexts. Indeed, a great deal of work in artificial systems has explored how camouflage can be optimised under specific contexts (see below).</p><p id="Par3">Phenotype-environment associations have to date largely been considered in the context of background matching<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, a widespread form of camouflage involving resembling the general colour and pattern of the environment (e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>). Background matching reduces the deviation in features between the appearance of an animal and its surroundings, and is therefore specific to the visual background where it has arisen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. While not always directly quantified in animals, background matching is likely to be widespread across many habitats and species, ranging from classic examples of concealment (e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>) to studies demonstrating its utility in preventing detection of potential prey in both the lab (e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>) and field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. At least one study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> has also provided direct quantification of site-specific background matching in an intertidal crustacean, the sand flea (<italic>Hippa testudinaria</italic>), demonstrating that individuals match the colour and luminance of their own beaches more closely than of neighbouring beaches.</p><p id="Par4">The efficacy of background matching can be limited by the outline of an animal&#x02019;s body, creating discontinuities with the background that make it more conspicuous to predators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. As a solution, disruptive coloration involves relatively high contrast markings near the edge of the body to break up the outline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Considerable research on disruptive coloration has demonstrated how this works, using artificial (human-made) prey presented to either birds or humans (e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>). These studies have shown that disruptive coloration frequently provides a reduction in detection (and potentially identification too), over and above the benefits conferred by background matching, and works at least in part by creating false edge information and hiding true body outlines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Disruptive coloration has been suggested as a key method of camouflage across numerous taxonomic groups (see review<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>). However, studies have seldom quantified the camouflage effect of disruptive coloration in real animals, or even clearly demonstrated its presence. Work has been overwhelmingly focussed on artificial systems, or has largely subjectively inferred disruption. Merilaita<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> analysed the distribution of spots on the polymorphic marine isopod <italic>Idotea baltica</italic> and found that spots deviated from a random distribution, being more likely to occur at the body edges. While consistent with disruption, this study did not compare the distribution of body markings to the actual distribution in the environment, nor directly quantify any potential disruptiveness of the markings either to vision models or in behavioural trials. A more recent study used a model of edge disruption to assess the behavioural choice of resting position in two species of moth, and found that both disruptive coloration and background matching were used to provide camouflage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. A similar earlier model also showed evidence for disruptive coloration and false edges in frogs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Overall, there remain several substantial gaps in our understanding of how camouflage is utilised in nature. As discussed, much past work on phenotype-environment matching has relied on human subjective judgement and does not quantify actual camouflage match among habitats; background matching is often inferred rather than directly quantified. Second, current evidence for the use of disruption in nature remains very limited and seldom quantified in any real animal. The vast majority of work is limited to artificial (human-made) systems. Third, no study has tested and compared the occurrence of both background matching and disruptive coloration strategies in an animal, especially in phenotypically variable species, nor investigated the use of these strategies across habitats. As yet, few quantitative tests exist directly comparing how camouflage types are expected to vary in use with habitat type/spatial scene, and predictions from artificial systems require testing in real animals and environments. Finally, while both background matching and disruptive coloration are effective means of preventing detection, there has been debate as to what extent these strategies operate independently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Indeed, some studies suggest that maximum camouflage is achieved when both strategies are used in conjunction, and past work often shows that the benefits of disruption decline as body markings increasingly mismatch the background<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. However, again these studies have been restricted to simple artificial prey markings and few visual backgrounds (mostly tree bark).</p><p id="Par7">A valuable group to test the relative occurrence and tuning of camouflage strategies is crabs, which show great diversity in colours and patterns within and among species, including for camouflage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. In crabs, phenotype-environment associations are thought to be common with many suggested examples, often including species that can vary greatly in appearance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. However, these studies generally lack quantification of the match between individuals and the environment (but see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>). Multiple studies have involved the common shore crab (<italic>Carcinus maenas</italic>). Early descriptive work showed associations between appearance and crab size/age and habitat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. More recent work found similar results, including showing associations between crab colour patterns in different habitats (mussel beds, rock pools, seaweed, sandy beach and rocks) at varied spatial scales<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, including when considering predator vision<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In general, crabs from mudflats tend to be more uniform, greener, and with less patterning than crabs from rock pools. In addition, more uniform environments (e.g. mudflats) harbour crabs with lower intraspecific diversity than heterogeneous habitats (e.g. rock pools)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Mudflat crabs are thought to use habitat-specific background matching, whereas crabs from rock pools possess high contrast and prominent markings, often found near the body edges, that are highly suggestive of disruptive coloration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">In this study, we test for habitat-specific camouflage strategies in shore crabs across two habitat types. Using quantitative image analysis and predator (bird and fish) vision modelling (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), we compare the match of crabs to their backgrounds for colour, luminance (perceived lightness), and pattern, and the extent of disruptive coloration using recent metrics to assess both pattern matching and edge disruption that have been demonstrated to predict visual detection and predation rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. We predict that shore crabs from heterogeneous and contrasting rock pool habitats camouflage themselves through disruptive mechanisms, whereas crabs from uniform mudflats use background matching in their low-contrast, homogenous environment.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Images of a representative rock pool background (top; without crabs) and three rock pool crabs with high disruptive coloration scores.

With the avian vision model, colour JND values were significantly predicted by an interaction between crab habitat of origin and the background habitat it was compared to (F<sub>1,93</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.09, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.045, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This indicates that the level of background matching for colour was dependent on the habitat the individual was collected from, but the magnitude of the effect differed between habitat types. The closest match to the background (lowest JND) was seen in crabs collected from mudflats against mudflat habitat images (avian model average JND&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.65). Conversely, the poorest match was in crabs collected from rock pools against a rock pool background (avian average JND&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.05). Rock pool individuals on mudflat backgrounds (avian average JND&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.76) were a marginally better match to the background than rock pool crabs on a rock pool background. Using the fish vision model we found no significant interaction between source habitat and background. The background main effect was significant (F<sub>1,93</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.11, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.015). JND values were lower for fish vision relative to avian vision (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Overall, however, colour matches to each background type were close (low JNDs) for all colour comparisons regardless of the specific combination of habitat type and crab habitat origin, for both avian and fish visual systems (JND average matches were all between 1.00 and 2.10). Thus, colour camouflage was good regardless of crab-habitat match.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Discrimination values (JNDs) for crabs collected from either mudflat (MF) or rock pool (RP) sites (X axis) compared to either mudflat or rock pool backgrounds, corresponding to (<bold>a</bold>) avian colour, (<bold>b</bold>) fish colour, (<bold>c</bold>) avian luminance, and (<bold>d</bold>) fish luminance vision comparisons.

Similar to the colour JND, the lowest luminance JND values came from shore crabs collected from mudflat sites against a mudflat background. Differences were more marked for luminance than for the colour comparisons. For avian vision, average matches of crabs to mudflat habitats were 1.79 and 1.95 JNDs for crabs from mudflats and rock pools respectively. That is compared to analogous matches of 3.59 and 3.73 JNDs for crabs against rock pool backgrounds. For fish vision, luminance average JNDs for crabs against mudflats were 6.76 and 7.35, versus matches of 13.40 and 13.92 for crabs against rock pools.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Background matching: pattern</title><p id="Par11">To assess how well crabs matched the pattern of their backgrounds, pattern energy difference (PED) values were used to determine the difference in pattern spectra between the carapace of an individual and the background habitat (rock pool or mudflat).

This indicates that the level of pattern background matching depended on the habitat the individual was collected from, but the magnitude of the effect differed between habitat types. The closest match to the background (lowest PED) was seen in crabs collected from mudflats and against mudflat habitat images. Conversely, the largest difference between carapace and background was in crabs collected from rock pools against a rock pool background. Otherwise, rock pool individuals on mudflat backgrounds had lower PED values and therefore were a better match to the background than rock pool crabs on a rock pool background. This shows that the phenotype of rock pool crabs is actually closer in pattern to the properties of mudflats than rock pools.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Disruption</title><p id="Par12">GabRat measurements of crab carapace disruption produced values ranging from very low (0.04) to values considered highly disruptive (&#x0003e;0.40)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.

Overall, crabs collected from rock pools had significantly higher levels of edge disruption against both rock pool and mudflat background than crabs from mudflats. The edge disruption of crabs collected from rock pool sites was not greatly different against rock pool as opposed to mudflat backgrounds, although rock pool crabs had marginally more disruptive edges on mudflat backgrounds than they did against their own habitat substrate (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Conversely, mudflat crabs have slightly higher edge disruption levels on rock pools than against their own substrate background.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par13">We assessed two different camouflage strategies (background matching and disruptive patterning) in juvenile shore crabs collected from rock pool and mudflat habitats. In line with our predictions, there was a clear difference in the degree of similarity of crabs to the background environment and in levels of edge disruption, depending on whether crabs were collected from rock pools or mudflats. Specifically, crabs collected from the more heterogeneous rock pools had a higher level of disruptive patterning than crabs from mudflats, and this effect was in fact marginally more pronounced against a mudflat background than against a rock pool background. This indicates that the disruptive effect operated on both backgrounds and is therefore somewhat intrinsic to the crabs themselves. Analysis of background matching found that crabs collected from the more homogeneous mudflat habitats were better matched to mudflat backgrounds than to rock pool backgrounds, and this was generally the case for colour, luminance, and pattern. Rock pool crabs compared to rock pool backgrounds often had the lowest level of background matching, whereas mudflat crabs against mudflat backgrounds had the closest overall matches. However, we note that for colour the visual modelling indicates that the level of match, and therefore camouflage, was very good for all colour comparisons regardless of habitat. Consistent with this, for colour, there was little difference in matching to a fish visual system, and only a marginally better match of crabs to the mudflat background to the avian model. In contrast, the results for luminance match were clearer than for colour, with mudflat crabs a closer match to their habitat for both visual systems. This was especially the case for the fish visual model. Overall, rock pool individuals match their habitat less closely but have high levels of edge disruption, whereas mudflat individuals do not have disruptive markings but match their background closely for colour, pattern, and luminance. These findings support our predictions that differences in camouflage strategy arise between individuals found in mudflat and rock pool habitats.</p><p id="Par14">Our results build on earlier work investigating shore crab appearance, which demonstrated phenotype-environment associations between carapace patterns and habitat at multiple spatial scales<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Previous work also showed that crabs from more uniform habitats exhibited less carapace patterning than crabs from heterogeneous habitats. The prominent markings found on some crabs, which tend to arise at the body margins, have also been suggested to provide disruptive camouflage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Our study also ties in with other recent work, showing that with ontogeny, crabs tend to adopt more uniform dark-green appearances, closer to mudflat backgrounds, and that this translates into a survival advantage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Overall, shore crabs therefore appear to utilise strategies that are well suited to the environments in which they live. Next, experiments are needed to test the effectiveness of disruptive edges on the survival (or predator detection) of shore crabs. This is non-trivial, however, since the changing nature of the environment (due to tides, waves, weather) makes experiments based on model prey (e.g. made of Plasticine) challenging to design robust yet visually accurate prey and record predation events, as well as targeting the wide diversity of predatory taxa.</p><p id="Par15">Our work demonstrates how the presence and likely utility of different camouflage markings depends on the visual environment. While this is often discussed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, little work has tested such ideas, especially in natural systems. In uniform environments, a close match to large areas of the background is possible since there is also no ambiguity over the best colour or pattern to match. In low contrast invariable habitats, disruption involving high contrast non-matching markings may actually give an individual away. In contrast, in highly variable backgrounds while it may be possible for different individual phenotypes to match different patches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, or for animals to adopt generalist or &#x02018;compromise&#x02019; camouflage strategies that match no background perfectly but several to some degree<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, it may sometimes still be better to match the most common substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Alternatively, as we demonstrate here, another approach is to focus on using disruptive camouflage, which may provide a better route to concealment irrespective of the specific background patches encountered<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In addition, the visually complex nature of the rock pool environment likely offers further protection independent of background matching, since high background complexity is known to facilitate camouflage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par16">Disruption is widely considered to work best alongside background matching<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, though there is evidence that to an extent it may also work independently and allow camouflage even with relatively mismatched individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Here, we have shown in a natural system, with complex real animal markings and two different background types, that disruption seems to be utilised when background matching is ineffective, and vice versa. Why rock pool crabs had marginally stronger disruptive effects when superimposed onto mudflat backgrounds is unclear, but a possible explanation may be that rock pool crabs seen against homogeneous habitats benefitted from higher levels of differential blending, enabling large parts of the carapace to blend into the background while other aspects stood out<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Regardless, this finding provides support that disruptive patterning is a distinct camouflage strategy not fully reliant on matching the background<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par17">While rock pool crabs have greater levels of disruption, this may not be the sole utility of their patterns. Diverse markings may contribute to background matching in some instances, and high levels of phenotypic diversity (especially in rock pool habitats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>) may reduce the ability of predators to detect individuals by hindering the formation of search images<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Furthermore, in common with other crustaceans, carapace patterns in shore crab become less distinct with age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Here, we compared crabs of the same size range and so a reduction in pattern in mudflat crabs cannot be explained by ontogenetic changes. An absence of pattern could in theory also be caused by strong visual predation removing patterned crabs from mudflat environments. However, predation levels are unlikely to be high enough for this, or to override the strong recruitment of new individuals into each location via continuous settlement of post-larvae from their planktonic larval stage and through movement of crabs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. More likely, our results stem from the considerable plasticity in individual shore crab pattern and coloration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. An additional possibility is that individuals show background choice of substrates for concealment, which has been found in a range of other species and taxa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, including ghost crabs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Indeed, microhabitat associations in shore crab appearance and substrate have been found in past work that are difficult to explain without some level of background choice existing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. However, past work directly investigating background choice has focussed on decisions within habitats and often at very fine spatial scales, and here we are considering sites and habitats separated by several km. While shore crabs have been known to move up to 2&#x02009;km in a short space of time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>, it seems implausible that they move such distances and among habitats for the purpose of selecting appropriate background environments for camouflage. Nonetheless, this remains an area that would benefit from further research.</p><p id="Par18">Our work highlights the need to understand camouflage strategies more comprehensively in natural systems. A range of previous studies on animal coloration have undertaken comparative analyses, finding evidence for links between camouflage and other defensive strategies with aspects of habitat and life-history (e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>). Disruptive coloration has been suggested to be extremely common in nature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, but it is seldom quantified, nor how its characteristics relate to the visual environment in which the bearer is found. Other work, especially on rapid colour changing (in seconds) species such as cuttlefish has explored the expression of camouflage patterns on different visual backgrounds, showing for example that backgrounds of different contrasts and spatial information tend to elicit more uniform or pronounced marking types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. One study in particular has also investigated both colour and pattern match of colour-changing flatfish to a range of visual systems, showing that expression of markings is habitat-dependent and that the flounder match the spatial scale of sand and gravel well, but not rocks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. This latter finding is interesting because it is consistent with the crabs in our study showing poor match to the rock pool substrates. However, the above study deviates from ours in that it analysed background matching but not disruptive coloration, and did not test how camouflage types/strategies are expected to vary in use with habitat type. In general, more work is needed in this area.</p><p id="Par19">Finally, another key area for further investigation is how phenotype-environment matching links to non-reversible ontogenetic changes in appearance with age and size. In shore crabs, we have also shown that larger crabs progress to a more uniform green coloration as they grow, at least partly independently from the background environment, and that this appears to facilitate generalist camouflage across many habitats, especially when crabs are larger and more mobile<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. To what extent ontogenetic and plastic changes explain overall phenotypes, and how this relates to camouflage strategy, requires considerable future work. Given that the expression and optimisation of camouflage has been a fruitful area for exploring a variety of issues, from evolutionary outcomes and mechanisms of adaptation (e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>) through to how visual perception works<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>, testing the presence and efficacy of camouflage features in complex visual scenes in real animals is an important area. This also has the potential to inform on how conspicuous signals improve efficacy in different habitats, from sexual and social signals to aposematism.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Field Sites and Photography</title><p id="Par20">Images were taken of rock pool and mudflat habitats across six sites, three were rock pool habitats (47 background images) and three were mudflats (47 images).

After entry to the focal area of a site, images were taken separated by approximately 3.7&#x02009;m with 20 images taken at each site.

Images of backgrounds were taken with a Nikon D7000 digital camera modified with a quartz conversion to allow for UV sensitivity (Advanced Camera Services, Norfolk, UK) fitted with a Nikon Nikor 105&#x02009;mm lens. All photographs were taken in RAW format with fixed aperture settings. The camera was held in position using a tripod and all photographs were taken at the same height (approximately 1&#x02009;m). Two sets of images were taken, using a visible (Baader UV/IR Cut filter) and UV (Baader Venus U filter) filter, to block UV and infrared light (human-visible images) and allow only UV transmission between 300&#x02013;400&#x02009;nm (UV images), respectively. Our camera sensitivities are as follows: UV: 360&#x02013;400&#x02009;nm (peak 380&#x02009;nm), SW: 400&#x02013;550&#x02009;nm (peak 460&#x02009;nm), MW: 420&#x02013;620&#x02009;nm (peak 540&#x02009;nm), LW: 560&#x02013; 700&#x02009;nm (peak 625&#x02009;nm)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>.

Crabs were then transported back to the laboratory at the University of Exeter, Penryn Campus in clear tanks containing salt water from the habitat and background substrate to cover the bottom of the tank, providing refuge to avoid inflicting stress during transportation. Individuals were then gently dried with tissue paper and placed underneath a tripod set up in a dark photography room.

Among the main predators of shore crabs are shore birds and fish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. Most birds are probably tetrachromats, using four cone types in colour vision: longwave (LW), mediumwave (MW), shortwave (SW) and ultraviolet/violet (UV/V). Most shore birds have a &#x02018;violet&#x02019; cone type relatively more sensitive to longer violet wavelengths than some other more UV-sensitive birds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. Therefore, for modelling we followed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and used the visual sensitivity of the peafowl (<italic>Pavo cristatus</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>, which is widely used as a species for visual modelling of violet birds (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Although other birds that may be relevant predators (e.g. gulls) can have an &#x02018;ultraviolet&#x02019; type system more sensitive to UV light, the crabs and backgrounds in our study generally have low ultraviolet reflectance. For fish, the European pollack, <italic>Pollachius pollachius</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup> is thought to be a key predator of crabs and represents a dichromatic fish predator, with LW and SW sensitive cones. While fish in our study site can also be trichromats, past work has showed only minor differences in modelled crab appearance among di- and tetrachromatic systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, and so other visual systems are unlikely to vary greatly either. We converted standardized images to predicted cone catch data for each species using a widely implemented polynomial mapping technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. This has been repeatedly shown to provide highly accurate data compared to cone catch modelling with reflectance spectra (see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Background matching: colour and luminance</title><p id="Par26">To quantify colour and luminance match to the background we used a widely employed log version of a model of predator discrimination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>.

The output of the model, JNDs, predicts whether two objects can be discriminated (values&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1.00), with increasing values equating to a reduction in the level of camouflage match.

In addition, mudflat backgrounds may also allow greater background matching owing to their more uniform appearance, whereas rock pools present highly variable environments meaning matching many patches is not possible.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec14"><p>
