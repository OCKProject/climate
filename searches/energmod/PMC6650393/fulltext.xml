Two EF-lobes, N-lobe and C-lobe, of calmodulin are structurally almost independent and show large conformational change upon the binding of calcium. We named four EF-hands as EF1, EF2, EF3 and EF4 from N-terminal side. EF-hand is a helix-loop-helix motif. The helix E is a helix incoming from N-terminus to calcium binding loop. The helix F is a helix exiting from the loop. The helix E in EF1 is E1, the helix F in EF1 is F1, the helix E in EF2 is E2, the helix F in EF2 is F2, and so on. We have developed a method to analyze the conformational state of the lobe of calmodulin. In this method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, the EF-lobe is placed in a coordinate system by aligning its pseudo two-fold axis with z-axis of the coordinate system. Then, the interface between two EF-hands is placed on yz-plane. This coordinate system is intrinsic to each EF-lobe.

Simulations were performed in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions applied, where proteins were located at 14&#x02009;&#x000c5; distance from box boundaries. The protein was neutralized with sodium ions. After adding solvent water with tip3p model around the protein, and some of water molecules were replaced with 0.15&#x02009;M NaCl, energy minimization was carried out to reach the maximum force below 250 (kJ/mol). Equilibrating the water around the protein was performed under 100&#x02009;ps NVT followed by 100&#x02009;ps NPT ensembles at 300&#x02009;K. MD data was collected for 100&#x02009;ns in the NPT ensemble at 300&#x02009;K. Electrostatic interactions were calculated using the PME algorithm.

The plots of MD results from the three structures are similar (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In the N-lobe, the conformations of holo-bound forms are distributed along the lower line. Two pairs of helices E1F2 and E2F1 show coordinated movements. In the C-lobe, the conformations are not only along the line for simple open/close of pairs of helices E3F4 and E4F3, but also change the arrangement of a pair of helices, E3F4 or E4F3. This movement of the C-lobe is much more complex than N-lobe; it moves over a wider range of conformation to accommodate the target. Although N- and C-lobes share high sequence identity and superposition of holo-structures yields an rmsd of about 0.75&#x02009;&#x000c5;, there are significant differences in calcium affinity. Linse <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> reported a difference of calcium affinity between N- and C-lobes. The calcium affinity is six fold higher for the C-lobe than for the N-lobe. Martin <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> reported that the C-lobe shows slow dissociation and the N-lobe shows rapid dissociation of calcium. Our MD results indicate that the C-lobe, which binds calcium first, accommodates the target by adjusting its conformation. Then the N-lobe binds the target. Faga <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> reported that the basic residues at the linker region stabilize the N-lobe and decrease calcium affinity. Calcium affinity is affected by several factors including amino acid sequence of the calcium binding loop and stability of the EF-lobe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The kinetic rate of conformational change of two EF-lobes of calmodulin in calcium binding differ more than an order of magnitude, ~20&#x02009;ms for the time constant of N-lobe and ~490&#x02009;&#x003bc;s for that of C-lobe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Such kinetic differences might inherit to the structure of holo-calmodulin. The plot obtained by 6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;100&#x02009;ns MD reflects the differences of a kind of initial velocity of conformational change between N- and C-lobes. Longer MD would give the complete shape of conformational landscape of the lobes of calmodulin. The results of MD are highly dependent on the force field. We performed the same MD run using different force filed and water model (Supplemental Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The shapes of area appeared in the plot is dependent on the force field. However, the results show also that N-lobe moves along the lower line in the plot and C-lobe moves over a wider range. This means the observed features for N- and C-lobes are not affected by the selection of force field.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Conformational landscape of N- and C-lobes from three holo-calmodulins.

In the N-lobe, the conformations of holo-bound forms (1X02) and also apo-forms (1DMO) are distributed along the lower line. A two-step mechanism of calcium binding to EF-hand has been proposed based on the structural analysis of a trapped intermediate of the N-lobe of calmodulin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In this model, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion binds to the N-terminal part of the calcium binding loop initially; this generates a rigid link between helix E and the beta structure present in the center of the loop. Then helix F moves and ligates the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion with a glutamate ligand. The open/close of EF-hand is explained by the torsional flexibility of EF&#x003b2;-scaffold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. There are small overlaps between holo-forms and apo-forms in the N-lobe. MD results for the N-lobe are consistent with this model. There are no overlaps between holo-forms and apo-forms in the C-lobe; these changes in the C-lobe also occur in a two-step mechanism. The range for conformational change in the C-lobe of apo-forms is wider than is that of the N-lobe. The change of the C-lobe occurs mainly along the upper line. We have speculated that the open/close of the C-lobe occurs along the upper line to the semi-open conformation of target bound apo-forms, and then goes to the position in the lower line with the helix rearrangement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. However, the MD results suggest that the C-lobe of apo-forms moves close to the lower line and probably the C-lobe also follows a similar conformational path of open/close to the N-lobe with this two-step mechanism. The longer MD reveals the presence of pre-formation of the calcium-bound conformation in the C-lobe of apo-calmodulin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>; it also indicates the presence of the closed form in holo-calmodulin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Conformational landscape of the EF-lobes from holo-, apo- and target bound apo-calmodulin.

The structure of 1DMO at the overlapped region is close to semi-open, but the cleft for target binding blocked by a bulge of Lys115. These results probably mean that the binding of target requires some conformational change of calmodulin induced by the target and also imply the importance of the conserved Arg residue in IQ motif, which probably expels Lys115 to open the cleft. The mutation of Arg6Ala of IQ motif in neuronal voltage-gated sodium Channel Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 made the peptide unable to bind to calmodulin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.

We analyzed the effect of amino acid sequence on the difference of conformational dynamics between two EF-lobes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The amino acid sequences of the N-lobe and of the C-lobe were exchanged by homology modeling; while, the sequences of the N-terminal extension and of the linker between two lobes were held constant. The MD result of this structure is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>. The C-lobe with N-lobe sequence shows the conformational change along the lower line and the major peak at a position similar to the N-lobe in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The N-lobe with C-lobe sequence moves over a wider area than does the native N-lobe. The change of amino acid sequences reflects the properties of their own lobe. However, these considerations do not completely explain the observed changes in conformation. This indicates additional causes for the difference between N- and C-lobes; for example, positional effects, and the interactions with the N-terminal extension and/or the linker between the two lobes. Homology-modeling with the structure used in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref> as a template and the native sequence generated another structure, which has side chains of homology-modeled conformation with the native amino acid sequence.

We evaluated the effects of amino acid sequence for conformational ensembles of each EF-lobe (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). First we mutated the residues at the interface between two helices, helix E1 (E3) and F2 (F4) or F1 (F3) and E2 (E4). The residues at the interface were exchanged between N-lobe and C-lobe (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a,b</xref>). The structure used in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref> is constructed by homology modeling using the native structure of 1CLL as a template. The structure used in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref> is constructed by homology modeling using a template structure whose sequence was exchanged between N- and C-lobes. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref> is similar to the results of 1CLL in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref> is similar to Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>. The mutation only at the interface between helices did not affect the MD results (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a,b</xref>). Then, we made mutant by adding some residues including outside of interface between helices (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c,d</xref>). However, additional mutations affected the MD results on lobe swapped structure, especially in C-lobe (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d</xref>), although the mutations at the same sites did not affect native structure (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>). These three sites are important for the flexibility of C-lobe (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). The atomic interaction of these residues against neighborhood residues might determine the differences of dynamics between N- and C-lobes. Swindells and Ikura identified two clusters conserved specifically in N-lobes or in C-lobes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Shimayama and Takeda-Shitaka described the residues involved in the open-close conformational changes in EF-hand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The differences of side chain conformations at conserved amino acids in each lobe might be important for the differences between two lobes. Further analyses of dynamic motion should explain the effects on atomic interactions between side chains in the EF-hand lobe.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>The effects of amino acid sequence for conformational ensembles of each EF-lobe.

We used a coordinate system in the analysis of calmodulin that is based on its approximate two-fold axis. That local two-fold cannot be applied as is to the analysis of other proteins. However, the use of a local coordinate system should be applicable to other proteins.

We selected the structure of calmodulin from Xenopus mainly. However, the structure from human was also used, when appropriate structure cannot be found in Xenopus. One structure from bovine (1PRW.dpb) was selected, since it shows a compact form in crystal. There are many structures of holo-calmodulin in PDB. However, there are quite few structures of apo-calmodulin. 1DMO and 2L53 are one of apo-calmodulins without target and with target, respectively. 2L53 is an NMR ensemble of apo-calmodulin complexed with 31-residue IQ motif peptide of voltage gated sodium channel Na<sub>V</sub>1.5. In this structure, the peptide interacts with the C-terminal domain (C-lobe) of calmodulin, with the N-terminal domain remaining free in solution. We have already reported the conformational mapping of NMR ensemble from 2L53.pdb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. We selected two models from the ensemble as the best exemplar for N-lobe and C-lobe each. 1IQ5 is a crystal structure of holo-calmodulin complexed with a 27-residue peptide of calcium/calmodulin dependent kinase kinase. Since it is a higher resolution crystal structure (1.8&#x02009;&#x000c5;), we used 1IQ5 as a representative for holo-calmodulin with target. We also used several structures of target bound holo-calmodulin. 1CKK is an NMR ensemble of holo-calmodulin complexed with 26-residue peptide of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin dependent protein kinase. 2M0K is an NMR ensemble of holo-calmodulin complexed with 28-residue peptide of cyclic nucleotide-gated olfactory channel. 1IQ5, 1CKK and 2M0K show similar conformations with the target peptide wrapped around by N- and C-lobes of calmodulin. 1NWD is an NMR ensemble of holo-calmodulin complexed with two C-terminal peptides of glutamate decarboxylase. The N- and C-lobes of calmodulin adopt an orientation different from that seen in other calmodulin-target complexes such as 1IQ5, 1CKK and 2M0K. We performed relatively short MD several times and summed up each MD, since we focused on the conformational change of each lobe of calmodulin without the interaction between lobes.</p><p id="Par15">MD results were analyzed with Bio3D<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> package of R on RStudio and also analyzed by our HVM (Helix Vector Mapping) method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.
