Protein kinases have drawn much attention as potential drug targets due to their important role in various cellular processes. In <italic>Leishmania</italic> sp. mitogen-activated protein kinase 4 is essential for the parasite survival because of its involvement in various regulatory, apoptotic and developmental pathways. The current study reveals the identification of natural inhibitors of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic> mitogen-activated protein kinase-4 (LdMPK4). We have performed in silico docking of 110 natural inhibitors of <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasite that have been reported earlier and identified two compounds Genistein (GEN) and Chrysin (CHY). The homology model of LdMPK4 was developed, followed by binding affinity studies, and pharmacokinetic properties of the inhibitors were calculated by maintaining ATP as a standard molecule. The modelled structure was deposited in the protein model database with PMDB ID: PM0080988. Molecular dynamic simulation of the enzyme-inhibitor complex along with the free energy calculations over 50 ns showed that GEN and CHY are more stable in their binding. These two molecules, GEN and CHY, can be considered as lead molecules for targeting LdMPK4 enzyme and could emerge as potential LdMPK4 inhibitors.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001843</institution-id><institution>Science and Engineering Research Board</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>YSS/2014/000147</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7211-0581</contrib-id><name><surname>Saudagar</surname><given-names>Prakash</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Science and Engineering Research Board, Government of India Grant Number: YSS/2014/000147 to PS.

Known for their high mortality rates, WHO has estimated 1.3 million new cases and 20,000 deaths every year [<xref rid="pone.0221331.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The protozoan parasite exists in two forms; the promastigotes that develop in sand-flies (<italic>Phlebotomus sp</italic>.) and the amastigotes that grow and multiply in the macrophages of mammalian hosts. The parasite switches forms as it journeys between the vector and the host [<xref rid="pone.0221331.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Different species of <italic>Leishmania</italic> causes five types of leishmaniasis and among these, the cutaneous, visceral and mucocutaneous are the most prominent forms studied [<xref rid="pone.0221331.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0221331.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The cure for the parasitic infection is limited because of the costs involved, efficacy and severe adverse effects, and this has led to reduced treatment options and drug resistance too. The current scenario requires the need for novel and safe drugs and drug target, thereby compelling the need for this study.</p><p>There have been previous studies for new targets in <italic>Leishmania sp</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0221331.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0221331.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Among them, protein kinases have been the subject of study for a long time for their role in survival, apoptosis, differentiation and cell responses. More than 500 different protein kinases have been discovered from human genome sequencing [<xref rid="pone.0221331.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. They also play an important role in signal transduction of eukaryotic cells. Kinase family of enzymes phosphorylates other enzymes by adding a phosphate molecule to the amino acid residues of the protein [<xref rid="pone.0221331.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The event is critical wherein a single phosphoryl molecule resulting from ATP molecule is transferred to the hydroxyl groups of serine, threonine or tyrosine molecules. Most commonly studied kinases are Ser/Thr kinase and followed by Tyr kinase because of their versatile nature in cells.</p><p>The Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPK) from the Ser/Thr kinase family is yet another long known target for cancer studies and is homologous in diverse organisms including humans. MAPKs play a significant role in the signal transduction cascade by phosphorylating and dephosphorylating kinase enzymes, eventually controlling the expression of protein molecules necessary for cell activities [<xref rid="pone.0221331.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0221331.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The genomic sequence of <italic>Leishmania</italic> has identified 15 MAPK genes and they have been found to be homologous in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>mexicana</italic>, <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum and L</italic>. <italic>brasiliensis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0221331.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Deletion analyses of MAPK genes have shown regulatory problems in parasite development. <italic>Leishmania</italic> MAPKs have been known to carry a long carboxy terminus extension of 52&#x02013;1186 amino acids and the extension is synonymous even in mammalian MAPKs ERK5 (400 amino acids), ERK7 (195 amino acids) and ERK8 (194 amino acids) [<xref rid="pone.0221331.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0221331.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The role of extensions in ERK5 and ERK7 has been known to be involved in regulation, cellular localisation, and negative growth regulators respectively but their role in <italic>Leishmania</italic> still remains elusive [<xref rid="pone.0221331.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Deletion mutants of MAPK3 have also shown shortening of flagella and overexpression of the enzyme with deletion background nullifies this effect [<xref rid="pone.0221331.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0221331.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The expression of MAPK4 is essential for both promastigotes and amastigote form of <italic>Leishmania sp</italic>. and the phosphorylation of T190 and Y192 in the phosphorylation lip causes activation of the kinase enzyme [<xref rid="pone.0221331.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Overexpression of MAPK4 causes stage-specific induction of phosphotransferase activity [<xref rid="pone.0221331.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. MAPK4 from <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> has very less similarity to mammalian MAP kinases and thereby the enzyme holds a prospective chance of being a unique drug target in <italic>Leishmania</italic>.</p><p>The workflow model for the study is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221331.g001">Fig 1</xref>. The lack of crystal structure of <italic>Leishmania</italic> MAPK4 pushed us to perform homology modelling of <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> MAPK4 (LdMPK4) by utilising the MAPK3 crystal structure from <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic>. The similarity of being from the same species allowed us to derive the modelled structure and structural domains of LdMPK4. The modelled structure was validated using various web servers and was found to be fit for further study. The stability of the enzyme was also tested using dynamic simulation over 100 nanoseconds (ns). Screening and docking for various natural inhibitors were also performed while maintaining ATP molecule as a positive control throughout. Two compounds genistein (GEN) and chrysin (CHY) were found to have good binding affinities and were investigated additionally to satisfy drug-likeliness. Subsequently, the binding affinities and stability of the enzyme-inhibitor complexes were put to test using molecular dynamic simulations for over 50 ns and binding free energies were determined. From this study, we report the identification of natural lead compounds GEN and CHY as potential inhibitors against LdMPK4. These novel compounds GEN and CHY reported in the study can be further evaluated for their anti-leishmanial activity and can be developed into drugs against leishmaniasis.</p><fig id="pone.0221331.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0221331.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Workflow.</title><p>Schematic representation of workflow for inhibitor screening, docking and simulation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0221331.g001"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Template selection</title><p>The lack of solved structures of LdMPK4 was assessed and homology modelling was opted to determine the structure of LdMPK4.

Among these, <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> MAPK (PDB ID: 4QNY) was considered, for the reason that the resolution was 2.71 &#x000c5; and that it shares 54% similarity and 39% identity with LdMPK4. The structure houses a structurally similar ligand Phosphoaminophosphonic acid-adenylate ester, thus confirming the intactness of the binding pocket.

Docking of ATP molecule with PM0080988 was also performed to analyse the residues involved in interactions. The molecules were ranked based on their binding energy differences and hydrogen bonds and the top two molecules with the lowest binding energies were carried forward for molecular dynamic simulation.

The protein-ligand complexes were solvated by TIP4 (Transferable Intermolecular Potential with 4 points) water molecules within a dodecahedron box maintaining a distance of 10 &#x000c5; between the box edges and the protein surface. The system was neutralised using 3 NA<sup>+</sup> ions and was energy minimised using steepest descent integrator. The three models were then subjected to position restrained canonically-defined NVT (constant number of atoms N, Volume V, and Temperature T) and NPT (constant number of atoms N, Pressure P and Temperature T) ensemble for 5 ns. Parrinello-Rahman and Modified Berendsen thermostat were used in NPT and NVT equilibration respectively. The models were equilibrated for NVT and NPT at 300 k and 1 bar respectively. The stability of PM0080988 was initially analysed for 100 ns and after verifying the same the simulation of protein-ligand complexes was carried out for 50 ns for comparative trajectory analysis.

The active site Lys59 was analysed for hydrogen bonding with all the ligands. ATP formed hydrogen bonding with Phe38, Gly42 and Lys59 continuously, thereby contributing majorly wherein Gly37, Gly39, Cys41, Arg73, and Asp174 formed intermittent hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221331.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). ATP significantly forms continuous hydrogen bonds with active site Lys59 and the phosphate group was found to be aligned favourably towards the same while Ser160 was found vice. The amide group of Gly37, Gly39 and Cys41 forms intermittent hydrogen bonds with ATP along with amino and carboxyl group of Arg73 and Asp174 respectively. The adenosine and ribose part of the ATP is thus stabilised by these amino acid residues. In GEN, the H-bond formation is mainly concentrated between Phe38, Cys41, and Lys59 with Lys59 less preferred. Gly37, Gly39, Gly42, Arg73, and Asp174 also formed hydrogen bonds non-continuously over the period of 50 ns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221331.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). These interactions mainly involved the bond formation between the hydroxyl groups of GEN and amide, amino and carboxyl groups of amino acid residues. No hydrogen bonds were observed with Ser160 and Arg60 as observed in docking. The Ser160 was observed to be aligned unfavourably to the ligand molecule. In the case of CHY molecule, the hydrogen bond formation was analysed to be with Phe38, Cys41, Gly42, and Lys59. The hydrogen bonds were sporadic with Lys59 and no other amino acids residues in the active site formed hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221331.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Among the predicted active site residues, Glu77, Met81, Tyr114, Asp115, Thr116, Asp117, Arg120, Ser160, Asn161, Leu163, Cys173, and Phe175 did not form any H-bonds with any of the ligands. The hydrogen bonds even though lesser was found to be stable through electrostatic and van der Waals forces. GEN and CHY were stable within the binding site over the period of 50 ns though continuous and stable hydrogen bonds weren&#x02019;t observed for CHY. Binding affinities of GEN and CHY were therefore analysed and compared with ATP by calculating the binding free energy between LdMPK4 and GEN/CHY contributed by electrostatic and van der Waals forces.</p><fig id="pone.0221331.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0221331.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>Hydrogen bond analysis.</title><p>Hydrogen bond formation between the LdMPK4 and (A) ATP, (B) GEN and (C) CHY during the course of simulation is represented.

The &#x00394;E<sub>vdW</sub> component for was found to be -103.47 kJ/mol in ATP complex, -104.92 kJ/mol in GEN complex and -105.59 kJ/mol in CHY complex. The &#x00394;E<sub>vdW</sub> was found to be more or less similarly contributed in all the ligand complexes. In the case of &#x00394;E<sub>elec,</sub> the energy component was -3.58 kJ/mol in ATP complex, -10.13 kJ/mol in GEN complex and -11.38 in CHY complex. The electrostatic energy contribution was found to be significantly higher in GEN and CHY complex when compared to the ATP complex. When &#x00394;G<sub>polar</sub> was analysed, 60.08 kJ/mol in ATP complex, 46.50 kJ/mol in GEN complex and 49.81 kJ/mol in CHY was determined. The higher polar energy found in ATP complex with respect to the lower polar energies in GEN and CHY also contributed to the GEN and CHY inhibitors higher binding affinity. &#x00394;Gnon-<sub>polar</sub> changes were insignificant in the complexes where -7.97 kJ/mol in ATP, -9.65 kJ/mol in GEN and -9.00 kJ/mol in CHY were found respectively.</p><p>The binding free energy &#x00394;G<sub>bind</sub> was found to be significantly different from the ATP substrate. The GEN and CHY complexes with LdMPK4 had better and similar binding energy when compared to ATP complex with LdMPK4. The difference in binding affinity was due to electrostatic, polar and non-polar energies in the inhibitor-protein complex. The presence of hydroxyl groups (OH) in these two molecules favoured better binding affinity when compared to natural substrate ATP. Both the molecules were also structurally similar with CHY being devoid of a hydroxyl group compared to GEN. This may be one of the reasons for reduced binding energies and stability of CHY over GEN. This significant &#x00394;G<sub>bind</sub> difference suggests that the GEN and CHY and their hydroxyl groups qualifies as inhibitor compounds competitive to ATP molecule.</p><p>Energy based decomposition of the inhibitor-protein complexes was performed to understand the singular contribution of each and every residue in the active site [<xref rid="pone.0221331.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0221331.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The stability of the complex based on the residues was investigated for interactions other that H-bonds. In the ATP complex, the major contributions were from residues Phe38, Gly39, Cys41, Gly42, Thr43, Val44, Leu61, Arg63, Val64, and Ile74. Comparing GEN complex, the favourable contributions were from Leu7, Gly37, Phe38, Gly39, Ala40, Cys41, Gly42, Thr43, Val44, Arg60, Leu61, and Ile74. The negative contributions in CHY came from the residues Phe38, Gly39, Ala40, Gly42, Thr43, Val44, Leu61, Glu77, and Asp117. In the GEN and CHY complexes, these residues with most of them belonging to the predicted active site residues maintain the stability of the complexes in the binding cavity. Even though there were intermittent hydrogen bond formations, the inhibitors were maintained in the binding cavity by electrostatic, polar and nonpolar interaction of the residues as seen in <xref rid="pone.0221331.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. There were many other residues in the binding cavity that formed minor negative energy contributions as represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221331.g007">Fig 7</xref>. The total binding free energy formed by GEN and CHY complex is greater than ATP free energy formed; moreover, GEN had an upper hand over CHY in the binding free energy too. This strongly suggests that there exist strong interactions in terms of other energy components than hydrogen bonding therefore strongly substantiating the point that GEN and CHY can be strong inhibitors of LdMPK4 enzyme.</p><fig id="pone.0221331.g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0221331.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><title>Binding energy calculation of ligands.</title><p>Free binding energy (&#x00394;G) contribution of 363 amino acid residues over the production period.

The pharmacological properties of these inhibitors also suggest their qualification as a lead molecule for drug studies. Docking studies had hypothesized that these molecules GEN and CHY, could act as inhibitors of LdMPK4 enzyme. The molecular dynamic simulation and free energy calculations were analysed along with the natural substrate ATP. The RMSD from the three compounds and from the apo-enzyme displayed stable backbone throughout the simulation period. RMSF analysis also revealed minor fluctuations in the active site residues in all three complexes. R<sub>g</sub> and SASA analysis predicted a compact complex protein structure and interactions between the complex structure and solvents also found small conformational changes of the ligands in the binding cavity, the results project the comfortability of the ligands in the binding cavity. Though hydrogen bonding revealed continuous bonding in GEN and ATP complex with active site Lys59 and other binding cavity residues, CHY complex displayed intermittent binding. The intermittence in the inhibitor-protein complex was counterbalanced by the electrostatic, polar and non-polar energy interactions between them. The stable energy interactions over the period of 50 ns indicated that the overall protein structure remained stable and the presence of ligand molecules in the binding cavity did not hinder the same. The presence of OH groups in the ringed molecules contributed to the higher binding affinity of the molecules compared to ATP as presented by the MMPBSA calculations. The results from the following study evidently indicate that the lead compounds GEN and CHY can emerge as potential inhibitors of LdMPK4 enzyme.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0221331.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><p>Validation of modelled LdMPK4 structure using (A) ProSA analysis server with overall model quality z-score of -6.46 (B) Ramachandran Plot showing 7.1% residues in the outlier region.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0221331.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0221331.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Multiple sequence alignment.</title><p>Multiple sequence alignment of modelled LdMPK4 modelled (s001) against Human (5MTX), <italic>P</italic>. <italic>bergheri</italic> (3N9X), <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic> (4QNY) and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> (3RP9).
