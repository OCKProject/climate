therapeutics. Most of the antibodies generated during dengue infection are non-neutralizing and cause antibody dependent enhancement. Hence, making a potent neutralizing antibody against all four dengue serotypes could be very effective for the treatment. However, designing a single antibody for all serotypes is difficult due to variation in protein sequences. Therefore, the objective is to identify conserved region of dengue envelope protein and then develop an antibody against that conserved region. Before advancing to the development of such an antibody, it is desirable to validate the interactions between antibody and dengue envelope protein. <italic>In silico</italic> analysis of such interactions provides a good platform to find out a suitable region to design and construct an antibody against it by analyzing antigen-antibody interaction before synthesizing the antibody. In this study, two highly conserved regions of dengue envelope protein were identified and an scFv was constructed against it. Both scFv and FuBc proteins were expressed in bacterial expression system and binding efficiency was analyzed by SPR analysis with <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub> value 2.3 &#x003bc;M. In order to improve binding efficiency, an <italic>in silico</italic> scFv mutant library was created which was virtually screened for higher binding efficiency. Six mutants with high binding efficiency were selected for further analysis. The binding ability of these mutants were predicted using simulation analysis which shows these mutations were stabilizing scFv-FuBc complex.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001501</institution-id><institution>University Grants Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JRF/SRF(2013-2018)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rathore</surname><given-names>Abhishek Singh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>South Asian University</institution></funding-source><award-id>Start-up fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1156-9596</contrib-id><name><surname>Gupta</surname><given-names>Rinkoo Devi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work is financially supported by South Asian University&#x02019;s &#x0201c;Start-up Fund&#x0201d; to RDG and the University Grants Commission (JRF/SRF(2013-2018)) to ASR.

There are 390 million dengue infections per year, of which 96 million manifest clinically [<xref rid="pone.0209576.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. An estimate of 3.9 billion people in 128 countries are living in areas with high risk of dengue virus infection [<xref rid="pone.0209576.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, there is no specific drug approved for the treatment of dengue fever. Dengue is caused by dengue virus of family Flaviviridae of (+) ss RNA virus which is mainly transmitted by female <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. There are four distinct serotypes of the dengue virus DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4. Infection by any one of these serotypes provides life-long immunity against that serotype, but cross immunity to the other serotypes is partial. Subsequent infections by other serotypes increase the risk of developing severe case of dengue which is known as dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome [<xref rid="pone.0209576.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>First dengue vaccine that has been registered for use in several endemic countries is Dengvaxia (CYD-TDV). However, there are potential risks involved with subsequent infection in areas with less exposure to dengue [<xref rid="pone.0209576.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Research on tetravalent live-attenuated vaccines is under phase III clinical trial, and other vaccine candidates like protein subunit, DNA and purified inactivated virus are at initial stage of clinical development [<xref rid="pone.0209576.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In dengue infection most of the circulating antibodies are non-neutralizing and are mostly directed against E protein and the prM protein. In the absence of highly specific neutralizing antibodies, non-neutralizing antibodies usually enhance the entry of any DENV into Fc receptor-bearing cells. This phenomenon is called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) [<xref rid="pone.0209576.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] which makes DENVs unique among all the human viral infections. Nature of the antibody response to DENV is likely to play a major role in defining disease outcome. Antibodies that recognize neutralizing epitope help in virus clearance and reduced symptoms, while antibodies that recognize non-neutralizing epitopes might lead to more severe disease. Hence, there is a need of a highly specific and cross neutralizing antibody that could neutralize all four serotypes and at the same time avoid the ADE of the disease [<xref rid="pone.0209576.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The prime target for developing an antibody is DENV envelope protein which has three structural domains DI, DII, and DIII. Domain III is present at one end of protein molecule which is involved in host cell entry. Fusion loop, present within domain DII located at the other end, provides fusion of viral membrane with the target cell endosomal membrane and help to release viral genome into the cytoplasm [<xref rid="pone.0209576.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Efforts have been made to raise effective antibody against dengue virus. Lai, <italic>et al</italic>. reported that antibodies against envelope protein during infection were predominantly cross-reactive and recognize epitopes containing highly conserved residues at the fusion loop of domain II [<xref rid="pone.0209576.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Mutation of fusion loop impairs capability of virus to infect host cells [<xref rid="pone.0209576.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Antibody against highly conserved 20 amino acids long (250&#x02013;270 amino acid) exposed surface, was reported from the infected patients indicating its antigenicity and potential vaccine development [<xref rid="pone.0209576.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Strongly neutralizing monoclonal antibody targeting envelope protein DII has also been generated from mice immunization [<xref rid="pone.0209576.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] which suggests that DENV envelope protein is a potential target. Recombinantly expressed DIII domain of DENV-3 was used to raise anti DENV-3 antibody in mice which is found to be immunogenic and can be used to elicit an immune response [<xref rid="pone.0209576.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Specifically targeting and highly neutralizing mAbs against EDIII have been developed against sequence-unique epitope, from position 346 to 360 in the envelope protein [<xref rid="pone.0209576.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. EDIII specific antibody 4E11 has been engineered to improve affinity towards antigen on the basis of physicochemical properties of antigen antibody surface [<xref rid="pone.0209576.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, a linear array epitope technique was used to generate epitope specific antibody against DEIII [<xref rid="pone.0209576.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. An envelope protein dimer epitope (EDE) was created by linking two envelope proteins via disulphide bond that buries fusion loop. Antibodies raised using EDE are reported to be highly neutralizing and cross reactive [<xref rid="pone.0209576.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Immunogenicity against different epitopes of envelope protein has also been confirmed by using monoclonal antibodies and human sera [<xref rid="pone.0209576.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209576.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These methods can help us find the neutralizing epitopes. However, none of the above have been reported to neutralize all the serotypes. Hence, the goal of our current study is to find highly conserved region among all of the four serotypes and to develop an antibody against it.</p><p>For this study, scFv antibody fragment was developed instead of whole immunoglobulin molecule which could be very effective against all serotype. scFv antibody fragment was designed using sequence of an anti-fusion loop dengue E53 Fab antibody (PDB ID. 3IXY) [<xref rid="pone.0209576.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Molecular simulations and homology modelling are used for constructing and checking reliability of interaction between antibody fragment and its corresponding antigen. Further, binding affinity of such antibody can be enhanced by screening mutant library in the CDR regions. Subsequently, mutational studies has been performed virtually by creating single and then triple mutant libraries. In addition, six positive mutants have been selected and RMSD values have been calculated for identifying the best binding and stabilized mutant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Conservation analysis of dengue envelope protein</title><p>Sequences of dengue envelope protein of all four serotype were obtained using virus variation resource of NCBI. 3056 full length sequences were obtained after collapsing all the repeated sequences. These sequences were aligned using multiple sequence alignment tool of NCBI virus variation resource and analysed using Antigen variability analyser (AVANA). Regions of envelope protein with high level of conservancy were screened by setting minimum conservancy to 90% and sequence length of 8&#x02013;25 amino acids. Conserved regions found in envelope protein region of sequence were further screened.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Construction of scFv and FuBc protein sequences and homology modelling</title><p>scFv antibody was created using a reported Fab antibody from Protein data bank (PDB: 3IXY) that was highly specific for fusion loop of dengue envelope protein. V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> region of 3IXY scFv antibody was selected and joined using a (G<sub>4</sub>S)<sub>3</sub> linker. All the six CDRs of V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> were mapped using Kabat and Chothia numbering scheme. FuBc protein was constructed on the basis of two highly conserved loops of domain II of dengue envelope protein. Whole domain II could not have been taken without incorporating domain I as they span over each other and only highly conserved regions were selected for this study, so neighbouring residues of two highly conserved loops Fusion loop and Bc loop were selected to form a stable protein molecule. This protein was named FuBc protein. Homology model of scFv was built using Swiss-model online tool. scFv x-ray crystallography structure 1QOK which shared 68.75% identity with 3IXY scFv was used as a template for homology modelling. Dengue envelope protein x-ray crystallography structure (PDB:1AON) was used as template for homology modelling of FuBc by using Discovery studio 4.0 software.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> binding between scFv and FuBc</title><p>To study the interaction between newly developed scFv and FuBc, SPR experiment was performed on a Biacore T200 instrument (GE Healthcare). Before going to the interaction assay both of the proteins were expressed in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> BL21 and purified by size exclusion chromatography. Recombinant FuBc protein was immobilized on the surface of thin gold disc of SPR instrument by amine coupling reaction. The purified scFv were applied in experimental flow cells at different concentrations going down from 10 &#x003bc;M to 50 &#x003b7;M, as well as a non-specific protein sample was applied in control flow cells to obtain its relative binding profile. In all SPR experiments, nonspecific binding obtained in the control flow cell was substracted from the signal obtained in the experimental flow cell. For quantitative binding analysis, different concentrations of scFv protein in 100 &#x003bc;l of running buffer were injected at a flow rate 20 &#x003bc;l/min over 2 min. In between injections, the surface of the sensor chip was regenerated by injecting 2 M NaCl for 15 s at the rate of 20 &#x003bc;l/min. The bulk signal caused by refractive index differences between the flow buffer and the buffer containing the analytes were systematically excluded from the data-fitting process. The association constant (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>) and the dissociation constant (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub>) were calculated from the association and dissociation kinetics of scFv-FuBc interaction sensorgram.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title><italic>In silico</italic> interaction analysis of the binding interface</title><p>Interaction analysis between scFv and FuBc protein was done using ZDock program of Discovery studio 4.0. scFv, and FuBc were defined as receptor and ligand respectively. Fusion and Bc loop were selected as the binding site to filter the poses. Poses were ranked based on ZRank score and RMSD cutoff was set at 10. ZDock results were obtained in a different window showing all the possible interaction poses and clusters. From all the clusters present on the surface of scFv protein, few clusters were filtered out on the basis of their position and interaction on the scFv molecule. All the clusters that were interacting in the CDR region of scFv antibody were filtered out. Poses among these clusters were further screened on the basis of ZDock score, ZRank score and cluster size. On the basis of these parameters best pose was found, and was further used for interaction analysis. Interaction between scFv and FuBc protein was done on the best pose found in ZDock analysis. Interaction analysis was done using Analyse Protein Interface Program of Discovery studio 4.0. The resulting data showed those amino acids which were present on scFv-FuBc interaction interface that were playing role in interaction. Different types of interactions present between the two proteins were also analysed.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title><italic>In silico</italic> scFv mutant library creation and screening of positive mutants</title><p>To create beneficial mutants, all the interacting residues of scFv that were involved in interaction with FuBc were selected as a target for mutation.

All the stabilizing single mutations with negative mutation energy were selected, and were screened for best mutation possible at every position. After screening the single mutations, triple mutations were created using the combination of best single mutants.

Molecular overlay analysis between mutant scFvs with wild type scFv was done to measure the RMSD variation between mutant and wild type proteins. All 6 mutant structures were copied in a molecular window with the scFv wild type, and were superimposed using molecular overlay option in discovery studio.

Simulation results were analysed by Analyse Trajectory Option using RMSD values. Data of RMSD variation in each simulation step was then transferred to excel.

Such analysis could be helpful in reducing the extent of work required to develop an efficient and neutralizing antibody. The envelope of dengue virus is one of the most crucial protein owing to its antigenic reactions in the host [<xref rid="pone.0209576.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Conservation analysis of all four serotypes of DENV resulted in four peptide regions with conservation above 90%. Among these regions, the sequence between 378&#x02013;392 amino acids was the most conserved (&#x0003e;99%). Noticeably, this region was found to be part of the fusion loop in domain II of DENV envelope protein. Another conserved region out of the remaining three, was found in another loop after fusion loop named Bc loop. Hence, these two conserved neighboring regions together (FuBc loop) were used as a target for developing cross-reactive antibody. FuBc loop was also found to be highly conserved in other viruses of <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family [<xref rid="pone.0209576.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. DII of dengue envelope protein has been known to generate cross reactive antibody where fusion loop was identified as a major contributor [<xref rid="pone.0209576.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Due to the high level of conservation of fusion loop in all serotypes of dengue, generation of cross reactive antibody can easily be assumed. However, if the binding affinity of antibody towards the conserved region can be improved, it would be able to neutralize all four serotypes of the virus.</p><p>Consequently, the sequence of scFv antibody against fusion loop of DENV was created from a pre-existing antibody by homology modelling. Previously, a novel anti-TNF scFv was constructed from human antibody frameworks and antagonistic peptides [<xref rid="pone.0209576.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] suggesting a common approach to enhance the specificity and binding efficiency of scFv [<xref rid="pone.0209576.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0209576.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Interaction analysis between scFv and DENV envelope protein showed a stable interaction which assured that after conversion from Fab to scFv fragment, scFv antibody retained the binding property of the original antibody [<xref rid="pone.0209576.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. To further validate the interaction of scFv antibody, recombinant FuBc loop was constructed using only the conserved region of fusion and Bc loops and their neighboring residues to retain their structural integrity (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209576.g003">Fig 3</xref></bold>). When further checked for <italic>in vitro</italic> interaction between FuBc and scFv proteins by SPR experiment, scFv was still found interacting with fusion and Bc loop region of the FuBc protein. From the association and dissociation kinetics of scFv-FuBc interaction sensorgram, the affinity of scFv to recombinant FuBc loop was calculated (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub>~2.3 &#x003bc;M; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209576.g004">Fig 4</xref>).

To improve the binding affinity of scFv towards FuBc, interacting amino acid residues of scFv CDRs were used as a target for mutational study. The result of saturation mutagenesis on all these scFv positions resulted in stabilizing mutations for the scFv-FuBc complex. Mutants that were destabilizing or neutral were removed and only stabilizing (i.e. beneficial) mutants were selected for this study. Total 74 beneficial mutants were found on the basis of binding energy, however these mutants were only concentrated to a few residues (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209576.g009">Fig 9</xref></bold>). These beneficial mutants were then used to build different combinations of triple mutants, and the best combinations with the lowest binding energy were screened. From the top twenty triple mutants, 6 different mutant combinations were selected for further analysis.</p><p>Homology modelling combined with molecular dynamic simulation is an efficient tool for protein structure and stability analysis [<xref rid="pone.0209576.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]). So, selected scFv mutants were used to build homology models <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209576.g010">Fig 10</xref>)</bold>. These protein models of scFv mutants were then used to validate the stability of scFv mutants using molecular overlay analysis. Differences in RMSD values for all mutants in reference to wild type were very low <bold>(<xref rid="pone.0209576.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>)</bold>, which suggested that variation in protein backbone was minor and structural integrity of scFv molecule was also intact after the mutation.

In this study also, RMSD variation in scFv-FuBc complex was higher than individual scFv and FuBc conformations suggesting that scFv and FuBc proteins are very stable on its own and stabilities were more than scFv-FuBc complex. However, RMSD values of the mutant scFv-FuBc complexes were lower than RMSD of wild-type scFv-FuBc interaction complex <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209576.g013">Fig 13</xref>)</bold>, and the potential energy of mutant 2 was even higher than the wild type. However, potential energy of mutant scFv 7, 8, 12 and 15 were almost equal, but lower than that of the wild-type. Mutant 1 has shown the lowest potential energy among all the mutants and was considered to be the most stable interaction <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209576.g014">Fig 14</xref>)</bold>. These findings suggest that most of the mutants constructed using the triple mutant combinatorial mutant library were stabilizing scFv-FuBc interaction and improving the binding of scFv to fusion and Bc loop of dengue envelope protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec018"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Construction of the scFv based antibody against conserved region of dengue virus envelope protein could be effective against all serotypes, and resistant to the genetic variation of the viral antigens. Conservation analysis was identified two neighbouring loops of envelope protein i.e., Fusion and Bc loop. So, these two conserved loops (FuBc protein) were selected as the target for the development of scFv antibody. The scFv antibody was created from a Fab antibody (PDB ID: 3IXY) that is reported against the fusion loop of DENV E-protein. V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> regions of the antibody were joined by a (G<sub>4</sub>S)<sub>3</sub> linker to construct a scFv antibody. The interaction between scFv-FuBc proteins was further validated by SPR experiment. In addition, virtually the affinity of scFv was improved by mutating scFv antibody CDRs. The scFv residues interacting with the FuBc were selected as a target for mutations and the mutants with improved binding energy were selected. To improve the binding efficiency, three single beneficial mutations were stacked to make a scFv triple mutant library. Molecular overlay showed that the difference between scFv wildtype and mutants was not significant, and the mutation was not distorting the structure of scFv. The molecular dynamic simulation showed that the most of the mutants were stabilizing the scFv-FuBc interaction. RMSD and potential energy for scFv mutant 7, 8, 12 and 15 were lower than wild-type scFv. However, scFv mutant 1 showed the best potential energy and RMSD values suggesting an improved interaction. These beneficial mutations can be used to create an antibody that could be highly neutralizing against all four serotypes of dengue virus by binding to the conserved region of DENV E protein with high affinity. Hence, these engineered antibodies would be potential drug candidate for the development of a broad range neutralizing antibody against dengue envelope protein. It can also be used for preventing the viral infection by inhibiting viral entry into the host cell [<xref rid="pone.0209576.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].
