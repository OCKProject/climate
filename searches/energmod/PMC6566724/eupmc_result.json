    "The ultrasonic testing technique using Lamb waves is widely used for the non-destructive testing and evaluation of various structures. For air-coupled excitation and the reception of A0 mode Lamb waves, leaky guided waves are usually exploited. However, at low frequencies (<100 kHz), the velocity of this mode in plastic and composite materials can become slower than the ultrasound velocity in air, and its propagation in films is accompanied only by an evanescent wave in air. To date, the information about the attenuation of the slow A0 mode is very contradictory. Therefore, the objective of this investigation was the measurement of the attenuation of the slow A0 mode in thin plastic films. The measurement of the attenuation of normal displacements of the film caused by a propagating slow A0 mode is discussed. The normal displacements of the film at different distances from the source were measured by a laser interferometer. In order to reduce diffraction errors, the measurement method based on the excitation of cylindrical but not plane waves was proposed. The slow A0 mode was excited in the polyvinylchloride film by a dry contact type ultrasonic transducer made of high-efficiency PMN-32%PT strip-like piezoelectric crystal. It was found that that the attenuation of the slow A0 mode in PVC film at the frequency of 44 kHz is 2 dB/cm. The obtained results can be useful for the development of quality control methods for plastic films."
