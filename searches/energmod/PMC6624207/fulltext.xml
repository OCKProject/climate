Here a machine-learned interatomic potential is utilised to generate an ensemble of glass models of the prototypical phase-change alloy, Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5</sub>, to obtain reliable statistics. Hybrid density-functional theory is used to identify and characterise the geometric and electronic structures of the mid-gap states. 5-coordinated Ge atoms are the local defective bonding environments mainly responsible for these electronic states. The structural motif for the localisation of the mid-gap states is a crystalline-like atomic environment within the amorphous network. An extra electron is trapped spontaneously by these mid-gap states, creating deep traps in the band gap. The results provide significant insights that can help to rationalise the design of multi-level-storage memory devices.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">The structural origin of the mid-gap states responsible for the time-dependent resistance drift in phase-change materials is still under debate.

The two states show very different electronic-transport and optical properties, leading to a unique set of features, exploited in non-volatile phase-change random-access electronic memory (PCRAM), which is a candidate of digital-storage technology to replace the current Si-based flash memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">One of the technological challenges to make PCRAM competitive with flash is to increase their storage density. Multi-level-storage operation would enable not only a manufacturing cost reduction but also the desired enhancement of the storage density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Multi-level-storage stores information as multiple intermediate resistance levels in between the high-resistance, entirely amorphous phase and the low-resistance, entirely crystalline state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, thereby enabling the storage of multiple bits per cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">However, the development of multi-level storage PCRAM devices has been hindered owing to the time-dependent, resistance-drift phenomenon in the amorphous phase. This has been related to the instability of the amorphous state of the phase-change material, resulting in so-called material ageing, characterised by a logarithmic increase of the resistivity with time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. This increase of the cell resistance therefore negatively impacts on data storage in multiple intermediate memory levels and can lead to memory failure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">The lack of long-range order in amorphous semiconductors can give rise to the formation of defect-related electronic states within the band gap, which correspond to an intrinsic property of the disordered material<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.

However, the presence of Te&#x02013;Te chains in amorphous Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5</sub> has been questioned experimentally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and from density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, as the average nearest-neighbour Te&#x02013;Te coordination number in the glass structure has been measured to be very small. In addition, Caravati et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> identified a mid-gap defect state with Sb&#x02013;Te chains in an amorphous Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5</sub> model, generated by ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. However, their mid-gap defect state is rather delocalised through the entire simulation cell rather than being localised at a specific structural motif.</p><p id="Par7">The most significant complication for modelling defects in amorphous materials concerns variations in their local environment caused by structural disorder. Any simulation study should involve a statistical analysis of many different models to investigate the probability of defect formation and to obtain distributions of their properties. The gap-state density of glassy Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5</sub> has been measured by modulated photocurrent experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and was found to be 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>10</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>/eV for mid-gap defect states and 4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>10</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>/eV for shallow gap states (located at ~0.2&#x02009;eV from the valence-band edge). Thus, the concentration of these electronic states is relatively low, making these defects difficult to be studied by computational modelling. Hence, calculations for many models are required to credibly predict the mid-gap defect-state configurations, and to identify the atomic environment that can host these special electronic states within the glass network (see Supplementary Note&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for further details).</p><p id="Par8">In this study, we take advantage of a machine-learned interatomic potential, recently developed by our group, for amorphous Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, in order to generate an ensemble of uncorrelated 315-atom glass models of this material. Subsequently, DFT calculations, using non-local functionals, are employed to optimise the geometries of the generated glass models and to calculate their electronic structure. The non-local functional is able to provide a very good estimate of the band gap and it can identify the atomic structural features responsible for the mid-gap localised defects. These calculations are extended to a 900-atom amorphous model to enhance the quality of the observations on the atomistic nature of the mid-gap defect states expected to be present in a real sample of glassy Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5</sub>. Finally, we explore the capability of the mid-gap defect states to serve as electron traps, providing further insight into the performance of these PCRAM devices.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Glass validation</title><p id="Par9">The present calculations make use of a machine-learned interatomic potential and DFT. In order to create sufficient statistics, 30 independent 315-atom models of amorphous Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5</sub> (225GST) were generated using classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with a Gaussian approximation potential (GAP), followed by periodic hybrid-DFT calculations of the electronic structure of these models, as described in the Methods section. It is noted that GAP-MD simulations have been successfully used recently to generate realistic and accurate glass models of other compounds as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par10">The GAP potential exhibits an accuracy close to that of the underlying DFT-PBEsol training set<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In addition, we have demonstrated that the potential can be employed for rigorous modelling, with near-DFT accuracy, of the short- and medium-range-order structure of amorphous 225GST. Analysis of the local atomic structure showed that, even though the GAP potential may slightly under-estimate the proportion of tetrahedral Ge environments and the amount of homopolar bonds in the glass structure, it can capture the coexistence of tetrahedral and octahedral Ge environments within the amorphous network of 225GST, as previously reported from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Consequently, the complex local environments coexisting in the glass structure can be successfully reproduced; hence, glass models generated with the GAP potential are not missing any of the atomic environments believed to be present in amorphous 225GST<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par11">In this work, an ensemble of 315-atom supercell models of amorphous 225GST was simulated; this cell size corresponds to a compromise between the size of the glass model, the computer time required to achieve representative statistics for the defect states, and the feasibility of performing spin-polarised hybrid-DFT calculations. The quality of the generated amorphous 225GST models, obtained using classical MD with the GAP potential, was validated by comparison of the atomic structure of the simulated glasses with experimental and previous DFT-modelling data. The total radial distribution function (RDF), averaged over the 30 samples, is shown in Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, and it agrees well with the RDF calculated for a 315-atom structural model of amorphous 225GST, generated by ab initio molecular dynamics simulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.

In a more-extended view, by considering second-nearest-neighbour environments, it can be observed that the defect states consist of small groups of Ge atoms that are not necessarily covalently bonded to each other.</p><p id="Par18">The molecular orbitals associated with mid-gap electronic states in two 225GST glass models are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>.

Two very interesting observations related to this pattern are: (a) a 5-coordinated Ge atom with a Ge&#x02013;Ge bond next to a cube; and (b) the formation of an odd-numbered, in particular a 5-membered, ring structure within the defect environment.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Local atomic structure of mid-gap defects.

Instead of simply quenching a liquid formed by the external thermal melting of a crystal, the thermal energy for melting in a PCRAM cell is provided internally by the Joule heating associated with the application of a RESET voltage pulse. The I&#x02013;V characteristics of 225GST are non-linear and the non-Ohmic increase in current is owing to electric-field-assisted carrier-generation processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Hence, when the amorphous phase of 225GST forms in a PCRAM cell, it is in the presence of a very high electron-hole current density. Thus, under such conditions, most of the localised gap-state trapping centres would be expected to become filled during the RESET process itself<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Thereby, the electronic condition of the material immediately post-RESET is equivalent to that an amorphous semiconductor that can be found after steady-state pulsed optical excitation and before the following transient photocurrent decay. Electrons/holes are subsequently thermally de-trapped; an applied read voltage therefore can produce a time-dependent current, which can be interpreted as a time-dependent resistance. Consequently, this type of behaviour can be used to explain the very short-time increase in resistance evident in amorphous 225GST immediately after the reset pulse. It is noted that this approach has been previously used to describe the long-time photocurrent decay exhibited by amorphous silicon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par37">This alternative electronic mechanism for the origin of the resistance drift is based on the fact that in-gap localised states in the amorphous phase can serve as charge-carrier traps, and the long-time resistance-drift effect is related to the slow deep-trap release and subsequent recombination with charge carriers. From the electron-trapping calculations in this study, we have highlighted that the unoccupied mid-gap defect electronic states in the band gap of the amorphous 225GST models are able to capture electrons, leading to deep-trap states with strong electron localisation in the structural motif of the defect. This observation works in favour of the view that the resistance drift in amorphous 225GST might be caused by electron/hole trapping during the electron/hole-injection process accompanying the RESET process and creation of the glass.</p><p id="Par38">In conclusion, understanding the structural origin of resistance drift in phase-change materials is indispensable for its elimination and subsequent development of multi-level, multi-bit storage devices. The atomistic modelling presented in this work links the electronic density of states to the structure of the glass, and establishes the structural motifs which are associated with the localised mid-gap electronic states of the prototypical phase-change memory material, 225GST. The results provide significant insight, as well as a prospect of mitigating resistance drift in phase-change memory devices by suitable material engineering to control the distribution of localised defect states within the band gap of the amorphous phase, thereby facilitating the realisation of multi-level storage operation in future PCRAM devices.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Molecular dynamics simulations</title><p id="Par39">Thirty model structures of amorphous 225GST were generated using classical MD with periodic boundary conditions.

The CP2K code uses a Gaussian basis set with an auxiliary plane-wave basis set<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. All atomic species were represented using a double-&#x003b6; valence-polarised Gaussian basis set<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup> in conjunction with the Goedecker-Teter-Hutter pseudopotential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>. The plane-wave energy cutoff was set to 400&#x02009;Ry. The atomic geometry of each glass model was optimised, and the electronic structure was calculated by using the non-local PBE0 functional, with a cutoff radius of 3&#x02009;&#x000c5; for the truncated Coulomb operator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. The inclusion of the Hartree&#x02013;Fock exchange provides an accurate description of the band gap and the localised defect states in our 225GST glass models, as was demonstrated in our previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. The computational cost of hybrid-functional calculations can be reduced by using the auxiliary density-matrix method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup> (see Supplementary Note&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref> for details), as employed in previous modelling studies of amorphous materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. The Broyden&#x02013;Fletcher&#x02013;Goldfarb&#x02013;Shanno algorithm was applied in the geometry optimisations and the forces on atoms were minimised to within 0.023&#x02009;eV/&#x000c5;. Electron trapping was modelled by injecting an extra electron in the relaxed ground-state glass structure and minimising the energy with respect to the atomic coordinates. The same non-local functional, as well as the same set-up, were used for the geometry optimisations of the glass systems with the extra electron.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec12"><p>
