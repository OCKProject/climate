    "Coal is still a major energy source, mostly used in power plants. However, the coal combustion emits harmful SO2 and fly ash. Wet flue gas desulfurization (WFGD) technology is extensively used to control SO2 emissions in power plants. However, only limited studies have investigated the synergistic dust removal by the WFGD system. Spray scrubbers and sieve-tray spray scrubbers are often used in WFGD systems to improve the SO2 removal efficiency. In this study, the synergistic dust removal of WFGD systems for a spray scrubber and a sieve-tray spray scrubber was investigated using the experimental and modelling approaches, respectively. For the spray scrubber, the influence of parameters, including dust particle diameters and inlet concentrations of dust particles, and the flow rates of flue gas and slurry of limestone/gypsum on the dust removal efficiency, was investigated. For the sieve-tray spray scrubber, the influence of parameters such as the pore diameter and porosity of sieve trays on the dust removal efficiency was examined. The study found that the dust removal efficiency in the sieve-tray spray scrubber was approximately 1.1-10.6% higher than that of the spray scrubber for the same experimental conditions. Based on the parameters investigated and geometric parameters of a scrubber, a novel droplets swarm model for dust removal efficiency was developed from the single droplet model. The enhanced dust removal efficiency of sieve tray was expressed by introducing a strength coefficient to an inertial collision model. The dust removal efficiency model for the sieve-tray spray scrubber was developed by combining the droplets swarm model for the spray scrubber with the modified inertial collision model for the sieve tray. The results simulated using both models are consistent with the experimental data obtained."
