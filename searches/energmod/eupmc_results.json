      "The focus of this work is to present the feasibility of lowering the supply and return temperatures of district heating networks in order to achieve energy savings through the implementation of feed-forward model predictive control. The current level of district heating technology dictates a need for higher supply temperatures, which is not the case when considering the future outlook. In part, this can be attributed to the fact that current networks are being controlled by operator experience and outdoor temperatures. The prospects of reducing network temperatures can be evaluated by developing a dynamic model of the process which can then be used for control purposes. Two scenarios are presented in this work, to not only evaluate a controller's performance in supplying lower network temperatures, but to also assess the boundaries of the return temperature. In Scenario 1, the historical load is used as a feed-forward signal to the controller, and in Scenario 2, a load prediction model is used as the feed-forward signal. The findings for both scenarios suggest that the new control approach can lead to a load reduction of 12.5% and 13.7% respectively for the heat being supplied to the network. With the inclusion of predictions with increased accuracy on end-user demand and feed-back, the return temperature values can be better sustained, and can lead to a decrease in supply temperatures and an increase in energy savings on the production side."

      "Habitat fragmentation threatens global biodiversity. To date, there is only limited understanding of how the different aspects of habitat fragmentation (habitat loss, number of fragments and isolation) affect species diversity within complex ecological networks such as food webs. Here, we present a dynamic and spatially explicit food web model which integrates complex food web dynamics at the local scale and species-specific dispersal dynamics at the landscape scale, allowing us to study the interplay of local and spatial processes in metacommunities. We here explore how the number of habitat patches, i.e. the number of fragments, and an increase of habitat isolation affect the species diversity patterns of complex food webs (α-, β-, γ-diversities). We specifically test whether there is a trophic dependency in the effect of these two factors on species diversity. In our model, habitat isolation is the main driver causing species loss and diversity decline. Our results emphasize that large-bodied consumer species at high trophic positions go extinct faster than smaller species at lower trophic levels, despite being superior dispersers that connect fragmented landscapes better. We attribute the loss of top species to a combined effect of higher biomass loss during dispersal with increasing habitat isolation in general, and the associated energy limitation in highly fragmented landscapes, preventing higher trophic levels to persist. To maintain trophic-complex and species-rich communities calls for effective conservation planning which considers the interdependence of trophic and spatial dynamics as well as the spatial context of a landscape and its energy availability."

      "This article contains data on the effects of seagrass decline on wave energy along the shoreline of Barnegat Bay (USA) previously evaluated in Donatelli et al., 2019. This study was carried out applying the Coupled-Ocean-Atmosphere-Wave-Sediment Transport (COAWST) numerical modelling framework to six historical maps of seagrass distribution. A new routine recently implemented in COAWST was used, which explicitly computes the wave thrust acting on salt marsh boundaries. The numerical modelling results are reported in terms of wind-wave heights for different seagrass coverages, wind speeds and directions. From a comparison with a numerical experiment without submerged aquatic vegetation, we show how the computed wave thrust on marsh boundaries can be reduced by seagrass beds."

      "Net energy accounts for the proportion of energy expenditure attributed to the digestion, metabolism, and absorption of ingested food. Currently, there are no models available to predict net energy density of food for domestic cats. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to measure the heat increment of feeding in cats, and to model the net energy of commercial diets. Metabolizable energy and calorimetry data from two previous studies was reanalyzed to create net energy models in the present study. Energy expenditure was calculated using measurements of CO2 production and O2 consumption. Net energy was determined as the metabolizable energy of the diets minus the heat increment of feeding. The heat increment of feeding was determined as the area under the energy expenditure curve above the resting fed metabolic rate. Eight net energy models were developed using metabolizable energy, 1 of 4 dietary parameters (crude protein, fat, fiber, and starch), and heat increment of feeding values from 0-2 h or 0-21 h. Two hours postprandial, and over the full calorimetry period, the heat increment of feeding amounted for 1.74, and 20.9% of the metabolizable energy, respectively. Of the models tested, the models using crude protein in combination with metabolizable energy as dietary parameters best fit the observed data, thus providing a more accurate estimate of dietary energy availability for cats."

      "Smart energy meters generate real time, high frequency data which can foster demand management and response of consumers and firms, with potential private and social benefits. However, proper statistical techniques are needed to make sense of this large amount of data and translate them into usable recommendations. Here, we apply Functional Data Analysis (FDA), a novel branch of Statistics that analyses functions-to identify drivers of residential electricity load curves. We evaluate a real time feedback intervention which involved about 1000 Italian households for a period of three years. Results of the FDA modelling reveal, for the first time, daytime-indexed patterns of residential electricity consumption which depend on the ownership of specific clusters of electrical appliances and an overall reduction of consumption after the introduction of real time feedback, unrelated to appliance ownership characteristics."

      "This research presents an analysis of the frequencies and vibration modes of the structure of the superficial seiches of Lake Chapala using mathematical modelling and measurements. The HAMSOM model was run with wind fields from coastal meteorological stations and for different lake storage levels. The lake water level measurements were carried out in two campaigns in 2003. An analysis of the surface seiches in the lake was performed using the fast Fourier transform method. A spectral analysis of lake water level measurements reveals seiches with periods close to 5.9, 3, 2, and 1.5 h. A comparison with the periods calculated by the HAMSOM model indicates that these periods correspond to superficial seiches of the fundamental longitudinal mode of the lake and the subsequent three modes. The lake has undergone important changes in its storage level over time. Therefore, we modelled it with storage levels from the isobaths 90 to 95 m and found that surface seiche periods decreased to 5.2 h."

      "To enable a more sustainable wastewater treatment processes, a transition towards resource recovery methods that have minimal environmental impact while being financially viable is imperative. Phosphorus (P) is a finite resource that is being discharged into the aqueous environment in excessive quantities. As such, understanding the financial and environmental effectiveness of different approaches for removing and recovering P from wastewater streams is important to reduce the overall impact of wastewater treatment. In this study, a process-systems modelling framework for comprehensively evaluating these approaches in terms of both economic and environmental impacts is developed. Applying this framework, treatment pathways are designed, simulated and analysed to determine the most suitable approaches for P removal and recovery. The purpose of this methodology is not only to assist with plant design, but also to identify the principal economic and environmental factors acting as barriers to implementing a given technology, incorporating the impact of waste recovery. The results suggest that the chemical and ion-exchange approaches studied deliver sustainable advantages over biological pathways, both economically and environmentally, with each possessing different strengths. The assessment methodology developed enables a more rational and environmentally sound wastewater plant design approach to be taken."

      "Background.The generation and management of solid waste pose potential adverse impacts on human health and the environment.Objective.The present study examines the operational performance of municipal solid waste (MSW) disposal in the Wa Municipality, Ghana.Methods.The study applied both qualitative and quantitative research methods and modelled the Wa Municipality's MSW disposal system using the municipal solid waste decision support tool (MSW DST). Acid gases (sulphur oxides and nitrogen oxides) and total particulate matter that have a direct impact on human health were set as the objective functions for modelling five MSW disposal scenarios. The modelled scenarios were: 1) landfill disposal only; 2) composting and landfill disposal; 3) composting, incineration, refuse derived fuels (RDF) and landfill disposal; 4) separation, composting, incineration, RDF and landfill disposal; and 5) separation, transfer, material recovery, composting, incineration, RDF and landfill disposal. The pollutants chosen as indicators for substance flow analysis included lead, cadmium, arsenic, mercury, copper, chromium, and zinc.Results.Scenarios 4 and 5 produced the least engineering cost of 1 150 000 US $/year for the entire MSW disposal system, whereas scenario 2 produced the highest cost of 1 340 000 US $/year. Scenario 5 produced the least average health impacts of −5.812E-04 lbs/year, while scenario 2 generated the highest engineering cost and produced the highest average health impact of 9.358E-05 lbs/year. Scenarios 5 and 4, which included waste-to-energy conversion in the systems, produced the lowest average health impacts (−5.812E-04 lbs/year and −5.611E-04 lbs/year, respectively).Conclusions.The adoption of an integrated solid waste management concept, including waste-to-energy technologies, will not only help to lessen MSW disposal hazards, but also to produce alternative sources of energy for Ghana and other developing countries.Competing Interests.The authors declare no competing financial interests"

      "CONTEXT:Calenduloside E (CE), one of the primary natural products found in Aralia elata (Miq.) Seem. (Araliaceae), possesses prominent anti-apoptotic potential. A previous study found that one of the anti-apoptotic CE targets is heat shock protein 90 AB1 (Hsp90AB1) by probe CE-P, while the other targets of CE still need to be identified with more efficient probes. OBJECTIVE:This study investigates CE analogue (CEA) as one clickable activity-based probe for use in exploring anti-apoptotic CE targets. MATERIALS AND METHODS:Pretreatment of HUVECs with CEA (1.25 μM) for 8 hr, followed by ox-LDL stimulation for 24 h. Flow cytometry analysis and JC-1 staining assays were performed The kinetic constant measurements were tested by the Biacore T200, CM5 Sensor Chip which was activated by using sulpho-NHS/EDC. Ligands were dissolved and injected with a concentration of 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, 1.56, 0.78 and 0 μM. RESULTS:CEA was confirmed to possess an anti-apoptotic effect. The probable targets of CE/CEA were calculated, and as one of the higher scores proteins (Fit values: 0.88/0.86), Hsp90 properly got our attention. Molecular modelling study showed that both CE and CEA could bind to Hsp90 with the similar interaction, and the docking scores (S value) were -7.61 and -7.33. SPR assay provided more evidence to prove that CEA can interact with Hsp90 with the KD value 11.7 µM. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS:Our results suggest that clickable probe CEA could alleviate ox-LDL induced apoptosis by a similar mechanism of anti-apoptotic CE, and afforded the possibility of identifying additional anti-apoptotic targets of CE."

      "This paper presents the first outcomes of the \"FAIRMODE pilot\" activity, aiming at improving the way in which air quality models are used in the frame of the European \"Air Quality Directive\". Member States may use modelling, combined with measurements, to \"assess\" current levels of air quality and estimate future air quality under different scenarios. In case of current and potential exceedances of the Directive limit values, it is also requested that they \"plan\" and implement emission reductions measures to avoid future exceedances. In both \"assessment\" and \"planning\", air quality models can and should be used; but to do so, the used modelling chain has to be fit-for-purpose and properly checked and verified. FAIRMODE has developed in the recent years a suite of methodologies and tools to check if emission inventories, model performance, source apportionment techniques and planning activities are fit-for-purpose. Within the \"FAIRMODE pilot\", these tools are used and tested by regional/local authorities, with the two-fold objective of improving management practices at regional/local scale, and providing valuable feedback to the FAIRMODE community. Results and lessons learnt from this activity are presented in this paper, as a showcase that can potentially benefit other authorities in charge of air quality assessment and planning."

      "In cell and molecular biology, metabolism is the only system that can be fully simulated at genome scale. Metabolic systems biology offers powerful abstraction tools to simulate all known metabolic reactions in a cell, therefore providing a snapshot that is close to its observable phenotype. In this review, we cover the 15 years of human metabolic modelling. We show that, although the past five years have not experienced large improvements in the size of the gene and metabolite sets in human metabolic models, their accuracy is rapidly increasing. We also describe how condition-, tissue-, and patient-specific metabolic models shed light on cell-specific changes occurring in the metabolic network, therefore predicting biomarkers of disease metabolism. We finally discuss current challenges and future promising directions for this research field, including machine/deep learning and precision medicine. In the omics era, profiling patients and biological processes from a multiomic point of view is becoming more common and less expensive. Starting from multiomic data collected from patients and N-of-1 trials where individual patients constitute different case studies, methods for model-building and data integration are being used to generate patient-specific models. Coupled with state-of-the-art machine learning methods, this will allow characterizing each patient's disease phenotype and delivering precision medicine solutions, therefore leading to preventative medicine, reduced treatment, and in silico clinical trials."

      "Despite a wide range of current and potential applications, one primary concern of brittle materials is their sudden and swift collapse. This failure phenomenon exhibits an inability of the materials to sustain tension stresses in a predictable and reliable manner. However, advances in the field of fracture mechanics, especially at the nanoscale, have contributed to the understanding of the material response and failure nature to predict most of the potential dangers. In the following contribution, a comprehensive review is carried out on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of brittle fracture, wherein the method provides new data and exciting insights into fracture mechanism that cannot be obtained easily from theories or experiments on other scales. In the present review, an abstract introduction to MD simulations, advantages, current limitations and their applications to a range of brittle fracture problems are presented. Additionally, a brief discussion highlights the theoretical background of the macroscopic techniques, such as Griffith's criterion, crack tip opening displacement, J-integral and other criteria that can be linked to the fracture mechanical properties at the nanoscale. The main focus of the review is on the recent advances in fracture analysis of highly brittle materials, such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, silicon carbide, amorphous silica, calcium carbonate and silica aerogel at the nanoscale. These materials are presented here due to their extraordinary mechanical properties and a wide scope of applications. The underlying review grants a more extensive unravelling of the fracture behaviour and mechanical properties at the nanoscale of brittle materials."

      "Biomechanical energy harvesters generate electricity, from human movement, to power portable electronics. We developed an energy harvesting module to be used in conjunction with a load carriage device that allows carried mass in a backpack to oscillate in the medial-lateral (M-L) direction. The energy harvesting module was designed to tune M-L oscillations of the carried mass to create favourable device-user interaction. We tested seven energy harvesting conditions and compared them to walking with the device when the weight was rigidly fixed to the backpack frame. For each energy harvesting condition, we changed the external load resistance: altering how much electricity was being generated and how much the carried mass would oscillate. We then correlated device behaviour to the biomechanical response of the user. The energy harvesting load carriage system generated electricity with no significant increase in the metabolic power required to walk, when compared to walking with the carried weight rigidly fixed. The device was able to generate up to 0.22 ± 0.03 W of electricity, while walking with 9 kg of carried weight. The device also reduced the interaction forces experienced by the user, in the M-L direction, compared to walking with the device when the mass was rigidly fixed."

      "The Class I Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) is a central protein in immunology as it binds to intracellular peptides and displays them at the cell surface for recognition by T-cells. The structural analysis of bound peptide-MHC complexes (pMHCs) holds the promise of interpretable and general binding prediction (i.e., testing whether a given peptide binds to a given MHC). However, structural analysis is limited in part by the difficulty in modelling pMHCs given the size and flexibility of the peptides that can be presented by MHCs. This article describes APE-Gen (Anchored Peptide-MHC Ensemble Generator), a fast method for generating ensembles of bound pMHC conformations. APE-Gen generates an ensemble of bound conformations by iterated rounds of (i) anchoring the ends of a given peptide near known pockets in the binding site of the MHC, (ii) sampling peptide backbone conformations with loop modelling, and then (iii) performing energy minimization to fix steric clashes, accumulating conformations at each round. APE-Gen takes only minutes on a standard desktop to generate tens of bound conformations, and we show the ability of APE-Gen to sample conformations found in X-ray crystallography even when only sequence information is used as input. APE-Gen has the potential to be useful for its scalability (i.e., modelling thousands of pMHCs or even non-canonical longer peptides) and for its use as a flexible search tool. We demonstrate an example for studying cross-reactivity."

      "In this study, the effect of the impact angle of a projectile during low-velocity impact on Kevlar fabrics has been investigated using a simplified numerical model. The implementation of mesoscale models is complex and usually involves long computation time, in contrast to the practical industry needs to obtain accurate results rapidly. In addition, when the simulation includes more than one layer of composite ply, the computational time increases even in the case of hybrid models. With the goal of providing useful and rapid prediction tools to the industry, a simplified model has been developed in this work. The model offers an advantage in the reduced computational time compared to a full 3D model (around a 90% faster). The proposed model has been validated against equivalent experimental and numerical results reported in the literature with acceptable deviations and accuracies for design requirements. The proposed numerical model allows the study of the influence of the geometry on the impact response of the composite. Finally, after a parametric study related to the number of layers and angle of impact, using a response surface methodology, a mechanistic model and a surface diagram have been presented in order to help with the calculation of the ballistic limit."

      "Rural residential energy consumption in China is experiencing a rapid transition towards clean energy, nevertheless, solid fuel combustion remains an important emission source. Here we quantitatively evaluate the contribution of rural residential emissions to PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm) and the impacts on health and climate. The clean energy transitions result in remarkable reductions in the contributions to ambient PM2.5, avoiding 130,000 (90,000-160,000) premature deaths associated with PM2.5 exposure. The climate forcing associated with this sector declines from 0.057 ± 0.016 W/m2 in 1992 to 0.031 ± 0.008 W/m2 in 2012. Despite this, the large remaining quantities of solid fuels still contributed 14 ± 10 μg/m3 to population-weighted PM2.5 in 2012, which comprises 21 ± 14% of the overall population-weighted PM2.5 from all sources. Rural residential emissions affect not only rural but urban air quality, and the impacts are highly seasonal and location dependent."

      "Mathematical models of spatial population dynamics typically focus on the interplay between dispersal events and birth/death processes. However, for many animal communities, significant arrangement in space can occur on shorter timescales, where births and deaths are negligible. This phenomenon is particularly prevalent in populations of larger, vertebrate animals who often reproduce only once per year or less. To understand spatial arrangements of animal communities on such timescales, we use a class of diffusion-taxis equations for modelling inter-population movement responses between [Formula: see text] populations. These systems of equations incorporate the effect on animal movement of both the current presence of other populations and the memory of past presence encoded either in the environment or in the minds of animals. We give general criteria for the spontaneous formation of both stationary and oscillatory patterns, via linear pattern formation analysis. For [Formula: see text], we classify completely the pattern formation properties using a combination of linear analysis and nonlinear energy functionals. In this case, the only patterns that can occur asymptotically in time are stationary. However, for [Formula: see text], oscillatory patterns can occur asymptotically, giving rise to a sequence of period-doubling bifurcations leading to patterns with no obvious regularity, a hallmark of chaos. Our study highlights the importance of understanding between-population animal movement for understanding spatial species distributions, something that is typically ignored in species distribution modelling, and so develops a new paradigm for spatial population dynamics."

      "BACKGROUND:Bone conduction implants can be used in the treatment of conductive or mixed hearing loss. The BONEBRIDGE bone conduction implant (BB-BCI) is an active, transcutaneous device. BB-BCI implantation can be performed through either the transmastoid or retrosigmoid approach with their respective limitations. Here, we present a third, novel approach for BB-BCI implantation. OBJECTIVE:Describe the detailed surgical technique of BB-BCI implantation through a middle fossa approach with self-drilling screws and present preliminary audiometric outcome data following this approach. METHODS:A single institution, retrospective chart review was completed for patients implanted with the BB-BCI via the middle fossa approach. Preoperative planning and modelling were performed using 3D Slicer. Audiological testing was performed pre- and post-operatively following standard audiometric techniques. RESULTS:Forty patients underwent BB-BCI implantation using the middle fossa approach. Modelling techniques allowed for implantation through the use of external landmarks, obviating the need for intraoperative image guidance. The surgical technique was refined over time through experience and adaptation. Mean follow-up was 29 months (range 3-71 months) with no surgical complications, favourable cosmesis, and expected audiometric outcomes. An average functional gain of 39.6 dB (± 14.7 SD) was found. CONCLUSION:The middle fossa technique with self-drilling screws is a safe and effective option for BONEBRIDGE implantation. As a reference for other groups considering this approach, an annotated video has been included as a supplement to the study."

      "Models such as InraPorc enable the growth of pigs to be simulated and their nutrient requirements to be determined. However, so far, these models have not been applied to local breeds. We used InraPorc to determine the nutrient requirements of growing pigs from local breeds (H2020 European Union project TREASURE). Data on feed composition, allowance and intake, and body weight (BW) were obtained from literature reports or experiments conducted within the project. Data were used in InraPorc to calibrate 16 growth and intake profiles from nine breeds (Alentejana, Basque, Bísara, Apulo Calabrese, Cinta Senese, Iberian, Krškopolje pig, Mangalitsa, and Moravka), with one to three profiles per breed depending on the experimental conditions or data source. On the 40-100 kg BW range, mean protein deposition (PDm) was low for all breeds (below 116 g/d vs. over 130 g/d in conventional breeds). The age of pigs at 40 kg BW (110 to 206 days) denoted different types of feeding management in addition to genetic differences. The PDm and the lysine requirements were the highest in breeds with the highest average daily gain. In all breeds, a small proportion of total body energy retention was dedicated to protein, with the greatest proportion of energy retention in the form of lipids. Despite some methodological limitations, this study provides initial insights into the nutrient requirements of some local breeds."

      "BACKGROUND:Palm oil's high yields, consequent low cost and highly versatile properties as a cooking oil and food ingredient have resulted in its thorough infiltration of the food sector in some countries. Longitudinal studies have associated palm oil's high saturated fatty acid content with non-communicable disease, but neither the economic or disease burdens have been assessed previously. METHODS:This novel palm oil-focussed disease burden assessment employs a fully integrated health, macroeconomic and demographic Computable General Equilibrium Model for Thailand with nine regional (urban/rural) households. Nutritional changes from food consumption are endogenously translated into health (myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke) and population outcomes and are fed back into the macroeconomic model as health and caregiver-related productive labour supply effects and healthcare costs to generate holistic 2016-2035 burden estimates. Model scenarios mirror the replacement of palm cooking oil with other dietary oils and are compared with simulated total Thai health and macroeconomic burdens for MI and stroke. RESULTS:Replacing consumption of palm cooking oil with other dietary oils could reduce MI/stroke incident cases by 8280/2639 and cumulative deaths by 4683/894 over 20 years, removing approximately 0.5% of the total Thai burden of MI/stroke. This palm cooking oil replacement would reduce consumption shares of saturated/monounsaturated fatty acids in Thai household consumption by 6.5%/3% and increase polyunsaturated fatty acid consumption shares by 14%, yielding a 1.74% decrease in the population-wide total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio after 20 years. The macroeconomic burden that would be removed is US$308mn, approximately 0.44% of the total burden of MI/stroke on Thailand's economy or 0.003% of cumulative 20-year GDP. Bangkok and Central region households benefit most from removal of disease burdens. CONCLUSIONS:Simulations indicate that consumption of palm cooking oil, rather than other dietary oils, imposes a negative health burden (MI and stroke) and associated economic burden on a high consuming country, such as Thailand. Integrated sectoral model frameworks to assess these burdens are possible, and burden estimates from our simulated direct replacement of palm cooking oil indicate that using these frameworks both for broader analyses of dietary palm oil use and total burden analyses of other diseases may also be beneficial."

      "Radiobiological modelling has been a key part of radiation biology and therapy for many decades, and many aspects of clinical practice are guided by tools such as the linear-quadratic model. However, most of the models in regular clinical use are abstract and empirical, and do not provide significant scope for mechanistic interpretation or making predictions in novel cell lines or therapies. In this review, we will discuss the key areas of ongoing mechanistic research in radiation biology, including physical, chemical, and biological steps, and review a range of mechanistic modelling approaches which are being applied in each area, highlighting the possible opportunities and challenges presented by these techniques."

      "The 3D structure of a protein can be predicted from its amino acid sequence with high accuracy for a large fraction of cases because of the availability of large quantities of experimental data and the advance of computational algorithms. Recently, deep learning methods exploiting the coevolution information obtained by comparing related protein sequences have been successfully used to generate highly accurate model structures even in the absence of template structure information. However, structures predicted based on either template structures or related sequences require further improvement in regions for which information is missing. Refining a predicted protein structure with insufficient information on certain regions is critical because these regions may be connected to functional specificity that is not conserved among related proteins. The GalaxyRefine2 web server, freely available via http://galaxy.seoklab.org/refine2, is an upgraded version of the GalaxyRefine protein structure refinement server and reflects recent developments successfully tested through CASP blind prediction experiments. This method adopts an iterative optimization approach involving various structure move sets to refine both local and global structures. The estimation of local error and hybridization of available homolog structures are also employed for effective conformation search."

      "In advanced radiotherapy, intensity modulated radiation fields and complex dose-delivery are utilized to prescribe higher doses to tumours. Here, we investigated the impact of modulated radiation fields on radio-sensitivity and cell recovery during dose delivery. We generated experimental survival data after single-dose, split-dose and fractionated irradiation in normal human skin fibroblast cells (AGO1522) and human prostate cancer cells (DU145). The dose was delivered to either 50% of the area of a T25 flask containing the cells (half-field) or 100% of the flask (uniform-field). We also modelled the impact of dose-rate effects and intercellular signalling on cell-killing. Applying the model to the survival data, it is found that (i) in-field cell survival under half-field exposure is higher than uniform-field exposure for the same delivered dose; (ii) the importance of sub-lethal damage repair (SLDR) in AGO1522 cells is reduced under half-field exposure; (iii) the yield of initial DNA lesions measured with half-field exposure is smaller than that with uniform-field exposure. These results suggest that increased cell survival under half-field exposure is predominantly attributed not to rescue effects (increased SLDR) but protective effects (reduced induction of initial DNA lesions). In support of these protective effects, the reduced DNA damage leads to modulation of cell-cycle dynamics, i.e., less G1 arrest 6 h after irradiation. These findings provide a new understanding of the impact of dose-rate effects and protective effects measured after modulated field irradiation."

      "BACKGROUND:Non-communicable diseases are the leading cause of death in England, and poor diet and physical inactivity are two of the principle behavioural risk factors. In the context of increasingly constrained financial resources, decision makers in England need to be able to compare the potential costs and health outcomes of different public health policies aimed at improving these risk factors in order to know where to invest so that they can maximise population health. This paper describes PRIMEtime CE, a multistate life table cost-effectiveness model that can directly compare interventions affecting multiple disease outcomes. METHODS:The multistate life table model, PRIMEtime Cost Effectiveness (PRIMEtime CE), is developed from the Preventable Risk Integrated ModEl (PRIME) and the PRIMEtime model. PRIMEtime CE uses routinely available data to estimate how changing diet and physical activity in England affects morbidity and mortality from heart disease, stroke, diabetes, liver disease, and cancers either directly or via raised blood pressure, cholesterol, and body weight. RESULTS:Model outcomes are change in quality adjusted life years, and change in English National Health Service and social care costs. CONCLUSION:This paper describes PRIMEtime CE and highlights its main strengths and limitations. The model can be used to compare any number of public policies affecting diet and physical activity, allowing decision makers to understand how they can maximise population health with limited financial resources."

      "Leishmaniasis caused by obligate intracellular parasites of genus Leishmania is one of the most neglected tropical diseases threatening 350 million people worldwide. Protein kinases have drawn much attention as potential drug targets due to their important role in various cellular processes. In Leishmania sp. mitogen-activated protein kinase 4 is essential for the parasite survival because of its involvement in various regulatory, apoptotic and developmental pathways. The current study reveals the identification of natural inhibitors of L. donovani mitogen-activated protein kinase-4 (LdMPK4). We have performed in silico docking of 110 natural inhibitors of Leishmania parasite that have been reported earlier and identified two compounds Genistein (GEN) and Chrysin (CHY). The homology model of LdMPK4 was developed, followed by binding affinity studies, and pharmacokinetic properties of the inhibitors were calculated by maintaining ATP as a standard molecule. The modelled structure was deposited in the protein model database with PMDB ID: PM0080988. Molecular dynamic simulation of the enzyme-inhibitor complex along with the free energy calculations over 50 ns showed that GEN and CHY are more stable in their binding. These two molecules, GEN and CHY, can be considered as lead molecules for targeting LdMPK4 enzyme and could emerge as potential LdMPK4 inhibitors."

      "Growth issues have been observed in young children with phenylketonuria (PKU), but studies are conflicting. In infancy, there is an increasing trend to introduce a second-stage semi-solid weaning protein substitute (WPS) but there is concern that this may not meet energy requirements. In this longitudinal, prospective study, 20 children with PKU transitioning to a WPS, and 20 non-PKU controls were observed monthly from weaning commencement (4⁻6 months) to 12 m and at 15, 18 and 24 months of age for: weight, length, head circumference, body mass index (BMI), energy and macronutrient intake. Growth parameters were within normal range at all ages in both groups with no significant difference in mean z-scores except for accelerated length in the PKU group. No child with PKU had z-scores < -2 for any growth parameter at age 2 years. Total protein and energy intake in both groups were similar at all ages; however, from 12⁻24 months in the PKU group, the percentage of energy intake from carbohydrate increased (60%) but from fat decreased (25%) and inversely for controls (48% and 36%). In PKU, use of low volume WPS meets Phe-free protein requirements, facilitates transition to solid foods and supports normal growth. Further longitudinal study of growth, body composition and energy/nutrient intakes in early childhood are required to identify any changing trends."

      "BACKGROUND:Physical inactivity contributes substantively to disease burden, especially in highly car dependent countries such as New Zealand (NZ). We aimed to quantify the future health gain, health-sector cost-savings, and change in greenhouse gas emissions that could be achieved by switching short vehicle trips to walking and cycling in New Zealand. METHODS:We used unit-level survey data to estimate changes in physical activity, distance travelled by mode, and air pollution for: (a) switching car trips under 1km to walking and (b) switching car trips under 5km to a mix of walking and cycling. We modelled uptake levels of 25%, 50%, and 100%, and assumed changes in transport behaviour were permanent. We then used multi-state life table modelling to quantify health impacts as quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and changes in health system costs over the rest of the life course of the NZ population alive in 2011 (n = 4.4 million), with 3% discounting. FINDINGS:The modelled scenarios resulted in health gains between 1.61 (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 1.35 to 1.89) and 25.43 (UI 20.20 to 30.58) QALYs/1000 people, with total QALYs up to 112,020 (UI 88,969 to 134,725) over the remaining lifespan. Healthcare cost savings ranged between NZ$127million (UI $101m to 157m) and NZ$2.1billion (UI $1.6b to 2.6b). Greenhouse gas emissions were reduced by up to 194kgCO2e/year, though changes in emissions were not significant under the walking scenario. CONCLUSIONS:Substantial health gains and healthcare cost savings could be achieved by switching short car trips to walking and cycling. Implementing infrastructural improvements and interventions to encourage walking and cycling is likely to be a cost-effective way to improve population health, and may also reduce greenhouse gas emissions."

      "The size increase of a nanoscale material is commonly associated with the increased stability of its ordered phases. Here we give a counterexample to this trend by considering the formation of the defect-free L11 ordered phase in AgPt nanoparticles, and showing that it is better stabilized in small nanoparticles (up to 2.5 nm) than in larger ones, in which the ordered phase breaks in multiple domains or is interrupted by faults. The driving force for the L11 phase formation in small nanoparticles is the segregation of a monolayer silver shell (an Ag-skin) which prevents the element with higher surface energy (Pt) from occupying surface sites. With increasing particle size, the Ag-skin causes internal stress in the L11 domains which cannot thus exceed the critical size of ~2.5 nm. A multiscale modelling approach using full-DFT global optimization calculations and atomistic modelling is used to interpret the findings."

      "OBJECTIVE:Pacific Island countries are experiencing a high burden of diet-related non-communicable diseases; and consumption of fat, sugar and salt are important modifiable risk factors contributing to this. The present study systematically reviewed and summarized available literature on dietary intakes of fat, sugar and salt in the Pacific Islands. DESIGN:Electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect and GlobalHealth) were searched from 2005 to January 2018. Grey literature was also searched and key stakeholders were consulted for additional information. Study eligibility was assessed by two authors and quality was evaluated using a modified tool for assessing dietary intake studies. RESULTS:Thirty-one studies were included, twenty-two contained information on fat, seventeen on sugar and fourteen on salt. Dietary assessment methods varied widely and six different outcome measures for fat, sugar and salt intake - absolute intake, household expenditure, percentage contribution to energy intake, sources, availability and dietary behaviours - were used. Absolute intake of fat ranged from 25·4 g/d in Solomon Islands to 98·9 g/d in Guam, while salt intake ranged from 5·6 g/d in Kiribati to 10·3 g/d in Fiji. Only Guam reported on absolute sugar intake (47·3 g/d). Peer-reviewed research studies used higher-quality dietary assessment methods, while reports from national surveys had better participation rates but mostly utilized indirect methods to quantify intake. CONCLUSIONS:Despite the established and growing crisis of diet-related diseases in the Pacific, there is inadequate evidence about what Pacific Islanders are eating. Pacific Island countries need nutrition monitoring systems to fully understand the changing diets of Pacific Islanders and inform effective policy interventions."

      "PURPOSE:Several tracers have been designed for tracking the abnormal accumulation of tau pathology in vivo. Recently, concerns have been raised about the sources of off-target binding for these tracers; inconclusive data propose binding for some tracers to monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B). METHODS:Molecular docking and dynamics simulations were used to estimate the affinity and free energy for the binding of several tau tracers (FDDNP, THK523, THK5105, THK5317, THK5351, T807 [aka AV-1451, flortaucipir], T808, PBB3, RO-948, MK-6240, JNJ-311 and PI-2620) to MAO-B. These values were then compared with those for safinamide (MAO-B inhibitor). PET imaging was used with the tau tracer [18F]THK5317 and the MAO-B tracer [11C]DED in five patients with Alzheimer's disease to investigate the MAO-B binding component of this first generation tau tracer in vivo. RESULTS:The computational modelling studies identified a binding site for all the tau tracers on MAO-B; this was the same site as that for safinamide. The binding affinity and free energy of binding for the tau tracers to MAO-B was substantial and in a similar range to those for safinamide. The most recently developed tau tracers MK-6240, JNJ-311 and PI-2620 appeared, in silico, to have the lowest relative affinity for MAO-B. The in vivo investigations found that the regional distribution of binding for [18F]THK5317 was different from that for [11C]DED, although areas of suspected off-target [18F]THK5317 binding were detected. The binding relationship between [18F]THK5317 and [11C]DED depended on the availability of the MAO-B enzyme. CONCLUSIONS:The developed tau tracers show in silico and in vivo evidence of cross-interaction with MAO-B; the MAO-B component of the tracer binding was dependent on the regional concentration of the enzyme."

      "The hybrid perovskites are coordination frameworks with the same topology as the inorganic perovskites, but with properties driven by different chemistry, including host-framework hydrogen bonding. Like the inorganic perovskites, these materials exhibit many different phases, including structures with potentially exploitable functionality. However, their phase transformations under pressure are more complex and less well understood. We have studied the structures of manganese and cobalt guanidinium formate under pressure using single-crystal X-ray and powder neutron diffraction. Under pressure, these materials transform to a rhombohedral phase isostructural to cadmium guanidinium formate. This transformation accommodates the reduced cell volume while preserving the perovskite topology of the framework. Using density-functional theory calculations, we show that this behaviour is a consequence of the hydrogen-bonded network of guanidinium ions, which act as struts protecting the metal formate framework against compression within their plane. Our results demonstrate more generally that identifying suitable host-guest hydrogen-bonding geometries may provide a route to engineering hybrid perovskite phases with desirable crystal structures.

      "The accuracy requirements for sensor network positioning have grown over the last few years due to the high precision demanded in activities related with vehicles and robots. Such systems involve a wide range of specifications which must be met through positioning devices based on time measurement. These systems have been traditionally designed with the synchronization of their sensors in order to compute the position estimation. However, this synchronization introduces an error in the time determination which can be avoided through the centralization of the measurements in a single clock in a coordinate sensor. This can be found in typical architectures such as Asynchronous Time Difference of Arrival (A-TDOA) and Difference-Time Difference of Arrival (D-TDOA) systems. In this paper, a study of the suitability of these new systems based on a Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) evaluation was performed for the first time under different 3D real environments for multiple sensor locations. The analysis was carried out through a new heteroscedastic noise variance modelling with a distance-dependent Log-normal path loss propagation model. Results showed that A-TDOA provided less uncertainty in the root mean square error (RMSE) in the positioning, while D-TDOA reduced the standard deviation and increased stability all over the domain."

      "We discuss scientific features and computational performance of kilometre-scale global weather and climate simulations, considering the Icosahedral Non-hydrostatic (ICON) model and the Integrated Forecast System (IFS). Scalability measurements and a performance modelling approach are used to derive performance estimates for these models on upcoming exascale supercomputers. This is complemented by preliminary analyses of the model data that illustrate the importance of high-resolution models to gain improvements in the accuracy of convective processes, a better understanding of physics dynamics interactions and poorly resolved or parametrized processes, such as gravity waves, convection and boundary layer. This article is part of the theme issue 'Multiscale modelling, simulation and computing: from the desktop to the exascale'."

      "In this work, we employed a non-linear programming (NLP) approach via quantitative structure-retention relationships (QSRRs) modelling for prediction of elution order in reversed phase-liquid chromatography. With our rapid and efficient approach, error in prediction of retention time is sacrificed in favor of decreasing the error in elution order. Two case studies were evaluated: (i) analysis of 62 organic molecules on the Supelcosil LC-18 column; and (ii) analysis of 98 synthetic peptides on seven reversed phase-liquid chromatography (RP-LC) columns with varied gradients and column temperatures. On average across all the columns, all the chromatographic conditions and all the case studies, percentage root mean square error (%RMSE) of retention time exhibited a relative increase of 29.13%, while the %RMSE of elution order a relative decrease of 37.29%. Therefore, sacrificing %RMSE(tR) led to a considerable increase in the elution order predictive ability of the QSRR models across all the case studies. Results of our preliminary study show that the real value of the developed NLP-based method lies in its ability to easily obtain better-performing QSRR models that can accurately predict both retention time and elution order, even for complex mixtures, such as proteomics and metabolomics mixtures."

      "The refinement of predicted 3D protein models is crucial in bringing them closer towards experimental accuracy for further computational studies. Refinement approaches can be divided into two main stages: The sampling and scoring stages. Sampling strategies, such as the popular Molecular Dynamics (MD)-based protocols, aim to generate improved 3D models. However, generating 3D models that are closer to the native structure than the initial model remains challenging, as structural deviations from the native basin can be encountered due to force-field inaccuracies. Therefore, different restraint strategies have been applied in order to avoid deviations away from the native structure. For example, the accurate prediction of local errors and/or contacts in the initial models can be used to guide restraints. MD-based protocols, using physics-based force fields and smart restraints, have made significant progress towards a more consistent refinement of 3D models. The scoring stage, including energy functions and Model Quality Assessment Programs (MQAPs) are also used to discriminate near-native conformations from non-native conformations. Nevertheless, there are often very small differences among generated 3D models in refinement pipelines, which makes model discrimination and selection problematic. For this reason, the identification of the most native-like conformations remains a major challenge."

      "The rapidly increasing interest from various verticals for the upcoming 5th generation (5G) networks expect the network to support higher data rates and have an improved quality of service. This demand has been met so far by employing sophisticated transmission techniques including massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO), millimeter wave (mmWave) bands as well as bringing the computational power closer to the users via advanced baseband processing units at the base stations. Future evolution of the networks has also been assumed to open many new business horizons for the operators and the need of not only a resource efficient but also an energy efficient ecosystem has greatly been felt. The deployment of small cells has been envisioned as a promising answer for handling the massive heterogeneous traffic, but the adverse economic and environmental impacts cannot be neglected. Given that 10% of the world's energy consumption is due to the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) industry, energy-efficiency has thus become one of the key performance indicators (KPI). Various avenues of optimization, game theory and machine learning have been investigated for enhancing power allocation for downlink and uplink channels, as well as other energy consumption/saving approaches. This paper surveys the recent works that address energy efficiency of the radio access as well as the core of wireless networks, and outlines related challenges and open issues."

      "We present a detailed study of permalloy (Ni80Fe20) nanostructures with variable shape (disk, cylinder and sphere) for magnetic hyperthermia application, exploiting hysteresis losses for heat release. The study is performed modifying nanostructure aspect ratio and size (up to some hundreds of nanometres), to find the optimal conditions for the maximization of specific heating capabilities. The parameters are also tuned to guarantee negligible magnetic remanence and fulfilment of biophysical limits on applied field amplitude and frequency product, to avoid aggregation phenomena and intolerable resistive heating, respectively. The attention is first focused on disk-shaped nanostructures, with a comparison between micromagnetic simulations and experimental results, obtained on nanodisks still attached on the lithography substrate (2D array form) as well as dispersed in ethanol solution (free-standing). This analysis enables us to investigate the role of magnetostatic interactions between nanodisks and to individuate an optimal concentration for the maximization of heating capabilities. Finally, we study magnetization reversal process and hysteresis properties of nanocylinders (diameter between 150 nm and 600 nm, thickness from 30 nm up to 150 nm) and nanospheres (size between 100 nm and 300 nm), to give instructions on the best combination of geometrical parameters for the design of novel hyperthermia mediators."

      "Socioeconomic deprivation has been linked to food consumption practices, but studies investigating the food environment around schools provide mixed findings. Peer influence and marketing cues are considered important influencers of young people's behaviors. This study used a tribal theory lens to investigate the factors affecting pupils' purchasing and consumption of food/drinks outside schools at lunchtime. A survey was conducted with 243 pupils from seven UK secondary schools of differing socioeconomic status (SES). A purchasing recall questionnaire (PRQ) was developed and administered online at the participating schools to capture food and drink purchasing, intake, and expenditure. No significant differences were found in terms of energy and nutrients consumed or food/drink expenditure between pupils from schools of lower and higher SES. Enjoyment of food shopping with friends was linked with higher food energy intake and spend. Higher susceptibility to peer influence was associated with greater influence from food advertising and endorsements. Without ignoring the impact that SES can have on young people's food choices, we suggest that tribal theory can be additionally used to understand pupils' eating behaviors and we present implications for social marketers and policy makers."

      "We report on numerical modelling of three-dimensional lattice structures designed to provide phononic bandgaps. The examined lattice structures rely on two distinct mechanisms for bandgap formation: the destructive interference of elastic waves and internal resonance. Further to the effect of lattice type on the development of phononic bandgaps, we also present the effect of volume fraction, which enables the designer to control the frequency range over which the bandgaps exist. The bandgaps were identified from dispersion curves obtained using a finite element wave propagation modelling technique that provides high computational efficiency and high wave modelling accuracy. We show that lattice structures employing internal resonance can provide transmissibility reduction of longitudinal waves of up to -103 dB. Paired with the manufacturing freedom and material choice of additive manufacturing, the examined lattice structures can be tailored for use in wide-ranging applications including machine design, isolation and support platforms, metrology frames, aerospace and automobile applications, and biomedical devices."

      "Taste and diet preferences are complex and influenced by both environmental and host traits while affecting both food selection and associated health outcomes. The present study genotyped 94 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in previously reported taste and food intake related genes and assessed associations with taste threshold (TT) and preferred intensity (PT) of sweet, sour and bitter, food preferences, habitual diet intake, and caries status in healthy young Swedish men and women (n = 127). Polymorphisms in the GNAT3, SLC2A4, TAS1R1 and TAS1R2 genes were associated with variation in TT and PT for sweet taste as well as sweet food intake. Increasing PT for sweet was associated with increasing preference and intake of sugary foods. Similarly, increasing TT for sour was associated with increasing intake of sour foods, whereas the associations between food preference/intake and TT/PT for bitter was weak in this study group. Finally, allelic variation in the GNAT3, SLC2A2, SLC2A4, TAS1R1 and TAS1R2 genes was associated with caries status, whereas TT, PT and food preferences were not. It was concluded that variations in taste receptor, glucose transporter and gustducin encoding genes are related to taste perception, food preference and intake as well as the sugar-dependent caries disease."

      "Microalga is a promising biomass feedstock to restore the global carbon balance and produce sustainable bioenergy. However, the present biomass productivity of microalgae is not high enough to be marketable mainly because of the inefficient utilization of solar energy. Here, we study optical engineering strategies to lead to a breakthrough in the biomass productivity and photosynthesis efficiency of a microalgae cultivation system. Our innovative optical system modelling reveals the theoretical potential (>100 g m-2 day-1) of the biomass productivity and it is used to compare the optical aspects of various photobioreactor designs previously proposed. Based on the optical analysis, the optimized V-shaped configuration experimentally demonstrates an enhancement of biomass productivity from 20.7 m-2 day-1 to 52.0 g m-2 day-1, under the solar-simulating illumination of 7.2 kWh m-2 day-1, through the dilution and trapping of incident energy. The importance of quantitative optical study for microalgal photosynthesis is clearly exhibited with practical demonstration of the doubled light utilization efficiencies."

      "The monitoring of small houses and rooms has become possible due to the advances in IoT sensors, actuators and low power communication protocols in the last few years. As buildings are one of the biggest energy consuming entities, monitoring them has great interest for trying to avoid non-necessary energy waste. Moreover, human behaviour has been reported as being the main discrepancy source between energy usage simulations and real usage, so the ability to monitor and predict actions as opening windows, using rooms, etc. is gaining attention to develop stronger models which may lead to reduce the overall energy consumption of buildings, considering buildings thermal inertia and additional capabilities. In this paper, a case study is described in which four meeting rooms have been monitored to obtain information about the usage of the rooms and later use it to predict their future usage. The results show the possibility to deploy a simple and non-intrusive sensing system whose output could be used to develop advanced control strategies."

      "Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) is an attractive therapeutic target for many pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases, cancer as well as chronic pain and inflammatory pathologies. The identification of reversible MAGL inhibitors, devoid of the side effects associated to prolonged MAGL inactivation, is a hot topic in medicinal chemistry. In this study, a novel phenyl(piperazin-1-yl)methanone inhibitor of MAGL was identified through a virtual screening protocol based on a fingerprint-driven consensus docking (CD) approach. Molecular modeling and preliminary structure-based hit optimization studies allowed the discovery of derivative 4, which showed an efficient reversible MAGL inhibition (IC50 = 6.1 µM) and a promising antiproliferative activity on breast and ovarian cancer cell lines (IC50 of 31-72 µM), thus representing a lead for the development of new and more potent reversible MAGL inhibitors. Moreover, the obtained results confirmed the reliability of the fingerprint-driven CD approach herein developed."

      "The Sustainable Energy Development Authority of Malaysia (SEDA) regularly receives complaints about damaged components and distribution boards of PV systems due to lightning strikes. Permanent and momentary interruptions of distribution circuits may also occur from the disturbance. In this paper, a solar PV Rooftop system (3.91 kWp) provided by SEDA was modelled in the PSCAD/EMTDC. The Heidler function was used as a lightning current waveform model to analyse the transient current and voltage at two different points susceptible to the influence of lightning events such as different lightning current wave shape, standard lightning current and non-standard lightning current. This study examines the effect on the system components when lightning directly strikes at two different points of the installation. The two points lie between the inverter and the solar PV array and between inverter and grid. Exceptionally high current and voltage due to the direct lightning strike on a certain point of a PV Rooftop system was also studied. The result of this case study is observed with and without the inclusion of surge protective devices (SPDs). The parameters used were 31 kA of peak current, 10 metres cable length and lightning impulse current wave shape of 8/20μs. The high current and voltage at P1 striking point were 31 kA and 2397 kV, respectively. As for the AC part, the current and voltage values were found to be 5.97 kA and 5392 kV, respectively.Therefore, SPDs with suitable rating provided by SEDA were deployed. Results showed that high transient current voltage is expected to clamp sharply at the values of 1.915 kV and 0 A at the P1 striking point. As for the AC part, the current and voltage values were found to be 0 kA and 0.751 V, respectively. Varying lightning impulse current wave shapes at striking point P2 showed that the highest voltage was obtained at waveshape 10/350 μs at 11277 kV followed by wave shapes of 2/70 μs, 8/20 μs and 0.7/6 μs. The high value of transient voltage was clamped at a lower level of 2.029 kV. Different lightning amplitudes were also applied, ranging from 2-200 kA selected based on the CIGRE distribution. It showed that the current and voltage at P1 and P2 were directly proportional. Therefore, the SPD will be designed at an acceptable rating and proper position of SPD installation at solar PV Rooftop will be proposed. The results obtained in this study can then be utilised to appropriately assign a SPD to protect the PV systems that are connected to the grid. Installing SPDs without considering the needs of lightning protection zones would expose the expensive equipment to potential damage even though the proper energy coordination of SPDs is in place. As such, the simulation results provide a basis for controlling the impacts of direct lightning strikes on electrical equipment and power grids and thus justify SPD coordination to ensure the reliability of the system."

      "The atomic disorder and the vibrational properties of Pd nanocubes have been studied through a combined use of X-ray diffraction and molecular dynamics simulations. The latter show that the trend of the mean square relative displacement as a function of the radius of the coordination shells is characteristic of the nanoparticle shape and can be described by a combined model: A correlated Debye model for the thermal displacement and a parametric expression for the static disorder. This combined model, supplemented by results of line profile analysis of the diffraction patterns collected at different temperatures (100, 200, and 300 K) can explain the observed increase in the Debye-Waller coefficient, and shed light on the effect of the finite domain size and of the atomic disorder on the vibrational properties of metal nanocrystals."

      "A method to improve the brazing between YSZ and Ti6Al4V by femtosecond laser surface machining is introduced. The highest strength of ~150 MPa (which is 95.2% higher than that of the flat YSZ/Ti6Al4V joint) is achieved when the processing speed is 200 μm/s. To understand the strengthen mechanism of the surface machining on the joint strength, image based models, based on the observed microstructure, have been used to probe the stress distribution in the joint. It is found that through surface machining on the ceramic, the residual stress distribution in ceramic becomes nonlinear. Upon shear testing, for the joint with a flat interface, the failure happens in the reaction layer and the out of plane stress in this layer is found to be tensile, which acts as the driving force for the crack generation and propagation. But for the joint with a rumpled interface, the compressive out of plane stress at the boundary of the grooves in the reaction layer could inhibit the propagation of the cracks. Finally, by surface machining on the ceramic, the maximum shear stress in the reaction layer is decreased, which could also help to improve the reliability of the joint."

      "Dietary intervention is a challenge in clinical practice because of inter-individual variability in clinical response. Gut microbiota is mechanistically relevant for a number of disease states and consequently has been incorporated as a key variable in personalised nutrition models within the research context. This paper aims to review the evidence related to the predictive capacity of baseline microbiota for clinical response to dietary intervention in two specific health conditions, namely, obesity and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Clinical trials and larger predictive modelling studies were identified and critically evaluated. The findings reveal inconsistent evidence to support baseline microbiota as an accurate predictor of weight loss or glycaemic response in obesity, or as a predictor of symptom improvement in irritable bowel syndrome, in dietary intervention trials. Despite advancement in quantification methodologies, research in this area remains challenging and larger scale studies are needed until personalised nutrition is realistically achievable and can be translated to clinical practice."

      "Implementation of new energy efficiency measures for the heating and building sectors is of utmost importance. Demand side management offers means to involve individual buildings in the optimization of the heat demand at city level to improve energy efficiency. In this work, two models were applied to forecast the heat demand from individual buildings up to a city-wide area. District heating data at the city level from more than 4000 different buildings was utilized in the validation of the forecast models. Forecast simulations with the applied models and measured data showed that, during the heating season, the relative error of the city level heat demand forecast for 48 h was 4% on average. In individual buildings, the accuracy of the models varied based on the building type and heat demand pattern. The forecasting accuracy, the limited amount of measurement information and the short time required for model calibration enable the models to be applied to the whole building stock. This should enable demand side management and lead to the predictive optimization of heat demand at city level, leading to increased energy efficiency."

      "Texture analysis is an important topic in Ultrasound (US) image analysis for structure segmentation and tissue classification. In this work a novel approach for US image texture feature extraction is presented. It is mainly based on parametrical modelling of a signal version of the US image in order to process it as data resulting from a dynamical process. Because of the predictive characteristics of such a model representation, good estimations of texture features can be obtained with less data than generally used methods require, allowing higher robustness to low Signal-to-Noise ratio and a more localized US image analysis. The usability of the proposed approach was demonstrated by extracting texture features for segmenting the thyroid in US images. The obtained results showed that features corresponding to energy ratios between different modelled texture frequency bands allowed to clearly distinguish between thyroid and non-thyroid texture. A simple k-means clustering algorithm has been used for separating US image patches as belonging to thyroid or not. Segmentation of thyroid was performed in two different datasets obtaining Dice coefficients over 85%."

      "In this work, we developed quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) models for prediction of oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) of flavonoids. Both linear (partial least squares-PLS) and non-linear models (artificial neural networks-ANNs) were built using parameters of two well-established antioxidant activity mechanisms, namely, the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanism defined with the minimum bond dissociation enthalpy, and the sequential proton-loss electron transfer (SPLET) mechanism defined with proton affinity and electron transfer enthalpy. Due to pronounced solvent effects within the ORAC assay, the hydration energy was also considered. The four-parameter PLS-QSAR model yielded relatively high root mean square errors (RMSECV = 0.783, RMSEE = 0.668, RMSEP = 0.900). Conversely, the ANN-QSAR model yielded considerably lower errors (RMSEE = 0.180 ± 0.059, RMSEP1 = 0.164 ± 0.128, and RMSEP2 = 0.151 ± 0.114) due to the inherent non-linear relationships between molecular structures of flavonoids and ORAC values. Five-fold cross-validation was found to be unsuitable for the internal validation of the ANN-QSAR model with a high RMSECV of 0.999 ± 0.253; which is due to limited sample size where resampling with replacement is a considerably better alternative. Chemical domains of applicability were defined for both models confirming their reliability and robustness. Based on the PLS coefficients and partial derivatives, both models were interpreted in terms of the HAT and SPLET mechanisms. Theoretical computations based on density functional theory at ωb97XD/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory were also carried out to further shed light on the plausible mechanism of anti-peroxy radical activity. Calculated energetics for simplified models (genistein and quercetin) with peroxyl radical derived from 2,2'-azobis (2-amidino-propane) dihydrochloride suggested that both SPLET and single electron transfer followed by proton loss (SETPL) mechanisms are competitive and more favorable than HAT in aqueous medium. The finding is in good accord with the ANN-based QSAR modelling results. Finally, the strongly predictive ANN-QSAR model was used to predict antioxidant activities for a series of 115 flavonoids designed combinatorially with flavone as a template. Structural trends were analyzed, and general guidelines for synthesis of new flavonoid derivatives with potentially potent antioxidant activities were given."

      "This study presents a model to calculate the border trap density (Nbt) of atomic layer deposition high-k onto In0.53Ga0.47As on a 300-mm (001) Si substrate. This model considers the quantum confinement effect and band nonparabolicity. Capacitance-equivalent thickness (CET) was used to reflect the distance of the charge centroid from the oxide-semiconductor interface. The border trap values based on CET were found to be approximately 65% lower than the extracted values based on physical thickness in the In0.53Ga0.47As material. In an investigation of two different post-metal annealing effects on border traps, the border trap was more effectively passivated by N2-based forming gas annealing (FGA) compared with rapid thermal annealing (RTA), whereas a lower interface state density was observed in RTA-annealed samples compared with FGA-annealed samples. Nbt extraction at different bias voltages demonstrated that the applied frequencies travel deep into the oxide and interact with more traps as more the Fermi level passes the conduction band, thus creating tunneling with the carriers."

      "The prevailing abiotic stresses, especially heat stress is of great significance on the growth of plants, yield and distribution. In the conditions of heat stress, plants modulate protein processes leading to development of heat tolerance. Of such proteins, the molecular chaperone functions of HSP70/HSC70 proteins are important where their enhanced expression positively correlates with the acquisition of heat tolerance. The key players in the regulation of such tailored protein responses of plants to heat stress are the phytohormones. In the present study, phytohormone mediated interaction of Pennisetum glaucum HSC70 (PgHSC70) protein was performed through docking studies involving sequence analysis, 3D modeling and model evaluation. In silico analysis has shown better interaction and good binding energy of PgHSC70 with the phytohormone brassinolide. Furthermore, the predicted structural information can be helpful for future studies on role of interaction between HSC70 and brassinolide in heat tolerance."

      "The improvement of quality of life in the framework of the smart city paradigm cannot be limited to a set of objective measures carried out over several critical parameters (e.g., noise or air pollution). Noise disturbances depend not only on the equivalent level LAeq measured, but also on the spectral distribution of the sounds perceived by people. Propagation modelling to conduct auralization can be done either with geometrical acoustics or with wave-based methods, given the fact that urban environments are acoustically complex scenarios. In this work, we present a first analysis of the acoustic spectral distribution of street noise, based on the frequency selectivity of the urban outdoor channel and its corresponding coherence bandwidth. The analysis was conducted in the framework of the data collected in the Milan pilotWASN of the DYNAMAP LIFE project, with the use of three simulated acoustic impulse responses. The results show the clear influence of the evaluated coherence bandwidth of each of the simulated channels over real-life acoustic samples, which leads us to the conclusion that all raw acoustic samples have to be considered as wide-band. The results also depict a dependence of accumulated energy at the receiver with the coherence bandwidth of the channel. We conclude that, the higher the delay spread of the channel, the narrower the coherence bandwidth and the higher the distortion suffered by acoustic signals. Moreover, the accumulated energy of the received signal along the frequency axis tends to differ from the accumulated energy of the transmitted signal when facing narrow coherence bandwidth channels; whereas the accumulated energy along the time axis diverges from the accumulated transmitted energy when facing wide coherence bandwidth channels."

      "Desire to accurately predict the deformation behaviour throughout industrial forming processes, such as thermoforming and stretch blow moulding, has led to the development of mathematical models of material behaviour, with the ultimate aim of embedding into forming simulations enabling process and product optimization. Through the use of modern material characterisation techniques, biaxial data obtained at conditions comparable to the thermoforming process was used to calibrate the Buckley material model to the observed non-linear viscoelastic stress/strain behaviour. The material model was modified to account for the inherent anisotropy observed between the principal directions through the inclusion of a Holazapfel-Gasser-Ogden hyperelastic element. Variations in the post-yield drop in stress values associated with deformation rate and specimen temperature below the glass transition were observable, and facilitated in the modified model through time-temperature superposition creating a linear relationship capable of accurately modelling this change in yield stress behaviour. The modelling of the region of observed flow stress noted when above the glass transition temperature was also facilitated through adoption of the same principal. Comparison of the material model prediction was in excellent agreement with experiments at strain rates and temperatures of 1-16 s-1 and 130-155 °C respectively, for equal-biaxial mode of deformation. Temperature dependency of the material model was well replicated with across the broad temperature range in principal directions, at the reference strain rate of 1 s-1. When concerning larger rates of deformation, minimum and maximum average error levels of 6.20% and 10.77% were noted. The formulation, and appropriate characterization, of the modified Buckley material model allows for a stable basis in which future implementation into representative forming simulations of poly-aryl-ether-ketones, poly(ether-ether-ketone) (PEEK) and many other post-yield anisotropic polymers."

      "The behaviour of semiconductor materials and devices subjected to femtosecond laser irradiation has been under scrutiny, for many reasons, during the last decade. In particular, recent works have shown that the specific functionality and/or geometry of semiconductor devices, among which non-volatile memory (NVM) devices hold a special place, could be used to improve the knowledge about ultrafast laser-semiconductor interactions. So far, such an approach has been applied to draw conclusions about the spatio-temporal properties of laser propagation in bulk materials. Here, by comparing the evolution of the electrical characteristics of Flash cells under the cumulative effect of repeated femtosecond laser pulses with first-order physical considerations and TCAD (Technology Computer Aided Design) simulations, we clearly establish the role of the carriers created by nonlinear ionization on the functionality of the structures. The complete electrical analysis informs indirectly on the energy of the laser-produced free-carriers which, to date, was almost inaccessible by an experimental method applicable to the bulk of a material. Establishing the link between the carrier energy and laser parameters is of major importance to improve the comprehension of the nonlinear ionization mechanisms associated to intense laser-semiconductor interactions and applied in various fields from microelectronics to laser micromachining."

      "The roles of organic additives in the assembly and crystallisation of zeolites are still not fully understood. This is important when attempting to prepare novel frameworks to produce new zeolites. We consider 18-crown-6 ether (18C6) as an additive, which has previously been shown to differentiate between the zeolite EMC-2 (EMT) and faujasite (FAU) frameworks. However, it is unclear whether this distinction is dictated by influences on the metastable free-energy landscape or geometric templating. Using high-pressure synchrotron X-ray diffraction, we have observed that the presence of 18C6 does not impact the EMT framework flexibility-agreeing with our previous geometric simulations and suggesting that 18C6 does not behave as a geometric template. This was further studied by computational modelling using solid-state density-functional theory and lattice dynamics calculations. It is shown that the lattice energy of FAU is lower than EMT, but is strongly impacted by the presence of solvent/guest molecules in the framework. Furthermore, the EMT topology possesses a greater vibrational entropy and is stabilised by free energy at a finite temperature. Overall, these findings demonstrate that the role of the 18C6 additive is to influence the free energy of crystallisation to assemble the EMT framework as opposed to FAU."

      "The present study gives an overview of the binding energetics of the homologous heterodimers of cruzipain-chagasin based on the binding energy (ΔGb) prediction obtained with FoldX. This analysis involves a total of 70 homologous models of the cruzipain-chagasin complex which were constructed by homology from the combinatory variation of nine papain-like cysteine peptidase structures and seven cysteine protease inhibitor structures (as chagasin-like and cystatin-like inhibitors). Only 32 systems have been evaluated experimentally, ΔGbexperimental values previously reported. Therefore, the result of the multiple analysis in terms of the thermodynamic parameters, are shown as relative energy |ΔΔG| = |ΔGbfrom FoldX - ΔGbexperimental|. Nine models were identified that recorded |ΔΔG| < 1.3, five models to 2.8 > |ΔΔG| > 1.3 and the other 18 models, values of |ΔΔG| > 2.8. The energetic analysis of the contribution of ΔH and ΔS to ΔGb to the 14-molecular model presents a ΔGb mostly ΔH-driven at neutral pH and at an ionic strength (I) of 0.15 M. The dependence of ΔGb(I,pH) at 298 K to the cruzipain-chagasin complex predicts a linear dependence of ΔGb(I). The computational protocol allowed the identification and prediction of thermodynamics binding energy parameters for cruzipain-chagasin-like heterodimers."

      "The aluminium matrix composites (AMCs) have become a tough competitor for various categories of metallic alloys, especially ferrous materials, owing to their tremendous servicing in the diversified application. In this work, additional efforts have been made to formulate a mathematical model, by using dimensionless analysis, able to predict the mechanical characteristics of the AMCs that have already been optimized and characterized by the authors. Here, the experimental and statistical data obtained from the Taguchi L18 orthogonal array and analysis of variance (ANOVA) have been used. They permit collection of the output responses and allow the identification of significant process parameters, respectively, which thereafter were used to design the mathematical model. Second order polynomial equations have been obtained from the specific output response and the relevant input parameter were incorporated with the highest level of contribution. The obtained quadratic equations indicate the regression values (R2) equal to unity, hence, proving the performances of the fit. The results demonstrate that the developed mathematical models present very high accuracy for predicting the output responses."

      "Recently, High Mobility Group Box1 (HMGB1) protein has been reported as an inflammatory cytokine present in all nucleated cells with crucial role in the genesis and promotion of cancer. No HMGB1 protein mice model and its active site details are available to validate mice in vivo experiments. Here, for the first time we have reported in silico mice HMGB1 model using human HMGB1 template. Prepared HMGB1 secondary structure showed 6-α helices, 5-β turns, 2-γ turns with 67% α-helices, 32% coil and 9% turn without β-sheet, and classified as α-class protein. Ramachandran plot analysis showed 98.2% and 92.3% residues lies in favoured region, verified by RAMPAGE and PDBsum server respectively. Cancer atlas of HMGB1 protein showed up-regulated expression of HMGB1 gene in different cancer, proved by CAB (CAB005873) and HPA-antibody (HPA003506) in silico. HMGB1 protein showed interaction with different biologically important inflammatory protein as depicted in STRING result.Prominent active site has residues Tyr78Ile79Pro80-81Lys82Gly83vGlu84Thr85Lys86-88Phe89Lys90Asp91Pro92Asn93Tyr162Lys165 with 310 Å3 site volume.Interacting residues of CGA-HMGB1 docked complex were ILE79PRO80-81LYS82GLY83GLU84LYS86-88PHE89Arg163Ala164LYS165Gly166 with docking score 3872 and surface area 412.6. CGA-conformer C3950 showed best docking than CGA and conformer-ZINC03947476, iso-chlorogenic acid and cischlorogenic acid. HMGB1 mice model could be a good therapeutic target for anti-cancerous drugs."

      "In this position paper, we discuss two relevant topics: (i) generic multiscale computing on emerging exascale high-performing computing environments, and (ii) the scaling of such applications towards the exascale. We will introduce the different phases when developing a multiscale model and simulating it on available computing infrastructure, and argue that we could rely on it both on the conceptual modelling level and also when actually executing the multiscale simulation, and maybe should further develop generic frameworks and software tools to facilitate multiscale computing. Next, we focus on simulating multiscale models on high-end computing resources in the face of emerging exascale performance levels. We will argue that although applications could scale to exascale performance relying on weak scaling and maybe even on strong scaling, there are also clear arguments that such scaling may no longer apply for many applications on these emerging exascale machines and that we need to resort to what we would call multi-scaling. This article is part of the theme issue 'Multiscale modelling, simulation and computing: from the desktop to the exascale'."

      "Nanomaterial-based sensors with high sensitivity, fast response and recovery time, large detection range, and high chemical stability are in immense demand for the detection of hazardous gas molecules. Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) which have exceptional electrical, physical, and chemical properties can fulfil all of these requirements. The detection of gas molecules using gas sensors, particularly in medical diagnostics and safety applications, is receiving particularly high demand. GNRs exhibit remarkable changes in their electrical characteristics when exposed to different gases through molecular adsorption. In this paper, the adsorption effects of the target gas molecules (CO and NO) on the electrical properties of the armchair graphene nanoribbon (AGNR)-based sensor are analytically modelled. Thus, the energy dispersion relation of AGNR is developed considering the molecular adsorption effect using a tight binding (TB) method. The carrier velocity is calculated based on the density of states (DOS) and carrier concentration (n) to obtain I-V characteristics and to monitor its variation in the presence of the gas molecules. Furthermore, the I-V characteristics and energy band structure of the AGNR sensor are simulated using first principle calculations to investigate the gas adsorption effects on these properties. To ensure the accuracy of the proposed model, the I-V characteristics of the AGNR sensor that are simulated based both on the proposed model and first principles calculations are compared, and an acceptable agreement is achieved."

      "This paper presents a physically valid quasi-ballistic drain current model applicable for nanoscale symmetric Double Gate (SDG) MOSFETs. The proposed drain current model includes both diffusive and ballistic transport phenomena. The model considers the important positional carrier scattering dependency effect near the source region described in terms of transmission and reflection co-efficients related to the scattering theory. The significance of carrier transport near the bottleneck source region is illustrated where the carriers diffuse into the channel at a relatively lower velocity before accelerating ballistically. The results obtained demonstrate carrier scattering dependency at the critical layer defined near the low field source region on the drain current characteristics. The proposed model partly evolves from Natori's ballistic bulk MOSFET model that is modified accordingly to be valid for a symmetric Double Gate MOSFET in the nanoscale regime. Carrier degeneracy and Fermi-Dirac statistics are included in the work so as to justify the complete physicality of the model. The model is further extended and is shown to be continuous in terms of terminal charges and capacitances in all regions of operation. A comparative analysis is also done between the proposed quasi-ballistic model and a hypothetical complete ballistic device."

      "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES:It is not known if diets lower in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are also healthier. We evaluated the population health implications of changing to more sustainable diets in the UK, France, Finland, Italy and Sweden. SUBJECTS/METHODS:We developed a life table model to simulate mortality and morbidity from diet-related diseases over the lifetime of the current population. Populating the model with locally available data for each country, we simulated the impact of country-specific dietary scenarios that had been optimised to meet dietary recommendations and reduce GHG emissions. Outcome measures included a change in disease-specific deaths, life expectancy and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). RESULTS:Diets that meet nutritional recommendations lead to substantial improvements in population health, ranging from 0.19 (95% uncertainty interval: 0.18-0.21) DALYs per person in Italy up to 0.89 (0.80-0.98) DALYs per person in Finland. Simultaneously reducing GHG emissions does not reduce the size of this impact, and in some cases produces additional health benefits. If sustainable diets can be maintained throughout adulthood, life expectancy would increase by between 2.3 (1.6-3.2) and 6.8 (5.5-8.5) months by country. However, results are sensitive to assumptions about how quickly changes in diet can influence disease, and future trends in disease. CONCLUSIONS:Modelling the health impact of diets that are both nutritional and low in GHG emissions shows the potential for significant co-benefits in health and sustainability from dietary changes. Future work is needed to find effective interventions to deliver healthy sustainable diets."

      "Coherent thermal emission deviates from the Planckian blackbody emission with a narrow spectrum and strong directionality. While far-field thermal emission from polaritonic resonance has shown the deviation through modelling and optical characterizations, an approach to achieve and directly measure dominant coherent thermal emission has not materialised. By exploiting the large disparity in the skin depth and wavelength of surface phonon polaritons, we design anisotropic SiO2 nanoribbons to enable independent control of the incoherent and coherent behaviours, which exhibit over 8.5-fold enhancement in the emissivity compared with the thin-film limit. Importantly, this enhancement is attributed to the coherent polaritonic resonant effect, hence, was found to be stronger at lower temperature. A thermometry platform is devised to extract, for the first time, the thermal emissivity from such dielectric nanoemitters with nanowatt-level emitting power. The result provides new insight into the realisation of spatial and spectral distribution control for far-field thermal emission."

However, it is notoriously difficult to achieve in a controlled, steady-state fashion. The most promising path is via magnetic confinement in a device called a tokamak. A magnetic confinement fusion (MCF) power plant requires many different science, technology and engineering challenges to be met simultaneously. This requires an integrated approach from the outset; advances are needed in individual areas but these only bring fusion electricity closer if the other challenges are resolved in harmony. The UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) has developed a wide range of skills to address many of the challenges and hosts the JET device, presently the only MCF facility capable of operating with both the fusion fuels, deuterium and tritium. Recently, several major new UKAEA facilities have been funded and some have started operation, notably a new spherical tokamak (MAST Upgrade), a major robotics facility (RACE), and a materials research facility (MRF). Most recently, work has started on Hydrogen-3 Advanced Technology (H3AT) for tritium technology and a group of Fusion Technology Facilities. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Fusion energy using tokamaks: can development be accelerated?'"

      "The energetics of the defect chemistry and processes in semiconducting alloys is both technologically and theoretically significant. This is because defects in semiconductors are critical to tune their electronic properties. These processes are less well understood in random semiconductor alloys such as silicon germanium as compared to elementary semiconductors (for example silicon). To model the random silicon germanium alloy we have employed density functional theory calculations in conjunction with the special quasirandom structures model for different compositions. Here we show that, the energetics of substitutional phosphorous-vacancy pairs (E-centres) in Si1-xGex alloys vary greatly with respect to the local Ge concentration and the composition of the alloy. The most energetically favourable E-centres have a Ge atom as a nearest neighbour, whereas the dependence of the binding energy of the E-centres with respect to alloy composition is non-linear."

      "Decision makers are responsible for directing staffing, logistics, selecting public health interventions, communicating to professionals and the public, planning future response needs, and establishing strategic and tactical priorities along with their funding requirements. Decision makers need to rapidly synthesize data from different experts across multiple disciplines, bridge data gaps and translate epidemiological analysis into an operational set of decisions for disease control. Analytic approaches can be defined for specific response phases: investigation, scale-up and control. These approaches include: improved applications of quantitative methods to generate insightful epidemiological descriptions of outbreaks; robust investigations of causal agents and risk factors; tools to assess response needs; identifying and monitoring optimal interventions or combinations of interventions; and forecasting for response planning. Data science and quantitative approaches can improve decision-making in outbreak response. To realize these benefits, we need to develop a structured approach that will improve the quality and timeliness of data collected during outbreaks, establish analytic teams within the response structure and define a research agenda for data analytics in outbreak response. This article is part of the theme issue 'Modelling infectious disease outbreaks in humans, animals and plants: epidemic forecasting and control'. This theme issue is linked with the earlier issue 'Modelling infectious disease outbreaks in humans, animals and plants: approaches and important themes'."

      "Macro Fibre Composites (MFC) are very effective piezoelectric transducers that, among others, can be used as elements of energy harvesting systems. The possibility to generate electric energy, for example, from mechanical vibrations in order to power electrical elements that could not be powered in another way (using wires or batteries) is a great solution. However, such a kind of systems has to be designed by considering all phenomena that could occur during the exploitation of the system. One of those phenomena is the temperature fluctuation during the device operation. In the presented research work, a mathematical model of the energy harvesting system based on MFC transducers is proposed. The mathematical model was validated by laboratory tests conducted on a laboratory stand equipped with a universal mechanical testing machine (Instron Electropuls 10000) and a thermal chamber. During the tests, the samples were subjected to cyclic excitation simulating the operation of the system in various environmental conditions by forcing changes in the system operation temperature with the constant conditions of its excitation."

      "Quantitative modelling is commonly used to assist the policy dimension of sustainability problems. Validation is an important step to make models credible and useful. To investigate existing validation viewpoints and approaches, we analyse a broad academic literature and conduct a survey among practitioners. We find that empirical data plays an important role in the validation practice in all main areas of sustainability science. Qualitative and participatory approaches that can enhance usefulness and public reliability are much less visible. Data-oriented validation is prevalent even when models are used for scenario exploration. Usefulness regarding a given task is more important for model developers than for users. As the experience of modellers and users increases, they tend to better acknowledge the decision makers' demand for clear communication of assumptions and uncertainties. These findings provide a reflection on current validation practices and are expected to facilitate communication at the modelling and decision-making interface."

      "Hematite (α-Fe2O3) is the most studied artificial oxygen-evolving photo-anode and yet its efficiency limitations and their origin remain unknown. A sub-picosecond reorganisation of the hematite structure has been proposed as the mechanism which dictates carrier lifetimes, energetics and the ultimate conversion yields. However, the importance of this reorganisation for actual device performance is unclear. Here we report an in situ observation of charge carrier self-localisation in a hematite device, and demonstrate that this process affects recombination losses in photoelectrochemical cells. We apply an ultrafast, device-based optical-control method to resolve the subpicosecond formation of small polarons and estimate their reorganisation energy to be ~0.5 eV. Coherent oscillations in the photocurrent signals indicate that polaron formation may be coupled to specific phonon modes (<100 cm-1). Our results bring together spectroscopic and device characterisation approaches to reveal new photophysics of broadly-studied hematite devices."

      "The use of natural cellulosic fibers as materials in the reinforcements of polymer composites and sorption of oil from water, has directed more focus on acetylation than other known chemical modification methods. Cellulose can be modified by acetylation to provide a suitable and cost effective cellulose acetate which have high hydrophobic characteristics and are biodegradable. In this study, lignocellulosic samples-oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB), pride of Barbados pods (POBP) and cocoa pods (CP)-with different compositions of lignin and hemicellulose, were acetylated using solvent free method. Effect of temperature on the acetylation of these samples at different reaction times were studied and used for the thermodynamic studies. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test the significance of temperature variation with weight percent gain (WPG) due to acetylation of the lignocellulosics at different reaction times. FTIR studies showed evidence of successful acetylation reaction. ANOVA test showed no statistical difference in the observed variation of WPG due to acetylation of all the lignocellulosic samples, with temperature at different reaction times. The best acetylating period for OPEFB, POBP and CP were 60, 30 and 90 min respectively. Acetylation of the lignocellulosic samples were found to occur by absorbing heat from the environment. Values of entropy changes were positive while Gibb's free energy change values were negative except at operating temperature of 303 K. Thus, acetylation of these lignocellulosic samples were spontaneous except at 303 K. Acetylated POBP has the lowest heat capacity (0.82 kJ mol-1 K-1) compared to acetylated OPEFB (1.47 kJ mol-1 K-1) and CP (1.15 kJ mol-1 K-1). Low critical WPG showed that the mechanism of acetylating these materials were diffusion controlled. The critical temperatures of OPEFB, POBP and CP acetylation were found to be 282.6 K, 223.2 K and 260.5 K respectively. Thus, acetylation of these lignocellulosic samples were successful and found to be energy efficient."

      "This study explores the effect of slum rehabilitation on appliance ownership and its implications on residential electricity demand. The low-income scenario makes it unique because the entire proposition is based on the importance of non-income drivers of appliance ownership that includes effects of changing the built environment (BE), household practices (HP) and appliances characteristics (AC). This study demonstrates quantitatively that non-income factors around energy practices influence appliance ownership, and therefore electricity consumption. The methodology consists of questionnaire design across the dimension of BE, HP and AC based on social practice theory, surveying of 1224 households and empirical analysis using covariance-based structural equation modelling. Results show that higher appliance ownership in the slum rehabilitation housing is due to change in household practice, built environment and affordability criteria of the appliances. Change in HP shifts necessary activities like cooking, washing and cleaning from outdoor to indoor spaces that positively and significantly influences higher appliance ownership. Poor BE conditions about indoor air quality, thermal comfort and hygiene; and product cost, discounts and ease of use of the appliances also triggers higher appliance ownership. The findings of this study can aid in designing better regulatory and energy efficiency policies for low-income settlements."

      "Halving per capita food waste and reducing food losses along production and supply chains is one of the objectives fixed by the United Nations among the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This study employs a system-wide modelling approach, to simulate economic impacts of households' food waste reduction in 2030, focusing on the European Union. The paper provides market, food security, biophysical and environmental indicators resulting from food commodity specific waste reductions by EU households. The scenarios explicitly account for associated costs paid by food manufacturers derived from adjustments in the packaging, labelling and logistics. The model shows, under a series of market assumptions, a possible increase in household savings, a fall in agri-food production and a minor negative macroeconomic impact due to household food waste reductions. On the other hand, the effects on environmental indicators such as land usage, GHG emissions and water abstraction are positive. Future research on several aspects of the food waste topic is needed to better integrate all economic aspects."

      "Spontaneous spatial organization behavior and the aggregate morphology of polystyrene-block-polyisoprene (PS-b-PI) copolymer were investigated. Molecular dynamic (MD) and mesoscopic simulations using the dynamic of mean field density functional theory (DDF) were adopted to investigate the morphology changes exhibited by this block copolymer (BCP). In the mesoscopic simulations, several atoms in repeating units were grouped together into a bead representing styrene or isoprene segments as a coarse-grained model. Inter-bead interactions and essential parameters for mesoscopic models were optimized from MD simulations. Study indicated that morphology alternations can be induced in this system at annealing temperature of 393, 493, and 533 K. From our simulations, lamellar, bicontinuous, and hexagonally packed cylindrical equilibrium morphologies were achieved. Our simulated morphologies agree well with the reported experimental evidence at the selected temperature. The process of aggregate formation and morphology evolution were concretely clarified."

      "A large library of fibrate-based N-acylsulphonamides was designed, synthesised, and fully characterised in order to propose them as zinc binders for the inhibition of human carbonic anhydrase (hCA) enzymatic activity. Synthesised compounds were tested against four hCAs (I, II, IX, and XII) revealing a promising submicromolar inhibitory activity characterised by an isozyme selectivity pattern. Structural modifications explored within this scaffold are: presence of an aryl ring on the sulphonamide, p-substitution of this aryl ring, benzothiazole or benzophenone as core nuclei, and an n-propyl chain or a geminal dimethyl at Cα carbon. Biological results fitted well with molecular modelling analyses, revealing a putative direct interaction with the zinc ion in the active site of hCA I, II and IX. These findings supported the exploration of less investigated secondary sulphonamides as potential hCA inhibitors."

      "Developmental system drift is a likely mechanism for the origin of hybrid incompatibilities between closely related species. We examine here the detailed mechanistic basis of hybrid incompatibilities between two allopatric lineages, for a genotype-phenotype map of developmental system drift under stabilising selection, where an organismal phenotype is conserved, but the underlying molecular phenotypes and genotype can drift. This leads to number of emergent phenomenon not obtainable by modelling genotype or phenotype alone. Our results show that: 1) speciation is more rapid at smaller population sizes with a characteristic, Orr-like, power law, but at large population sizes slow, characterised by a sub-diffusive growth law; 2) the molecular phenotypes under weakest selection contribute to the earliest incompatibilities; and 3) pair-wise incompatibilities dominate over higher order, contrary to previous predictions that the latter should dominate. The population size effect we find is consistent with previous results on allopatric divergence of transcription factor-DNA binding, where smaller populations have common ancestors with a larger drift load because genetic drift favours phenotypes which have a larger number of genotypes (higher sequence entropy) over more fit phenotypes which have far fewer genotypes; this means less substitutions are required in either lineage before incompatibilities arise. Overall, our results indicate that biophysics and population size provide a much stronger constraint to speciation than suggested by previous models, and point to a general mechanistic principle of how incompatibilities arise the under stabilising selection for an organismal phenotype."

      "The transcription factor p53 plays pivotal roles in numerous biological processes, including the suppression of tumours. The rich availability of biophysical data aimed at understanding its structure-function relationships since the 1990s has enabled the application of a variety of computational modelling techniques towards the establishment of mechanistic models. Together they have provided deep insights into the structure, mechanics, energetics, and dynamics of p53. In parallel, the observation that mutations in p53 or changes in its associated pathways characterize several human cancers has resulted in a race to develop therapeutic modulators of p53, some of which have entered clinical trials. This review describes how computational modelling has played key roles in understanding structural-dynamic aspects of p53, formulating hypotheses about domains that are beyond current experimental investigations, and the development of therapeutic molecules that target the p53 pathway."

      "DNA condensation and phase separation is of utmost importance for DNA packing in vivo with important applications in medicine, biotechnology and polymer physics. The presence of hexagonally ordered DNA is observed in virus capsids, sperm heads and in dinoflagellates. Rigorous modelling of this process in all-atom MD simulations is presently difficult to achieve due to size and time scale limitations. We used a hierarchical approach for systematic multiscale coarse-grained (CG) simulations of DNA phase separation induced by the three-valent cobalt(III)-hexammine (CoHex3+). Solvent-mediated effective potentials for a CG model of DNA were extracted from all-atom MD simulations. Simulations of several hundred 100-bp-long CG DNA oligonucleotides in the presence of explicit CoHex3+ ions demonstrated aggregation to a liquid crystalline hexagonally ordered phase. Following further coarse-graining and extraction of effective potentials, we conducted modelling at mesoscale level. In agreement with electron microscopy observations, simulations of an 10.2-kb-long DNA molecule showed phase separation to either a toroid or a fibre with distinct hexagonal DNA packing. The mechanism of toroid formation is analysed in detail. The approach used here is based only on the underlying all-atom force field and uses no adjustable parameters and may be generalised to modelling chromatin up to chromosome size."

      "In this study, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is applied to investigate the electron beam effects on the X-pinch produced K-shell Aluminum plasma. The radiating plasma is produced by the explosion of two 25-μm Al wires on a compact L-C (40 kV, 200 kA and 200 ns) generator, and the time integrated spectra are recorded using de Broglie spectrographs. The ion and electron oscillations of K-shell Al plasma are extracted using LDA of spectral database of non-LTE K-shell Al model. A three dimensional representation of LDA shows that the presence of electron beam exhibits outward spirals of Langmuir turbulence and the center region of the spirals recieves lower electron temperatures of 50-100 eV. These spirals then are modeled by logistic growth of predator-prey model. This modeling suggests that the ions (LD1: most dominant eigenvector of LDA) and electrons (LD2: second most dominant eigenvector of LDA) represent the predators and preys, respectively. Besides, addition of electron beams transforms evanescent oscillations to the standing ones."

      "In this work, a 200 μm diameter InGaP (GaInP) p+-i-n+ mesa photodiode was studied across the temperature range 100 °C to 20 °C for the development of a temperature-tolerant electron spectrometer. The depletion layer thickness of the InGaP device was 5 μm. The performance of the InGaP detector was analysed under dark conditions and then under the illumination of a 183 MBq 63Ni radioisotope beta particle source. The InGaP photodiode was connected to a custom-made low-noise charge-sensitive preamplifier to realise a particle counting electron spectrometer. Beta spectra were collected at temperatures up to 100 °C with the InGaP device reverse biased at 5 V. The spectrum accumulated at 20 °C was compared with the spectrum predicted using Monte Carlo simulations; good agreement was found between the predicted and experimental spectra. The work is of importance for the development of electron spectrometers that can be used for planetary and space science missions to environments of high temperature or extreme radiation (e.g. Mercury, Jupiter's moon Europa, near-Sun comets), as well as terrestrial applications."

      "Global population growth and urbanization necessitate countless more buildings in this century, causing an unprecedented increase in energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, waste generation and resource use. It is imperative to achieve maximal efficiency in buildings quickly. The building envelope is a key element to address environmental concerns, as it is responsible for thermal transfers to the outdoors, causing energy demand and carbon emissions. It also requires cladding, thus consuming a significant amount of finite resources. This paper investigates the relationship between surface area and indoor space to unravel the sustainability of building forms. Firstly, we demonstrate what the optimal form is. Secondly, as a single definite form is of little use in practice, we develop a scale-independent metric to measure the degree of optimality of building forms and show its practical use. This newly developed metric can significantly help in early design stages, by quantifying how much a building form deviates from optimality and identifying the domain of alternative geometries to bring us closer to it. This compactness measure also represents a theoretical basis for further research, to explore how optimality changes when additional parameters are factored in. It therefore contributes to both theory and practice to support global efforts towards sustainable built environments."

      "Calmodulin is a calcium binding protein with two lobes, N-lobe and C-lobe, which evolved from duplication and fusion of a single precursor lobe of a pair of EF-hand. These two lobes of calmodulin show subtle differences in calcium binding and target recognition; these are important for the functions of calmodulin. Since the structures, especially main chain conformations, of two EF-lobes in holo-form are quite similar; this is a good example to evaluate the effect of side chains for structural dynamics. We analyzed the structure of calmodulin using molecular dynamics and found differences in conformational ensembles between N- and C-lobes. We also showed the mutant structures created by homology modeling could reproduce the difference of dynamic motion between N- and C-lobes."

      "BACKGROUND:sustainability of population diet is a public health concern: the high price of healthy food is one of the main causes of diet-related health problems. The aim of this study is to synthesize the evidence produced by systematic reviews that evaluated the effectiveness of decreasing healthy food prices to improve accessibility in order to positively modify the dietary pattern. METHODS:We carried out a review of systematic reviews that examined the effects of the interventions, by exploring the online databases PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and hand-searching the reference lists. RESULTS:after screening by titles and abstracts, we selected 11 systematic reviews that met the inclusion criteria, plus one that was hand-searched. The review generally presented a good quality. Studies concluded that measures aimed at modifying the prices of targeted healthy food were effective in improving population diet by modifying what people buy. CONCLUSIONS:the complexity of the outcome-population diet-as well as the poor transferability of data across populations and geographical areas makes it obligatory to provide clear and universal conclusions. Nonetheless, this should not stop policymakers from adapting them and resorting to food fiscal interventions to improve people's diet and health."

      "The selection of optimal enzyme concentration in multienzyme cascade reactions for the highest product yield in practice is very expensive and time-consuming process. The modelling of biological pathways is a difficult process because of the complexity of the system. The mathematical modelling of the system using an analytical approach depends on the many parameters of enzymes which rely on tedious and expensive experiments. The artificial neural network (ANN) method has been successively applied in different fields of science to perform complex functions. In this study, ANN models were trained to predict the flux for the upper part of glycolysis as inferred by NADH consumption, using four enzyme concentrations i.e., phosphoglucoisomerase, phosphofructokinase, fructose-bisphosphate-aldolase, triose-phosphate-isomerase. Out of three ANN algorithms, the neuralnet package with two activation functions, \"logistic\" and \"tanh\" were implemented. The prediction of the flux was very efficient: RMSE and R2 were 0.847, 0.93 and 0.804, 0.94 respectively for logistic and tanh functions using a cross validation procedure. This study showed that a systemic approach such as ANN could be used for accurate prediction of the flux through the metabolic pathway. This could help to save a lot of time and costs, particularly from an industrial perspective. The R-code is available at: https://github.com/DSIMB/ANN-Glycolysis-Flux-Prediction."

      "Adenovirus based vectors are of increasing importance for wide ranging therapeutic applications. As vaccines, vectors derived from human adenovirus species D serotypes 26 and 48 (HAdV-D26/48) are demonstrating promising efficacy as protective platforms against infectious diseases. Significant clinical progress has been made, yet definitive studies underpinning mechanisms of entry, infection, and receptor usage are currently lacking. Here, we perform structural and biological analysis of the receptor binding fiber-knob protein of HAdV-D26/48, reporting crystal structures, and modelling putative interactions with two previously suggested attachment receptors, CD46 and Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor (CAR). We provide evidence of a low affinity interaction with CAR, with modelling suggesting affinity is attenuated through extended, semi-flexible loop structures, providing steric hindrance. Conversely, in silico and in vitro experiments are unable to provide evidence of interaction between HAdV-D26/48 fiber-knob with CD46, or with Desmoglein 2. Our findings provide insight into the cell-virus interactions of HAdV-D26/48, with important implications for the design and engineering of optimised Ad-based therapeutics."

      "Pipelines are widely used for the transportation of hydrocarbon fluids over millions of miles all over the world. The structures of the pipelines are designed to withstand several environmental loading conditions to ensure safe and reliable distribution from point of production to the shore or distribution depot. However, leaks in pipeline networks are one of the major causes of innumerable losses in pipeline operators and nature. Incidents of pipeline failure can result in serious ecological disasters, human casualties and financial loss. In order to avoid such menace and maintain safe and reliable pipeline infrastructure, substantial research efforts have been devoted to implementing pipeline leak detection and localisation using different approaches. This paper discusses pipeline leakage detection technologies and summarises the state-of-the-art achievements. Different leakage detection and localisation in pipeline systems are reviewed and their strengths and weaknesses are highlighted. Comparative performance analysis is performed to provide a guide in determining which leak detection method is appropriate for particular operating settings. In addition, research gaps and open issues for development of reliable pipeline leakage detection systems are discussed."

      "The selective attention for identification model (SAIM) is an established model of selective visual attention. SAIM implements translation-invariant object recognition, in scenes with multiple objects, using the parallel distributed processing (PDP) paradigm. Here, we show that SAIM can be formulated as Bayesian inference. Crucially, SAIM uses excitatory feedback to combine top-down information (i.e. object knowledge) with bottom-up sensory information. By contrast, predictive coding implementations of Bayesian inference use inhibitory feedback. By formulating SAIM as a predictive coding scheme, we created a new version of SAIM that uses inhibitory feedback. Simulation studies showed that both types of architectures can reproduce the response time costs induced by multiple objects-as found in visual search experiments. However, due to the different nature of the feedback, the two SAIM schemes make distinct predictions about the motifs of microcircuits mediating the effects of top-down afferents. We discuss empirical (neuroimaging) methods to test the predictions of the two inference architectures."

      "BACKGROUND:Photothermal therapy is a local treatment method for cancer and the heat energy generated from it could destroy the tumor cells. This study is aimed to investigate the temperature distribution in tumor tissue and surrounding health tissue of tumor bearing mice applying mathematical simulation model. Tumor bearing mice treated by laser combined with or without indocyanine green. Monte Carlo method and the Pennes bio-heat equation were used to calculate the light distribution and heat energy. COMSOL Multiphysic was adopted to construct three dimensional temperature distribution model. RESULTS:This study revealed that the data calculated by simulation model is in good agreement with the surface temperature monitored by infrared thermometer. Effected by the optical parameters and boundary conditions of tissue, the highest temperature of tissue treated by laser combined with indocyanine green was about 65 °C which located in tumor tissue and the highest temperature of tissue treated by laser was about 43 °C which located under the tumor tissue. The temperature difference was about 20 °C. Temperature distribution in tissue was not uniform. The temperature difference in different parts of tumor tissue raised up to 15 °C. The temperature of tumor tissue treated by laser combined with indocyanine green was about 20 °C higher than that of the surrounding healthy tissue. CONCLUSIONS:Reasonably good matching between the calculated temperature and the measured temperature was achieved, thus demonstrated great utility of our modeling method and approaches for deepening understand in the temperature distribution in tumor tissue and surrounding healthy tissue during the laser combined with photosensitizer. The simulation model could provide guidance and reference function for the effect of photothermal therapy."

      "Parents are an ideal target to reduce children's unhealthy food intake. Motivation is one component of behavior change; however, there is a paucity of research exploring parental motivation in unhealthy food provision. This study aimed to understand the relationships between, and relative importance of, constructs of parents' reflective motivation and children's intake of unhealthy foods. An online survey captured parent-rated reflective motivation constructs based on the health action process approach (HAPA) model, and children's intake of unhealthy food using the short food survey. The HAPA model includes constructs of self-efficacy, risk perception, outcome expectancies, intention, and planning. Structural equation modelling was used to examine relationships between constructs and the HAPA model in its structural form. Four-hundred and ninety-five parents of three to seven-year olds completed the study. Model fit statistics (X2 = 210.03, df = 83, p < 0.001; Comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.96; Tucker Lewis index (TLI) = 0.94) supported suitability of the HAPA model. The HAPA model explained 9.2% of the variance in children's unhealthy food intake. Constructs of self-efficacy (action to maintenance β = 0.69; maintenance to recovery β = 0.70; maintenance to planning β = 0.82) were found to be the most important constructs for reducing children's unhealthy food intake, followed by planning (to unhealthy food intake β = -0.32) and intention (to planning β = 0.21). This study provides an initial insight into parental motivation and identifies primary intervention targets to enhance parental motivation to reduce unhealthy food provision, and subsequently children's unhealthy food intake."

      "Purpose:Computational modelling may improve the fundamental understanding of various mechanisms of diseases more particularly related to clinical challenges. In this study the effect of remodeling infarct presence in the left ventricle on the interventricular septal wall is studied using the finite element methods. Methods:In this study, two rat heart (one model with healthy myocardium and one model with remodeling free wall and healthy septal wall) with magnetic resonance imaging data was gathered to reconstruct three-dimensional (3D) rat heart models. 3D data points from Segment® were imported into SolidEdge® for creation of 3D rat heart models. Abaqus® was used for finite element modeling. Results:The strain in the healthy interventricular septum of the infarcted left ventricle wall increased when compared to the healthy interventricular septum in the healthy left ventricle. Similarly, the average stress in the healthy left ventricle was observed to have increased on the healthy the interventricular septum where the free wall is subjected to remodeling infarct. When comparing the infarcted models to the healthy model, it was found that the average strain had greatly increased by up to 50.0 %. Conclusions:The remodeling infarct in the left ventricle has an impact on the healthy interventricular septal wall. Even though the interventricular septal wall was modelled as healthy, it was observed that it has undergone considerable changes in stresses and strains in circumferential and longitudinal direction. The observed changes in myocardial stresses and strains may result in poor global functioning of the heart."

      "The dynamics of the cellular proportion of mutant mtDNA molecules is crucial for mitochondrial diseases. Cellular populations of mitochondria are under homeostatic control, but the details of the control mechanisms involved remain elusive. Here, we use stochastic modelling to derive general results for the impact of cellular control on mtDNA populations, the cost to the cell of different mtDNA states, and the optimisation of therapeutic control of mtDNA populations. This formalism yields a wealth of biological results, including that an increasing mtDNA variance can increase the energetic cost of maintaining a tissue, that intermediate levels of heteroplasmy can be more detrimental than homoplasmy even for a dysfunctional mutant, that heteroplasmy distribution (not mean alone) is crucial for the success of gene therapies, and that long-term rather than short intense gene therapies are more likely to beneficially impact mtDNA populations."

      "Aptamer has been long studied as a substitute of antibodies for many purposes. However, due to the exceeded length of the aptamers obtained in vitro, difficulties arise in its manipulation during its molecular conjugation on the matrix surfaces. Current study focuses on computational improvement for aptamers screening of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) through optimization of the length sequences obtained from SELEX. Three original aptamers with affinity against HBsAg were truncated into five short hairpin structured aptamers and their affinity against HBsAg was thoroughly studied by molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MMPBSA) method. The result shows that truncated aptamers binding on HBsAg \"a\" determinant region are stabilized by the dynamic H-bond formation between the active binding residues and nucleotides. Amino acids residues with the highest hydrogen bonds hydrogen bond interactions with all five aptamers were determined as the active binding residues and further characterized. The computational prediction of complexes binding will include validations through experimental assays in future studies. Current study will improve the current in vitro aptamers by minimizing the aptamer length for its easy manipulation."

      "Quantifying entropy production in various active matter phases will open new avenues for probing self-organization principles in these far-from-equilibrium systems. It has been hypothesized that the dissipation of free energy by active matter systems may be optimized, leading to system trajectories with histories of large dissipation and an accompanying emergence of ordered dynamical states. This interesting idea has not been widely tested. In particular, it is not clear whether emergent states of actomyosin networks, which represent a salient example of biological active matter, self-organize following the principle of dissipation optimization. In order to start addressing this question using detailed computational modelling, we rely on the MEDYAN simulation platform, which allows simulating active matter networks from fundamental molecular principles. We have extended the capabilities of MEDYAN to allow quantification of the rates of dissipation resulting from chemical reactions and relaxation of mechanical stresses during simulation trajectories. This is done by computing precise changes in Gibbs free energy accompanying chemical reactions using a novel formula and through detailed calculations of instantaneous values of the system's mechanical energy. We validate our approach with a mean-field model that estimates the rates of dissipation from filament treadmilling. Applying this methodology to the self-organization of small disordered actomyosin networks, we find that compact and highly cross-linked networks tend to allow more efficient transduction of chemical free energy into mechanical energy. In these simple systems, we observe that spontaneous network reorganizations tend to result in a decrease in the total dissipation rate to a low steady-state value. Future studies might carefully test whether the dissipation-driven adaptation hypothesis applies in this instance, as well as in more complex cytoskeletal geometries."

      "One of the most common types of experiment in X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measures the secondary inelastically scattered fluorescence photon. This widespread approach has a dominant systematic of self-absorption of the fluorescence photon. The large impact of self-absorption compromises accuracy, analysis and insight. Presented here is a detailed self-consistent method to correct for self-absorption and attenuation in fluorescence X-ray measurements. This method and the resulting software package can be applied to any fluorescence data, for XAS or any other experimental approach detecting fluorescence or inelastically scattered radiation, leading to a general solution applicable to a wide range of experimental investigations. The high intrinsic accuracy of the processed data allows these features to be well modelled and yields deeper potential insight."

      "External shading geometry on buildings has been found to contribute substantially to reducing energy consumption for cooling. This study examines the effect of inclined wall self-shading strategy on heat gain in an office building. Field measurement of environmental variables such as ambient temperature, relative humidity, dew point, and wet bulb temperature was carried out in a case study inclined wall self-shading office building located in Putrajaya, Malaysia. The results of the validation of ApacheSim simulation software tool against the measured environmental variables indicated significant reliability having Pearson correlations ranging from 0.56 to 0.90. In establishing the relationship between different inclined wall strategies to the amount of heat gain, modification of the inclined wall self-shading projection (SSP) was modelled and experimented using ApacheSim simulation. Findings from the analysis revealed a relationship between heat gains into a building space and self-shading projection (SSP), as heat gains tend to reduce with increased SSP. From the findings, the optimum inclination angle of self-shading for effective heat gain reduction is based on a 45% self-shading projection. The application of inclined wall self-shading strategy in buildings would, therefore, bring about a reduction in heat gain, which invariably reduces energy consumption for cooling."

      "A large library of derivatives based on the scaffold of 2-(benzylsulfinyl)benzoic acid were synthesised and tested as atypical inhibitors against four different isoforms of human carbonic anhydrase (hCA I, II, IX and XII, EC 4.2.1.1). The exploration of the chemical space around the main functional groups led to the discovery of selective hCA IX inhibitors in the micromolar/nanomolar range, thus establishing robust structure-activity relationships within this versatile scaffold. HPLC separation of some selected chiral compounds and biological evaluation of the corresponding enantiomers was performed along with molecular modelling studies on the most active derivatives."

      "Understanding the structure-function relationships of RNA has become increasingly important given the realization of its functional role in various cellular processes. Chemical denaturation of RNA by urea has been shown to be beneficial in investigating RNA stability and folding. Elucidation of the mechanism of unfolding of RNA by urea is important for understanding the folding pathways. In addition to studying denaturation of RNA in aqueous urea, it is important to understand the nature and strength of interactions of the building blocks of RNA. In this study, a systematic examination of the structural features and energetic factors involving interactions between nucleobases and urea is presented. Results from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on each of the five DNA/RNA bases in water and eight different concentrations of aqueous urea, and free energy calculations using the thermodynamic integration method are presented. The interaction energies between all the nucleobases with the solvent environment and the transfer free energies become more favorable with respect to increase in the concentration of urea. Preferential interactions of urea versus water molecules with all model systems determined using Kirkwood-Buff integrals and two-domain models indicate preference of urea by nucleobases in comparison to water. The modes of interaction between urea and the nucleobases were analyzed in detail. In addition to the previously identified hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions between urea and nucleobases that stabilize the unfolded states of RNA in aqueous solution, NH-π interactions are proposed to be important. Dynamic properties of each of these three modes of interactions have been presented. The study provides fundamental insights into the nature of interaction of urea molecules with nucleobases and how it disrupts nucleic acids."

      "RATIONALE:Variation in 18 O natural abundance can lead to errors in the calculation of total energy expenditure (TEE) when using the doubly labelled water (DLW) method. The use of Bayesian statistics allows a distribution to be assigned to 18 O natural abundance, thus allowing a best-fit value to be used in the calculation. The aim of this study was to calculate within-subject variation in 18 O natural abundance and apply this to our original working model for TEE calculation. METHODS:Urine samples from a cohort of 99 women, dosed with 50 g of 20% 2 H2 O, undertaking a 14-day breast milk intake protocol, were analysed for 18 O. The within-subject variance was calculated and applied to a Bayesian model for the calculation of TEE in a separate cohort of 36 women. This cohort of 36 women had taken part in a DLW study and had been dosed with 80 mg/kg body weight 2 H2 O and 150 mg/kg body weight H2 18 O. RESULTS:The average change in the δ18 O value from the 99 women was 1.14‰ (0.77) [0.99, 1.29], with the average within-subject 18 O natural abundance variance being 0.13‰2 (0.25) [0.08, 0.18]. There were no significant differences in TEE (9745 (1414), 9804 (1460) and 9789 (1455) kJ/day, non-Bayesian, Bluck Bayesian and modified Bayesian models, respectively) between methods. CONCLUSIONS:Our findings demonstrate that using a reduced natural variation in 18 O as calculated from a population does not impact significantly on the calculation of TEE in our model. It may therefore be more conservative to allow a larger variance to account for individual extremes."

      "Cats are able to jump from a high-rise without any sign of injury, which is attributed in large part to their impact-resistant paw pads. The biomechanical study of paw pads may therefore contribute to improving the impact resistance of specific biomimetic materials. The present study is aimed at investigating the mechanics of the paw pads, revealing their impact-resistant biomechanism from macro- and microscopic perspectives. Histological and micro-CT scanning methods were exploited to analyze the microstructure of the pads, and mechanical testing was conducted to observe the macroscopic mechanical properties at different loading frequencies. Numerical micromodels of the ellipsoidal and cylindrical adipose compartments were developed to evaluate the mechanical functionality as compressive actions. The results show that the stiffness of the pad increases roughly in proportion to strain and mechanical properties are almost impervious to strain rate. Furthermore, the adipose compartment, which comprises adipose tissue enclosed within collagen septa, in the subcutaneous tissue presents an ellipsoid-like structure, with a decreasing area from the middle to the two ends. Additionally, the finite element results show that the ellipsoidal structure has larger displacement in the early stage of impact, which can absorb more energy and prevent instability at touchdown, while the cylindrical structure is more resistant to deformation. Moreover, the Von Mises of the ellipsoidal compartment decrease gradually from both ends to the middle, making it change to a cylindrical shape, and this may be the reason why the macroscopic stiffness increases with increasing time after contact. This preliminary investigation represents the basis for biomechanical interpretation and can accordingly provide new inspirations of shock-absorbing composite materials in engineering."

      "We report computer-aided design of new lactone-chalcone and isatin-chalcone (HLCIC) inhibitors of the falcipain-2 (PfFP-2). 3D models of 15 FP-2:HLCIC1-15 complexes with known observed activity (IC50exp) were prepared to establish a quantitative structure-activity (QSAR) model and linear correlation between relative Gibbs free energy of enzyme:inhibitor complex formation (ΔΔGcom) and IC50exp: pIC50exp = -0.0236 × ΔΔGcom+5.082(#); R2 = 0.93. A 3D pharmacophore model (PH4) derived from the QSAR directed our effort to design novel HLCIC analogues. During the design, an initial virtual library of 2621440 HLCIC was focused down to 18288 drug-like compounds and finally, PH4 screened to identify 81 promising compounds. Thirty-three others were added from an intuitive substitution approach intended to fill better the enzyme S2 pocket. One hundred and fourteen theoretical IC50 (IC50pre) values were predicted by means of (#) and their pharmacokinetics (ADME) profiles. More than 30 putative HLCICs display IC50pre 100 times superior to that of the published most active training set inhibitor HLCIC1."

      "A typical colloidal nanoparticle can be viewed as a nanocrystal-ligands complex with an inorganic single-crystalline core, the nanocrystal, bonded with a monolayer of organic ligands. The surface chemistry of nanocrystal-ligands complexes is crucial to their bulk properties. However, deciphering the molecular pictures of the nonperiodic and dynamic organic-inorganic interlayer is a grand technical challenge, and this hampers the quantitative perception of their macroscopic phenomena. Here we show that the atomic arrangement on nanocrystal surface and ligand-ligand interactions can be precisely quantified through comprehensive solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) methodologies. The analyses reveal that the mixed ligands of n-alkanoates on a CdSe nanocrystal segregate in areal partitions and the unique arrangement unlocks their rotational freedom. The mathematical model based on the NMR-derived ligand partition and dynamics successfully predicts the unusual solubility of nanocrystal-ligands complexes with mixed ligands, which is several orders of magnitude higher than that of nanocrystal-ligands complexes with pure ligands."

      "The consideration of the disposition of minima of electron density and electrostatic potential along the line between non-covalently bound atoms in systems with Hal-···CH₃⁻Y (Hal- = Cl, Br; Y = N, O) fragments allowed to prove that the carbon atom in methyl group serves as an electrophilic site provider. These interactions between halide anion and carbon in methyl group can be categorized as the typical tetrel bonds. Statistics of geometrical parameters for such tetrel bonds in CSD is analyzed. It is established that the binding energy in molecular complexes with tetrel bonds correlate with the potential acting on an electron in molecule (PAEM). The PAEM barriers for tetrel bonds show a similar behavior for both sets of complexes with Br- and Cl- electron donors."

      "Objective:During the last century, running shoes have been subject to drastic changes with incremental however improvements as to injury prevention. This may be, among others, due to the limited insight that experimental methodologies can provide on their 3D in situ response. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the effectiveness of finite element (FE) modelling techniques, in optimizing a midsole system as to the provided cushioning capacity. Methods:A commercial running shoe was scanned by means of micro computed tomography and its gel-based midsole, reverse-engineered to a 200 μm accuracy. The resulting 3D model was subjected to biorealistic loading and boundary conditions, in terms of time-varying plantar pressure distribution and shoe-ground contact constraints. The mesh grid of the FE model was verified as to its conceptual soundness and validated against velocity-driven impact tests. Nonlinear material properties were assigned to all entities and the model subjected to a dynamic FE analysis. An optimization function (based on energy absorption criteria) was employed to determine the optimum gel volume and position, as to accommodate sequential cushioning in the rear-, mid-, and forefoot, of runner during stance phase. Results:The in situ developing stress fields suggest that the shock dissipating properties of the midsole could be significantly improved. Altering the position of the gel pads and varying their volume led to different midsole responses that could be tuned more efficiently to the specific strike and pronation pattern. Conclusions:The results suggest that midsole design can be significantly improved through biorealistic FE modelling, thus providing a new platform for the conceptual redesign and/or optimization of modern footwear."

      "BACKGROUND:A positive energy balance is considered to be the primary cause of the development of obesity-related diseases. Treatment often consists of a combination of reducing energy intake and increasing energy expenditure. Here we use an existing computational modelling framework describing the long-term development of Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) in APOE3L.CETP mice fed a high-fat diet containing cholesterol with a human-like metabolic system. This model was used to analyze energy expenditure and energy balance in a large set of individual model realizations. RESULTS:We developed and applied a strategy to select specific individual models for a detailed analysis of heterogeneity in energy metabolism. Models were stratified based on energy expenditure. A substantial surplus of energy was found to be present during MetS development, which explains the weight gain during MetS development. In the majority of the models, energy was mainly expended in the peripheral tissues, but also distinctly different subgroups were identified. In silico perturbation of the system to induce increased peripheral energy expenditure implied changes in lipid metabolism, but not in carbohydrate metabolism. In silico analysis provided predictions for which individual models increase of peripheral energy expenditure would be an effective treatment. CONCLUSION:The computational analysis confirmed that the energy imbalance plays an important role in the development of obesity. Furthermore, the model is capable to predict whether an increase in peripheral energy expenditure - for instance by cold exposure to activate brown adipose tissue (BAT) - could resolve MetS symptoms."

      "As result of the great east Japan earthquake on March 2011 and the damages of the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP), huge amount of radionuclides, especially 137Cs, were released to the Japanese Pacific coast. By consequence, several marine species have been contaminated by direct uptake of radionuclides from seawater or through feeding on contaminated preys. In the present study we propose a novel radioecological modelling approach aiming to simulate the radionuclides transfer to pelagic marine species by giving to the organism body-size a key role in the model. We applied the model to estimate the 137Cs content in 14 commercially important species of the North-Western Pacific Ocean after the FDNPP accident. Firstly, we validated the model and evaluated its performance using various observed field data, and we demonstrated the importance of using such modelling approach in radioecological studies. Afterwards, we estimated some radioecological metrics, such as the maximum activity concentration, its corresponding time and the ecological half-life, which are important in assessment of the previous, current and future contamination levels of the studied species. Finally, we estimated the time duration required for each species to reach the pre-accident 137Cs activity concentrations. The results showed that the contamination levels in the planktivorous species have generally reached the pre-accident levels since about 5 years after the accident (since 2016). While in the case of the higher trophic level species, although the activity concentrations are much lower than the regulatory limit for radiocesium in seafood in Japan (100 Bq kg-1), these species still require another 6-14 years (2018-2026) to reach the pre-accident levels."

      "Tau is a microtubule-associated protein whose C-terminal domain consisting of four repeat regions R1, R2, R3 and R4 binds to microtubules to stabilize them. In several neurodegenerative diseases, tau detaches from microtubules to form insoluble aggregates leading to tauopathy. Microtubules are made up of αβ tubulin subunits. Seven α-tubulin and nine β-tubulin isotypes have been reported to be present in humans till date. These tubulin isotypes show residue composition variations mainly at C-terminal region and bind to motor proteins and anti-mitotic drugs differently. These tubulin isotypes show tissue specific expression as their relative proportion varies significantly in different type of cells. It is also known that tau binds differently to different cell lines and can either promote or demote microtubule polymerization. However, the relative binding affinity of tau to the different β-tubulin isotypes present in different cell lines is completely unknown. Here, we study relative binding affinity of Tau repeat region R2 to neuronal specific tubulin isotypes βI, βIIb, and βIII using molecular modelling approach. The order of binding energy of tau with tubulin is βIII > βIIb > βI. Our strategy can be potentially adapted to understand differential binding affinity of tau towards β-tubulin isotypes present in other cell lines."

      "The international tourism competition poses new challenges to the cruise sector, such as the achievement of the tourists' satisfaction and the increase in on board comfort. Moreover, the growing sophistication of tourists' needs leads to a more user-centric touristic offer. Consequently, a personalized cabin environment, which fits the users' activities and their characteristics, could be a plus value during the cruise vacation. These topics, however, are strictly connected with the diffusion of digital technologies and dynamics, which represent the tools to achieve the goal of a customized on-cruise experience. This paper presents E-Cabin, a novel Internet of Things (IoT) framework architecture that has at its core a reasoning system tuned on data gathered from the environment and from each specific passenger and the activities he/she performs. The framework leverages on knowledge representation with ontologies and consists of a publisher⁻subscriber communication framework that allows all of the IoT applications to use the reasoner and the provided ontologies. The paper demonstrates the proposed system in a demo cruise cabin where, by using the E-Cabin application, it is possible to set various atmospheres based on the users and activities occurring in the cabin."

      "Models play a vital role in science and technology and in the evolution of modern societies. They are used for describing processes and mechanisms, experimental observations, analyses and predictions. In spite of the fact that models are a reduction of reality, the achievements of modern societies are impressive and would have been inconceivable without the role of models. These achievements can be qualified with one term: growth. The impressive growth in past decades, however, now appears to be unsustainable. In this contribution the above-mentioned dilemma is dealt with. First the evolution and use of models is discussed from a more general sustainability perspective. In the second part of the paper the application of models for sustainable solutions in the field of cementitious materials is emphasized."

      "Notwithstanding current heavy dependence on gas-fired electricity generation in the Eastern African Power Pool (EAPP), hydropower is expected to play an essential role in improving electricity access in the region. Expansion planning of electricity infrastructure is critical to support investment and maintaining balanced consumer electricity prices. Variations in water availability due to a changing climate could leave hydro infrastructure stranded or result in underutilization of available resources. In this study, we develop a framework consisting of long-term models for electricity supply and water systems management, to assess the vulnerability of potential expansion plans to the effects of climate change. We find that the most resilient EAPP rollout strategy corresponds to a plan optimised for a slightly wetter climate compared to historical trends. This study demonstrates that failing to climate-proof infrastructure investments can result in significant electricity price fluctuations in selected countries (Uganda & Tanzania) while others, such as Egypt, are less vulnerable."

      "Accurate occupancy is crucial for planning for sustainable buildings. Using massive, passively-collected mobile phone data, we introduce a novel framework to estimate building occupancy at unprecedented scale. We show that, at urban-scale, occupancy differs widely from current estimates based on building types. For commercial buildings, we find typical occupancy rates are 5 times lower than current assumptions imply, while for residential buildings occupancy rates vary widely by neighborhood. Our mobile phone based occupancy estimates are integrated with a state-of-the-art urban building energy model to understand their impact on energy use predictions. Depending on the assumed relationship between occupancy and internal building loads, we find energy consumption which differs by +1% to -15% for residential buildings and by -4% to -21% for commercial buildings, compared to standard methods. This highlights a need for new occupancy-to-load models which can be applied at urban-scale to the diverse set of city building types."

      "BACKGROUND:The transition to parenthood is a cornerstone event for both parents, potentially leading to relevant changes in lifestyle and behaviour. In women, the metabolic changes during and after pregnancy and the deleterious effects of excessive gestational weight gain and postpartum weight retention have been extensively described. However, there is no full understanding about which specific energy balance related behaviours (EBRB) contribute to unfavourable weight gain and weight retention. Furthermore, information on how transition to parenthood affects men is lacking. Therefore, this study aims to investigate changes in body weight, body composition and EBRB in couples transitioning to parenthood. METHODS:TRANSPARENTS is a multi-centre observational follow-up study that focuses on body weight, body composition and EBRB during the transition to parenthood. Couples (women and men) will be recruited during the first trimester of their first pregnancy. Study visits will occur at four occasions (12 weeks of pregnancy, 6 weeks postpartum, 6 months postpartum and 12 months postpartum). Anthropometrics of the parents and new-borns will be assessed including body weight, height/length, body composition (using bio-electrical impedance analysis and measurement of four skinfold thicknesses (biceps, triceps, subscapular and supraspinal/suprailiac)) and waist and hip circumference. Dietary intake, physical activity, sedentary behaviour, smoking habits, sleeping pattern, fatigue, diet and exercise related partner support, mental health, breastfeeding, contraception use, and socio-demographics will be assessed using a questionnaire. In addition, accelerometry will be used to assess physical activity and sedentary behaviour objectively. Also data from women's medical record, such as pre-pregnancy weight and pregnancy outcomes, will be included. Multilevel modelling will be used to evaluate maternal and paternal changes in body weight, body composition and EBRB during and after pregnancy (primary outcomes). Multiple linear regression analyses will be performed to identify predictors of changes in body weight, body composition and EBRB. All analyses will be adjusted for possible confounders. DISCUSSION:TRANSPARENTS is a unique project identifying vulnerable parents and (un)favourable changes in EBRB throughout this potentially critical life period. Provided insights will facilitate the development of effective intervention strategies to help couples towards a healthy transition to parenthood.

      "The discovery of hybrid boron nitride-carbon (BN-C) nanostructures has triggered enormous research interest in the design and fabrication of new generation nanocomposites. The robust design of these nanocomposites for target applications requires their mechanical strength to be characterized with a wide range of factors. This article presents a comprehensive study, with the aid of molecular dynamics analysis, of the tensile loading mechanics of BN-C nanosheet reinforced polyethylene (PE) nanocomposites. It is observed that the geometry and lattice arrangement of the BN-C nanosheet influences the tensile loading characteristics of the nanocomposites. Furthermore, defects in the nanosheet can severely impact the tensile loading resistance, the extent of which is determined by the defect's location. This study also found that the tensile loading resistance of nanocomposites tends to weaken at elevated temperatures. The interfacial mechanics of the BN-C nanocomposites are also investigated. This analysis revealed a strong dependency with the carbon concentration in the BN-C nanosheet."

      "This paper examines the prospect of PEM (Proton Exchange Membrane) electrolyzers and fuel cells to partake in European electrical ancillary services markets. First, the current framework of ancillary services is reviewed and discussed, emphasizing the ongoing European harmonization plans for future frequency balancing markets. Next, the technical characteristics of PEM hydrogen technologies and their potential uses within the electrical power system are discussed to evaluate their adequacy to the requirements of ancillary services markets. Last, a case study based on a realistic representation of the transmission grid in the north of the Netherlands for the year 2030 is presented. The main goal of this case study is to ascertain the effectiveness of PEM electrolyzers and fuel cells for the provision of primary frequency reserves. Dynamic generic models suitable for grid simulations are developed for both technologies, including the required controllers to enable participation in ancillary services markets. The obtained results show that PEM hydrogen technologies can improve the frequency response when compared to the procurement with synchronous generators of the same reserve value. Moreover, the fast dynamics of PEM electrolyzers and fuel cells can help mitigate the negative effects attributed to the reduction of inertia in the system."

      "Differential growth is the driver of tissue morphogenesis in plants, and also plays a fundamental role in animal development. Although the contributions of growth to shape change have been captured through modelling tissue sheets or isotropic volumes, a framework for modelling both isotropic and anisotropic volumetric growth in three dimensions over large changes in size and shape has been lacking. Here, we describe an approach based on finite-element modelling of continuous volumetric structures, and apply it to a range of forms and growth patterns, providing mathematical validation for examples that admit analytic solution. We show that a major difference between sheet and bulk tissues is that the growth of bulk tissue is more constrained, reducing the possibility of tissue conflict resolution through deformations such as buckling. Tissue sheets or cylinders may be generated from bulk shapes through anisotropic specified growth, oriented by a polarity field. A second polarity field, orthogonal to the first, allows sheets with varying lengths and widths to be generated, as illustrated by the wide range of leaf shapes observed in nature. The framework we describe thus provides a key tool for developing hypotheses for plant morphogenesis and is also applicable to other tissues that deform through differential growth or contraction."

      "Coagulase (Coa) activity is essential for the virulence of Staphylococcus aureus (S aureus), one of the most important pathogenic bacteria leading to catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI). We have demonstrated that the mutation of coagulase improved outcomes in disease models of S aureus CRBSI, suggesting that targeting Coa may represent a novel antiinfective strategy for CRBSI. Here, we found that quercetin, a natural compound that does not affect S aureus viability, could inhibit Coa activity. Chemical biological analysis revealed that the direct engagement of quercetin with the active site (residues Tyr187, Leu221 and His228) of Coa inhibited its activity. Furthermore, treatment with quercetin reduced the retention of bacteria on catheter surfaces, decreased the bacterial load in the kidneys and alleviated kidney abscesses in vivo. These data suggest that antiinfective therapy targeting Coa with quercetin may represent a novel strategy and provide a new leading compound with which to combat bacterial infections."

      "Antibodies are an important class of therapeutics that have significant clinical impact for the treatment of severe diseases. Computational tools to support antibody drug discovery have been developing at an increasing rate over the last decade and typically rely upon a predetermined co-crystal structure of the antibody bound to the antigen for structural predictions. Here, we show an example of successful in silico affinity maturation of a hybridoma derived antibody, AB1, using just a homology model of the antibody fragment variable region and a protein-protein docking model of the AB1 antibody bound to the antigen, murine CCL20 (muCCL20). In silico affinity maturation, together with alanine scanning, has allowed us to fine-tune the protein-protein docking model to subsequently enable the identification of two single-point mutations that increase the affinity of AB1 for muCCL20. To our knowledge, this is one of the first examples of the use of homology modelling and protein docking for affinity maturation and represents an approach that can be widely deployed."

      "Various models and datasets related to aflatoxins in the maize and dairy production chain have been developed and used but they have not yet been linked with each other. This study aimed to investigate the impacts of climate change on aflatoxin B1 production in maize and its consequences on aflatoxin M1 contamination in dairy cow's milk, using a full chain modelling approach. To this end, available models and input data were chained together in a modelling framework. As a case study, we focused on maize grown in Eastern Europe and imported to the Netherlands to be fed-as part of dairy cows' compound feed-to dairy cows in the Netherlands. Three different climate models, one aflatoxin B1 prediction model and five different carryover models were used. For this particular case study of East European maize, most of the calculations suggest an increase (up to 50%) of maximum mean aflatoxin M1 in milk by 2030, except for one climate (DMI) model suggesting a decrease. Results from all combinations of carryover and climate models suggest a similar or slight increase (up to 0.6%) of the chance of finding aflatoxin M1 in milk above the EC limit of 0.05 μg/kg by 2030. Results varied mainly with the climate model data and carryover model considered. The model framework infrastructure is flexible so that forecasting models for other mycotoxins or other food safety hazards as well as other production chains, together with necessary input databases, can easily be included as well. This modelling framework for the first time links datasets and models related to aflatoxin B1 in maize and related aflatoxin M1 the dairy production chain to obtain a unique predictive methodology based on Monte Carlo simulation. Such an integrated approach with scenario analysis provides possibilities for policy makers and risk managers to study the effects of changes in the beginning of the chain on the end product."

      "Recent advances in additive manufacturing have enabled fabrication of phononic crystals and metamaterials which exhibit spectral gaps, or stopbands, in which the propagation of elastic waves is prohibited by Bragg scattering or local resonance effects. Due to the high level of design freedom available to additive manufacturing, the propagation properties of the elastic waves in metamaterials are tunable through design of the periodic cell. In this paper, we outline a new design approach for metamaterials incorporating internal resonators, and provide numerical and experimental evidence that the stopband exists over the irreducible Brillouin zone of the unit cell of the metamaterial (i.e. is a three-dimensional stopband). The targeted stopband covers a much lower frequency range than what can be realised through Bragg scattering alone. Metamaterials have the ability to provide (a) lower frequency stopbands than Bragg-type phononic crystals within the same design volume, and/or (b) comparable stopband frequencies with reduced unit cell dimensions. We also demonstrate that the stopband frequency range of the metamaterial can be tuned through modification of the metamaterial design. Applications for such metamaterials include aerospace and transport components, as well as precision engineering components such as vibration-suppressing platforms, supports for rotary components, machine tool mounts and metrology frames."

      "Biohybrid robotics takes an engineering approach to the expansion and exploitation of biological behaviours for application to automated tasks. Here, we identify the construction of living buildings and infrastructure as a high-potential application domain for biohybrid robotics, and review technological advances relevant to its future development. Construction, civil infrastructure maintenance and building occupancy in the last decades have comprised a major portion of economic production, energy consumption and carbon emissions. Integrating biological organisms into automated construction tasks and permanent building components therefore has high potential for impact. Live materials can provide several advantages over standard synthetic construction materials, including self-repair of damage, increase rather than degradation of structural performance over time, resilience to corrosive environments, support of biodiversity, and mitigation of urban heat islands. Here, we review relevant technologies, which are currently disparate. They span robotics, self-organizing systems, artificial life, construction automation, structural engineering, architecture, bioengineering, biomaterials, and molecular and cellular biology. In these disciplines, developments relevant to biohybrid construction and living buildings are in the early stages, and typically are not exchanged between disciplines. We, therefore, consider this review useful to the future development of biohybrid engineering for this highly interdisciplinary application."

      "As phase-change materials are poised to play a key role in next-generation computing systems, improving the current understanding of electrical transport in their amorphous phase can further strengthen their technological competitiveness. Even though the interaction of charge carriers with disorder-induced localised states largely affect the field-dependent conductivity, a clear link between electrical transport and specific features of the electronic density of states (DOS) could not be established yet due to a lack of knowledge of the capture characteristics of trap states. Here, we address this knowledge gap and employ modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (MPC) to investigate localised states in the frequently studied amorphous phase of Ge2Sb2Te5. Additionally, we present results on the DOS in the bandgap of amorphous AgIn-doped Sb2Te, which has not been subject to high-resolution DOS spectroscopy before. We find experimental evidence for clearly non-constant capture coefficients among a continuous spectrum of localised states in both studied materials. According to this observation especially in AgIn-doped Sb2Te, where no pronounced defect can be detected as main channel for carrier emission, we point out the necessity of modifying the current Poole-Frenkel-based transport modelling."

      "BACKGROUND:The formation of acetate by fast-growing Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a commonly observed phenomenon, often referred to as overflow metabolism. Among various studies that have been carried over decades, a recent work (Basan, M. et al. Nature 528, 99-104, 2015) suggested and validated that it is the differential proteomic efficiencies in energy biogenesis between fermentation and respiration that lead to the production of acetate at rapid growth conditions, as the consequence of optimally allocating the limited proteomic resource. In the current work, we attempt to incorporate this newly developed proteome allocation theory into flux balance analysis (FBA) to capture quantitatively the extent of overflow metabolism in different E. coli strains. RESULTS:A concise constraint was introduced into a FBA-based model with three proteomic cost parameters to represent constrained allocation of proteome over two energy (respiration and fermentation) pathways and biomass synthesis. Linear relationships were shown to exist between the three proteomic cost parameters. Tests with three different strains revealed that the proteomic cost of fermentation was consistently lower than that of respiration. A slow-growing strain appeared to have a higher proteomic cost for biomass synthesis than fast-growing strains. Different assumed levels of carbon flowing into pentose phosphate pathway affected the absolute value of model parameters, but had no qualitative impact on the comparative proteomic costs. For the prediction of biomass yield, significant errors that occurred for one of the tested strains (ML308) were rectified by adjusting the cellular energy demand according to literature data. CONCLUSIONS:With the aid of a concise proteome allocation constraint, our FBA-based model is able to quantitatively predict the onset and extent of the overflow metabolism in various E. coli strains. Such prediction is enabled by three linearly-correlated (as opposed to uniquely determinable) proteomic cost parameters. The linear relationships between these parameters, when determined using data from cell culturing experiments, render biologically meaningful comparative proteomic costs between fermentation and respiration pathways and between the biomass synthesis sectors of slow- and fast-growing species. Simultaneous prediction of acetate production and biomass yield in the overflow region requires the use of reliable cellular energy demand data."

      "The blood brain barrier (BBB) is the main barrier that separates the blood from the brain. Because of the BBB, the drug concentration-time profile in the brain may be substantially different from that in the blood. Within the brain, the drug is subject to distributional and elimination processes: diffusion, bulk flow of the brain extracellular fluid (ECF), extra-intracellular exchange, bulk flow of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), binding and metabolism. Drug effects are driven by the concentration of a drug at the site of its target and by drug-target interactions. Therefore, a quantitative understanding is needed of the distribution of a drug within the brain in order to predict its effect. Mathematical models can help in the understanding of drug distribution within the brain. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of system-specific and drug-specific properties that affect the local distribution of drugs in the brain and of currently existing mathematical models that describe local drug distribution within the brain. Furthermore, we provide an overview on which processes have been addressed in these models and which have not. Altogether, we conclude that there is a need for a more comprehensive and integrated model that fills the current gaps in predicting the local drug distribution within the brain."

      "AIMS:We sought to identify metabolic pathways associated with right ventricular (RV) adaptation to pulmonary hypertension (PH). We evaluated candidate metabolites, previously associated with survival in pulmonary arterial hypertension, and used automated image segmentation and parametric mapping to model their relationship to adverse patterns of remodelling and wall stress. METHODS AND RESULTS:In 312 PH subjects (47.1% female, mean age 60.8 ± 15.9 years), of which 182 (50.5% female, mean age 58.6 ± 16.8 years) had metabolomics, we modelled the relationship between the RV phenotype, haemodynamic state, and metabolite levels. Atlas-based segmentation and co-registration of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was used to create a quantitative 3D model of RV geometry and function-including maps of regional wall stress. Increasing mean pulmonary artery pressure was associated with hypertrophy of the basal free wall (β = 0.29) and reduced relative wall thickness (β = -0.38), indicative of eccentric remodelling. Wall stress was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio = 1.27, P = 0.04). Six metabolites were significantly associated with elevated wall stress (β = 0.28-0.34) including increased levels of tRNA-specific modified nucleosides and fatty acid acylcarnitines, and decreased levels (β = -0.40) of sulfated androgen. CONCLUSION:Using computational image phenotyping, we identify metabolic profiles, reporting on energy metabolism and cellular stress-response, which are associated with adaptive RV mechanisms to PH."

      "The ultrasonic testing technique using Lamb waves is widely used for the non-destructive testing and evaluation of various structures. For air-coupled excitation and the reception of A0 mode Lamb waves, leaky guided waves are usually exploited. However, at low frequencies (<100 kHz), the velocity of this mode in plastic and composite materials can become slower than the ultrasound velocity in air, and its propagation in films is accompanied only by an evanescent wave in air. To date, the information about the attenuation of the slow A0 mode is very contradictory. Therefore, the objective of this investigation was the measurement of the attenuation of the slow A0 mode in thin plastic films. The measurement of the attenuation of normal displacements of the film caused by a propagating slow A0 mode is discussed. The normal displacements of the film at different distances from the source were measured by a laser interferometer. In order to reduce diffraction errors, the measurement method based on the excitation of cylindrical but not plane waves was proposed. The slow A0 mode was excited in the polyvinylchloride film by a dry contact type ultrasonic transducer made of high-efficiency PMN-32%PT strip-like piezoelectric crystal. It was found that that the attenuation of the slow A0 mode in PVC film at the frequency of 44 kHz is 2 dB/cm. The obtained results can be useful for the development of quality control methods for plastic films."

      "BACKGROUND:Currently, control of exoskeletons in rehabilitation focuses on imposing desired trajectories to promote relearning of motions. Furthermore, assistance is often provided by imposing these desired trajectories using impedance controllers. However, lower-limb exoskeletons are also a promising solution for mobility problems of individuals in daily life. To develop an assistive exoskeleton which allows the user to be autonomous, i.e. in control of his motions, remains a challenge. This paper presents a model-based control method to tackle this challenge. METHODS:The model-based control method utilizes a dynamic model of the exoskeleton to compensate for its own dynamics. After this compensation of the exoskeleton dynamics, the exoskeleton can provide a desired assistance to the user. While dynamic models of exoskeletons used in the literature focus on gravity compensation only, the need for modelling and monitoring of the ground contact impedes their widespread use. The control strategy proposed here relies on modelling of the full exoskeleton dynamics and of the contacts with the environment. A modelling strategy and general control scheme are introduced. RESULTS:Validation of the control method on 15 non-disabled adults performing sit-to-stand motions shows that muscle effort and joint torques are similar in the conditions with dynamically compensated exoskeleton and without exoskeleton. The condition with exoskeleton in which the compensating controller was not active showed a significant increase in human joint torques and muscle effort at the knee and hip. Motor saturation occurred during the assisted condition, which limited the assistance the exoskeleton could deliver. CONCLUSIONS:This work presents the modelling steps and controller design to compensate the exoskeleton dynamics. The validation seems to indicate that the presented model-based controller is able to compensate the exoskeleton."

      "Coal is still a major energy source, mostly used in power plants. However, the coal combustion emits harmful SO2 and fly ash. Wet flue gas desulfurization (WFGD) technology is extensively used to control SO2 emissions in power plants. However, only limited studies have investigated the synergistic dust removal by the WFGD system. Spray scrubbers and sieve-tray spray scrubbers are often used in WFGD systems to improve the SO2 removal efficiency. In this study, the synergistic dust removal of WFGD systems for a spray scrubber and a sieve-tray spray scrubber was investigated using the experimental and modelling approaches, respectively. For the spray scrubber, the influence of parameters, including dust particle diameters and inlet concentrations of dust particles, and the flow rates of flue gas and slurry of limestone/gypsum on the dust removal efficiency, was investigated. For the sieve-tray spray scrubber, the influence of parameters such as the pore diameter and porosity of sieve trays on the dust removal efficiency was examined. The study found that the dust removal efficiency in the sieve-tray spray scrubber was approximately 1.1-10.6% higher than that of the spray scrubber for the same experimental conditions. Based on the parameters investigated and geometric parameters of a scrubber, a novel droplets swarm model for dust removal efficiency was developed from the single droplet model. The enhanced dust removal efficiency of sieve tray was expressed by introducing a strength coefficient to an inertial collision model. The dust removal efficiency model for the sieve-tray spray scrubber was developed by combining the droplets swarm model for the spray scrubber with the modified inertial collision model for the sieve tray. The results simulated using both models are consistent with the experimental data obtained."

      "(1) Background: Processivity is common among enzymes and mechanochemical motors that synthesize, degrade, modify or move along polymeric substrates, such as DNA, RNA, polysaccharides or proteins. Processive enzymes can make multiple rounds of modification without releasing the substrate/partner, making their operation extremely effective and economical. The molecular mechanism of processivity is rather well understood in cases when the enzyme structurally confines the substrate, such as the DNA replication factor PCNA, and also when ATP energy is used to confine the succession of molecular events, such as with mechanochemical motors. Processivity may also result from the kinetic bias of binding imposed by spatial confinement of two binding elements connected by an intrinsically disordered (ID) linker. (2) Method: By statistical physical modeling, we show that this arrangement results in processive systems, in which the linker ensures an optimized effective concentration around novel binding site(s), favoring rebinding over full release of the polymeric partner. (3) Results: By analyzing 12 such proteins, such as cellulase, and RNAse-H, we illustrate that in these proteins linker length and flexibility, and the kinetic parameters of binding elements, are fine-tuned for optimizing processivity. We also report a conservation of structural disorder, special amino acid composition of linkers, and the correlation of their length with step size. (4) Conclusion: These observations suggest a unique type of entropic chain function of ID proteins, that may impart functional advantages on diverse enzymes in a variety of biological contexts."

      "Upon application of ultrasonic waves to a suspension of solid particles in liquid, multiple scattering occurs at the particle/liquid interfaces leading to attenuation. It was recently shown through experimental verification that multiple scattering theory must include shear wave influences at the boundary between the liquid and solid particles in a nanofluid when the concentration of the scatterers is even as low as a few percent by volume. Herein, we consider silica spheres of 50-450 nm diameter in the long-wavelength regime to elucidate the form of the shear decay fields at the liquid/solid interface for individual particles. This is important because the overlap of these fields ultimately leads to the conversion of a compressional wave to shear waves and back into the compressional wave, the effect originating due to the density contrast between the particle and the liquid. Therefore, we examine in detail the velocity, vorticity and viscous dissipation in the shear wave field and around the silica spheres using finite element modelling, giving clarity to the viscous boundary effects. We also compare the numerical modelling to semi-analytical results."

      "Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are highly promising tools to deliver therapeutic molecules into tumours. αVβ3 integrins are cell-matrix adhesion receptors, and are considered as an attractive target for anticancer therapies owing to their roles in the process of metastasis and angiogenesis. Therefore, this study aims to assess the effect of co-administration of zerumbone (ZER) and ZERencapsulated in hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin with TP5-iRGD peptide towards cell cytotoxicity, apoptosis induction, and proliferation of normal and cancerous breast cells utilizing in vitro assays, as well as to study the molecular docking of ZER in complex with TP5-iRGD peptide. Cell viability assay findings indicated that ZER and ZERencapsulated in hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (ZER-HPβCD) inhibited the growth of estrogen receptor positivebreast cancer cells (ER+ MCF-7) at 72 h treatment with an inhibitory concentration (IC)50 of 7.51 ± 0.2 and 5.08 ± 0.2 µg/mL, respectively, and inhibited the growth of triple negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) with an IC50 of 14.96 ± 1.52 µg/mL and 12.18 ± 0.7 µg/mL, respectively. On the other hand, TP5-iRGD peptide showed no significant cytotoxicity on both cancer and normal cells. Interestingly, co-administration of TP5-iRGD peptide in MCF-7 cells reduced the IC50 of ZER from 7.51 ± 0.2 µg/mL to 3.13 ± 0.7 µg/mL and reduced the IC50 of ZER-HPβCD from 5.08 ± 0.2 µg/mL to 0.49 ± 0.004 µg/mL, indicating that the co-administration enhances the potency and increases the efficacy of ZER and ZER-HPβCD compounds. Acridine orange (AO)/propidium iodide (PI) staining under fluorescence microscopy showed evidence of early apoptosis after 72 h from the co-administration of ZER or ZER-HPβCD with TP5-iRGD peptide in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The findings of the computational modelling experiment provide novel insights into the ZER interaction with integrin αvβ3 in the presence of TP5-iRGD, and this could explain why ZER has better antitumor activities when co-administered with TP5-iRGD peptide."

      "BACKGROUND:As digital healthcare expands to include the use of mobile devices, there are opportunities to integrate these technologies into the self-management of chronic disease. Purpose built apps for diabetes self-management are plentiful and vary in functionality; they offer capability for individuals to record, manage, display, and interpret their own data. The optimal incorporation of mobile tablets into diabetes self-care is little explored in research, and guidelines for use are scant. OBJECTIVE:The purpose of this study was to examine an individual's use of mobile devices and apps in the self-management of type 2 diabetes to establish the potential and value of this ubiquitous technology for chronic healthcare. METHODS:In a 9-month intervention, 28 patients at a large multidisciplinary healthcare center were gifted internet connected Apple iPads with preinstalled apps and given digital support to use them. They were invited to take up predefined activities, which included recording their own biometrics, monitoring their diet, and traditional online information seeking. Four online surveys captured the participants' perceptions and health outcomes throughout the study. This article reports on the qualitative analysis of the open-ended responses in all four surveys. RESULTS:Using apps, participants self-curated small data sets that included their blood glucose level, blood pressure, weight, and dietary intake. The dynamic visualizations of the data in the form of charts and diagrams were created using apps and participants were able to interpret the impact of their choices and behaviors from the diagrammatic form of their small personal data sets. Findings are presented in four themes: (1) recording personal data; (2) modelling and visualizing the data; (3) interpreting the data; and (4) empowering and improving health. CONCLUSIONS:The modelling capability of apps using small personal data sets, collected and curated by individuals, and the resultant graphical information that can be displayed on tablet screens proves a valuable asset for diabetes self-care. Informed by their own data, individuals are well-positioned to make changes in their daily lives that will improve their health."

      "Major transformation of the global energy system is required for climate change mitigation. However, energy demand patterns and supply systems are themselves subject to climate change impacts. These impacts will variously help and hinder mitigation and adaptation efforts, so it is vital they are well understood and incorporated into models used to study energy system decarbonisation pathways. To assess the current state of understanding of this topic and identify research priorities, this paper critically reviews the literature on the impacts of climate change on the energy supply system, summarising the regional coverage of studies, trends in their results and sources of disagreement. We then examine the ways in which these impacts have been represented in integrated assessment models of the electricity or energy system. Studies tend to agree broadly on impacts for wind, solar and thermal power stations. Projections for impacts on hydropower and bioenergy resources are more varied. Key uncertainties and gaps remain due to the variation between climate projections, modelling limitations and the regional bias of research interests. Priorities for future research include the following: further regional impact studies for developing countries; studies examining impacts of the changing variability of renewable resources, extreme weather events and combined hazards; inclusion of multiple climate feedback mechanisms in IAMs, accounting for adaptation options and climate model uncertainty."

      "Modelling brittle fracture by a phase-field fracture formulation has now been widely accepted. However, the full-order phase-field fracture model implemented using finite elements results in a nonlinear coupled system for which simulations are very computationally demanding, particularly for parametrized problems when the randomness and uncertainty of material properties are considered. To tackle this issue, we present two reduced-order phase-field models for parametrized brittle fracture problems in this work. The first one is a mesh-based Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) method. Both the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM) and the Matrix Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method ((M)DEIM) are adopted to approximate the nonlinear vectors and matrices. The second one is a meshfree Krigingmodel. For one-dimensional problems, served as proof-of-concept demonstrations, in which Young's modulus and the fracture energy vary, the POD-based model can speed up the online computations eight-times, and for the Kriging model, the speed-up factor is 1100, albeit with a slightly lower accuracy. Another merit of the Kriging's model is its non-intrusive nature, as one does not need to modify the full-order model code."

      "Several economic, institutional, technical and socio-cultural barriers hinder countries from moving from the high to the low emission pathway. The objective of this research is to find out the impacts of social, economic, technological and regulatory barriers in the deployment of renewable energy. Data were collected through an online questionnaire responded to by 223 professionals working in the energy sector all over the globe. This research shows that social, technological and regulatory barriers have a strong influence on the deployment of renewable energy, while economic barriers significantly influence it indirectly. By breaking research and development-related barriers, organizations will be able to invest greatly in developing advanced technologies that can optimize usage of renewable energy and make renewable energy appear more lucrative. With less polluting and lower tariff energy solutions being made available to local people, and higher profits for manufacturers, this will create an atmosphere where all stakeholders are satisfied."

      "A series of benzo[b]thiophen-3-ols were synthesised and investigated as potential human monoamine oxidase (hMAO) inhibitors in vitro as well as ex vivo in rat cortex synaptosomes by means of evaluation of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid/dopamine (DOPAC/DA) ratio and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity. Most of these compounds possessed high selectivity for the MAO-B isoform and a discrete antioxidant and chelating potential. Molecular docking studies of all the compounds underscored potential binding site interactions suitable for MAO inhibition activity, and suggested structural requirements to further improve the activity of this scaffold by chemical modification of the aryl substituents. Starting from this heterocyclic nucleus, novel lead compounds for the treatment of neurodegenerative disease could be developed."

      "We report two novel functional dyes based on a boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) core displaying a panchromatic absorption with an extension to the near-infrared (NIR) range. An innovative synthetic approach for preparing the 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-BODIPY unit is disclosed, and a versatile way to further functionalize this unit has been developed. The optoelectronic properties of the two dyes were computed by density functional theory modelling (DFT) and characterized through UV-vis spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. Finally, we report preliminary results obtained using these functional dyes as photosensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)."

      "The characterisation of buried radioactive wastes is challenging because they are not readily accessible. Therefore, this study reports on the development of a method for integrating ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and gamma-ray detector measurements for nonintrusive characterisation of buried radioactive objects. The method makes use of the density relationship between soil permittivity models and the flux measured by gamma ray detectors to estimate the soil density, depth and radius of a disk-shaped buried radioactive object simultaneously. The method was validated using numerical simulations with experimentally-validated gamma-ray detector and GPR antenna models. The results showed that the method can simultaneously retrieve the soil density, depth and radius of disk-shaped radioactive objects buried in soil of varying conditions with a relative error of less than 10%. This result will enable the development of an integrated GPR and gamma ray detector tool for rapid characterisation of buried radioactive objects encountered during monitoring and decontamination of nuclear sites and facilities."

      "Control over spontaneous emission rate is important for improving efficiency in different semiconductor applications including lasers, LEDs and photovoltaics. Usually, an emitter should be placed inside the cavity to increase the spontaneous emission rate, although it is technologically challenging. Here we experimentally demonstrate a phenomenon of super-radiance observed in a cavity-less periodic Bragg structure based on InAs monolayer-thick multiple quantum wells (MQW). The collective super-radiant mode shows enhanced emission rate for specific angles and frequencies. This behaviour correlates with the calculations demonstrating individual spots of the enhanced Purcell coefficient near the Bragg condition curve. This study provides a perspective for realization of surface emitting cavity-less lasers with distributed feedback."

      "In this association study on chromosome 11, the data from 12,537 Korean individuals within the Health Examinee (HEXA) and the Korea Association Resource (KARE) projects were analysed to identify genetic loci correlating with increased and decreased plasma triglyceride (TG) levels. We identified a locus in chromosomal region 11q23.3 that harbours genes BUD13, ZNF259, APOA5, APOA1, and SIK3, which may be associated with plasma TG levels. In this locus, 13 relevant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found: rs184616707, rs118175510, rs60954647, rs79408961, and rs180373 (near BUD13); rs11604424 (in ZNF259); rs2075291, rs651821, and rs7123666 (in or near APOA5); rs525028 (near APOA1), and rs645258, rs10160754, and rs142395187 (in or near SIK3). All 13 SNPs satisfied the genome-wide significance level (P < 5.0 × 10-8) in both meta-analysis and conditional analysis. Haplotype analysis of six SNPs (rs79408961, rs180373, rs2075291, rs651821, rs525028, and rs10160754) that were selected based on the β coefficient and conditional P values, revealed nine common haplotypes (with frequency 0.02-0.34) associated with both increased and reduced TG levels. Furthermore, to shed light on possible structural implications, we modelled and simulated the G185C variant of APOA5 (corresponding to rs2075291), which showed the strongest association. Molecular dynamics simulation results showed that this polymorphic variant of APOA5 has a different hydrogen bond network, increased average distance between chains, and an ability to form distinct clusters. Owing to the orientation of cysteine, the possibility of disulphide bond formation with other proteins is evident. In summary, our association and modelling analyses provided evidence that genetic variations in chromosomal region 11q23.3 are associated with elevated TG levels."

      "Reversed apparent motion (or reversed phi) can be seen during a continuous dissolve between a positive and a spatially shifted negative version of the same image. Similar reversed effects can be seen in stereo when positive and spatially shifted negative images are presented separately to the two eyes or in a Vernier alignment task when the two images are juxtaposed one above the other. Gregory and Heard reported similar effects that they called \"phenomenal phenomena.\" Here, we investigate the similarities between these different effects and put forward a simple, spatial-smoothing explanation that can account for both the direction and magnitude of the reversed effects in the motion, stereo and Vernier domains. In addition, we consider whether the striking motion effects seen when viewing Kitaoka's colour-dependent Fraser-Wilcox figures are related to the reversed phi illusion, given the similarity of the luminance profiles."

      "This article analyses the connection of the two types of floors on the ground (floors on joists and self-supporting floors), with the external wall made of a hemp-lime composite for the occurrence of thermal bridges. Several factors that may affect the heat transfer in the junction were taken into account: the level of the floor on the ground, the wall thickness, the thermal conductivity of the composite, and the location of the timber frame construction. The technology of using hemp and lime is relatively new, and there is a lack of such analyses in the literature. The two-dimensional (2D) heat-transfer in the described construction joints was analyzed based on the finite-element method with the use of the THERM 7.4 software. The results were presented as averaged and linear thermal transmittance coefficients dependent on the above mentioned factors. The possibility of surface condensation was also checked. The differences in the values of the thermal transmittance of the junction between the two variants of ground floors reached around 0.13%-1.67% and the values of linear thermal transmittance factor reached approximately 2.43%-10.13%. The junctions with the highest floor level showed a decrease in the thermal transmittance value by about 3.00%-5.77% and in the linear thermal transmittance, by about 21.98%-53.83%, compared to the junctions with the lowest floor level. Calculations showed that almost all analyzed junctions are free from surface condensation causing mould growth, because the minimum temperature factors f0.25 were higher than 0.78 (except for junctions with the lowered floor levels). The junction with a floor on the timber joists showed better thermal parameters than the junction with a self-supporting floor in each of the analyzed variants. By increasing the level of floor insulation, it is possible to limit the thermal bridges and improve the thermal properties of the junction."

      "Dengue being one of the deadliest diseases of tropical regions, enforces to put continuous efforts for the development of vaccine and effective therapeutics. Most of the antibodies generated during dengue infection are non-neutralizing and cause antibody dependent enhancement. Hence, making a potent neutralizing antibody against all four dengue serotypes could be very effective for the treatment. However, designing a single antibody for all serotypes is difficult due to variation in protein sequences. Therefore, the objective is to identify conserved region of dengue envelope protein and then develop an antibody against that conserved region. Before advancing to the development of such an antibody, it is desirable to validate the interactions between antibody and dengue envelope protein. In silico analysis of such interactions provides a good platform to find out a suitable region to design and construct an antibody against it by analyzing antigen-antibody interaction before synthesizing the antibody. In this study, two highly conserved regions of dengue envelope protein were identified and an scFv was constructed against it. Both scFv and FuBc proteins were expressed in bacterial expression system and binding efficiency was analyzed by SPR analysis with KD value 2.3 μM. In order to improve binding efficiency, an in silico scFv mutant library was created which was virtually screened for higher binding efficiency. Six mutants with high binding efficiency were selected for further analysis. The binding ability of these mutants were predicted using simulation analysis which shows these mutations were stabilizing scFv-FuBc complex."

      "There is evidence that replacing saturated fat (SFA) with polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) lowers ischemic heart disease (IHD). In order to improve the population's diet, the World Health Organization has called for the taxation of foods that are high in SFA. We aimed to assess the potential health gains of a European fat tax by applying the SFA intake reduction that has been observed under the Danish fat tax to six other European countries. For each country, we created a fat tax scenario with a decreased SFA intake and a corresponding increase in PUFA. We compared this fat tax scenario to a reference scenario with no change in SFA intake, and to a guideline scenario with a population-wide SFA intake in line with dietary recommendations. We used DYNAMO-HIA to dynamically project the policy-attributable IHD cases of these three scenarios 10 years into the future. A fat tax would reduce prevalent IHD cases by a minimum of 500 and 300 among males and females in Denmark, respectively, up to a maximum of 5,600 and 4,000 among males and females in the UK. Thereby, the prevented IHD cases under a fat tax scenario would correspond to between 11.0% (in females in the Netherlands) and 29.5% (in females in Italy) of the prevented IHD cases under a guideline scenario, which represents the maximum preventable disease burden. Henceforth, our quantification of beneficial health impacts makes the case for the policy debate on fat taxes."

      "This study is dedicated to the common problem of how to choose a suitable substrate for ion irradiation of two-dimensional materials in order to achieve specific roles of certain defect formation mechanisms. The estimations include Monte Carlo simulations for He, Ar, Xe, C, N and Si ions, performed in the incident ion energy range from 100 eV to 250 MeV. Cu, SiO2, SiC and Al2O3 substrates were analyzed. The considered substrate-related defect formation mechanisms are sputtering, recoil atoms reaching the interface with a non-zero energy, and generation of hot electrons in close proximity of the interface. Additionally, the implantation of sputtered substrate atoms into the 2D material lattice is analyzed. This work is useful both for fundamental studies of irradiation of two-dimensional materials and as a practical guide on choosing the conditions necessary to obtain certain parameters of irradiated materials."

      "Bayesian statistical learning provides a coherent probabilistic framework for modelling uncertainty in systems. This review describes the theoretical foundations underlying Bayesian statistics and outlines the computational frameworks for implementing Bayesian inference in practice. We then describe the use of Bayesian learning in single-cell biology for the analysis of high-dimensional, large data sets."

      "Short-term wind speed forecasting for Colonia Eulacio, Soriano Department, Uruguay, is performed by applying an artificial neural network (ANN) technique to the hourly time series representative of the site. To train the ANN and validate the technique, data for one year are collected by one tower, with anemometers installed at heights of 101.8, 81.8, 25.7, and 10.0 m. Different ANN configurations are applied for each site and height; then, a quantitative analysis is conducted, and the statistical results are evaluated to select the configuration that best predicts the real data. This method has lower computational costs than other techniques, such as numerical modelling. For integrating wind power into existing grid systems, accurate short-term wind speed forecasting is fundamental. Therefore, the proposed short-term wind speed forecasting method is an important scientific contribution for reliable large-scale wind power forecasting and integration in Uruguay. The results of the short-term wind speed forecasting showed good accuracy at all the anemometer heights tested, suggesting that the method is a powerful tool that can help the Administración Nacional de Usinas y Transmissiones Eléctricas manage the national energy supply."

      "Understanding the relation between the time-dependent resistance drift in the amorphous state of phase-change materials and the localised states in the band gap of the glass is crucial for the development of memory devices with increased storage density. Here a machine-learned interatomic potential is utilised to generate an ensemble of glass models of the prototypical phase-change alloy, Ge2Sb2Te5, to obtain reliable statistics. Hybrid density-functional theory is used to identify and characterise the geometric and electronic structures of the mid-gap states. 5-coordinated Ge atoms are the local defective bonding environments mainly responsible for these electronic states. The structural motif for the localisation of the mid-gap states is a crystalline-like atomic environment within the amorphous network. An extra electron is trapped spontaneously by these mid-gap states, creating deep traps in the band gap. The results provide significant insights that can help to rationalise the design of multi-level-storage memory devices."

      "Increasing knowledge of the relationship between cancer and dysregulated polyamine catabolism suggests interfering with aberrant polyamine metabolism for anticancer therapy that will have considerable clinical promise. SMO (spermine oxidase) plays an essential role in regulating the polyamines homeostasis. Therefore, development of SMO inhibitors has increasingly attracted much attention. Previously, we successfully purified and characterised SMO. Here, we presented an in silico drug discovery pipeline by combining pharmacophore modelling and molecular docking for the virtual screening of SMO inhibitors. In vitro evaluation showed that N-(3-{[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]amino}propyl)-8-quinolinecarboxamide (SI-4650) inhibited SMO enzyme activity, increased substrate spermine content and reduced product spermidine content, indicating that SI-4650 can interfere with polyamine metabolism. Furthermore, SI-4650 treatment suppressed cell proliferation and migration. Mechanistically, SI-4650 caused cell cycle arrest, induced cell apoptosis, and promoted autophagy. These results demonstrated the properties of interfering with polyamine metabolism of SI-4650 as a SMO inhibitor and the potential for cancer treatment."

      "Germanium has long been regarded as a promising laser material for silicon based opto-electronics. It is CMOS-compatible and has a favourable band structure, which can be tuned by strain or alloying with Sn to become direct, as it was found to be required for interband semiconductor lasers. Here, we report lasing in the mid-infrared region (from λ = 3.20 μm up to λ = 3.66 μm) in tensile strained Ge microbridges uniaxially loaded above 5.4% up to 5.9% upon optical pumping, with a differential quantum efficiency close to 100% with a lower bound of 50% and a maximal operating temperature of 100 K. We also demonstrate the effect of a non-equilibrium electron distribution in k-space which reveals the importance of directness for lasing. With these achievements the strained Ge approach is shown to compare well to GeSn, in particular in terms of efficiency."

      "OBJECTIVE:Using MAL-ED (Etiology, Risk Factors, and Interactions of Enteric Infections and Malnutrition and the Consequences for Child Health) Bangladesh birth cohort data, we sought to measure the relative contributions of the most predictive correlates of stunting to mean length-for-age z (LAZ) score difference between stunted and non-stunted children at 24 months of age. SETTING:Dhaka, Bangladesh PARTICIPANTS: 211 slum-dwelling children enrolled within 17 days of their birth. VARIABLES AND METHOD:The explanatory variables were identified from the following groups: maternal characteristics, birth characteristics, macronutrient intake, socioeconomic status, morbidity and serum micronutrient level. At step 1, predictive correlates of stunting were identified longitudinally (from 9 to 24 months of age) using generalized estimating equations (GEE) model. Then, the relative contributions of the most predictive correlates of stunting to mean LAZ score difference between stunted and non-stunted children at 24 months of age was measured using Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition analysis RESULTS: The GEE multivariable model identified maternal height, birth weight, people per room, gender, having separate room for kitchen and energy intake as the most predictive correlates of stunting. At 24 months, mean LAZ score difference between stunted and non-stunted children was 1.48. The variable by variable decomposition of the LAZ gap identified maternal height (coefficient: -3.04; 95% CI: 0.35 to -6.44), birth weight (coefficient: -0.21; 95% CI: 0.88 to -1.30), people per room (coefficient: 0.31; 95% CI: 0.92 to -0.30) and energy intake (coefficient: -0.12; 95% CI: 0.22 to -0.46) as the top most factors responsible for the mean LAZ score difference between stunted and non-stunted children at 24 months of age. CONCLUSIONS:The relative contributions of maternal height and birth weight to LAZ gap signifies that improvement in nutritional status of a women during her adolescence and pregnancy would have an impact on birth weight of her offspring, and ultimately, on linear growth of the child."

      "This work demonstrates that black phosphorene, a two dimensional allotrope of phosphorus, has the potential to be an efficient photo-thermionic emitter. To investigate and understand the novel aspects we use a combined approach in which ab initio quantum simulation tools are utilized along with semiclassical description for the emission process. First by using density functional theory based formalism, we study the band structure of phosphorene. From the locations of electronic bands, and band edges, we estimate the Fermi level and work function. This leads us to define a valid material specific parameter space and establish a formalism for estimating thermionic electron emission current from phosphorene. Finally we demonstrate how the emission current can be enhanced substantially under the effect of photon irradiation. We observe that photoemission flux to strongly dominate over its coexisting counterpart thermionic emission flux. Anisotropy in phosphorene structure plays important role in enhancing the flux. The approach which is valid over a much wider range of parameters is successfully tested against recently performed experiments in a different context. The results open up a new possibility for application of phosphorene based thermionic and photo-thermionic energy converters."

      "BACKGROUND:B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia 11A (BCL11A) is a C2H2-type zinc-finger transcription factor protein that is a critical modulator of haemoglobin switching and suppresses the production of foetal haemoglobin. Variation in the BCL11A gene ameliorates the severity of sickle cell disease (SCD) and β-thalassemia (β-thal). The BCL11A gene is located on chromosome 2p16.1 and encodes an 835-amino acid protein. METHOD:Using state-of-the-art in silico tools, this study examined the most pathogenic non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) that disrupt the BCL11A protein and mediate foetal-to-adult globin switching. A total of 11,463 SNPs were retrieved from the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database (dbSNP). These included 799 in the 5' untranslated region (UTR), 486 in the 3' UTR, and 266 non-synonymous, 189 coding synonymous, six nonsense, and six stop-gained SNPs. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:In silico tools (SIFT, SNAP, PolyPhen-2, PANTHER, I-Mutant, PROVEAN, SNPs&GO, mCSM, and PhD-SNP) predicted the five most-deleterious nsSNPs: rs61742690, rs62142605, rs17028351, rs115666026, and rs74987258. Molecular dynamic simulation and homology modelling of the mutated proteins (S783N, D643N, G451S, K670R, and M313L) of the most deleterious nsSNPs revealed their functional and structural impact. nsSNP rs61742690 was predicted to be the most deleterious, as supported by eight of the nine in silico tools. CONCLUSIONS:Complete failure in the protein-protein interactions with functional partners (KLF1 and others) and significant changes (±100% variation) in the interface energy revealed that rs61742690 (S783N) in the zinc-finger domain is a suitable target for disrupting BCL11A-mediated foetal-to-adult globin switching."

      "Female adders (Vipera berus) are \"capital breeders\" that exhibit delayed maturity and intermittent reproductive frequency. We studied the attainment of sexual maturity, the initiation of annual breeding in mature females, the energy and mortality costs associated with breeding, the length of the reproductive cycle and female lifetime reproductive frequency. We use longitudinal data obtained during an 18-year (2000-2017) mark-recapture study in a large population of adders in northern Belgium. A minority (15%) of the females gave birth to their first litter when they attained the actual age of 3 years, upon surpassing a minimum snout-vent-length of 38 cm. However, most females reproduced for the first time when they were 4 years or older. In mature females, breeding in a given year depends to a large extent on their body condition at the onset of the active season, indicating that a threshold level of energy reserves is necessary to start a reproductive cycle. During breeding years females stop growing, lose about one-third of their initial body mass and are very emaciated after parturition. The decrease in relative body mass was most notable initially in the largest and fattiest females. During the non-breeding years, females forage intensely to rebuild their fat reserves; their abilities to do so will strongly affect whether and when they engage in subsequent reproductive bouts. We used a multistate mark-recapture analytical method to simultaneously estimate the capture and survival rates of breeding and non-breeding females, a necessary procedure to obtain accurate estimates of survival probabilities. The analysis indicated much higher capture rates during the breeding years, but did not reveal a substantial effect of reproductive state on annual survival rates. Although some females were observed to breed in successive years, the reproductive cycle was most often biennial or triennial. However, most females (ca. 70%) that attained sexual maturity reproduced only once during their lifetime, while a minority of the females (ca. 5%) were observed to breed on 3-5 annual occasions. On average, females produced only ca. 1.3 litters during their reproductive lifetime. The short reproductive lifetime is a consequence not only of mortality directly related to the reproductive activities, but also of mortality associated with recovering from the weakened post-parturient body condition during the long intervals (1-2 years) between reproductive bouts."

      "This work investigates multi-resolution methodologies for simulating dimer models. The solvent particles which make up the heat bath interact with the monomers of the dimer either through direct collisions (short-range) or through harmonic springs (long-range). Two types of multi-resolution methodologies are considered in detail: (a) describing parts of the solvent far away from the dimer by a coarser approach; (b) describing each monomer of the dimer by using a model with different level of resolution. These methodologies are then used to investigate the effect of a shared heat bath versus two uncoupled heat baths, one for each monomer. Furthermore, the validity of the multi-resolution methods is discussed by comparison to dynamics of macroscopic Langevin equations."

      "We describe herein the design, multicomponent synthesis and biological studies of new donepezil + chromone + melatonin hybrids as potential agents for Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapy. We have identified compound 14n as promising multitarget small molecule showing strong BuChE inhibition (IC50 = 11.90 ± 0.05 nM), moderate hAChE (IC50 = 1.73 ± 0.34 μM), hMAO A (IC50 = 2.78 ± 0.12 μM), and MAO B (IC50 = 21.29 ± 3.85 μM) inhibition, while keeping a strong antioxidant power (3.04 TE, ORAC test). Consequently, the results reported here support the development of new multitarget Donepezil + Chromone + Melatonin hybrids, such as compound 14n, as a potential drug for AD patients cure."

      "In order to capture the stress-strain response of metallic materials under cyclic loading, it is necessary to consider the cyclic hardening behaviour in the constitutive model. Among different cyclic hardening approaches available in the literature, the Chaboche model proves to be very efficient and convenient to model the kinematic hardening and ratcheting behaviour of materials observed during cyclic loading. The purpose of this study is to determine the material parameters of the Chaboche kinematic hardening material model by using isotropic J2 plasticity and micromechanical crystal plasticity (CP) models as constitutive rules in finite element modelling. As model material, we chose a martensitic steel with a very fine microstructure. Thus, it is possible to compare the quality of description between the simpler J2 plasticity and more complex micromechanical material models. The quality of the results is rated based on the quantitative comparison between experimental and numerical stress-strain hysteresis curves for a rather wide range of loading amplitudes. It is seen that the ratcheting effect is captured well by both approaches. Furthermore, the results show that concerning macroscopic properties, J2 plasticity and CP are equally suited to describe cyclic plasticity. However, J2 plasticity is computationally less expensive whereas CP finite element analysis provides insight into local stresses and plastic strains on the microstructural length scale. With this study, we show that a consistent material description on the microstructural and the macroscopic scale is possible, which will enable future scale-bridging applications, by combining both constitutive rules within one single finite element model."

      "Poly(limonene carbonate) (PLC) has been highlighted as an attractive substitute to petroleum derived plastics, due to its utilisation of CO2 and bio-based limonene as feedstocks, offering an effective carbon capture and utilisation pathway. Our study investigates the techno-economic viability and environmental sustainability of a novel process to produce PLC from citrus waste derived limonene, coupled with an anaerobic digestion process to enable energy cogeneration and waste recovery maximisation. Computational process design was integrated with a life cycle assessment to identify the sustainability improvement opportunities. PLC production was found to be economically viable, assuming sufficient citrus waste is supplied to the process, and environmentally preferable to polystyrene (PS) in various impact categories including climate change. However, it exhibited greater environmental burdens than PS across other impact categories, although the environmental performance could be improved with a waste recovery system, at the cost of a process design shift towards energy generation. Finally, our study quantified the potential contribution of PLC to mitigating the escape of atmospheric CO2 concentration from the planetary boundary. We emphasise the importance of a holistic approach to process design and highlight the potential impacts of biopolymers, which is instrumental in solving environmental problems facing the plastic industry and building a sustainable circular economy."

      "This paper presents simplified finite-element analysis procedures based on geometrical nonlinearity and ductile Mohr-Coulomb-Davis plasticity for analysis of bending behaviour of steel pipes subjected to lateral soil loading. A simple, and easy to implement, user-defined subroutine to represent soil stiffness using the Janbu model is also presented and discussed. The development of a three-dimensional (3D) finite-element model is presented, and its evaluation against experimental measurements is discussed. Data are presented for different burial depths of the pipe, including soil loading on the pipe as well as 3D responses, longitudinal bending deflections and pressure distribution along the pipe. It was shown that numerical analyses which include soil modulus dependency on confining pressure lead to effective 3D calculations of pulling forces, bending moments along the pipeline and flexural deformations, based on measured soil parameters. The 3D analysis model requires the use of lower order (linear displacement) elements, which overestimated peak mobilized load. However, those 3D calculations effectively provided the progress of both the load-deflection and longitudinal bending response of the steel pipe at embedment ratios up to 5 where most energy pipelines are buried."

      "Plasmodium falciparum adenylosuccinate lyase (PfADSL) is an important enzyme in purine metabolism. Although several benzimidazole derivatives have been commercially developed into drugs, the template design as inhibitor against PfADSL has not been fully explored. This study aims to model the 3-dimensional (3D) structure of PfADSL, design and predict in silico absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) of 8 substituted benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl)methyl)benzimidamide compounds as well as predict the potential interaction modes and binding affinities of the designed ligands with the modelled PfADSL. PfADSL 3D structure was modelled using SWISS-MODEL, whereas the compounds were designed using ChemDraw Professional. ADMET predictions were done using OSIRIS Property Explorer and Swiss ADME, whereas molecular docking was done with AutoDock Tools. All designed compounds exhibited good in silico ADMET properties, hence can be considered safe for drug development. Binding energies ranged from -6.85 to -8.75 kcal/mol. Thus, they could be further synthesised and developed into active commercial antimalarial drugs."

      "The aerial parts of Tetrastigma hemsleyanum (APTH) have been used as a functional tea in China. The purpose of the current study was to identify the bioactive constituents with inhibitory activity against soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which are jointly considered potential therapeutic targets for vascular system diseases. In the present study, 39 compounds (1-39) were isolated from the APTH. Among them, compounds 8, 10, 12, 16, 17, 19, and 32 displayed potential activities, with IC50 values ranging from 4.5 to 9.5 µM, respectively, and all in non-competitive inhibition mode. Compounds 5, 10, 12, 19, and 32 displayed potent iNOS inhibitory effects, with IC50 values ranging from 15.6 to 47.3 µM. The results obtained in this work contribute to a better understanding of the pharmacological activities of T. hemsleyanum and its potential application as a functional food."

      "BACKGROUND:Australia provides health care services for Indigenous peoples as part of its effort to enhance Indigenous peoples' wellbeing. However, biomedical frameworks shape Australia's health care system, often without reference to Indigenous wellbeing priorities. Under Indigenous leadership the Interplay research project explored wellbeing for Indigenous Australians in remote regions, through defining and quantifying Indigenous people's values and priorities. This article aimed to quantify relationships between health care access, mental and physical health, and wellbeing to guide services to enhance wellbeing for Indigenous Australians in remote regions. METHODS:Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers worked with Indigenous people in remote Australia to create a framework of wellbeing priorities. Indigenous community priorities were community, culture and empowerment; these interplay with government priorities for Indigenous development of health, education and employment. The wellbeing framework was further explored in four Indigenous communities through a survey which measured aspects of the wellbeing priorities. Indigenous community researchers administered the survey in their home communities to 841 Indigenous people aged 15 to 34 years from June 2014. From the survey items, exploratory factor analysis was used to develop constructs for mental and physical health, barriers to health care access and wellbeing. Relationships between these constructs were quantified through structural equation modelling. RESULTS:Participants reported high levels of health and physical health (mean scores (3.17/4 [SD 0.96]; and 3.76/4 [SD 0.73]) and wellbeing 8.07/10 [SD 1.94]. Transport and costs comprised the construct for barriers to health care access (mean access score 0.89/1 [SD 0.28]). Structural equation modelling showed that mental health, but not physical health was associated with wellbeing (β = 0.25, P < 0.001; β = - 0.038, P = 0.3). Health care access had an indirect positive relationship with wellbeing through mental health (β = 0.047, P = 0.007). Relationships differed significantly for participants in remote compared with those in very remote communities. CONCLUSIONS:Greater attention to mental health and recognition of the role of services outside the health care sector may have positive impacts on wellbeing for Indigenous people in remote/ very remote Australia. Aggregation of remote and very remote populations may obscure important differences between Indigenous communities."

      "Circular Economy (CE) is a growing topic, especially in the European Union, that promotes the responsible and cyclical use of resources possibly contributing to sustainable development. CE is an umbrella concept incorporating different meanings. Despite the unclear concept, CE is turned into defined action plans supported by specific indicators. To understand what indicators used in CE measure specifically, we propose a classification framework to categorise indicators according to reasoning on what (CE strategies) and how (measurement scope). Despite different types, CE strategies can be grouped according to their attempt to preserve functions, products, components, materials, or embodied energy; additionally, indicators can measure the linear economy as a reference scenario. The measurement scope shows how indicators account for technological cycles with or without a Life Cycle Thinking (LCT) approach; or their effects on environmental, social, or economic dimensions. To illustrate the classification framework, we selected quantitative micro scale indicators from literature and macro scale indicators from the European Union 'CE monitoring framework'. The framework illustration shows that most of the indicators focus on the preservation of materials, with strategies such as recycling. However, micro scale indicators can also focus on other CE strategies considering LCT approach, while the European indicators mostly account for materials often without taking LCT into account. Furthermore, none of the available indicators can assess the preservation of functions instead of products, with strategies such as sharing platforms, schemes for product redundancy, or multifunctionality. Finally, the framework illustration suggests that a set of indicators should be used to assess CE instead of a single indicator."

      "The ability of theoretical chemists to quantitatively model the weak forces between organic molecules is being exploited to predict their crystal structures and estimate their physical properties. Evolving crystal structure prediction methods are increasingly being used to aid the design of organic functional materials and provide information about thermodynamically plausible polymorphs of speciality organic materials to aid, for example, pharmaceutical development. However, the increasingly sophisticated experimental studies for detecting the range of organic solid-state behaviours provide many challenges for improving quantitative theories that form the basis for the computer modelling. It is challenging to calculate the relative thermodynamic stability of different organic crystal structures, let alone understand the kinetic effects that determine which polymorphs can be observed and are practically important. However, collaborations between experiment and theory are reaching the stage of devising experiments to target the first crystallization of new polymorphs or create novel organic molecular materials."

      "7-methoxytacrine-4-pyridinealdoxime (7-MEOTA-4-PA, named hybrid 5C) is a compound formerly synthesized and evaluated in vitro, together with 4-pyridine aldoxime (4-PA) and commercial reactivators of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). This compound was designed with the purpose of being a prophylactic reactivator, capable of interacting with different subdomains of the active site of AChE. To investigate these interactions, theoretical results from docking were first compared with experimental data of hybrid 5C, 4-PA, and two commercial oximes, on the reactivation of human AChE (HssAChE) inhibited by VX. Then, further docking studies, molecular dynamics simulations, and molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area calculations, were carried out to investigate reactivation performances, considering the near attack conformation (NAC) approach, prior to the nucleophilic substitution mechanism. Our results helped to elucidate the interactions of such molecules with the different subdomains of the active site of HssAChE. Additionally, NAC poses of each oxime were suggested for further theoretical studies on the reactivation reaction."

      "Although solvent-free mechanochemical synthesis continues to gain ever greater importance, the molecular scale processes that occur during such reactions remain largely uncharacterised. Here, we apply computational modelling to indentations between particles of crystals of aspirin and meloxicam under a variety of conditions to mimic the early stages of their mechanochemical cocrystallisation reaction. The study also extends to the effects of the presence of small amounts of solvent. It is found that, despite the solid crystalline nature of the reactants and the presence of little or no solvent, mixing occurs readily at the molecular level even during relatively low-energy collisions. When indented crystals are subsequently drawn apart, a connective neck formed by a mixture of the reactant molecules is observed, suggesting plastic-like behaviour of the reacting materials. Overall the work reveals some striking new insights including (i) relatively facile mixing of crystals under solvent-free conditions, (ii) no appreciable local temperature increases, (iii) localised amorphisation at the contact region and neck of the reacting crystals, and (iv) small amounts of solvent have relatively little effect during this early stage of the reaction, suggesting that their accelerating effect on the reaction may be exerted at later stages."

      "Head collisions in sport can result in catastrophic injuries to the cervical spine. Musculoskeletal modelling can help analyse the relationship between motion, external forces and internal loads that lead to injury. However, impact specific musculoskeletal models are lacking as current viscoelastic values used to describe cervical spine joint dynamics have been obtained from unrepresentative quasi-static or static experiments. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a cervical spine musculoskeletal model for use in axial impacts. Cervical spine specimens (C2-C6) were tested under measured sub-catastrophic loads and the resulting 3D motion of the vertebrae was measured. Specimen specific musculoskeletal models were then created and used to estimate the axial and shear viscoelastic (stiffness and damping) properties of the joints through an optimisation algorithm that minimised tracking errors between measured and simulated kinematics. A five-fold cross validation and a Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis were conducted to assess the performance of the newly estimated parameters. The impact-specific parameters were integrated in a population specific musculoskeletal model and used to assess cervical spine loads measured from Rugby union impacts compared to available models. Results of the optimisation showed a larger increase of axial joint stiffness compared to axial damping and shear viscoelastic parameters for all models. The sensitivity analysis revealed that lower values of axial stiffness and shear damping reduced the models performance considerably compared to other degrees of freedom. The impact-specific parameters integrated in the population specific model estimated more appropriate joint displacements for axial head impacts compared to available models and are therefore more suited for injury mechanism analysis."

      "The paper describes an approach to model glue laminated timber (GLT) made of pinewood (softwood), taking into account damage processes in timber and adhesive layers. An example of a pre-cracked beam has been presented. Obtaining necessary material properties has been supported by several finite elements models (FEM), laboratory tests and a wide literature survey. The authors have taken into consideration an orthotropic material with damage for timber lamellas and isotropic traction separation law for bonding layers. Both plane stress CPS8R and COH2D4 finite elements from the Simulia ABAQUS system or mesh density, used in the numerical analyses, have been carefully chosen and tested. The GLT beam model has been verified on the basis of several values, using two types of testing techniques-MTS 809 machine measurements and digital image correlation (DIC). Additional results revision has been provided by measuring a crack shear displacement (CSD), using the original laboratory test setup by the authors' idea. Finally, some conclusions and introductory recommendations for modelling a glue laminated timber in a plane stress have been formulated. The paper is a part of a wider research on timber-polymer composites, which is still under development."

      "Living neuronal networks in dissociated neuronal cultures are widely known for their ability to generate highly robust spatiotemporal activity patterns in various experimental conditions. Such patterns are often treated as neuronal avalanches that satisfy the power scaling law and thereby exemplify self-organized criticality in living systems. A crucial question is how these patterns can be explained and modeled in a way that is biologically meaningful, mathematically tractable and yet broad enough to account for neuronal heterogeneity and complexity. Here we derive and analyse a simple network model that may constitute a response to this question. Our derivations are based on few basic phenomenological observations concerning the input-output behavior of an isolated neuron. A distinctive feature of the model is that at the simplest level of description it comprises of only two variables, the network activity variable and an exogenous variable corresponding to energy needed to sustain the activity, and few parameters such as network connectivity and efficacy of signal transmission. The efficacy of signal transmission is modulated by the phenomenological energy variable. Strikingly, this simple model is already capable of explaining emergence of network spikes and bursts in developing neuronal cultures. The model behavior and predictions are consistent with published experimental evidence on cultured neurons. At the larger, cellular automata scale, introduction of the energy-dependent regulatory mechanism results in the overall model behavior that can be characterized as balancing on the edge of the network percolation transition. Network activity in this state shows population bursts satisfying the scaling avalanche conditions. This network state is self-sustainable and represents energetic balance between global network-wide processes and spontaneous activity of individual elements."

      "Biomechanical models with different levels of complexity are of advantage to understand the underlying principles of legged locomotion. Following a minimalistic approach of gradually increasing model complexity based on Template & Anchor concept, in this paper, a spring-loaded inverted pendulum-based walking model is extended by a rigid trunk, hip muscles and reflex control, called nmF (neuromuscular force modulated compliant hip) model. Our control strategy includes leg force feedback to activate hip muscles (originated from the FMCH approach), and a discrete linear quadratic regulator for adapting muscle reflexes. The nmF model demonstrates human-like walking kinematic and dynamic features such as the virtual pendulum (VP) concept, inherited from the FMCH model. Moreover, the robustness against postural perturbations is two times higher in the nmF model compared to the FMCH model and even further increased in the adaptive nmF model. This is due to the intrinsic muscle dynamics and the tuning of the reflex gains. With this, we demonstrate, for the first time, the evolution of mechanical template models (e.g. VP concept) to a more physiological level (nmF model). This shows that the template model can be successfully used to design and control robust locomotor systems with more realistic system behaviours."

      "Metoprolol {systematic name: (RS)-1-isopropylamino-3-[4-(2-methoxyethyl)phenoxy]propan-2-ol}, C15H25NO3, is a cardioselective β1-adrenergic blocking agent that shares part of its molecular skeleton with a large number of other β-blockers. Results from its solid-state characterization by single-crystal and variable-temperature powder X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry are presented. Its molecular and crystal arrangements have been further investigated by molecular modelling, by a Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) survey and by Hirshfeld surface analysis. In the crystal, the side arm bearing the isopropyl group, which is common to other β-blockers, adopts an all-trans conformation, which is the most stable arrangement from modelling data. The crystal packing of metoprolol is dominated by an O-H...N/N...H-O pair of hydrogen bonds (as also confirmed by a Hirshfeld surface analysis), which gives rise to chains containing alternating R and S metoprolol molecules extending along the b axis, supplemented by a weaker O...H-N/N-H...O pair of interactions. In addition, within the same stack of molecules, a C-H...O contact, partially oriented along the b and c axes, links homochiral molecules. Amongst the solid-state structures of molecules structurally related to metoprolol deposited in the CSD, the β-blocker drug betaxolol shows the closest analogy in terms of three-dimensional arrangement and interactions. Notwithstanding their close similarity, the crystal lattices of the two drugs respond differently on increasing temperature: metoprolol expands anisotropically, while for betaxolol, an isotropic thermal expansion is observed."

      "Quantifications of in-situ denudation rates on vertical headwalls, averaged over millennia, have been thwarted because of inaccessibility. Here, we benefit from a tunnel crossing a large and vertical headwall in the European Alps (Eiger), where we measured concentrations of in-situ cosmogenic 36Cl along five depth profiles linking the tunnel with the headwall surface. Isotopic concentrations of 36Cl are low in surface samples, but high at depth relative to expectance for their position. The results of Monte-Carlo modelling attribute this pattern to inherited nuclides, young minimum exposure ages and to fast average denudation rates during the last exposure. These rates are consistently high across the Eiger and range from 45 ± 9 cm kyr-1 to 356 ± 137 cm kyr-1 (1σ) for the last centuries to millennia. These high rates together with the large inheritance point to a mechanism where denudation has been accomplished by frequent, cm-scale rock fall paired with chemical dissolution of limestone."

      "In the absence of traditional communication infrastructures, the choice of available technologies for building data collection and control systems in remote areas is very limited. This paper reviews and analyzes protocols and technologies for transferring Internet of Things (IoT) data and presents an architecture for a hybrid IoT-satellite network, which includes a long range (LoRa) low power wide area network (LPWAN) terrestrial network for data collection and an Iridium satellite system for backhaul connectivity. Simulation modelling, together with a specialized experimental stand, allowed us to study the applicability of different methods of information presentation for the case of transmitting IoT data over low-speed satellite communication channels. We proposed a data encoding and packaging scheme called GDEP (Gateway Data Encoding and Packaging). It is based on the combination of data format conversion at the connection points of a heterogeneous network and message packaging. GDEP enabled the reduction of the number of utilized Short Burst Data (SBD) containers and the overall transmitted data size by almost five times."

      "We propose a new computational method for exploring chromatin structural organization based on Markov State Modelling of Hi-C data represented as an interaction network between genomic loci. A Markov process describes the random walk of a traveling probe in the corresponding energy landscape, mimicking the motion of a biomolecule involved in chromatin function. By studying the metastability of the associated Markov State Model upon annealing, the hierarchical structure of individual chromosomes is observed, and corresponding set of structural partitions is identified at each level of hierarchy. Then, the notion of effective interaction between partitions is derived, delineating the overall topology and architecture of chromosomes. Mapping epigenetic data on the graphs of intra-chromosomal effective interactions helps in understanding how chromosome organization facilitates its function. A sketch of whole-genome interactions obtained from the analysis of 539 partitions from all 23 chromosomes, complemented by distributions of gene expression regulators and epigenetic factors, sheds light on the structure-function relationships in chromatin, delineating chromosomal territories, as well as structural partitions analogous to topologically associating domains and active / passive epigenomic compartments. In addition to the overall genome architecture shown by effective interactions, the affinity between partitions of different chromosomes was analyzed as an indicator of the degree of association between partitions in functionally relevant genomic interactions. The overall static picture of whole-genome interactions obtained with the method presented in this work provides a foundation for chromatin structural reconstruction, for the modelling of chromatin dynamics, and for exploring the regulation of genome function. The algorithms used in this study are implemented in a freely available Python package ChromaWalker (https://bitbucket.org/ZhenWahTan/chromawalker)."

Hence, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is used to determine aerobic fitness of young patients as part of the clinical management of CF. However, at present there is a lack of conclusive evidence for one limiting system of aerobic fitness for CF patients at individual patient level. Here, we perform detailed data analysis that allows us to identify important systems-level factors that affect aerobic fitness. We use patients' data and principal component analysis to confirm the dependence of CPET performance on variables associated with ventilation and metabolic rates of oxygen consumption. We find that the time at which participants cross the gas exchange threshold (GET) is well correlated with their overall performance. Furthermore, we propose a predictive modelling framework that captures the relationship between ventilatory dynamics, lung capacity and function and performance in CPET within a group of children and adolescents with CF. Specifically, we show that using Gaussian processes (GP) we can predict GET at the individual patient level with reasonable accuracy given the small sample size of the available group of patients. We conclude by presenting an example and future perspectives for improving and extending the proposed framework. The modelling and analysis have the potential to pave the way to designing personalised exercise programmes that are tailored to specific individual needs relative to patient's treatment therapies."

      "Breast cancer is a leading cancer type and one of the major health issues faced by women around the world. Some of its major risk factors include body mass index, hormone replacement therapy, family history and germline mutations. Of these risk factors, estrogen levels play a crucial role. Among the estrogen receptors, estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) is known to interact with tumor suppressor protein p53 directly thereby repressing its function. Previously, we have studied the impact of deleterious breast cancer-associated non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsnps) rs11540654 (R110P), rs17849781 (P278A) and rs28934874 (P151T) in TP53 gene on the p53 DNA-binding core domain. In the present study, we aimed to analyze the impact of these mutations on p53-ERα interaction. To this end, we, have modelled the full-length structure of human p53 and validated its quality using PROCHECK and subjected it to energy minimization using NOMAD-Ref web server. Three-dimensional structure of ERα activation function-2 (AF-2) domain was downloaded from the protein data bank. Interactions between the modelled native and mutant (R110P, P278A, P151T) p53 with ERα was studied using ZDOCK. Machine learning predictions on the interactions were performed using Weka software. Results from the protein-protein docking showed that the atoms, residues and solvent accessibility surface area (SASA) at the interface was increased in both p53 and ERα for R110P mutation compared to the native complexes indicating that the mutation R110P has more impact on the p53-ERα interaction compared to the other two mutants. Mutations P151T and P278A, on the other hand, showed a large deviation from the native p53-ERα complex in atoms and residues at the surface. Further, results from artificial neural network analysis showed that these structural features are important for predicting the impact of these three mutations on p53-ERα interaction. Overall, these three mutations showed a large deviation in total SASA in both p53 and ERα. In conclusion, results from our study will be crucial in making the decisions for hormone-based therapies against breast cancer."

      "A vibration-based bridge scour detection procedure using a cantilever-based piezoelectric energy harvesting device (EHD) is proposed here. This has an advantage over an accelerometer-based method in that potentially, the requirement for a power source can be negated with the only power requirement being the storage and/or transmission of the data. Ideally, this source of power could be fulfilled by the EHD itself, although much research is currently being done to explore this. The open-circuit EHD voltage is used here to detect bridge frequency shifts arising due to scour. Using one EHD attached to the central bridge pier, both scour at the pier of installation and scour at another bridge pier can be detected from the EHD voltage generated during the bridge free-vibration stage, while the harvester is attached to a healthy pier. The method would work best with an initial modal analysis of the bridge structure in order to identify frequencies that may be sensitive to scour. Frequency components corresponding to harmonic loading and electrical interference arising from experiments are removed using the filter bank property of singular spectrum analysis (SSA). These frequencies can then be monitored by using harvested voltage from the energy harvesting device and successfully utilised towards structural health monitoring of a model bridge affected by scour."

      "Around liquid particles in a fluid of contrasting properties (for example, oil in water) in ultrasonic fields there are small regions where thermal waves can propagate with relatively high amplitudes. Herein, we demonstrate the existence and character of these waveforms using three-dimensional finite element modelling based on linearised Navier-Stokes equations. We investigate single particles and small clusters of particles, validating the expected thermal wavelength and the power dissipation due to viscous and thermal effects around the particle. The energy lost due to thermal and viscous dissipation is explored as a function of the average separation distance between the particles (linking to concentration) as well as the applied frequency. The determination of energy loss provides a new method for calculating the attenuation in particle systems. We demonstrate that the effective attenuation of an emulsion in which particles exist in clusters is influenced by the interparticle separation within the cluster, even at the same total particle concentration. Thus, the finite element modelling provides evidence for thermal interactions and their effect in correlated particle systems."

      "BACKGROUND:Many dietary recommendations for weight control rely on the assumption that greater core food intake will displace intake of energy-dense discretionary foods and beverages. However, there is little evidence to support these assumptions. This study examined the naturalistic relationship between daily core and discretionary energy intake, and with discretionary food and discretionary beverage intake, separately. The impact of weight status on these associations was also examined. METHOD:One hundred participants completed a four-day (non-consecutive) estimated food diary. Discretionary foods and beverages were identified by reference to the Australian Dietary Guidelines. Non-discretionary items were considered core items. Simultaneous-equation random effects models using disaggregated dietary data controlling for sociodemographic variables were used to determine the association between various dietary components. RESULT:Core energy intake correlated negatively with discretionary energy intake (cross-equation correlation, ρ = -0.49 (95% CI: -0.57, -0.39)). Its correlation with discretionary foods (-0.47 (-0.56, -0.37)) was stronger than that with discretionary beverages (-0.19 (-0.30, -0.07)) The correlation between core energy intake and discretionary energy intake was significantly stronger in participants who did not have obesity (-0.67 (-0.71, -0.50)) than those with obesity (-0.32 (-0.46, -0.17)) (p = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS:Core and discretionary energy intake share an inverse and potentially bidirectional, relationship that appears to be stronger with discretionary foods than discretionary beverages. These relationships were significantly weaker in participants with obesity which may indicate less precise dietary compensation in these individuals. While strategies that promote greater intake of core foods may assist with weight maintenance in individuals of healthy weight, its impact in individuals with obesity may be limited. These strategies should be accompanied by direct messages to reduce commensurately the intake of discretionary items, with special attention paid to discretionary beverage consumption."

      "Self-compacting concrete (SCC) is increasingly applied in the construction industries dueto its advantages of outstanding workability and eco-friendliness. However, few experimentalstudies on the mechanical behaviors of SCC under cyclic direct tension are available in theliterature. In this work, experimental investigations of mechanical behaviors of SCC under cyclicdirect tension were conducted. Especially, direct tensile load equipment was developed. It is foundthat the envelope stress-strain curve under cyclic direct tension is close to that under monotonicdirect tension; however, it is different from that in a compressive case. It is also revealed that theratio of unloading strain to irreversible strain is approximately linearly dependent on unloadingstrain. The evolutions of energy dissipation for SCC under both cyclic direct tension andcompression are similar to those of normally vibrated concrete. In addition, Poisson's ratio isobserved to be nearly 0.21 for SCC. Furthermore, a damage model enabling characterization of thestress-strain curve under both monotonic and cyclic loading was proposed and verified againstexperimental results. Therefore, the results in this work provide original research material forstudying and modelling the mechanical behaviors of SCC under uniaxial cyclic direct tension."

      "Polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) is a thermoplastic formed by polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and ethylene glycol and known for his high impact resistance and ductility. The printability of PETG for fused deposition modelling (FDM) is studied by monitoring the filament temperature using an infra-red camera. The microstructural arrangement of 3D printed PETG is analysed by means of X-ray micro-tomography and tensile performance is investigated in a wide range of printing temperatures from 210 °C to 255 °C. A finite element model is implemented based on 3D microstructure of the printed material to reveal the deformation mechanisms and the role of the microstructural defects on the mechanical performance. The results show that PETG can be printed within a limited range of printing temperatures. The results suggest a significant loss of the mechanical performance due to the FDM processing and particularly a substantial reduction of the elongation at break is observed. The loss of this property is explained by the inhomogeneous deformation of the PETG filament. X-ray micro-tomography results reveal a limited amount of process-induced porosity, which only extends through the sample thickness. The FE predictions point out the combination of local shearing and inhomogeneous stretching that are correlated to the filament arrangement within the plane of construction."

      "The ureolytic activity of Neurospora crassa results in an alkaline carbonate-rich culture medium which can precipitate soluble metals as insoluble carbonates. Such carbonates are smaller, often of nanoscale dimensions, than metal carbonates synthesized abiotically which infers that fungal excreted products can markedly affect particle size. In this work, it was found that amino acid excretion was a significant factor in affecting the particle size of copper carbonate. Eleven different amino acids were found to be secreted by Neurospora crassa, and L-glutamic acid, L-aspartic acid and L-cysteine were chosen to examine the impact of amino acids on the morphology and chemical composition of copper carbonate minerals. X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to characterize the obtained copper carbonate samples. Copper carbonate nanoparticles with a diameter of 100-200 nm were produced with L-glutamic acid, and the presence of L-glutamic acid was found to stabilize these particles in the early phase of crystal growth and prevent them from aggregation. FTIR and TG analysis revealed that the amino acid moieties were intimately associated with the copper mineral particles. Component analysis of the final products of TG analysis of the copper minerals synthesized under various conditions showed the ultimate formation of Cu, Cu2O and Cu2S, suggesting a novel synthesis method for producing these useful Cu-containing materials."

      "Streamlines, vortex lines and magnetic flux tubes in turbulent fluids and plasmas display a great amount of coiling, twisting and linking, raising the question as to whether their topological complexity (continually created and destroyed by reconnections) can be quantified. In superfluid helium, the discrete (quantized) nature of vorticity can be exploited to associate to each vortex loop a knot invariant called the Alexander polynomial whose degree characterizes the topology of that vortex loop. By numerically simulating the dynamics of a tangle of quantum vortex lines, we find that this quantum turbulence always contains vortex knots of very large degree which keep forming, vanishing and reforming, creating a distribution of topologies which we quantify in terms of a knot spectrum and its scaling law. We also find results analogous to those in the wider literature, demonstrating that the knotting probability of the vortex tangle grows with the vortex length, as for macromolecules, and saturates above a characteristic length, as found for tumbled strings."

      "Camouflage is a key defence across taxa and frequently critical to survival. A common strategy is background matching, resembling the colour and pattern of the environment. This approach, however, may be ineffective in complex habitats where matching one patch may lead to increased visibility in other patches. In contrast, disruptive coloration, which disguises body outlines, may be effective against complex backgrounds. These ideas have rarely been tested and previous work focuses on artificial systems. Here, we test the camouflage strategies of the shore crab (Carcinus maenas) in two habitats, being a species that is highly variable, capable of plastic changes in appearance, and lives in multiple environments. Using predator (bird and fish) vision modelling and image analysis, we quantified background matching and disruption in crabs from rock pools and mudflats, predicting that disruption would dominate in visually complex rock pools but background matching in more uniform mudflats. As expected, rock pool individuals had significantly higher edge disruption than mudflat crabs, whereas mudflat crabs more closely matched the substrate than rock pool crabs for colour, luminance, and pattern. Our study demonstrates facultative expression of camouflage strategies dependent on the visual environment, with implications for the evolution and interrelatedness of defensive strategies."

      "The rapid response of photosynthetic organisms to fluctuations in ambient light intensity is incompletely understood at both the molecular and membrane levels. In this review, we describe research from our group over a 10-year period aimed at identifying the photophysical mechanisms used by plants, algae and mosses to control the efficiency of light harvesting by photosystem II on the seconds-to-minutes time scale. To complement the spectroscopic data, we describe three models capable of describing the measured response at a quantitative level. The review attempts to provide an integrated view that has emerged from our work, and briefly looks forward to future experimental and modelling efforts that will refine and expand our understanding of a process that significantly influences crop yields."

      "This article aims to model the thermal behaviour of a wall using deep learning techniques. The Fourier theoretical model which is traditionally used to model such enclosures is not capable of considering several factors that affect a prediction that is often incorrect. These results motivate us to try to obtain a better thermal model of the enclosure. For this reason, a connexionist model is provided capable of modelling the behaviour of the enclosure from actual observed temperature data. For the training of this model, several measurements have been obtained over the course of more than one year in a specific enclosure, distributing the readings among the different layers of it. In this work, the predictions of both the theoretical model and the connexionist model have been tested, contrasting them with the measurements obtained previously. It has been observed that the connexionist model substantially improves the theoretical predictions of the Fourier method, thus allowing better approximations to be made regarding the real energy consumption of the building and, in general, the prediction of the energy behaviour of the enclosure."

      "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), also known as human herpesvirus 4 (HHV-4), is a member of the Herpesviridae family and causes infectious mononucleosis, Burkitt's lymphoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Even in the United States of America, the situation is alarming, as EBV affects 95% of the young population between 35 and 40 years of age. In this study, both linear and conformational B-cell epitopes as well as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes were predicted by using the ElliPro and NetCTL.1.2 webservers for EBV proteins (GH, GL, GB, GN, GM, GP42 and GP350). Molecular modelling tools were used to predict the 3D coordinates of peptides, and these peptides were then docked against the MHC molecules to obtain peptide-MHC complexes. Studies of their post-docking interactions helped to select potential candidates for the development of peptide vaccines. Our results predicted a total of 58 T-cell epitopes of EBV;  where the most potential were selected based on their TAP, MHC binding and C-terminal Cleavage score. The top most peptides were subjected to MD simulation and stability analysis. Validation of our predicted epitopes using a 0.45 µM concentration was carried out by using a systems biology approach. Our results suggest a panel of epitopes that could be used to immunize populations to protect against multiple diseases caused by EBV."

      "An improved red blood cell (RBC) membrane model is developed based on the bilayer coupling model (BCM) to accurately predict the complete sequence of stomatocyte-discocyte-echinocyte (SDE) transformation of a RBC. The coarse-grained (CG)-RBC membrane model is proposed to predict the minimum energy configuration of the RBC from the competition between lipid-bilayer bending resistance and cytoskeletal shear resistance under given reference constraints. In addition to the conventional membrane surface area, cell volume and bilayer-leaflet-area-difference constraints, a new constraint: total-membrane-curvature is proposed in the model to better predict RBC shapes in agreement with experimental observations. A quantitative evaluation of several cellular measurements including length, thickness and shape factor, is performed for the first time, between CG-RBC model predicted and three-dimensional (3D) confocal microscopy imaging generated RBC shapes at equivalent reference constraints. The validated CG-RBC membrane model is then employed to investigate the effect of reduced cell volume and elastic length scale on SDE transformation, to evaluate the RBC deformability during SDE transformation, and to identify the most probable RBC cytoskeletal reference state. The CG-RBC membrane model can predict the SDE shape behaviour under diverse shape-transforming scenarios, in-vitro RBC storage, microvascular circulation and flow through microfluidic devices."

      "OBJECTIVE:To estimate the impact of the UK government's sugar reduction programme on child and adult obesity, adult disease burden, and healthcare costs. DESIGN:Modelling study. SETTING:Simulated scenario based on National Diet and Nutrition Survey waves 5 and 6, England. PARTICIPANTS:1508 survey respondents were used to model weight change among the population of England aged 4-80 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:Calorie change, weight change, and body mass index change were estimated for children and adults. Impact on non-communicable disease incidence, quality adjusted life years, and healthcare costs were estimated for adults. Changes to disease burden were modelled with the PRIMEtime-CE Model, based on the 2014 population in England aged 18-80. RESULTS:If the sugar reduction programme was achieved in its entirety and resulted in the planned sugar reduction, then the calorie reduction was estimated to be 25 kcal/day (1 kcal=4.18 kJ=0.00418 MJ) for 4-10 year olds (95% confidence interval 23 to 26), 25 kcal/day (24 to 28) for 11-18 year olds, and 19 kcal/day (17 to 20) for adults. The reduction in obesity could represent 5.5% of the baseline obese population of 4-10 year olds, 2.2% of obese 11-18 year olds, and 5.5% of obese 19-80 year olds. A modelled 51 729 quality adjusted life years (95% uncertainty interval 45 768 to 57 242) were saved over 10 years, including 154 550 (132 623 to 174 604) cases of diabetes and relating to a net healthcare saving of £285.8m (€332.5m, $373.5m; £249.7m to £319.8m). CONCLUSIONS:The UK government's sugar reduction programme could reduce the burden of obesity and obesity related disease, provided that reductions in sugar levels and portion sizes do not prompt unanticipated changes in eating patterns or product formulation."

      "In the last few decades, multiscale modelling has emerged as one of the dominant modelling paradigms in many areas of science and engineering. Its rise to dominance is primarily driven by advancements in computing power and the need to model systems of increasing complexity. The multiscale modelling paradigm is now accompanied by a vibrant ecosystem of multiscale computing software (MCS) which promises to address many challenges in the development of multiscale applications. In this paper, we define the common steps in the multiscale application development process and investigate to what degree a set of 21 representative MCS tools enhance each development step. We observe several gaps in the features provided by MCS tools, especially for application deployment and the preparation and management of production runs. In addition, we find that many MCS tools are tailored to a particular multiscale computing pattern, even though they are otherwise application agnostic. We conclude that the gaps we identify are characteristic of a field that is still maturing and features that enhance the deployment and production steps of multiscale application development are desirable for the long-term success of MCS in its application fields. This article is part of the theme issue 'Multiscale modelling, simulation and computing: from the desktop to the exascale'."

      "Research in the field of hydrate formation requires more focus upon its modelling to enable the researchers to predict and assess the hydrate formation and its characteristics. The main focus of the study was to analyze the deviations induced in various parameters related to hydrate nucleation caused by the choice of different measuring correlations or methods of their sub-components. To serve this purpose under a range of operational conditions, parameters of hydrate nucleation such as rates of nucleation and crystal growth, critical radius of the nucleus, and theoretical induction time for carbon dioxide and methane were considered in this study. From these measurements, we have quantitatively compared the ease of hydrate formation in CO₂ and CH₄ systems in terms of nucleation while analyzing how various correlations for intermediate parameters were affecting the final output. Values of these parameters were produced under the considered bracket of operational conditions and distributed among six cases using both general and guest-gas specific correlations for gas dissolution and fugacity and their combinations. The isotherms and isobars produced from some of the cases differed from each other considerably. The rate of nucleation in one case showed an exponential deviation with a value over 1 × 1028 at 5 MPa, while the rest showed values as multiples of 10⁶. These deviations explain how sensitive hydrate formation is to processing variables and their respective correlations, highlighting the importance of understanding the applicability of semi-empirical correlations. An attempt was made to define the induction time from a theoretical perspective and derive a relevant equation from the existing models. This equation was validated and analyzed within these six cases from the experimental observations."

      "The demand for electricity has been rising significantly over the past years and it is expected to rise further in the coming years due to economic and societal development. Smart grid technology is being developed in order to meet the rising electricity requirement. In order for the smart grid to perform its full functions, the Energy Management Systems (EMSs), especially Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) are essential. It is necessary to understand the energy demand of the loads and the energy supply either from the national grid or from renewable energy technologies. To facilitate the Demand Side Management (DSM), Heat Pumps (HP) and air conditioning systems are often utilised for heating and cooling in residential houses due to their high-efficiency power output and low CO2 emissions. This paper presents a program for a HEMS using a Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm. A HP is used as the load and the aim of the optimisation program is to minimise the operational cost, i.e., the cost of electricity, while maintaining end-user comfort levels. This paper also details an indoor thermal model for temperature update in the heat pump control program. Real measured data from the UK Government's Renewable Heat Premium Payment (RHPP) scheme was utilised to generate characteristic curves and equations that can represent the data. This paper compares different PSO variants with standard PSO and the unscheduled case calculated from the data for five winter days in 2019. Among all chosen algorithms, the Crossover Subswarm PSO (CSPSO) achieved an average saving of 25.61% compared with the cost calculated from the measured data with a short search time of 1576 ms for each subswarm. It is clear from this work that there is significant scope to reduce the cost of operating a HP while maintaining end user comfort levels."

      "The conditions surrounding oil and gas exploration are becoming more hazardous, especially in oil and gas fields with a high quantity of corrosive components such as CO2. CO2 causes localized corrosion of tools made from metal, rubber and other materials in humid environments; this leads to corrosion failure in metal equipment and downhole tools such as drills pipes, casings and oil pipes, thereby reducing their service life. In this study, the composition, lattice and crystalline forms of corrosion products and corroded materials were analysed using scanning electron microscopy, energy spectrum analysis, X-ray diffraction and polarization curves, in order to investigate the corrosion mechanisms and influential factors for several common tool materials. A CO2 corrosion model was established for two materials and the results were verified with optimal prediction values."

      "The cohesive zone model (CZM) has found wide acceptance as a tool for the simulation of delamination in composites and debonding in bonded joints and various implementations of the cohesive zone model dedicated to fatigue problems have been proposed in the past decade. In previous works, the authors have developed a model based on cohesive zone to simulate the propagation of fatigue defects where damage acts on cohesive stiffness, with an initial (undamaged) stiffness representative of that of the entire thickness of an adhesive layer. In the case of a stiffness that is order of magnitude higher than the previous one (for instance, in the simulation of the ply-to-ply interface in composites), the model prediction becomes inaccurate. In this work, a new formulation of the model that overcomes this limitation is developed. Finite element simulations have been conducted on a mode I, constant bending (constant G)-loaded double cantilever beam (DCB) joint to assess the response of the new model with respect to the original one for varying initial stiffness K₀ and cohesive strength σ₀. The results showed that the modified model is robust with respect to changes of two orders of magnitude in initial stiffness and of a factor of two in σ₀."

      "The start from blocks is a fundamental component of all track and field sprint events (≤ 400 m). This narrative review focusses on biomechanical aspects of the block phase and the subsequent first flight and stance phases. We discuss specific features of technique and how they may be important for a high level of performance during the start. The need to appropriately quantify performance is discussed first; external power has recently become more frequently adopted because it provides a single measure that appropriately accounts for the requirement to increase horizontal velocity as much as possible in as little time as possible. In the \"set\" position, a relatively wide range of body configurations are adopted by sprinters irrespective of their ability level, and between-sprinter differences in these general positions do not appear to be directly associated with block phase performance. Greater average force production during the push against the blocks, especially from the rear leg and particularly the hip, appears to be important for performance. Immediately after exiting the blocks, shorter first flight durations and longer first stance durations (allowing more time to generate propulsive force) are found in sprinters of a higher performance level. During the first stance phase, the ankle and knee both appear to play an important role in energy generation, and higher levels of performance may be associated with a stiffer ankle joint and the ability to extend the knee throughout stance. However, the role of the sprinter's body configuration at touchdown remains unclear, and the roles of strength and anatomy in these associations between technique and performance also remain largely unexplored. Other aspects such as the sex, age and performance level of the studied sprinters, as well as issues with measurement and comparisons with athletes with amputations, are also briefly considered."

      "Numerous studies have highlighted the implications of the glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) in several processes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, GSK-3 has become a crucial therapeutic target for the treatment of this neurodegenerative disorder. Hereby, we report the design and multistep synthesis of ethyl 4-oxo-pyrazolo[4,3-d][1-3]triazine-7-carboxylates and their biological evaluation as GSK-3 inhibitors. Molecular modelling studies allow us to develop this new scaffold optimising the chemical structure. Potential binding mode determination in the enzyme and the analysis of the key features in the catalytic site are also described. Furthermore, the ability of pyrazolotriazinones to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was evaluated by passive diffusion and those who showed great GSK-3 inhibition and permeation to the central nervous system (CNS) showed neuroprotective properties against tau hyperphosphorylation in a cell-based model. These new brain permeable pyrazolotriazinones may be used for key in vivo studies and may be considered as new leads for further optimisation for the treatment of AD."

      "We present a novel approach for identifying a multiaxial thermodynamic magneto-mechanical constitutive law by direct bi- or trivariate spline interpolation from available magnetization and magnetostriction data. Reference data are first produced with a multiscale model in the case of a magnetic field and uniaxial and shear stresses. The thermodynamic model fits well to the results of the multiscale model, after which the models are compared under complex multiaxial loadings. A surprisingly good agreement between the two models is found, but some differences in the magnetostrictive behaviour are also pointed out. Finally, the model is fitted to measurement results from an electrical steel sheet. The spline-based constitutive law overcomes several drawbacks of analytical approaches used earlier. The presented models and measurement results are openly available."
