    "Tau is a microtubule-associated protein whose C-terminal domain consisting of four repeat regions R1, R2, R3 and R4 binds to microtubules to stabilize them. In several neurodegenerative diseases, tau detaches from microtubules to form insoluble aggregates leading to tauopathy. Microtubules are made up of αβ tubulin subunits. Seven α-tubulin and nine β-tubulin isotypes have been reported to be present in humans till date. These tubulin isotypes show residue composition variations mainly at C-terminal region and bind to motor proteins and anti-mitotic drugs differently. These tubulin isotypes show tissue specific expression as their relative proportion varies significantly in different type of cells. It is also known that tau binds differently to different cell lines and can either promote or demote microtubule polymerization. However, the relative binding affinity of tau to the different β-tubulin isotypes present in different cell lines is completely unknown. Here, we study relative binding affinity of Tau repeat region R2 to neuronal specific tubulin isotypes βI, βIIb, and βIII using molecular modelling approach. The order of binding energy of tau with tubulin is βIII > βIIb > βI. Our strategy can be potentially adapted to understand differential binding affinity of tau towards β-tubulin isotypes present in other cell lines."
