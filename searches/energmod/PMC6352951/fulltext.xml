Anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) are the two main eCBs,<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref> which are synthesized on-demand in the plasma membrane and released into the extracellular space. After activating the cannabinoid receptors, eCBs are transported into the cytoplasm and degraded by specific enzymes. AEA is hydrolyzed by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) to arachidonic acid and ethanolamine, whereas 2-AG is predominantly hydrolyzed to arachidonic acid and glycerol by monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) and to a lesser extent by &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; hydrolase-6 and -12 (ABHD6 and ABHD12). The inhibition of eCBs degradation can be considered as a promising pharmacological strategy to activate the ECS limiting the side effects associated with direct receptor agonists.<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2&#x02013;4</sup>
</xref> In addition, MAGL plays a key role in the progression and maintenance of cancer, being overexpressed in many aggressive tumour types. MAGL-catalyzed hydrolysis of monoacylglycerols in the peripheral tissues, such as adipose tissue and liver, provides a pool of free fatty acids, which constitute the building blocks for the formation of cellular membranes of growing tumour cells and for the synthesis of pro-tumorigenic signalling factors.<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref> Therefore, MAGL is an attractive therapeutic target for many pathologies such as neurodegenerative diseases, chronic pain, inflammatory pathologies as well as cancer. In the last years, many MAGL inhibitors were developed, of both synthetic and natural origin,<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">

<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref> although many of them were characterized by an irreversible mechanism of action that hindered their potential subsequent clinical development. In fact, a prolonged MAGL inactivation provokes a chronic increase of 2-AG, which is the endogenous agonist of cannabinoid receptor CB1. The continuous CB1 stimulation by elevated 2-AG concentrations has negative effects, such as loss of therapeutic effects and physical dependence.<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref> Reversible MAGL inhibitors are devoid of these problems and therefore they represent a safer alternative to irreversible inhibitors.<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9&#x02013;11</sup>
</xref> Recently, we tested the reliability of the consensus docking (CD) protocol combining different docking methods. Our results showed that this approach was able to predict ligand binding poses better than the single docking procedures and showed to be a promising strategy for improving performance and hit rates of virtual screening (VS) campaigns.<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> However, due to a sort of symmetry in MAGL binding site, we have recently verified that docking procedures for MAGL inhibitors are not always able to identify a unique ligand-binding disposition, suggesting the presence of two possible orientations that are geometrically opposite but nevertheless equivalent in terms of ligand&#x02013;protein interactions.<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> the enzyme binding site can be roughly schematized as an ellipsoidal shaped cavity where the central residues A51 and M123 form two H-bonds with the carbonyl group of the ligand and all surrounding residues show lipophilic interactions with the inhibitor. In particular, the 2-cyclohexylbenzo[<italic>d</italic>]oxazole fragment of the molecule is inserted into a lipophilic pocket mainly delimited by A151, A156, I179, L213, L214, and L241, whereas the pyrimidine ring establishes a &#x003c0;-&#x003c0; stacking with Y194 and other hydrophobic interactions with L184, V191, and V270. On the basis of the symmetrical features of MAGL binding site, the CD approach might lead to a high number of false negatives, since only compounds showing a unique preferred binding orientation are proposed as potential active ligands. On the other hand, we recently demonstrated that receptor-based fingerprint analysis can improve docking reliability.<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">

In fact, by using this method a whole data set of molecules should be subjected to multiple docking procedures. For this reason, large libraries of compounds require large amount of CPU time. One of the possible solutions for this problem could be the application of a pre-filtering step able to decrease the number of compounds to be analyzed. Recently, we verified the reliability of FLAP software<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> therefore, we used this software as a pre-filter for selecting potential reversible MAGL inhibitors. The Chembridge database (XPRESS-Pick&#x02122; stock database) was subjected to a ligand-based bit-string filtering using as a template the crystal structure of ZYH extracted from the complex with MAGL (3PE6 PDB code).<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref> In a ligand-based bit-string analysis, FLAP compares the template molecule with the whole data set of compounds through the comparison of the molecular interaction fields (MIFs)-based pharmacophoric features translated into fingerprints. The test compounds are then scored on the basis of their fingerprint similarity with respect to the template molecule. By applying this procedure and considering compounds with a Glob-sum score (representing the overall fingerprint similarity) higher than 1.5, 13772 compounds were selected as potential MAGL inhibitors and thus subjected to the CD studies. The docking step was carried out by employing Gold (ChemPLP fitness function), Dock, Fred, and Autodock software, as they already showed reliable results for identifying new MAGL inhibitors.<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref> In a classical CD procedure, the four docking poses obtained for each compound (resulting from the calculations carried out by using the four docking procedures) should be clustered together to search for common binding modes. However, as mentioned in the introduction, MAGL binding site shows a sort of symmetry and, therefore, compounds can interact with the enzyme by assuming two opposite, but yet equivalent, dispositions making the CD approach not particularly reliable. Therefore, instead of applying the classical CD protocol, a fingerprint-based CD approach was tested. More in detail, the interaction of ZYH with MAGL was analyzed and converted into a fingerprint code by means of Binana software.<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>24</sup>
</xref> The main ligand&#x02013;protein interactions identified, i.e. the two H-bonds with A51 or M123, the &#x003c0;&#x02013;&#x003c0; stacking with Y194 and the lipophilic interactions with L213 and L241, were then considered as fundamental for the inhibitory activity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>). Following this hypothesis, all the docking poses previously generated were processed by using Binana and the resulting fingerprints were analyzed employing an in-house software. Only the compounds that showed the &#x003c0;&#x02013;&#x003c0; stacking interaction with Y194, the lipophilic interactions with L213 and L241 and at least one H-bond with A51 and M123 in the binding poses predicted by all four docking procedures, were then considered as potential active MAGL inhibitors. By applying this kind of approach, the compounds that showed different binding dispositions were still considered as potential active compounds, provided that the above-described interactions were displayed by all the different dispositions. Therefore, this kind of optimization of the CD approach should be able to solve the problem generated by the presence of symmetrical binding sites. Following this fingerprint-based CD step only 17 compounds were selected, as they were the only compounds that showed the desired interactions with MAGL in the binding poses predicted by all four docking methods. The low number of compounds that survived this selection step was in agreement with previous studies reported in the literature, where CD was combined with pharmacophore-based/receptor-based post-docking filters, which highlighted the high strictness of this type of approach.<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">

In order to assess the reliability of the two possible binding modes from an energetic point of view, ligand&#x02013;protein binding energy evaluations were performed on the MD trajectories relative to the last 20&#x02009;ns of simulation by using the Molecular Mechanic-Poisson Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) methods. Based on this evaluation (see <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table"/>

), binding mode A appeared to be the most reliable, since its estimated binding energy (&#x00394;PBSA = &#x02212;30.1&#x02009;kcal/mol) was found to be higher than that associated to binding mode B (&#x00394;PBSA = &#x02212;28.6&#x02009;kcal/mol). However, the energy difference was rather modest and could not allow a reliable identification of the most probable binding orientation for this compound.</p><fig id="F0002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Docking of compound <bold>1</bold> into MAGL.

As shown in <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, in agreement with the docking results, both binding modes proved to be possible because both compounds showed inhibition of MAGL activity. However, binding mode A was confirmed to be the preferred one, because compound <bold>4</bold> demonstrated a 5-fold higher activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 6.1&#x02009;&#x003bc;M) than compound <bold>5</bold> (IC<sub>50</sub> = 31.9&#x02009;&#x003bc;M). Furthermore, the 4-fold improvement of activity obtained with compound <bold>4</bold>, with respect to the starting compound <bold>1</bold>, supported the binding disposition suggested for this class of compounds. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(A)</xref>, the compound maintains the interactions required by the fingerprint-based filter, forming H-bonds with both A51 and M123, a &#x003c0;-&#x003c0; stacking with Y194 and lipophilic interactions with L213 and L241 (as well as with L148, L184, I179, and V270). Moreover, the 7-hydroxy group of the ligand shows two additional H-bonds with E53 and H272 that support its higher activity with respect to compound <bold>1</bold>.</p><p>In order to verify whether the compounds could interact with cysteine residues of MAGL enzyme, the activity of the most potent inhibitor <bold>4</bold> was also tested in presence of the thiol-containing agent 1,4-dithio-<sc>dl</sc>-threitol (DTT). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(A)</xref>, the IC<sub>50</sub> value of compound <bold>4</bold> was only very slightly, but not significantly, influenced by the presence of DTT, shifting from 6.1&#x02009;&#x003bc;M when assayed in the absence of DTT to 6.2&#x02009;&#x003bc;M when assayed in the presence of 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;M DTT, thus excluding any significant interaction with MAGL cysteine residues. Furthermore, with the aim of establishing whether the mechanism of inhibition was reversible or irreversible, the effects of preincubation on the inhibitory activity of compound <bold>4</bold> were evaluated. In this assay, the compound was preincubated with the enzyme for 0, 30, and 60&#x02009;min before adding the substrate to start the enzymatic reaction. An irreversible inhibitor should show a higher potency after longer incubation times, whereas a reversible inhibitor should display a constant inhibition potency that is independent from the incubation time. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(B)</xref>, this assay confirmed the reversible property of <bold>4</bold>, as it did not show any significant increase in inhibitory potency at longer incubation times.</p><fig id="F0005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Compound <bold>4</bold>-MAGL inhibition analysis.

The reference compound <bold>CAY10499</bold> was also included in the experiments.

This first step of the study led to the discovery of compound <bold>1</bold> as an interesting MAGL inhibitor. Then, molecular modelling studies guided chemical modifications of the structure of the initial hit compound <bold>1</bold> in order to establish the binding orientation of this ligand. This preliminary analysis highlighted the most probable binding orientation of this class of compounds and led to the discovery of compound <bold>4</bold> as a novel reversible MAGL inhibitor endowed with promising anticancer activity in breast and ovarian cancer cell lines, which can be considered as a lead for the development of new and more potent reversible MAGL inhibitors. Furthermore, these successful screening results suggest that the use of ligand&#x02013;protein interaction fingerprints as a post-docking filter can compensate for the limitations encountered when applying the CD approach on protein targets characterized by a considerable level of symmetry within their binding site. The fingerprint-based CD protocol herein reported may be thus applied in future receptor-based VS studies aimed at developing small-molecule inhibitors of other therapeutically interesting targets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM0805"><caption><title>Supplemental Material</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="IENZ_A_1571271_SM0805.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d37e255" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec id="s0010"><title>Disclosure statement</title><p>No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
