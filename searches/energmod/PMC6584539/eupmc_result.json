    "Understanding the structure-function relationships of RNA has become increasingly important given the realization of its functional role in various cellular processes. Chemical denaturation of RNA by urea has been shown to be beneficial in investigating RNA stability and folding. Elucidation of the mechanism of unfolding of RNA by urea is important for understanding the folding pathways. In addition to studying denaturation of RNA in aqueous urea, it is important to understand the nature and strength of interactions of the building blocks of RNA. In this study, a systematic examination of the structural features and energetic factors involving interactions between nucleobases and urea is presented. Results from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on each of the five DNA/RNA bases in water and eight different concentrations of aqueous urea, and free energy calculations using the thermodynamic integration method are presented. The interaction energies between all the nucleobases with the solvent environment and the transfer free energies become more favorable with respect to increase in the concentration of urea. Preferential interactions of urea versus water molecules with all model systems determined using Kirkwood-Buff integrals and two-domain models indicate preference of urea by nucleobases in comparison to water. The modes of interaction between urea and the nucleobases were analyzed in detail. In addition to the previously identified hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions between urea and nucleobases that stabilize the unfolded states of RNA in aqueous solution, NH-Ï€ interactions are proposed to be important. Dynamic properties of each of these three modes of interactions have been presented. The study provides fundamental insights into the nature of interaction of urea molecules with nucleobases and how it disrupts nucleic acids."
