In the
conditions of heat stress, plants modulate protein processes leading to development of heat tolerance. Of such proteins, the molecular
chaperone functions of HSP70/HSC70 proteins are important where their enhanced expression positively correlates with the acquisition of
heat tolerance. The key players in the regulation of such tailored protein responses of plants to heat stress are the phytohormones. In the
present study, phytohormone mediated interaction of Pennisetum glaucum HSC70 (PgHSC70) protein was performed through docking
studies involving sequence analysis, 3D modeling and model evaluation. In silico analysis has shown better interaction and good binding
energy of PgHSC70 with the phytohormone brassinolide. Furthermore, the predicted structural information can be helpful for future
studies on role of interaction between HSC70 and brassinolide in heat tolerance.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>heat stress</kwd><kwd>HSP70/HSC70</kwd><kwd>phytohormones</kwd><kwd>heat tolerance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Background</title><p>As plants being sessile organisms, they are endlessly exposed to
diverse climatic conditions like drought, salt, heat, flooding, and
oxidative stress. The main abiotic stress, heat, essentially leads to
protein dysfunction, which ultimately impacts the growth of plants,
harvest, and distribution 
[<xref rid="R01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Heat stress lead to serious effects
on protein metabolism, together with inhibition of protein
accumulation, depravity of proteins, and initiation of certain
protein synthesis, depending on the amount and duration of heat
stress [<xref rid="R06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Conservative heat responses include down-regulation
of proteins functioning in cytoskeleton structure, lipid biogenesis,
amino acid biosynthesis, sulfate assimilation, antioxidant response,
and nuclear transport [<xref rid="R08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Moreover, the synthesis of mRNAs and
most of the normal proteins is constrained under heat stress
conditions. The transcription and translation of the heat shock
proteins (HSPs) may either be improved or induced when plants
are exposed to increased temperatures 
[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Heat-shock
proteins (HSPs) function as molecular chaperones in order to
expedite the refolding of impaired proteins, hinder irreversible
protein aggregation and keep up cellular homeostasis under both
unfavorable and optimum developmental conditions. HSPs are
found to be up-regulated on exposure to higher temperatures along
with other various environmental and physiological stress factors
like cold, anoxia, metal drought [<xref rid="R09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and salinity 
[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and guard
protein structure and function. They aid in varied functions but are
specifically associated with acquired heat tolerance. Refined upregulation
and over expression of HSP70 positively equates with
the acquisition of heat tolerance 
[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Based on the approximate molecular weights, five extensive
families of HSPs are recognized: Hsp100, Hsp90, Hsp70, Hsp60 and
the small HSP (sHSP) families. Among these groups, HSP70 family
chaperons with a molecular weight of 70kDa are highly conserved
family of heat inducible (HSP70s) and constitutively expressed
(HSC70s) proteins in different organisms and in different cellular
structures in the same organism 
[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In plants, the
HSP70/HSC70 family consists of members located in the
mitochondrion, plastid, endoplasmic reticulum and cytosol 
[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].
Distinct expression of HSC70s/HSP70s has been reported in
various tissues during different developmental stages. All HSP70
proteins in higher eukaryotes along with plants share analogous
structure, consisting of an N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain
(NBD) that exhibit modest ATPase activity on its own, and a Cterminal
peptide substrate-binding domain (SBD). The functions of
the two main domains of the HSP70 proteins are allosterically
controlled. The SBD and NBD are linked by a highly conserved
inter-domain linker (also known as loop LL1), which is critically
involved in inflecting the allosteric regulation of HSP70 proteins.
The extreme C-terminal domain of HSP70 is assumed to be broadly
unstructured and is the docking site for few co-chaperones 
[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>One of the substantial and broadly conferring endogenous
messenger molecules to abiotic stress tolerance are phytohormones
that play a crucial role in plant growth and development 
[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Numerous reports documented evidence about the
phytohormones active involvement in physiological protection
against heat stress. The adaptation of plants to abiotic stresses
illustrates the potentiality of phytohormones in the refinement of
stress responses in plants 
[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Taking into account the
phytohormone mediated heat stress tolerance; present study
investigated the involvement of phytohormone interaction with the
up-regulated HSC70 protein of Pennisetum glaucum. In this study,
sequence analysis, 3D structure modelling and validation of the
target protein HSC70 were carried out. Furthermore, molecular
docking was applied to study binding conformations and structural
specificity of the selected phytohormones. The phytohormone
mediated interaction of PgHSC70 protein through in silico analysis
showed good binding energy with brassinolide</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Sequence retrieval and analysis:
</title><p>The amino acid sequence of the HSC70 from Pennisetum glaucum
was retrieved from the SwissProt database using the accession No
C7E6Z5. The primary structure was predicted using ProtParam
tool. The physicochemical properties were computed that included
the molecular weight, theoretical isoelectric point (pI), amino acid
composition, atomic composition, total number of positive and
negative residues, extinction coefficient, estimated half-life,
instability index, aliphatic index, and grand average of
hydropathicity (GRAVY). The secondary structure of this protein
was predicted using SOPMA (Self Optimized Prediction Method
with Alignment) program that uses multiple alignments. It
calculated and analyzed the secondary structural features alpha
helixes, extended strand, random coil and beta turns of the protein
sequence.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>3D Structure modelling:</title><p>The 3D structure of the protein HSC70 from Pennisetum glaucum
was determined using the homology modelling methods of
Discovery Studio (DS). Homology modelling was for the alignment
of the target sequence and the sequences of known structures of
one or more proteins as templates, which resembled the structure
of the query sequence. The sequence alignment and template
structure are then used to generate a structural model of the target.
The retrieved FASTA sequence as query, using BLAST against PDB,
the homologous sequences with known related protein 3D
structures was used as templates search. From the obtained BLAST
results, the sequence with maximum identity score and lowest evalue
was retrieved. The query and the template sequences are
aligned using align sequences program of DS. Based on this
sequence alignment, using crystal structural coordinates of
templates; three 3D models of target protein were generated with
the homology model-building program of DS Modeler. The best
model of target was selected on the basis of the results of the
internal scoring functions analysis, PDF (Probability Density
Functions) total energy, PDF physical energy and DOPE scores of
DS. The best homology model with least energy function was taken
for further refinement using DS energy minimization methods. At
first, all the hydrogen atoms were allowed while performing the
calculations. Energy minimization was carried out under
CHARMM force fields using 1000 steps of the steepest descent
algorithm followed by 1000 steps of the conjugate gradient
algorithm, with minimization criteria set at 0.001 root mean square
gradient, respectively to obtain a stable and low energy
conformation. After the optimization procedure, the final 3D model
was chosen for further validation.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Model Evaluation:</title><p>The final 3D model of PgHSC70 was chosen for validation using
RAPPER, ProSA and Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD). The
modelled structure validated by RAPPER was verified with
Ramachandran plot through analysis of the possible conformations
of dihedral angles &#x003a8; and &#x003a6; of amino acid residues in protein
structure for the assessment of the stereo chemical quality. ProSA
was used to analyze the energy criteria and the Z-score values for
the comparison of reliability. The model Z score was compared to
the Z scores determined experimentally of similar structures.
Additionally, the Root Mean Square Deviation value, which
indicates degree of similarity of the 3D structures, was done both
for the query and template structures. The structures were
superimposed for RMSD calculation using SPDBV program. Lower
RMSD value represented more similarity in the structures. Finally,
the best quality model of PgHSC70 was subjected to further
calculations and molecular modelling studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Identification of Active Site:</title><p>The possible binding site of the modelled PgHSC70 were predicted
according to the receptor cavity method (Eraser algorithm) using
the DS Analyze Binding Site tool. The receptor molecule was first
defined by using 'define receptor molecule module' of DS. The
protein active site-Search was done using 'find sites from the
receptor cavities' which identified the protein active sites by
locating cavity in the modelled structure. When the search was
completed, the largest site, Site 1 was automatically displayed on
the structure. The predicted site 1 was chosen as the most
favourable binding site for docking with the ligands.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Generation of ligand dataset:</title><p>All the chemical structures of the selected phytohormones shown in
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) were drawn using ACD/ChemSketch (12.0) and later
imported in DS for ligand preparation. Ligands were prepared
using Prepare Ligands protocol which added hydrogen, generated
all possible stereoisomer's, ionization and tautomeric states,
converted 2D to 3D structures using catalyst algorithm and
minimized the energy of ligands through CHARMM force field
using smart minimizer algorithm with the default settings that was
continued by steepest descent and conjugate gradient algorithm
until the compounds reached with a convergence gradient of 0.001
kcal/mol.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Molecular docking:</title><p>Molecular docking studies were carried out to predict the
interaction energy and best orientation between the target protein
and ligand molecules. The docking program LibDock provided by
DS was used for high-throughput site-featured algorithm to dock
ligands into a receptor binding site. LibDock used protein polar and
apolar interaction site features, referred to as hot spots, where the
ligand aligned to form favourable interaction. All other docking
and consequent scoring parameters used were kept at their default
settings. The docking calculation generated few minimized poses
for each ligand. The selection of the best pose was done on the
interaction energy between the ligand and the protein and
interactions with the important residues of the protein. Each pose
was evaluated according to the LibDock score which was calculated
using a simple pair-wise method and the ligands with top LibDock
scores were selected for calculation of binding energy between the
receptor and ligand. The complex pose with the best binding
energy was used for further binding mode analysis. Further, the
hydrogen bond formed between the protein-ligand complex and
the receptor docking conformation was calculated with the
'Analyze Ligand Poses' process analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results and Discussion:</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Sequence retrieval and analysis:</title><p>The sequence of PgHSC70 was retrieved in FASTA format from
SWISS PROT database with Accession No: G0254653 and entry
name: C7E6Z5_PENAM. The primary structure was predicted
using ProtParam tool and the physicochemical parameters
computed are presented in (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Results showed that the
protein has 649 amino acid residues with an estimated molecular
weight of 71105.48 daltons. The maximum number of amino acids
present in the sequence was found to be Ala (8.9%) and least was
that of Trp (0.5%). The atomic composition was
C2777H4999N861O995S24. The total number of negatively charged
residues (Asp+Glu) are 100 and the total number of positively
charged residues (Arg+Lys) are 82. The isoelectric point pI was
5.10 revealing the basic nature of this protein. The instability index
is 34.52 which classify the protein as stable and the aliphatic index
is 81.79 which indicate that this protein is thermostable. At 280 nm,
the protein's extinction coefficient was evaluated and the value was
37735. The estimated half-life is 30 hours (mammalian reticulocytes,
in vitro), greater than 20 hours (yeast, in vivo) and greater than 10
hours (Escherichia coli, in vivo). Negative GRAVY value indicates the
hydrophilicity of the protein. The calculated GRAVY of -0.427
indicates that this protein is hydrophilic and soluble in nature.</p><p>Secondary structure predicted by SOPMA program is shown in
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) and the results of the analysis are shown in (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).
Alpha helix was predominant (42.68%), followed by random coil
(31.90%) and extended strand (18.03%). Also, beta turn was found
as 7.40%. The high percentage of random coils indicates the
flexibility of the protein which is responsible for more interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>3D Structure modelling:</title><p> Homology modelling of PgHSC70 was predicted based on the
BLAST search against the PDB database for homologous template.
From the BLAST results, the selected template was the crystal
structure of a bovine HSC70 (PDB ID: 1YUW) (amino acids: 1-554,
resolution 2.6 &#x000c5;), having 81% identity and 83% similarity with the
target protein. A 3D homology model of PgHSC70 was built on the
basis of sequence alignment of the selected template (1YUW) and
target protein PgHSC70 as shown in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The protocol 'Align
multiple sequences' of DS performed sequence alignment and the
initial models of the PgHSC70 was built using protein modelling
protocol called 'build homology model' which used modeller to
build homology models. The modeller options were kept default
while running and ended up with a loop refinement by default
modelling process. Of the three generated models, the model with
least energy function was chosen. It has the lowest value in PDF
total energy (6141.58), PDF physical energy (-556.69) and DOPE
(Discrete Optimized Protein Energy) score (-40198.65), that
indicated it as the best model. The energy refinement method has
given the best conformation to the model. For optimization, the
CHARMM force field and steepest descent algorithm was applied
with 0.001 minimizing RMS gradient and 1000 minimizing steps.
Following the steps of minimization, the protein was minimized
using conjugate gradient algorithm preceded by smart minimizer
algorithm until the convergence gradient of 0.001 kcal mol-1 was
satisfied. The finally refined protein generated is shown in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Model Validation:</title><p>The refined 3D structure of PgHSC70 was validated through the
RAPPER for Ramchandran plot analysis, ProSA for energy criteria
analysis and Root mean square deviation (RMSD) of template and
PgHSC70 model using SPDBV. The stereo-chemical quality and
accuracy of the final refined modelled PgHSC70 protein was
evaluated by Ramachandran plot calculations. The model showed
that 94.6% residues are in favoured region, 4.4% residues in the
allowed region and 1.1% residues in the outlier region. Of the total
sequence length, 521 amino acid residues are in favourable regions
and 24 residues in allowed regions and only five residues in
outliner region indicating the energetically and sterically stable
conformations of residues characterized by values of torsion angles
&#x003a8; and &#x003a6;.</p><p>ProSA was used to analyze the energy criteria and the Z-score
values for the comparison of reliability. ProSA reveals that the
overall quality of the predicted PgHSC70 model by comparing the
potential of mean forces derived from a large set of known NMR
and X-ray deciphered structures of similar sizes and group. The
model quality assessment of Z score is -10.38 kcal/mol for
PgHSC70 model suggesting the model being within the permissible
range of native conformational structures. Finally, the RMSD value
indicates the degree of structural similarity of the template 1YUW
and PgHSC70, calculated by SPDBV program. In this, both the
query and template structures were superimposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) for
RMSD calculation, which is 0.62 &#x000c5;.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Molecular docking:</title><p>In an attempt to further corroborate the phytohormones, aimed at
better modulation of PgHSC70 activity, docking studies were
investigated using the LibDock docking program. From the
docking studies, both the binding affinities and hydrogen bond
interactions were generated which were employed as the criterion
for ranking the docked complexes of the protein and the ligand.
Each docked conformation was assigned a LibDock score according
to its binding mode onto the binding site. Of all the conformations
generated for each compound, the compound with the highest
LibDock score was taken for interaction analysis of the hydrogen
bonding. LibDock scores of all the compounds along with their
hydrogen bond interactions and bond lengths are depicted in the
(<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Finally, the 'Analyze Ligand Poses' sub protocol was
performed to count H- bonds and close contacts (van der Waals
clashes) between the poses and PgHSC70. The molecular docking
simulation study revealed that the binding mode of brassinolide
shows high LibDock score of 115.231 K.cal/mol and forms five
hydrogen bonds with the amino acids LYS59, THR271, LYS277.
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>), show the amino acid residues involved in hydrogen
bond interactions with PgHSC70 and brassinolide. The hydrogen
bonds are formed between the hydrogen atom of LYS59 interacting
with the oxygen atom of the Brassinolide (LYS59:HZ1-
Brassinolide:O12) with a distance of 2.180000 &#x000c5;, between nitrogen
atom of THR271 interacting with oxygen atom of the Brassinolide

between hydrogen atom of THR271 interacting with oxygen atom
of the Brassinolide (THR271:HG1Brassinolide:O33) with a distance
of 2.381000 &#x000c5;, between the hydrogen atom of LYS277 interacting
with the oxygen atom of the Brassinolide (LYS277:HZ1-
Brassinolide:O29) with a distance of 2.284000 &#x000c5; and between the
hydrogen atom of Brassinolide interacting with the oxygen atom of
the THR271 with a distance of 2.196000 &#x000c5;. It shows some close
contacts with the amino acid residue GLY236.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Phytohormones are the key players in the regulation of molecular
chaperons/HSP protein (HSP/HSC70) responses under heat stress.
The current study focused on the interaction of phytohormones
with the protein PgHSC70. The molecular docking simulation
study revealed that the binding mode of brassinolide has high
LibDock score of 115.231 K.cal/mol and forms five hydrogen bonds
with the amino acids LYS59, THR271, LYS277 showing better
binding energy and good interactions compared to other hormones.
Findings of this study on the predicted structural information
suggest the role of interaction between HSC 70 and brassinolide.
Further in vivo studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of this
interaction in heat tolerance.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p>none</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We greatly thank financial support of the funding by DST-PURSE -
