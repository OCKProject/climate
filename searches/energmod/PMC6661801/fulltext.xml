seen in stereo when positive and spatially shifted negative images are

different effects and put forward a simple, spatial-smoothing
explanation that can account for both the direction and magnitude of
the reversed effects in the motion, stereo and Vernier domains. In
addition, we consider whether the striking motion effects seen when
viewing Kitaoka&#x02019;s colour-dependent Fraser-Wilcox figures are related
to the reversed phi illusion, given the similarity of the luminance

image and a displaced and contrast-reversed version, the perception is of
<italic>backward</italic> motion, in a direction opposite to the
physical displacement between the two images. He dubbed this effect
&#x0201c;reversed phi&#x0201d; or reversed apparent motion (<xref rid="bibr2-2041669519856906" ref-type="bibr">Anstis, 1970</xref>; <xref rid="bibr3-2041669519856906" ref-type="bibr">Anstis &#x00026; Rogers,

only for small displacements (&#x0003c;10 arc min) between the initial and the
displaced, contrast-reversed version and, paradoxically, the smaller the
physical shift, the greater the perceived backward motion. In 1983, Gregory
and Heard reported related effects that they called &#x0201c;phenomenal phenomena.&#x0201d;
Many of Art Shapiro's beautiful motion effects (<xref rid="bibr14-2041669519856906" ref-type="bibr">Shapiro, Charles, &#x00026; Shear-Heyman,
2005</xref>) and some of Kitaoka's illusory effects (seen with static
patterns; <xref rid="bibr8-2041669519856906" ref-type="bibr">Kitaoka, 2006,
2014</xref>) use stimuli that are related to those used to demonstrate
the reversed phi effect.</p><sec id="sec2-2041669519856906"><title>The Wagon Wheel Illusion</title><p>What is the explanation of the reversed phi effect? One possibility is
that it is a variant of the well-known wagon-wheel illusion in which
the spokes of a wheel are seen to rotate in the opposite direction to
their physical motion when a continuously rotating wheel is filmed
with a camera that takes a series of discrete frames.</p><p>The wagon-wheel illusion is a form of aliasing in a spatially repetitive
moving stimulus when it is sampled at discrete points in time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2041669519856906">Figure 2(a)</xref>).
The perceived reversed direction of motion is present in the sequence
of images reaching the eye and therefore tells us little about the
properties of the visual system. Like mirages and moire fringes, the
wagon-wheel illusion is a consequence of the particular stimuli
reaching the eye rather than of the visual system.</p><fig id="fig2-2041669519856906" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>The wagon-wheel illusion. (a) When a repetitive pattern of
light and dark bars is displaced to the
<italic>left</italic> in successive images but with
jumps that have a magnitude greater than half a spatial
period (green arrow), the nearest neighbouring light (or
dark) bar is in the opposite direction, that is, to the
<italic>right</italic> (red arrows). The same thing
happens when a repetitive pattern is displaced by a
smaller amount to the <italic>left</italic> but reverses
in contrast between each presentation. (b) If a pattern
has a luminance profile with different width light and
dark bars and it displaces to the <italic>left</italic>
(green arrow), the nearest neighbouring light (or dark)
bar in the contrast-reversed image is also in the opposite
direction, that is, to the <italic>right</italic> (red
arrows). (c) When the displacement between the pattern and
the contrast-reversed version is very small, the nearest
neighbouring light (or dark) bar is also to the right
(with an amplitude close to half an average spatial
period), but there is considerable ambiguity about the
direction of displacement (dashed red arrows). (d) If the
displacement to the left is increased, the directional
ambiguity is reduced.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2041669519856906-fig2"/></fig><p>Should reversed phi be considered to be a variant of the wagon-wheel
illusion? Clearly, if the initial image is a repetitive grating
pattern of light and dark bars and the final image is a displaced,
contrast-reversed version, the direction of the perceived motion
depends on the magnitude of the displacement&#x02014;in a reversed direction
if the displacement is less than half a spatial period and in a
forward direction if the displacement is between a half and one
spatial period. In other words, the perceived direction of motion is
between a given light (or dark) bar and its nearest neighbour of the
same contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2041669519856906">Figure
2(a)</xref>). Once again, the perceived motion is in the
direction of the physical stimulus reaching the eye and therefore
tells us little about the properties of the visual system.</p><p>The situation becomes slightly more complicated if the initial image is
not a simple repetitive grating pattern but instead is the sort of
luminance profile created by a slice through a random dot pattern
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2041669519856906">Figure
2(b)</xref>). In this case, there is not an exact correspondence
between the luminance profiles of the initial and the displaced,
contrast-reversed version but, for small displacements, there is
always a closer match between a given light (or dark) bar in the
initial image and its nearest neighbouring light (or dark) bar in the
final, contrast-reversed image. Presenting the stimuli as a space-time
diagram reveals the reversed direction of the motion in a sequence of
images. It is clear that there is motion energy in the reversed
direction. Is this all there is to reversed phi? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2041669519856906">Figure 2(c) and (d)</xref> shows
that the magnitude of the displacement between the initial and the
displaced, contrast-reversed version varies as a function of the
<italic>phase shift</italic> of the average spatial period. A
small phase shift between the initial image and contrast-reversed
version generates the largest average displacement between the nearest
neighbouring bars of the same luminance.</p><p>How adequate is a wagon-wheel explanation of the reversed phi effect?
<xref rid="bibr3-2041669519856906" ref-type="bibr">Anstis and
Rogers (1975)</xref> reported that the reversed phi effect
involving a dissolve from an initial image to a displaced,
contrast-reversed version is maximal for very small displacements (a
few arc min), and there was little or no reversed motion when the
displacement exceeded &#x0223c;10 arc min. The wagon-wheel model predicts that
the amplitude of the perceived motion in the reversed direction should
be maximal with the smallest displacements&#x02014;approaching half the
average spatial period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2041669519856906">Figure 2(c)</xref>) but does not
predict the absence of reversed motion when the displacement exceeds
more than 10 arc min.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2041669519856906"><title>A Spatial-Smoothing Explanation</title><p>At the time, four observations made us doubt a simple wagon-wheel
explanation of the reversed phi effect. First, the reversed phi effect
using a temporal <italic>dissolve</italic> is much more powerful than
a straight cut from an image to its displaced, contrast-reversed
version. Second, reversed phi can be seen when the initial image is a
single, dark-to-light luminance <italic>edge</italic> rather than a
repetitive or pseudo-repetitive pattern. Third, the perceived
amplitude of the reversed phi effect is larger when the stimuli are
presented in peripheral vision. Fourth, we discovered similar reversed
effects in judgements of disparity and Vernier acuity (<xref rid="bibr3-2041669519856906" ref-type="bibr">Anstis &#x00026;
Rogers, 1975</xref>). This led us to propose an explanation of
all three effects that was based on the spatial summation or low-pass
filtering of the luminance profiles occurring <italic>prior</italic>
to the processes responsible for detecting motion, disparity and
Vernier alignment (<xref rid="bibr13-2041669519856906" ref-type="bibr">Rogers &#x00026; Anstis, 1975</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec4-2041669519856906"><title>Reversed Phi</title><p>Consider a luminance profile that consists of a single broad, white bar
on a dark background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2041669519856906">Figure 3(i)</xref>) and how it changes during a steady and
continuous dissolve to a contrast-reversed version that is displaced
to the <italic>right</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2041669519856906">Figure 3</xref>(vii)). The
displacement amplitude is small compared to the bar width. Note that
the luminance of the surrounding, dark background steadily increases
and the luminance of the wide white bar in the centre steadily
decreases over time. At the same time, the luminance of a narrow strip
at the left-hand edge of the bar remains unchanged (white), while the
luminance of a narrow strip at the right-hand edge of the bar remains
unchanged (black). These narrow strips turn out to be very important
for both the reversed phi effects and for Gregory and Heard&#x02019;s
phenomenal phenomena.</p><fig id="fig3-2041669519856906" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>(a) A &#x0201c;reversed phi&#x0201d; sequence of images depicting a

should be no longer seen (i.e., 50 units) is the same as the spatial
extent of the low-pass smoothing function and therefore can be used to
provide an estimate of the extent of spatial summation at a particular
eccentricity and for a particular visual task.</p><p>In the graphs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-2041669519856906">Figure 4</xref>, note that both the size of the displacement
and the size of the smoothing function are expressed in arbitrary
units. This means that the <italic>ratio</italic> between the
dimensions of luminance profile and the smoothing function is size
invariant. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-2041669519856906 fig5-2041669519856906">Figures 4(c)
and 5</xref>, the displacement (50 units) that no longer creates
a reversed effect provides an estimate of the extent of spatial
summation&#x02014;that is, 50 units. If the size of the smoothing function is
doubled (as is the case for peripheral receptive fields), the
perceived amplitude of the reversed phi motion should double and the
displacement at which the reversed motion breaks down should also
double. This is precisely what <xref rid="bibr3-2041669519856906" ref-type="bibr">Anstis and Rogers (1975)</xref>
found. When the reversed apparent motion stimuli were presented away
from the fovea (to regions where the receptive fields are larger), the
amplitude of perceived reversed motion increased and the maximum
displacement of the contrast-reversed negative image that still
produced reversed motion also increased.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-2041669519856906"><title>Reversed Stereo</title><p>The second piece of evidence that spatial-smoothing is responsible for
the reversed phi effect was the discovery of similar effects in the
disparity domain (<xref rid="bibr13-2041669519856906" ref-type="bibr">Rogers &#x00026; Anstis, 1975</xref>). It is well known that
presenting a random dot pattern to one eye and a contrast-reversed
version to the other eye produces binocular rivalry and no impression
of depth (<xref rid="bibr6-2041669519856906" ref-type="bibr">Julesz,
1971</xref>). Not surprisingly, presenting a single white bar to
one eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2041669519856906">Figure
3(i)</xref>) and a displaced, contrast-reversed dark bar to the
other eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2041669519856906">Figure
3</xref>(vii)) yields no impression of depth. However, if a
single white bar is presented to one eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2041669519856906">Figure 3(i)</xref>) and the other
eye is presented with one of the composite images created during a

(e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2041669519856906">Figure
3(i</xref>i) or (iii)), stereopsis is obtained and the direction
of the perceived depth is in the <italic>reversed</italic> direction
to the disparity of the contrast-reversed dark bar (<xref rid="bibr13-2041669519856906" ref-type="bibr">Rogers &#x00026;
Anstis, 1975</xref>) (Figure 6).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-2041669519856906">Figure 7(a)</xref> shows
R&#x00026;A&#x02019;s results. The amount of reversed depth increases with each
subsequent stage of the dissolve, reaching a maximum when the left eye
saw the single white bar and the right eye saw a composite consisting
of 60% of the original white bar and 40% of displaced,
contrast-reversed dark bar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-2041669519856906">Figure 7(a)</xref>). If the right
eye saw a composite that contained 50% or more of the displaced,
contrast-reversed dark bar, binocular rivalry occurred and stereopsis
could no longer be obtained. In other words, as soon as the two eyes
saw images that were of opposite contrast (however small), no depth
was seen, in line with Julesz&#x02019;s original observation. Moreover, the
reversed stereo effect was strongest when the displaced,
contrast-reversed dark bar had a disparity of 1.3 arc min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-2041669519856906">Figure 7(b)</xref>)
and the amount of reversed depth fell steadily as the disparity was
increased to &#x0223c;6.5 arc min, where it was abolished (<xref rid="bibr13-2041669519856906" ref-type="bibr">Rogers &#x00026;

alignment (<xref rid="bibr3-2041669519856906" ref-type="bibr">Anstis
&#x00026; Rogers, 1975</xref>). The observer&#x02019;s task in that

(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2041669519856906">Figure

corresponded to one of the stages of a dissolve between a

edge in the lower part of the display (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2041669519856906">Figure 3(i</xref>ii)). In other
words, the two edges that the observer was asked to align spatially
were identical to the images used in a reversed apparent motion
sequence over time and the pair of images used in a binocular,
reversed stereo presentation. When the composite image was a mixture
of the light-to-dark edge and a contrast-reversed edge that was
displaced to the <italic>right</italic>, observers judged the
composite edge to be displaced to the <italic>left</italic> (see
Figure 8).</p><p>The magnitude of the effect was measured by asking observers to shift the
horizontal position of the composite pattern in the lower part of the

edge in the upper part of the display (<xref rid="bibr12-2041669519856906" ref-type="bibr">Perrett, 1976</xref>). As
previously described for reversed apparent motion and reversed stereo,
the amount of shift needed for the contours to appear aligned
<italic>increased</italic> with the balance of the displaced,
contrast-reversed light-to-dark image that was present in the
composite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-2041669519856906">Figure

for very small offsets of the contrast-reversed light-to-dark edge and
was abolished when the offset exceeded &#x0223c;3.5 arc min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-2041669519856906">Figure 9(b)</xref>).
This pattern of results is consistent with that described previously
for the reversed motion and reversed stereo effects, although the
predicted size of the summatory centres of the receptive fields
involved in making Vernier judgments close to the fovea should be
smaller at around 3.5 arc min.</p><fig id="fig7-2041669519856906" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>(a) The matched amplitude of the reversed depth increases as

summatory centres) increase in size with increasing eccentricity. The
spatial-smoothing explanation not only predicts that larger
displacements of the contrast-reversed image would be tolerated before
the effect broke down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-2041669519856906">Figure 4(c)</xref>) but also that
the size of the reversed alignment effect would be greater. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-2041669519856906">Figure 9(b)</xref>

stereo and reversed Vernier alignment&#x02014;can all be accounted for by a
simple, parsimonious explanation in which the visual system blurs or
spatially smooths the physical contours of the stimuli prior to the
extraction of motion, stereo or Vernier alignment. Our simulations
show that if the stimuli used in the reversed phi, reversed stereo and
reversed Vernier effects are spatially smoothed, either optically or
neurally, the major contours will be displaced in the reversed
direction and hence <italic>all</italic> models of motion, stereo and
Vernier alignment must predict the reversed effects, just as they
would if the contours were actually displaced in that direction. This
is not to say that the spatial-smoothing does not form part of the
processes used to extract motion, stereo or Vernier alignment
information but rather that the reversed effects themselves do not
depend on particular ways in which motion, stereo or Vernier alignment
information is extracted.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-2041669519856906">2</xref></sup></p></sec></sec><sec id="sec7-2041669519856906"><title>Gregory and Heard&#x02019;s &#x0201c;Phenomenal Phenomena&#x0201d;</title><p>So far, we have shown that the reversed apparent motion, reversed stereo and

made to the particular Vernier task depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-2041669519856906">Figure 14(i</xref>v). When the same
pair of images was presented separately to the two eyes in G&#x00026;H&#x02019;s
stereo experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-2041669519856906">Figure 12(i</xref>v)), observers saw rivalry rather than depth
because the corresponding strips in the binocular images were of
opposite contrast. However, when the same pair of contours were
presented one above the other in a Vernier offset experiment, it was
quite possible for observers to align the narrow strips, even though
they had opposite contrasts. Hence, there should be little or no
Vernier offset. This was the result reported by G&#x00026;H at the
&#x0201c;iso-grey&#x0201d; point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-2041669519856906">Figure 15(e)</xref>). Note that the instruction given to
observers was to adjust the horizontal position of the lower figure
until &#x0201c;both rectangular figures appeared to be vertically aligned.&#x0201d;
When the luminance of the surround was the same as that of the central
area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-2041669519856906">Figure
14(i</xref>v)), the grey &#x0201c;rectangle figures&#x0201d; between the light
and dark strips were of course aligned.</p><p>This explains why their observers saw no Vernier offset in their
&#x0201c;iso-grey&#x0201d;, but how can we account for the results reported by G&#x00026;H
when observers were presented with the intermediate stages, for
example, 14(ii) or (iii)? If observers were attempting to align the
positions of the major contours, the spatial-smoothing model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-2041669519856906">Figure 15</xref>)
predicts that the apparent Vernier offset should be
<italic>larger</italic> with the composite images 14(ii) and
(iii) compared with 14(i). The modelling results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-2041669519856906">Figure 15(a) to
(d)</xref> show that the horizontal separation between the
contours in the upper (green) and lower (red) images
<italic>increases</italic> from 15(a) to 15(b) and from 15(b) to
(c).</p><p>However, if observers were attempting to align the opposite contrast
strips (rather than the major contours) in the way they did when
presented with the images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-2041669519856906">Figure 14(i</xref>v), the
spatial-smoothing model predicts that the perceived Vernier offset of
the corresponding peaks and troughs should <italic>decrease</italic>
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-2041669519856906">Figure 15(a)
to (d)</xref>). The horizontal separation between the peak (or
trough) in upper (green) profile and the corresponding trough (or
peak) in the lower (red) images <italic>decreases</italic> from a
maximum in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-2041669519856906">Figure
15(a)</xref> to zero in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-2041669519856906">Figure 15(d)</xref> where the
opposite contrast strips are aligned.</p><p>As a consequence, the results reported by G&#x00026;H are consistent with the
suggestion that observers were attempting to align the opposite
contrast strips in the upper and lower images and therefore perfectly
compatible with our own results and with our spatial-smoothing
explanation. Moreover, we think it very likely that if G&#x00026;H had
used a pair of their images in their Vernier alignment task that
represented different stages of a dissolve between the dark background
(iso-dark strip) and their light background (iso-dark strip), rather
than left-right reversed versions, they would have obtained similar
results to those we reported. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-2041669519856906">Figure 16</xref> provides evidence
to support this. There is a similar reversed Vernier alignment effect

spatial-smoothing proposal account for these differences? As was pointed
earlier, the spatial limit for seeing reversed phi between the original
image and its displaced, contrast-reversed version was
<italic>larger</italic> when the same stimuli were viewed in
peripheral vision. This is consistent with the finding that the extent of
spatial-smoothing is larger in peripheral retina. As a consequence, we
propose that the amount of spatial-smoothing (low-pass filtering) is greater
for the processing of motion stimuli than for binocular disparity which, in
turn, is greater for the processing of Vernier alignment. This proposal is
consistent with the suggestions made in the classic study of <xref rid="bibr7-2041669519856906" ref-type="bibr">King-Smith and Kulikowski

strips that are flanked on either side by regions that are either increasing
or decreasing in luminance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2041669519856906">Figure 3</xref>). In particular, when a thin light strip is flanked

has also drawn attention to the configurational coincidence between the
stimuli used in his colour-dependent Fraser-Wilcox illusion and those used
previously in A&#x00026;R&#x02019;s reversed motion, stereo and Vernier alignment
studies. Given that the effects reported by A&#x00026;R and G&#x00026;H can be
explained by a simple, spatial-smoothing model that effectively shifts the
positions of the peaks, troughs and zero-crossings of the major contours
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-2041669519856906">Figure 4</xref>),
could a similar model predict the illusory motion seen in Kitaoka&#x02019;s
colour-dependent Fraser-Wilcox illusion? Note that Kitaoka has reported that
the illusory motion effects are stronger when the colour-dependent
Fraser-Wilcox patterns are viewed in peripheral vision (where there is
greater spatial summation), just like the effects described by A&#x00026;R and
G&#x00026;H.</p><p>There are, however, two important differences. First, the reversed motion,
stereo and Vernier alignment studies involve the <italic>comparison of
image</italic>s over time (in the case of reversed motion), between
the eyes (in the case of reversed stereo) or spatially juxtaposed (in the
case of reversed Vernier alignment). In contrast, only a single image is
involved in the colour-dependent Fraser-Wilcox illusion. Under bright
illumination conditions, such that the long-wavelength (red) flanking region
(to the left of a light strip) is seen as getting <italic>lighter</italic>
than the short-wavelength (purple) flanking region (to the right of a light
strip), the perceived illusory motion is to the left. The second difference
is that the colour-dependent Fraser-Wilcox illusion is almost certainly a
colour effect&#x02014;a grey-scale version produces little or no apparent motions
(<xref rid="bibr9-2041669519856906" ref-type="bibr">Kitaoka,
2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec15-2041669519856906"><title>Conclusions&#x02014;Kitaoka&#x02019;s Colour-Dependent Fraser-Wilcox Patterns</title><p>The luminance profiles used in A&#x00026;R&#x02019;s reversed motion effects are clearly
very similar to those in Kitaoka&#x02019;s colour-dependent Fraser-Wilcox figure
with narrow light and dark strips flanking regions of homogeneous luminance.
However, there are also important differences. It is possible that a
difference in the latencies of different colour channels may play a
significant role in creating the colour-dependent Fraser-Wilcox, but latency
differences, by themselves, would not predict the perceived motion. However,
the idea of differential latencies in different colour channels together
with some sort of spatial smoothing to blur and alter the effective
positions of the contours may provide a possible explanation of Kitaoka&#x02019;s
effect. At present, this is only speculation.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="sec16-2041669519856906"><title>Declaration of Conflicting Interests</title><p>The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the

themselves incorporate spatial smoothing. Attributing the
reversed motion effects to motion energy models is not an
explanation, but a description of what happens when these
particular stimuli provide the input to a particular motion
energy model. We suggest that the reason why motion energy
models predict reversed apparent motion effects is because they
incorporate spatial smoothing. As a consequence, the reversed
apparent motion effects, although consistent with the
predictions of motion energy models, do not provide support for
any particular motion model. If the reversed apparent motion
contours are spatially smoothed, either optically or neurally,
the contours themselves displace in the reversed direction
