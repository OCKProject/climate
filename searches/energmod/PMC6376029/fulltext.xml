As vaccines, vectors derived from human adenovirus species D serotypes 26 and 48 (HAdV-D26/48) are demonstrating promising efficacy as protective platforms against infectious diseases. Significant clinical progress has been made, yet definitive studies underpinning mechanisms of entry, infection, and receptor usage are currently lacking. Here, we perform structural and biological analysis of the receptor binding fiber-knob protein of HAdV-D26/48, reporting crystal structures, and modelling putative interactions with two previously suggested attachment receptors, CD46 and Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor (CAR). We provide evidence of a low affinity interaction with CAR, with modelling suggesting affinity is attenuated through extended, semi-flexible loop structures, providing steric hindrance. Conversely, in silico and in vitro experiments are unable to provide evidence of interaction between HAdV-D26/48 fiber-knob with CD46, or with Desmoglein 2. Our findings provide insight into the cell-virus interactions of HAdV-D26/48, with important implications for the design and engineering of optimised Ad-based therapeutics.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Adenovirus based (AdV) vectors are promising platforms for therapeutics and vaccines, but receptor usage of serotypes in clinical development remains unclear.

As vaccine vectors, their use clinically has been popularised by their excellent safety profile coupled with their ability to induce robust cellular and humoral immunogenicity in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Phylogenetically, the human adenoviruses (HAdV&#x02019;s) are diverse, subdivided across seven species, A&#x02013;G<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, based classically on serological cross-reactivity, receptor usage, haemagglutination properties and, more recently, phylogenetic sequence similarity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Most experimental and clinical studies have focussed on the well-studied species C adenovirus, HAdV-C5. Although potently immunogenic, the efficacy of vaccines based on HAdV-C5 appears hampered by high seroprevalence rates in humans, and enthusiasm for their use as clinical vaccine platforms has been dampened by the well-publicised failure of the MERCK sponsored STEP vaccine trial. This trial, to evaluate an HAdV-C5-based HIV vaccine encoding HIV gag/pol/nef antigens, was abandoned due to apparent lack of efficacy upon 1st term analysis. The study also identified a non-significant trend towards increased HIV acquisition in a specific high-risk, uncircumcised subset of patients who also had high levels of baseline pre-existing neutralising antibodies (NAbs) to HAdV-C5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. As a result, attention has switched from HAdV-C5-based vectors towards the development of alternative adenoviral serotypes with lower rates of pre-existing immunity. Most notably, vectors under development include those based on species D serotypes including HAdV-D26, which has entered Phase-III clinical trials as an Ebola vaccine and recently reported promising immunogenicity in an HIV trial. Chimeric vectors utilising the hexon hyper variable regions (HVRs) of HAdV-D48 which have undergone Phase-I evaluation as an HIV vaccine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. However, despite extensive clinical advances using these vaccine vectors we possess very limited knowledge of their basic biology, particularly with regards to the determinants underpinning their tropism, mechanisms of cellular entry, and receptor usage. In this study, we address these shortcomings through analysis of adenoviral diversity in the context of their receptor binding, fiber proteins. Whilst adenoviruses are historically divided into seven species, A&#x02013;G, this may underestimate their diversity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Phylogenetic examination of 56 human adenovirus fiber proteins from different species shows deviation from the taxonomy expected based upon whole genome taxonomy, likely due to recombination events as seen in other adenoviral proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Here, we have sought to generate high-resolution crystallographic structures of the cellular interacting fiber-knob domains of species D adenoviruses HAdV-D26 and HAdV-D48. The fiber-knob is the receptor interacting domain of the fiber protein, one of three major capsid proteins along with the hexon and penton base, as shown schematically in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Phylogenetic analysis of adenoviruses mapped by whole genome and fiber-knob domain. A diagrammatic representation of the adenoviral major capsid proteins shows the icosahedral capsid structure with the Hexon (orange) comprising the facets, pentons (green) at the vertices, from which the fiber proteins (fiber-shaft in light blue, fiber-knob in dark blue) protrude (<bold>a</bold>). Condensed maximum likelihood trees (percentage confidence shown by numbers next to nodes) were generated from alignments of fiber-knob domain amino acid sequences of adenoviruses 1&#x02013;56 (<bold>b</bold>) or whole genome NT sequences (<bold>c</bold>). Adenoviruses divide into 7 subspecies, as denoted in the key, regardless of alignment used, but the species D adenoviruses divide into additional sub-species when determined by fiber-knob alignment, for readability simple nomenclature is used, all are human adenovirus. Numbers next to nodes denote confidence. Wu&#x02013;Kabat variability analysis of the Clustal Omega aligned fiber-knob domains amino acid sequences of adenoviruses 1&#x02013;56 (<bold>d</bold>) reveals regions of low amino acid variability corresponding to beta-sheets.

In both phylogenetic trees, the adenoviruses divide into seven clades corresponding to the seven adenoviral species, A&#x02013;G. However, the tree based upon the fiber-knob domain (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) shows the species D adenoviruses forming a greater number of sub-groups than in the whole genome tree suggesting greater diversity in the receptors of this species than might be expected when comparing serotypes. This may be the result of recombination events, as reported previously for other adenoviral proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The opposite is observed in species B adenoviruses, where simpler groupings are seen when analysing fiber-knob domain alignment than by whole genome analysis. When divided into sub-species based on whole genome, they divide into species B1 and B2, but when the tree is generated based on fiber-knob alone the species B viruses do not divide into similar groups. The significance of this fiber-knob diversity is unclear, but it has previously been suggested that the species B1/B2 designation may more closely represent the tissue tropism, than receptor usage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">We next calculated the amino acid variability at each position in the aligned adenoviral fiber-knob sequences, which revealed regions of broad conservation corresponding to &#x003b2;-strands which make up the main fold of the fiber-knob trimer (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>).

Comparison shows that the more N-terminal (A, B, and C) and C-terminal (I and J) &#x003b2;-strands have greater homology across the adenoviral species than the other strands.

Despite their advanced development, the field lacks fundamental knowledge regarding the mechanisms of infection for these viral vector platforms.

The current adenoviral taxonomy is based on antibody neutralisation assays, which are limited by antibody's reliance on surface accessible proteins in the capsid, and does not account for diversity in other viral proteins, as the above suggests for species B. This supports a taxonomic proposal based upon viral genetics rather than antibody neutralisation, as has previously been suggested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par33">Many studies on adenovirus neutralisation have focused upon NAbs which bind to the hexon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>.

However, during natural infection, many NAbs target the fiber protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, presumably due to the abundance of fiber produced in the early stages of hAdV replication to loosen cell&#x02013;cell junctions and facilitate viral spread, prior to lysis and entry of large amounts of whole virus to the bloodstream<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. For individuals with pre-existing anti-adenovirus immunity derived from natural infections, anti-fiber NAbs are likely to limit the use of vectors with common adenovirus fiber proteins by neutralisation of the viral vector prior to its therapeutic effect. Thus, for the development of vectors to circumvent pre-existing anti-adenovirus immunity for therapeutic use further exploration of this fiber protein diversity may be beneficial, as well as the on-going studies using hexon HVR pseudotypes to circumvent anti-hexon immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par34">Analysis of the adenovirus loops (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>) reveals an intricate network of polar interactions which stabilise their three-dimensional structures. These bonds appear to hold the loops in a conformation which, in the case of HAdV-B11K and HAdV-B35K, facilitates receptor binding. In the HAdV-D26 and HAdV-D48 fiber-knob structures presented in this study the loops are also held in a stable conformation, though not one which enables CD46 interaction.</p><p id="Par35">Modelling of HAdV-D26K/HAdV-D48K in complex with CD46 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) suggested few contacts, and interface energy calculations using these models predict a weak binding energy (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). SPR indicated that HAdV-D26K has an affinity for CD46 that is approximately 1500&#x000d7; weaker than that of HAdV-B35K (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8d, e</xref>). Combined with the extremely fast kinetics, this is suggestive of a highly unstable interface. HAdV-D48K showed no affinity for CD46 at all. This was confirmed by in vitro competition inhibition assays, in which no tested quantity of recombinant fiber-knob was capable of inhibiting antibody binding to CD46 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8c</xref>). These findings appear contradictory to previous studies which suggest CD46 as the primary receptor for these viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Our findings improve knowledge of the cell entry mechanisms of these viruses and the vectors derived from them, and do not diminish the observed effectiveness of these vaccines. However, if CD46, a protein expressed on the surface of all nucleated cells, is not the receptor for these viruses then it is as yet unknown what the primary tissue tropism determinant is for these clinically significant viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par36">A similar methodology was applied to the interaction HAdV-D26K/HAdV-D48K with CAR. Inspection of the modelled complexes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) indicated a conserved &#x003b1;-interface enabling CAR binding in adenovirus 5, 26, and 48, fiber knobs. However, the structure of the &#x003b2;-interface interaction appears to indicate a mechanism modulating the fiber-knob&#x02019;s CAR affinity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). When occupying the intermonomer cleft in the conformation shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>, the DG loops of HAdV-D26K and HAdV-D48K are likely to inhibit CAR binding by steric hindrance, but if the loops were to shift into a conformation which relieves this clash CAR binding could occur. Therefore, the ability of these vectors to interact with CAR is likely a function of the steric hindrance provided by these loops, reducing the ability of the fiber-knob domain to engage CAR in a permissive conformation. SPR analysis supports this hypothesis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d, e</xref>), where the larger the DG loop of the investigated fiber-knob the slower the <italic>K</italic><sub>On</sub>.</p><p id="Par37">The inter-loop contacts described in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a, b</xref>, and Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>, and the normalised B-factors described in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref> will influence the molecular dynamics of the DG-loops. Loops which can occupy a CAR inhibitory conformation but have fewer stabilising contacts, such as that of HAdV-D26K (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3A, C</xref>), should be more permissive to CAR binding. While loops which are less flexible and/or stabilised in a CAR inhibitory conformation, such as HAdV-D48K (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>, Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3B, D</xref>) should result in a fiber-knob which is less able to bind CAR. This hypothesis fits the competition inhibition studies shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>, which demonstrate that HAdV-D26K has an approximately ~15&#x000d7; lower affinity for CAR than HAdV-C5K, and HAdV-D48K has 500&#x000d7; lower affinity.</p><p id="Par38">Interestingly, the affinity of HAdV-D48K for CAR as measured by SPR is approximately 2&#x000d7; higher than that for HAdV-D26K, due to the slower <italic>K</italic><sub>Off</sub> of HAdV-D48K (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>) which is in contrast with the IC<sub>50</sub> curves (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>) in which HAdV-D48K is observed to bind to CAR less strongly than HAdV-D26K. The incongruity may be explained by the methodology. It is possible that the large fluid volume in the wells during the inhibition assay (in comparison to the BIAcore microfluidics system), favoured greater binding by HAdV-D26K due to its faster <italic>K</italic><sub>On</sub>, compared to HAdV-D48K.

Most sequences have lengths equal to, or greater than, that of HAdV-D26K, making it plausible that they too could modulate the fiber-knob interaction with CAR. However, the magnitude of this effect will be dependent on the individual molecular dynamics of the DG-loops and its interactions with adjacent residues.</p><p id="Par40">Assuming this mechanism of CAR binding regulation is broadly applicable, it may have important implications for adenoviral vector design. The presence of a high affinity receptor for the virus can mask the low affinity CAR interaction, creating a hidden tropism only observed if the virus is forced to rely upon it. Expression of CAR on human erythrocytes suggests the potential for sequestration of virotherapies in the blood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. CAR expression in lung epithelial tissues offers another site for potential off target activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Therefore, many virotherapies previously thought to be non-CAR binding adenoviruses may in fact demonstrate weak CAR tropism, driving off target infections or resulting in sequestration of the vector in tissues other than that target. This may not be of grave consequence for non-replicating vectors, such as viral vaccines, but in vectors which rely upon controlled replication in targeted tissues, such as oncolytic virotherapies, this could result in off-target infection, dysregulated expression of therapeutic protein, and reduced delivery to the point of need.</p><p id="Par41">DSG2 was also shown to be unable to bind HAdV-D26K or HAdV-D48K at any concentration by SPR.

This is likely due to our use of recombinant knob trimers, rather than the multivalent penton dodecahedrons.</p><p id="Par42">The final, known, adenovirus fiber-knob receptor, which has thus far not been addressed in this study is sialic acid, as part of glycosylation motifs. Several adenoviruses have been shown to bind to sialylated glycans, including HAdV-D37<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, HAdV-G52<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>, and Canine adenovirus serotype 2 (CAdV-2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Each of these three viruses binds to sialic acid by different mechanisms (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref> shows that HAdV-D26/48K do not share the sialic acid binding residues found in HAdV-G52K or CAV-2 but do share the Tyr-142 and Lys-178 contact residues with HAdV-D37K. Further, the HAdV-D37K contact residue Pro-147 is between the sialic acid and the main chain oxygen which is functionally identical at the similar position in HAdV-D26/48K. Taken together, it remains plausible that HAdV-D26/48K may be capable of binding sialic acid in an HAdV-D37K-like manner. However, binding does not equate to functional infection, as seen with HAdV-D19pK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> and further studies are required to ascertain whether HAdV-D26/48 are capable of utilising sialic acid to generate a productive infection. Further, HAdV-D37 was shown to require a specific glycosylation motif (GD1a) in order form a functional infection, so any assessment of sialic acid as an adenoviral receptor must be in the context of its glycan carrier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par43">The work undertaken in this study presents, for the first time, the crystal structures of the fiber-knob domain protein of HAdV-D26 (PDB: 6FJN), and HAdV-D48 (PDB: 6FJQ) fiber-knob protein.

Finally, we showed that DSG2 is also unable to form a stable interaction in the context of SPR analysis. We suggest that CAR binding is moderated by a previously unreported mechanism of steric inhibition which may apply to other adenoviruses and demonstrate an in silico methodology capable of rapidly predicting these interactions.

The two fiber-knob proteins were then aligned with respect to their C&#x003b1; chains, in such a way as to achieve the lowest possible RMSD. Models containing only the fiber-knob protein of interest and the ligand were saved and subjected to energy minimisation, using the YASARA self-parametrising energy minimisation algorithm as performed by the YASARA energy minimisation server, and results were visualised in PyMol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Calculation of interface energy</title><p id="Par52">Interface energies were calculated using QT-PISA using biological protein assemblies and excluding crystallographic interfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref></sup>.

Post-refinement B-factors relate to the Wilson B-factor, which can vary widely between data sets, even from the same crystal preparation. A valid comparison between different structures can be achieved by comparing normalised B-factors instead. Normalisation was performed by dividing individual atomic B-factors by the average B-factor of the whole data set, quantifying the range of internal flexibility in a structure. This normalised B-factor can then be compared between different data sets.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis</title><p id="Par55">Binding analysis was performed using a BIAcore 3000&#x02122; equipped with a CM5 sensor chip. Approximately 5000&#x02009;RU of CD46, CAR, and DSG2 was attached to the CM5 sensor chip, using amine coupling, at a slow flow-rate of 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;l/min to ensure uniform distribution on the chip surface. A blank flow cell was used as a negative control surface on flow cell 1. All measurements were performed at 25&#x02009;&#x000b0;C in PBS buffer (Sigma, UK) at a flow rate of 30&#x02009;&#x000b5;l/min. For equilibrium binding analysis, the HAdV-D26K and HAdV-B3K fiber knob proteins were purified and concentrated to 367 and 3&#x02009;&#x003bc;M respectively. 5&#x000d7; 1:3 serial dilutions were prepared for each sample and injected over the relevant sensor chip. The equilibrium binding constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>) values were calculated assuming a 1:1 interaction by plotting specific equilibrium-binding responses against protein concentrations followed by non-linear least squares fitting of the Langmuir binding equation. For single cycle kinetic analysis, HAdV-D26K, HAdV-D48K, HAdV-B35K, HAdV-C5K, and HAdV-B3K were injected at a top concentration of around 200&#x02009;&#x000b5;M, followed by four injections using serial 1:3 dilutions. The <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values were calculated assuming Langmuir binding (AB&#x02009;=&#x02009;B&#x000d7;ABmax/(KD&#x02009;+&#x02009;B)) and the data were analysed using the kinetic titration algorithm (BIAevaluationTM 3.1).
