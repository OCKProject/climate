In this article, we investigate the oxic degradation of different types of organic archaeological deposits located in different climatic zones in West and South Greenland. The rate of degradation is investigated based on measurements of O<sub>2</sub> consumption, CO<sub>2</sub> production and heat production at different temperatures and water contents. Overall, there is good consistency between the three methods. However, at one site the, O<sub>2</sub> consumption is markedly higher than the CO<sub>2</sub> production, highlighting the importance of combining several measures when assessing the vulnerability of organic deposits. The archaeological deposits are highly vulnerable to degradation regardless of age, depositional and environmental conditions. Degradation rates of the deposits are more sensitive to increasing temperatures than natural soils and the process is accompanied by a high microbial heat production that correlates significantly with their total carbon content. We conclude that organic archaeology in the Arctic is facing a critical challenge that requires international action.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Archaeological deposits in Arctic areas are known to hold extraordinary well-preserved organic archaeological materials, primarily due to the cold temperatures and in some cases lack of water or oxygen within the depositional environments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.

Increasing air temperatures cause longer periods of ground thawing and changes in precipitation affect the hydrology and the amounts of oxygen that diffuse into the ground with impact on the microbial decomposition of organic carbon<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. The until now well-preserved archaeological deposits may thereby be exposed to accelerated degradation that destroys the integrity of stratified layers and leads to the loss of key elements such as archaeological wood, bone and ancient DNA. While the physical destruction due to e.g. coastal erosion has been studied to some extent<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, very little is known about how climate change affects the microbial degradation of organic archaeological deposits and therefore the extent of this threat to our common heritage remains largely unknown. To our knowledge, the coupling between climate change and the degradation of organic archaeological deposits has only been studied at one site in the Arctic, i.e. the Qajaa kitchen midden in the Disco Bay area in Greenland. Results from Qajaa have shown that even a small increase in soil temperature may lead to substantial degradation of the buried remains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Furthermore, the organic-rich archaeological deposits at Qajaa produce enough heat during decomposition to further increase soil temperatures and consequently accelerate the rate at which the organic matter is degraded<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. So far it is unknown whether these results are site-specific or whether the many well-preserved organic archaeological deposits located in other Arctic areas are equally vulnerable.</p><p>In this study we assess the vulnerability of organic archaeological deposits at four contrasting sites located along the two main climatic gradients in West and South Greenland. The degradability of the archaeological deposits is investigated at different temperatures and water contents by measuring O<sub>2</sub> consumption, CO<sub>2</sub> production and micro calorimetric heat production in depth-specific samples from the study sites. As far as we know, this is the first time these three methods are used in combination to study archaeological materials and hence the results presented here also provide a unique methodological insight that may be useful whenever assessing the vulnerability of organic archaeological deposits.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Study sites and environmental conditions</title><p>The four archaeological sites included in this study, Qajaa, Sandnes, Kangeq, and Igaliku, are among the most valuable sites in Greenland and all contain well-preserved organic materials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs S1&#x02013;7</xref>). The sites were chosen in order to represent different types of archaeological deposits that have been exposed to the different climatic conditions found in West and South Greenland. Qajaa consists of deposits from the three main Eskimoic cultures of Greenland: Saqqaq (2,500&#x02013;800 BC), Dorset (300&#x02009;BC&#x02013;600&#x02009;AD) and Thule (1,300&#x02009;AD&#x02013;present), Kangeq of deposits from the Thule culture (1,300&#x02009;AD&#x02013;present), Sandnes of deposits from the Norse farmers inhabiting the Western Settlement (985&#x02013;1,350 AD) and Igaliku of deposits from the Norse farmers inhabiting the Eastern Settlement (985&#x02013;1,450/1,500&#x02009;AD).</p><p>The study sites are located along a North/South gradient with respect to air temperatures and soil temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>) and a West/East gradient with respect to precipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Permafrost was found at the northernmost site Qajaa (continuous permafrost) and at the inland site of Sandnes (sporadic permafrost).

In line with previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, the collected climate data reveal a North/South (cold/warm) gradient in air temperatures and soil temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>) and a West/East (wet/dry) gradient in precipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Comparison with regional climate data shows that the mean annual air temperatures and precipitation rates at the four study sites represent 60&#x02013;70% of the ice-free coastal areas in West and South Greenland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1, S2</xref>). According to the official Greenlandic heritage data base, several thousand archaeological sites are registered in this part of Greenland (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S13</xref>) and we therefore expect that a large number of archaeological sites are exposed to environmental conditions similar to our study sites.</p><p>A combination of O<sub>2</sub> consumption, CO<sub>2</sub> production and heat production measurements was used to investigate the degradability of the archaeological deposits. The measured degradation rates confirm that the archaeological deposits are highly reactive with rates that are in the same order of magnitude as what has been reported from organic permafrost soils in Greenland<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. For three out of four sites, we found a good correlation between CO<sub>2</sub> production and O<sub>2</sub> consumption with a ratio of approximately 0.93&#x02009;mol CO<sub>2&#x02009;</sub>mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> O<sub>2</sub>. This is within the normal range found for the decomposition of soil organic matter and indicates that O<sub>2</sub> is mainly consumed by aerobic mineralization of SOC with a low oxidation level (low O-content)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>). For the last site (Igaliku), the O<sub>2</sub> consumption was 3&#x02013;15 times higher than the CO<sub>2</sub> production, indicating that processes other than SOC oxidation are taking place. Measurements of the pyrite (FeS<sub>2</sub>) content showed that the deposits at Igaliku contain pyrite (0.37%), indicating that O<sub>2</sub> could also be consumed in reaction with pyrite. As both pyrite and SOC produces heat when oxidized this also explains why the O<sub>2</sub> consumption and heat production was correlated at all four sites. This highlights the advantage of combining several methods when assessing the degradation of organic materials as e.g. carbonate dissolution may produce CO<sub>2</sub> without consuming O<sub>2</sub> and pyrite oxidation may consume O<sub>2</sub> without reflecting the degradation of organic artifacts directly.</p><p>For Qajaa, Sandnes and Kangeq, the rates of oxygen consumption, CO<sub>2</sub> production and heat production were all significantly correlated to the carbon content (linear regression on logarithmic transformed data: O<sub>2</sub> vs C: r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.73, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;18; CO<sub>2</sub> vs C: r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.76, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;18; heat production vs C: r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.73, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;18) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs S14 and S15</xref>). Thereby, the organic carbon found at the three sites is almost equally reactive regardless of the sites being very different in age and being exposed to different depositional/environmental conditions. In addition, the measured C/N ratios (ranging from 10 to 18, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>) were all within the range of what is considered optimal for C decomposition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. This verifies the hypothesis that the degradation so far has been limited by other parameters such as lack of water and/or oxygen, in combination with the low temperatures, and thus further suggests that Arctic archaeological deposits are highly degradable and vulnerable to environmental change.</p><p>With Q<sub>10</sub> values between 1.8 and 5.1 (mean&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.9), the archaeological deposits are more sensitive to temperature change than Arctic organic soils in general<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. In 2100, the mean annual air temperature in Western Greenland is expected to be 4.0&#x02013;7.0&#x02009;&#x000b0;C warmer than the 1961&#x02013;1990 mean<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. This could in average increase in the degradation rate by 62&#x02013;132%; but for the layers with Q<sub>10</sub> values above 5 the increase could be as high as 200%. This will be highly dependent on the future water balance and thus, on whether O<sub>2</sub> will be available in the deposits. Climate- and atmospheric models generally suggest a future increase in precipitation in the Arctic<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. However, a likely future increase in evapotranspiration and runoff is also reported which could result in lower soil moisture content especially in the southern parts of the region<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Our measurements show that draining of saturated samples increased the oxygen consumption rates. For sites that are currently wet, drier conditions may lead to increased oxygen access that will accelerate the degradation. On the other hand, wetter conditions may help to keep the archaeological deposits water saturated and reduce the microbial activity. The measurements also show a 110 times increase in reactivity when water is added to the very dry samples from the inland site of Sandnes. This suggests that at sites that are currently very dry, increasing precipitation could improve the conditions for microbial activity and accelerate the rate of degradation.</p><p>Previously, it has been shown that the impact of climate change on the archaeological deposits at Qajaa can be accelerated by microbial heat production<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. The results obtained here further highlight the fact that microbial heat production is seen across different types of sites and is positively correlated with the organic C content of the deposits (= 0.73, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;18. The overall warming effect from heat production is expected to be most pronounced in deposit with a very high organic C content, where the degradation is not limited by lack of oxygen or water. Furthermore, in accordance with studies from Arctic mine waste rock dumps<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, the thickness and volume of the archaeological deposits are important for the overall &#x0201c;internal warming effect&#x0201d; of microbial heat production.</p><p>We investigated the long-term degradation of the archaeological deposits and found that oxygen consumption rates in average decreased to 61&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;23% of the initial rate after 14 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). This is in good agreement with studies of natural soils showing that the most reactive organic material decomposes first and, with time, the remaining material becomes decreasingly reactive<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. This is important when quantifying the long term loss of organic material and the corresponding emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere. In relation to archaeological deposits, the mineralization over the first few years is considered more critical than in natural soils, as the initial degradation can cause irreversible damage to the quality and integrity of the deposits.</p><p>In this study, we have focused on the microbial degradation of organic deposits that contain important residues of human subsistence activities and in which the different types of artefacts are embedded. Previously, it has been have shown that archaeological wood is equally vulnerable when exposed to O<sub>2</sub> and higher temperatures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. We therefore expect the loss of organic deposits to be closely linked to a loss in quality of other buried organic artefacts. Furthermore, the loss of organic material may be accompanied by soil settling and erosion processes that accelerate the destruction of their cultural and scientific value.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have shown that archaeological deposits from four contrasting archaeological sites located in different climatic zones in West and South Greenland all are highly reactive and vulnerable to increasing soil temperatures and changes in the water balance. The results provide strong evidence that Arctic organic archaeological deposits, regardless of age and geographical location, are particularly vulnerable to degradation under the climatic changes predicted by global climate models.</p><p>For most samples, we found a good correlation between CO<sub>2</sub> production and O<sub>2</sub> consumption, confirming that most of the O<sub>2</sub> is consumed by reacting with organic carbon in the deposits. However, for one of the sites, the correlation was poor, indicating other ongoing oxygen consuming processes. This highlights the importance of combining several methods when assessing the degradation of organic materials, especially when quantifying their long term loss.</p><p>The organic carbon found in the archaeological deposits has a significant heat production potential that may be enough to warm the deposit and thereby accelerate the degradation more than can be attributed to the direct impact of climate change alone. The effect of this heat production is highly dependent on the total carbon content, the thickness of the deposits and the local environmental conditions.</p><p>It is difficult to discover, quantify and predict ongoing microbial or chemical degradation of buried deposits and, as a result, sites that are suddenly undergoing rapid degradation can be easily overlooked. The investigations presented here should be expanded to include more sites and other types of organic archaeological materials. This would provide the fundamental knowledge needed to develop regional impact models that can be used to pinpoint areas most vulnerable to microbial degradation. Such information will make it possible to prioritize and optimize future archaeological investigations and save important records of the past before they are lost.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Sites, monitoring and sampling</title><p>The northern site of Qajaa is located 18&#x02009;km south-east of Ilulissat at the southern side of the Ilulissat Icefjord (69.127602&#x000b0; N, 50.702076&#x000b0; E).
