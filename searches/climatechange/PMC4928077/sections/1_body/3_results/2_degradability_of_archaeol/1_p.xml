<p class="p">Soil bulk samples and volume specific samples (100 cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>) were collected at each site for laboratory experiments. The carbon content (TOC) varied considerably both within and across locations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3A</xref>) with the samples from Sandnes containing least organic C (8.5 ± 2.3% weight to dry weight) (mean  ±  SD; n = 10) and the samples from Qajaa the most (42 ± 12%) (mean  ±  SD; n = 7). The C/N relationship varied between 10 and 18 in all the samples (
