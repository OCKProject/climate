<p class="p">The O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> consumption measurements were repeated after 6 and 14 months in selected samples from Qajaa, Sandnes and Kangeq to investigate the long-term degradation of the archaeological deposits. During this 14 month period, the O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> consumption rates in average decreased to 61 ± 23% (mean ± SD; n = 11) of the initial rate (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). This average represents significant decreases in O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> consumption rates to 67% at Sandnes (one way ANOVA: p = 0.03, n = 4) and to 57% at Kangeq (one way ANOVA: p = 0.01, n = 4) whereas the decrease at Qajaa to 72% of the initial rate is not significant (one way ANOVA, p = 0.17, n = 3).
