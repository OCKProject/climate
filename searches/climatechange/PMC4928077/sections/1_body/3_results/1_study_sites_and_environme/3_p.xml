<p class="p">The representativeness of the sites in terms of climatic conditions was evaluated against mean annual temperatures derived from the MODIS-based land surface temperature product MOD11A2
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" class="xref">16</xref> as well as accumulated annual precipitation from the ERA Interim reanalysis dataset
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref>. Both datasets were analyzed for the period 2005–2014 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). The mean annual temperatures at the four study sites represented about 40% of the total ice-free land area in West and South Greenland and 65% of the ice-free land below 100 m a.s.l. where the majority of archeological sites are located (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). In terms of precipitation, the four study sites represented roughly 70% of the precipitation regimes found in the ice-free land areas in West and South Greenland (
