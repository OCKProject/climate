<p class="p">The four archaeological sites included in this study, Qajaa, Sandnes, Kangeq, and Igaliku, are among the most valuable sites in Greenland and all contain well-preserved organic materials (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Figs S1–7</xref>). The sites were chosen in order to represent different types of archaeological deposits that have been exposed to the different climatic conditions found in West and South Greenland. Qajaa consists of deposits from the three main Eskimoic cultures of Greenland: Saqqaq (2,500–800 BC), Dorset (300 BC–600 AD) and Thule (1,300 AD–present), Kangeq of deposits from the Thule culture (1,300 AD–present), Sandnes of deposits from the Norse farmers inhabiting the Western Settlement (985–1,350 AD) and Igaliku of deposits from the Norse farmers inhabiting the Eastern Settlement (985–1,450/1,500 AD).
