In this experiment, sterilized deionized water was first added to mimic saturated conditions where the oxygen supply is limited, and after the first round of measurements, the samples were freely drained and exposed to air for 24 h to mimic oxic conditions before repeating the measurements. Results showed an oxygen consumption in the wet samples between 1.3 to 2.6 μmol O
