<p class="p">For most samples, we found a good correlation between CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> production and O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> consumption, confirming that most of the O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is consumed by reacting with organic carbon in the deposits. However, for one of the sites, the correlation was poor, indicating other ongoing oxygen consuming processes. This highlights the importance of combining several methods when assessing the degradation of organic materials, especially when quantifying their long term loss.
