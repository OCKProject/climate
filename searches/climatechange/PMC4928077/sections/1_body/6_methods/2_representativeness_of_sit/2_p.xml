<p class="p">No similar high resolution precipitation products exist for the Arctic. Instead, we analyzed precipitation using the ERA Interim dataset at 0.125 degrees ground resolution, which we re-sampled to 0.05 degrees (approx. 5.5 km ground resolution, using bilinear interpolation) to allow masking of glaciers, open water, etc. The performance of this dataset in the Arctic has previously been documented
