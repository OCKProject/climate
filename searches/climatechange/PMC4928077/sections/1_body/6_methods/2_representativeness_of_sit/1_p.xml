<p class="p">We evaluated the representativeness of the four study sites regarding air temperature and precipitation for the ice-free part of West and South Greenland (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). The mean annual temperature was evaluated using land surface temperatures (LST) derived from the MODIS sensor onboard the Terra satellite. LST from this sensor has shown to be closely linked with air temperatures in the Arctic
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" class="xref">33</xref> , hence at 1 km ground resolution this product allows for detailed temperature mapping of the fjord systems dominating West and South Greenland. Annual mean LST from the period 2005–2014 was computed based on the 8-day product MOD11A2 and converted into air temperature 2 m above surface using a linear model derived from an ordinary least squares regression between air temperatures measured at the four study sites (2 m above terrain) and MODIS LST (0.8845 * LST + 1.626; r = 0.91; p &lt; 0.001).
