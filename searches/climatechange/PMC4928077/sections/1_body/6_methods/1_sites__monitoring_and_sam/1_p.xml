<p class="p">The northern site of Qajaa is located 18 km south-east of Ilulissat at the southern side of the Ilulissat Icefjord (69.127602° N, 50.702076° E). The midden at the site covers an area of approximately 2900 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and is up to 3 m thick (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). The midden contains remains of the three main Eskimoic cultures of Greenland: The Saqqaq, Dorset and Thule cultures, and the Saqqaq remains are considered some of the best preserved in Greenland

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). The midden is permanently frozen with an active layer (top layer of soil that thaws during the summer) of approximately 0.5 m. The site was visited in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2014. Part of the field work carried out at the site has been published

In 2009, a permafrost core was extracted from the site, after which temperature probes (Campbell Scientific T107 temperature probes) were installed at 7, 16, 32, 50, 120, 170, 220, 270 and 320 cm depth. Soil water Theta Probes (ML2x, Delta-T Devices Ltd, Cambridge, UK) were installed in the active layer at the depths 7, 16, 20 and 32 cm. In 2010, a meteorological station was installed, monitoring the air temperature (Campbell Scientific CS215 temperature probe) (

 <sup class="sup">3</sup>) from an exposed, north-facing profile (Profile A) were included in this study.
