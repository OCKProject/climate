<p class="p">The heat production was measured calorimetrically on triplicates from each bulk sample on a Thermal Activity Monitor (TAM) 2277 (TA Instruments Inc.). During the measurements, the replicates were kept in stainless steel ampoules (4 ml twin, type 2277-201). Direct measurements of heat production rates are difficult to perform at temperatures lower than 15–16 °C due to the risk of condensation within the equipment. Therefore, the heat production was measured at 16 °C.</p>
