<p class="p">The collected soil bulk samples were homogenized manually (stones, bones, and wooden fragments were removed) and all the replicates used for the measurements of O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> consumption, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> production, and heat production were extracted. The samples, including the temperatures at which they were incubated, are listed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table S3</xref>. O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> consumption was measured on triplicates of each bulk sample by means of SDR SensorDish
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> readers (PreSens Precision Sensing GmbH, Regensburg, Germany). The replicates were placed in vials, which were sealed by a disc of transparent commercial oxygen barrier film (EscalTM), a silicone gasket and a screw cap with aperture. Oxygen sensor foil (SF-PSt5-1223-01, PreSens) was glued to the inside of the oxygen barrier film, and the OxoDish
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> readers were placed on top of the vials. At 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> water content, the O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> consumption was measured at 0.5, 5, 10 and 16 °C. In addition the importance of soil water on the degradation, rates were investigated (at 16 °C) by measuring the O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> consumption in selected samples from Sandnes, Kangeq and Igaliku. In this experiment, sterilized deionized water was first added to mimic saturated conditions, and after the first round of measurements, the samples were freely drained and exposed to air for 24 h to mimic oxic conditions before repeating the measurements.
