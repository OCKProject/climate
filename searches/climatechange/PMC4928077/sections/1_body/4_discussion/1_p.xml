<p class="p">We included 24 depth-specific samples taken from four contrasting types of archaeological deposits that contained well-preserved organic materials from the main cultures who have lived in West and South Greenland during the past 4,000 years. In line with previous studies
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" class="xref">19</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" class="xref">20</xref>, the collected climate data reveal a North/South (cold/warm) gradient in air temperatures and soil temperatures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2A</xref>) and a West/East (wet/dry) gradient in precipitation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2B</xref>). Comparison with regional climate data shows that the mean annual air temperatures and precipitation rates at the four study sites represent 60â€“70% of the ice-free coastal areas in West and South Greenland (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table S1, S2</xref>). According to the official Greenlandic heritage data base, several thousand archaeological sites are registered in this part of Greenland (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. S13</xref>) and we therefore expect that a large number of archaeological sites are exposed to environmental conditions similar to our study sites.
