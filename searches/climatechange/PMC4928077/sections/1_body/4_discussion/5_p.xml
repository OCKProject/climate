<p class="p">Previously, it has been shown that the impact of climate change on the archaeological deposits at Qajaa can be accelerated by microbial heat production
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref>. The results obtained here further highlight the fact that microbial heat production is seen across different types of sites and is positively correlated with the organic C content of the deposits (= 0.73, p &lt; 0.01, n = 18. The overall warming effect from heat production is expected to be most pronounced in deposit with a very high organic C content, where the degradation is not limited by lack of oxygen or water. Furthermore, in accordance with studies from Arctic mine waste rock dumps

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" class="xref">28</xref>, the thickness and volume of the archaeological deposits are important for the overall “internal warming effect” of microbial heat production.
