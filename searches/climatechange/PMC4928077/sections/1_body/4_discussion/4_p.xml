<p class="p">With Q
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> values between 1.8 and 5.1 (mean = 3.3 ± 0.9), the archaeological deposits are more sensitive to temperature change than Arctic organic soils in general
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref>. In 2100, the mean annual air temperature in Western Greenland is expected to be 4.0–7.0 °C warmer than the 1961–1990 mean
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref>. This could in average increase in the degradation rate by 62–132%; but for the layers with Q
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> values above 5 the increase could be as high as 200%. This will be highly dependent on the future water balance and thus, on whether O

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" class="xref">25</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" class="xref">26</xref>. However, a likely future increase in evapotranspiration and runoff is also reported which could result in lower soil moisture content especially in the southern parts of the region
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>. Our measurements show that draining of saturated samples increased the oxygen consumption rates. For sites that are currently wet, drier conditions may lead to increased oxygen access that will accelerate the degradation. On the other hand, wetter conditions may help to keep the archaeological deposits water saturated and reduce the microbial activity. The measurements also show a 110 times increase in reactivity when water is added to the very dry samples from the inland site of Sandnes. This suggests that at sites that are currently very dry, increasing precipitation could improve the conditions for microbial activity and accelerate the rate of degradation.
