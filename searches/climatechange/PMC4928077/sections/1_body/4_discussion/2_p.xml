<p class="p">A combination of O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> consumption, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> production and heat production measurements was used to investigate the degradability of the archaeological deposits. The measured degradation rates confirm that the archaeological deposits are highly reactive with rates that are in the same order of magnitude as what has been reported from organic permafrost soils in Greenland
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref>. For three out of four sites, we found a good correlation between CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> production and O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> consumption with a ratio of approximately 0.93 mol CO
 <sub class="sub">2 </sub>mol
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. This is within the normal range found for the decomposition of soil organic matter and indicates that O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is mainly consumed by aerobic mineralization of SOC with a low oxidation level (low O-content)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4A</xref>). For the last site (Igaliku), the O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> consumption was 3–15 times higher than the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> production, indicating that processes other than SOC oxidation are taking place. Measurements of the pyrite (FeS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) content showed that the deposits at Igaliku contain pyrite (0.37%), indicating that O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> could also be consumed in reaction with pyrite. As both pyrite and SOC produces heat when oxidized this also explains why the O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> consumption and heat production was correlated at all four sites. This highlights the advantage of combining several methods when assessing the degradation of organic materials as e.g. carbonate dissolution may produce CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> without consuming O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and pyrite oxidation may consume O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> without reflecting the degradation of organic artifacts directly.
