   <bold class="bold">(A)</bold> Linear correlation between logarithmic transformed O
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> consumption rates and CO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> production rates measured at 5 °C, 
   <bold class="bold">(B)</bold> Linear correlation between logarithmic transformed O
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> consumption rates and heat production rates at 16 °C. Measurements were made on samples from Qajaa (squares), Sandnes (circles), Kangeq (triangles), and Igaliku (diamonds). The solid lines in the upper figure represent the linear fits for all points excluding Igaliku (black) and for Igaliku alone (orange). The solid black line in the bottom figure represents the linear fit for all points.
