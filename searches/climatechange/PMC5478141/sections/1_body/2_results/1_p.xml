<p class="p">The countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change on fisheries are primarily small island states in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean, and countries along the Western and Eastern coasts of Africa (

Seven of the top ten positions on the index are held by small island developing states (SIDS), while states with substantial inland fisheries such as Tanzania and Cambodia occupied lower rankings than in previous studies (

 <xref rid="pone.0179632.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] using coupled physical-biological shelf seas models across 67 EEZs matches closely with our findings with the notable exception of the Russian Federation, which occupies a position on the lower half of the vulnerability index. This is perhaps due to the Russian Federationâ€™s high levels of fisheries subsidies and emphasis on industrial fishing, which accounted for over 90% of landed catch in 2010 [
