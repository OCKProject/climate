<p class="p">Considering multiple representative concentration pathways (RCPs) as well as two different 35-year timescales (2016–2050; 2066–2100) provided insight into how climate change mitigation efforts at the global level could affect the relative vulnerability of individual countries. Full indices are calculated for all three RCPs on the two timescales (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0179632.s001" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>), and the five most/least vulnerable countries for each are listed in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0179632.t004" class="xref">Table 4</xref>. Although there is some movement of countries up or down the index, the same trend remains of SIDS occupying the top of the index, and OECD member states consistently remaining among the least vulnerable countries.
