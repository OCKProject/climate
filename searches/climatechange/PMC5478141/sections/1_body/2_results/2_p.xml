<p class="p">Vulnerability of national economies to climate change impacts on fisheries is strongly linked to states’ respective levels of development. All 31 of the world’s least developed countries (LDCs) with coastlines are included in the calculated vulnerability index, and over 87% are in the top half of the vulnerability index (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0179632.t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Likewise, 29 OECD member states are coastal, and 25 of these are in the bottom half of the index. The individual component indices, however, show greater variation, with both LDCs and OECD states fairly equally distributed across the index of exposure, and slight tendencies to greater sensitivity among LDCs and less sensitivity among OECD states. The adaptive capacity of the two groups of states are a virtual mirror image, with nearly all LDCs appearing on the lower half of the index, while almost all OECD states appear in the upper half of the index (with 86% in the top quartile) (
