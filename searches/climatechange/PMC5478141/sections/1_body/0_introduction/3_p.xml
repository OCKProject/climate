<p class="p">It is highly likely that marine fisheries around the world are vulnerable to the various impacts of climate change. Vulnerability to climate change is defined as the product of three variables, namely: (1) exposure to climate change impacts; (2) sensitivity of an economy/community/country to changes in productive capacity associated with climate change impacts; and (3) adaptive capacity, or the ability to modify or adjust fisheries and livelihoods in order to cope with the negative impacts of climate change and pursue any emerging opportunities [

 <xref rid="pone.0179632.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] used this framework to construct a global index of vulnerability of national economies to the impacts of climate change on fisheries, and the approach was further refined with the biophysical models of Barange et al. [
