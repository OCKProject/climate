<p class="p">We further refine previous efforts with new and updated data sources relevant to marine capture fisheries. In addition to recalculating the vulnerability index, we highlight the vulnerability of coastal least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS), and how deficits in adaptive capacity are the primary driver of this vulnerability. To place these findings in a broader policy context, we conclude by referencing global commitments to reduce inequality and promote equitable development, as well as pathways to reducing vulnerability, including by prioritizing the allocation of climate finance and activities to build capacity and promote the transfer of marine technologies.</p>
