<p class="p">The exposure of countries to the impacts of climate change on marine capture fisheries was calculated based on projected sea surface temperature anomalies. Three different representative concentration pathways (RCPs) were used to provide insight into exposure levels in the case of highly successful reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (RCP 2.6 –highly optimistic), more modest emissions reductions (RCP 4.5 –optimistic), and a continued increase in carbon emissions (RCP 8.5 –closer to business-as-usual, somewhat pessimistic). Multi-model ensemble means were constructed using data from all CMIP5 models with outputs that satisfied three criteria: (1) available for RCPs 2.6, 4.5 and 8.6; (2) available for the projected timeframe from 2016–2100, as well as a historical reference timeframe from 1900–1950; (3) including the variable sea surface temperature (“tos”). See 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0179632.s002" class="xref">S1 Appendix</xref> for a list of the 14 models used to calculate the multi-model ensemble means. Output data files for each model were downloaded from the Earth System Grid Federation [
 <xref rid="pone.0179632.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], concatenated using NetCDF command line operators, regridded from native grids to a standardized rectangular grid, and averaged for all 14 models. The same process was used to construct four NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) files, namely projected sea surface temperature (SST) from 2016–2100 at RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, as well as a reference climatology from 1900–1950. Finally, average SST anomalies for each of the three RCPs were computed for two future time periods, a near-future projection (2016–2050) and a distant-future projection (2066–2100) by calculating the average SST over each respective timeframe, and then subtracting the average SST from the reference climatology (1900–1950). The results for both the near-future and distant-future projections at RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 are presented in
