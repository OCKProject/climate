<p class="p">Next, the exposure of each country to SST anomalies was calculated for each of the three pathways as well as the two timeframes. For cases in which a countryâ€™s EEZ was divided into multiple polygons in the EEZ shapefile [
 <xref rid="pone.0179632.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], these were first combined according to the sovereignty feature. The points of each polygon were used to determine which grid points to extract from the SST anomaly files. These points were subsequently averaged to give the SST anomaly for each country, resulting in a total of six indices (three RCPs with two timeframes each). Finally, each index was normalized on a scale from 0 to 1. Unix and Python scripts used for the manipulation of CMIP5 files and the subsequent SST anomaly calculations are available from Kristiansen [
