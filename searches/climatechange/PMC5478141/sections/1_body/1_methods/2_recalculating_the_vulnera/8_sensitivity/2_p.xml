<p class="p">FAO reports data on number of fishers, but the level of detail varies across countries, with some going so far to disaggregate according to gender and deep sea / marine / inland fishing, while others provide aggregate data [

 <xref rid="pone.0179632.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Whenever possible, the latest disaggregated data was used for this analysis, but the authors acknowledge the variation in data quality as a limitation. As previously noted, there is only a weak correlation between the number of fishers per country and the proportion of the economically active population that are fishers [

 <xref rid="pone.0179632.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]; we found that this trend continues to persist (Spearman’s 
 <italic class="italic">ρ</italic> = 0.28) and therefore included both variables in our sensitivity index. The share of fisheries exports in total exports was calculated by dividing each country’s total exports by the latest FAO fisheries commodities trade flow data [

 <xref rid="pone.0179632.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Due to interannual variability in fisheries catch volumes, total fisheries landings were calculated as the mean of catches from 2012–2014 [
 <xref rid="pone.0179632.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. The share of marine fish protein in total protein consumption was calculated as a percentage using the latest values available on individual food balance sheets [
