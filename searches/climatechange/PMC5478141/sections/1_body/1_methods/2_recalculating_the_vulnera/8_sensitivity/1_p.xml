<p class="p">The sensitivity or dependence of countries with regard to marine capture fisheries was calculated as an index of five variables: number of fishers (

 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">1</italic>
 </sub>); share of marine fisheries exports in total exports (
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>

  <italic class="italic">2</italic>

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179632.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). In line with the previous work of Allison et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0179632.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], values for each variable were first collected from corresponding existing datasets. Next the data were normalized on a scale from 0 to 1, and the five variables were averaged with equal weights. The subsequent aggregate sensitivity variable was then normalized on a scale from 0 to 1 to create the sensitivity index.
