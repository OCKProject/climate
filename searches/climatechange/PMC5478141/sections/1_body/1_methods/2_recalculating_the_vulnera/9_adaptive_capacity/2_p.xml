<p class="p">Landlocked countries were not considered in this analysis, and a lack of data led to the exclusion of an additional 19 countries (

Finally, a vulnerability index was calculated in line with the IPCC framework (exposure + sensitivity–adaptive capacity = vulnerability), and the resulting vulnerability index was normalized on a scale from 0 to 1 (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0179632.s001" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>, the remainder of paper focuses on the vulnerability index for RCP 8.5 over the timeframe 2016–2050.
