<p class="p">We expand on previous efforts to calculate a global index of the vulnerability of national economies to climate change impacts on fisheries by adding several novel refinements. First, to the greatest possible extent, we disaggregate marine and inland fisheries. This is due not only to the stark differences in management regimes and catch volumes (marine fisheries are roughly seven times as productive as inland fisheries), but also the risks related to assessing both with the same indicator or model [

 <xref rid="pone.0179632.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] noted the challenge of choosing such a variable, and ultimately opted for mean predicted land surface temperature, while suggesting that sea surface temperature (SST) would likely be the more reliable indicator for impacts on marine fisheries, as it is linked to levels of primary production and the foundations of marine food webs [
 <xref rid="pone.0179632.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Their results were therefore somewhat skewed towards countries with substantial inland fisheries and high ratios of land area to EEZ, with land-locked countries occupying seven of the top 20 positions on their vulnerability index [
