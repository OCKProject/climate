<p class="p">Third, we revisit the constructed variable for adaptive capacity in Allison et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0179632.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], which is based on four broad socio-economic variables: healthy life expectancy; education (literacy rates and school enrolment ratios); governance (including political stability); size of economy (GDP). None of these factors, however, are specifically related to the fisheries sector, but rather theyâ€™re relevant for the adaptive capacity of any sector within a given country in the face of any type of stress or disaster. One strength of selecting such broad socio-economic variables is that they may reflect the mobility of those employed in the fisheries sector and their capacity to move into other sectors of the economy as needed. However, these indicators do not provide fisheries-specific information, and it is uncertain whether fishers or the fisheries sector are able to draw on the capacities suggested by these indicators.
