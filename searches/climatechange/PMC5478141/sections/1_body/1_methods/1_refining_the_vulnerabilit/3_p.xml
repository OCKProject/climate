<p class="p">The internal variability of climate change models increases at smaller spatial scales, rendering projections more effective at a macro level than a species-specific one [
 <xref rid="pone.0179632.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Furthermore, the unpredictability of how socio-economic factors included in this analysis will be affected by the impacts of climate change on fisheries, and corresponding feedback loops, creates a high degree of scenario uncertainty, suggesting that our analysis should be limited to a relatively short time horizon [
 <xref rid="pone.0179632.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Still, accounting for natural variability, particularly in areas like the North Pacific, suggests the need for projections that extend beyond a decadal timeframe [
 <xref rid="pone.0179632.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. We therefore depart from previous long-term efforts to forecast vulnerability to the impacts of climate change, and instead limit our projection to the near future from 2016–2050. To allow comparability with longer-term future projections, however, we also include supplemental material with projections over a similar 35-year timeframe from 2066–2100.
