<p class="p">We attempt to improve the adaptive capacity calculation by including additional factors that are directly tied to the fisheries sector. We incorporate the proportion of industrial and small-scale fishers to the adaptive capacity calculation. Industrialized fisheries typically have greater access to technology and markets than small-scale fisheries, and they are more mobileâ€“all factors that have been shown to enhance adaptation to climate-related stressors [

 <xref rid="pone.0179632.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], and we assume that higher proportions of industrial fishers increase adaptive capacity. Likewise, fisheries subsidies can provide a cushion to the sector within the context of inter-annual variability in catch levels or sudden disturbances. Such subsidies are moreover directly tied to the fisheries sector, and could broadly be considered as a proxy for the capacity or willingness of governments to assist the sector in resolving new challenges. We therefore supplement the adaptive capacity variable with the inclusion of fisheries subsidy data from the Sea Around Us Project. [
