<p class="p">Regional heterogeneity with regards to vulnerability has been a source of conflict in some transboundary natural resource management scenarios [

 <xref rid="pone.0179632.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>], suggesting that regions with the greatest variability in vulnerability scores may be particularly conflict-prone if exposure to the impacts of climate change on fisheries becomes more pronounced without mitigating efforts to build adaptive capacity. A number of general principles are emerging from multiple case studies that described key factors that contribute to building social-ecological resilience to shocks and disturbances [
 <xref rid="pone.0179632.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>], including maintaining diversity and redundancy, managing connectivity, encouraging learning and promoting polycentric governance. Translating these principles into practice involves strengthening existing institutions in the most vulnerable countries identified here, and managing issues that further increase their vulnerability. As described above, such efforts may prove contentious. Providing fishing subsidies or encouraging industrial fishing of certain stocks to promote efficiency, for instance, could result in long-term decreases in national vulnerability scores, but immediately destabilize local fishing communities, leading to negative impacts on local livelihoods, employment, nutrition and ecosystems. Clearly defined interventions that take a long-term holistic approach including local, regional and national levels incorporating both social and ecological goals are therefore crucially important.
