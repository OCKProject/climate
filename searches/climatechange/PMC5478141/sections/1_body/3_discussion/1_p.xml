<p class="p">Covering EEZs of 147 countries, this is the most comprehensive assessment to date of vulnerability due to climate change impacts on marine fisheries. The index reflects clear trends with regards to countries’ level of development, and the disaggregation of vulnerability into exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity provides some insight into how to increase social-ecological resilience in LDCs and SIDS. Most notably, no linkage is apparent between exposure to the impacts of climate change on fisheries and national development levels, with both LDCs and OECD member states spread across the exposure index. This can be interpreted as an empowering finding, because pathways to reducing exposure to the impacts of climate change will require global action and long, uncertain timeframes. Adaptive capacity, on the other hand, can be enhanced in a more direct and timely fashion through action at national and sub-national levels, and further supported by regional and global partnerships. Changes in sensitivity can also affect the overall vulnerability score, yet while a reduction in exposure or increase in adaptive capacity may find broad acceptance, a reduction in sensitivity is less clear cut. This could entail, for instance, a reduction in the number of fishers (perhaps leading to loss of livelihoods and greater unemployment–or movement into other sectors, like agriculture, that may be even more vulnerable to climate change), a reduction in total fisheries landings (perhaps leading to a loss in revenue), or a reduction in fish protein as proportion of all animal protein (perhaps leading to negative health outcomes). Accordingly, the low vulnerability scores of OECD states are also attributable in part to a continuous drop in employment in the fisheries sector over the past decades, as well as the economic importance of the fisheries sector shrinking in comparison with the overall economy [

Although perhaps slow to bear fruit, efforts to bolster adaptive capacity constitute the least contentious and most feasible option for countries to reduce vulnerability levels, particularly when considered over longer timeframes like 2016–2050.
