<p class="p">While the sensitivity component of this analysis reveals hotspots of SST anomalies under different RCPs, which will likely impact fisheries and their management, it does not attempt to quantify these impacts. A potentially useful further step for improving the index would be to specify projected changes in fisheries productivity, for instance with population models that incorporate not only SST anomalies, but also other factors such as projected changes in primary production or acidity levels [

Additionally, the homogenizing effect of averaging SST anomalies across EEZs will disproportionately affect countries with EEZs characterized by high levels of latitudinal variation. Yet similar homogenization is reflected in the socio-economic variables used to calculate the sensitivity and adaptive capacity indices (e.g. GDP per capita, fish protein as a proportion of all animal protein), which provide general estimates and enable comparability across nations, but mask regional or local variabilities. Thus, further refinements in the calculation of the exposure index would optimally be accompanied by refinements to the calculation of socio-economic variables, or would need to be undertaken at local or regional level [
