<p class="p">There is a substantial body of international commitments and agreements to reduce regional and global inequalities, promote responsible consumption and production patterns, and establish sustainable cities and communities, among other things [

 <xref rid="pone.0179632.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. As this research underscores, systematically reducing vulnerability to the impacts of climate change on marine fisheries is closely linked to development objectives. One possible avenue for translating these commitments into tangible actions is the rapidly expanding pool of financing available through climate funds, which is now estimated at up to USD 650 billion annually for all countries [
 <xref rid="pone.0179632.ref059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. Dedicated financing has also been rising, with over USD 9 billion approved for new projects in 2014 â€“nearly double 2012 levels [
 <xref rid="pone.0179632.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Fisheries exist at the nexus of food security, income generation and natural resource management, and the earmarking of climate finance to enhance adaptive capacity in countries scoring highly on the vulnerability index could bring a wide range of benefits.
