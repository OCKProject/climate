<p class="p">Initial studies have suggested that catch potential will sharply decrease in some regions, while increasing in others under different climate scenarios [

 <xref rid="pone.0179632.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Adapting to such changes will require effective fisheries management, and a recent analysis [
 <xref rid="pone.0179632.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>] suggested that China, Indonesia and India represent the three countries where there is most potential for improvement in fisheries management. All three countries were identified in the first quartile of the vulnerability index constructed in this study. Although Paragraph XI of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) specifically describes the need for capacity building and the transfer of marine technology, these obligations by the 157 signatories to UNCLOS have been cited as the least implemented section of the convention [
 <xref rid="pone.0179632.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Yet the results of this study clearly indicate where capacity building has the potential to represent a key strategy for improving fisheries management and strengthening particularly vulnerable states.
