 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-00376-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref> shows that the increased ageing (as measured by percentage of the elderly in the total population) will result in a significant increase in heat-related 
 <italic class="italic">YLLs</italic> when adaptation is considered to be constant since 2010. Each 1% increase in the degree of ageing will lead to an average of 428.0 more 
 <italic class="italic">YLLs</italic> in one million total population in the 2030s. Moreover, the ageing induced heat-related 
 <italic class="italic">YLLs</italic> will consecutively increase as time progresses, and reach a peak in the 2090s. The heat-related 
 <italic class="italic">YLLs</italic> in the future could be largely counteracted under the S1 and S3 adaptation scenarios, particularly in the 2060s and 2090s when peopleâ€™s adaptation consecutively increases. The average 
 <italic class="italic">YLLs</italic> for each 1% increase in ageing decreased from 428.0 to 368.5. The offset effects of the S2 adaptation were less than S1 and S3 (
