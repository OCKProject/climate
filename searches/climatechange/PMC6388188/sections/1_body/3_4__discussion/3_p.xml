 <italic class="italic">YLLs</italic> is a decrease in population size under the low and medium scenarios, where the population would consecutively decline after 2040. However, the population expansion process in Guangzhou would probably follow the high scenario because of the universal two-child policy issued by the Chinese government in October 2015, which aimed to attenuate negative effects of the one-child policy, such as accelerating population ageing, the skewed sex ratio, and the decline of working-age populations [

These results suggest that the rapid population expansion will lead to unprecedented challenges in dealing with health threats of future climate change, and the heat-related health risks would be greatly underestimated if population expansion was not integrated into assessment models. Policy makers need to adequately consider actions to enhance sustainable development and urban resilience to the health impacts of climate change, such as through the reduction in GHG emissions (mitigation) and the increase in adaptation [
