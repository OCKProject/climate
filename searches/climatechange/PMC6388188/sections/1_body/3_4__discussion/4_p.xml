<p class="p">It has been observed that the elderly were more vulnerable to climate change [

 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-16-00376" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] Ageing can decrease an individualâ€™s tolerance to heat. The elderly also often suffer from comorbidity, social isolation, physical and cognitive impairment, and the need to take multiple medications, which may further increase their vulnerability to extreme heat [
 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-16-00376" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Here, we found that the heat-related 
 <italic class="italic">YLLs</italic> in the elderly were projected to increase more rapidly than other age groups. For example, we estimated that every 1% increase in the percentage of the elderly per one million population would be associated with an increase in around 420 heat-related 
 <italic class="italic">YLLs</italic> in the 2030s; this figure would increase further in the 2060s and 2090s. A recent study conducted in Beijing observed similar results [

We estimated that the number of the elderly under the medium scenario in Guangzhou would increase from 0.84 million (6.62%) in 2010 to 3.5 (23.7%), 4.9 (35.7%), and 4.2 million (36.0%) in the 2030s, 2060s, and 2090s, respectively. Although the implementation of the universal two-child policy may partially alleviate the degree of ageing in the future, the absolute number of the elderly would be very large in the future [
 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-16-00376" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Hence, the protection for the elderly should be prioritized in dealing with the adverse effects of global warming. Strategies that have enhanced the care of the elderly and improve their ability to cope with climate change, such as regular monitoring of their health conditions, encouraging suitable clothing, providing cool environments, appropriate diets, and adequate intake of fluids, need to be implemented particularly at the community level as most elderly people live with their families in the community.
