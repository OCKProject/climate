<p class="p">The wheat yield per unit area, or Y, was used as the dependent variable in the study’s model. P, T, M, F, and A were all included in the model as independent variables. This model used data from Henan Province spanning from 1970 to 2014. Precipitation and average temperature data were obtained from the China Meteorological Administration [

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0184474.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The wheat yield, the total power of agricultural machinery and fertilizer use showed large variations from 1970 to 2014. For example, the mean wheat yield per unit areais 3,800.31 kg/ha, while the wheat yield is as low as 1,226.39 kg/ha (minimum), and as high as 6,157.17 kg/ha (maximum). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184474.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref> shows that the wheat yield per unit area during the wheat growth period sharply increased from 1970 to 2014(y = 110.56x+1257.5, R
