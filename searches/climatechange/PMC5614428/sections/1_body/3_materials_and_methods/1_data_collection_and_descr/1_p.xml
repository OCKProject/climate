<p class="p">Agriculture couples natural reproduction and social reproduction. Therefore crop yields are jointly affected by natural factors (e.g., temperature, precipitation, soil, solar radiation) and socioeconomic factors (e.g., agriculture management, fertilizer use, and agriculture mechanism use). Previous studies indicate that climate change and agricultural technology are two important factors that influence crop yields [

In this study, agricultural technology progress refers to the inputs of chemical fertilizers, planting areas, and mechanical progress. To examine the driving factors for increases in the wheat yield per unit area, we consider two types of factors. One type is the climate change factor, which includes temperature and precipitation. Temperature is the average temperature for entire wheat winter growth stage (from emergence to maturity, consisting of the period from last October to June). Similarly, precipitation is the total precipitation for entire wheat winter growth stage. The other type is the technical progress factor, which includes total power of agricultural machinery, fertilizer use, and the area used for wheat cultivation [
