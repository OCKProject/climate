 <xref rid="pone.0184474.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>] stability tests known as cumulative sum (CUSUM) and cumulative sum of squares(CUSUMSQ) to test the stability of the coefficient in the estimated models. If the plots of the CUSUM and CUSUMSQ statistics stay within the critical bonds of a 5% level of significance interval, the null hypothesis that all coefficients in the model are stable.
