<p class="p">The lag orders of the variables are selected using Schawrtz Bayesian criteria(SBC) and Akaikeâ€™s information criteria(AIC). AIC selects the maximum relevant lag length. SBC selects the smallest possible lag length. The long-run relationship among the variables is estimated when the ARDL model is selected by the AIC or SBC criterion. Given the models for the data set in this study, lag orders were judged based on AIC.</p>
