<p class="p">The underlying assumptions for implementing the ARDL bound test were that all the variables must be integrated at the levels of I(0) or I(1) to allow for computation of F-statistics [

 <xref rid="pone.0184474.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Therefore, unit root tests are normally carried out on the variables that are introduced to the model [
 <xref rid="pone.0184474.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. The I(0) order represents the variables in the model that were stationary in their level forms, which indicats that the variables are integrated at order zero. The I(1) order indicates that the model variables are stationary in their first differences, which indicates that the variables are integrated at order one.
