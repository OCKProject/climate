 <xref rid="pone.0184474.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. Fu is the upper bound value. Fl is the lower critical bound value. If the F-statistic &gt; Fu in the model, then the null hypothesis of no cointegration is rejected. This result would suggest the existence of a long-run relationship among the variables. However, if the computed F-statistic falls inside the critical value band, then an affirmative decision would not result. If F-statistic &lt; Fl, then the inference of no cointegration among the variables could not be rejected.
