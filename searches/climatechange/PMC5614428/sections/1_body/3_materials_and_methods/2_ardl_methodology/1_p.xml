<p class="p">When time series data are employed in non-stationary or level form, a spurious regression problem may arise. To avoid a spurious regression, cointegration analysis was developed and employed to test the existence of a long-run relationship among time series variables [
 <xref rid="pone.0184474.ref059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. The definition of cointegration is that, if two or more series are individually integrated, but some linear combination of them has a lower order of integration, then the series are said to be cointegrated [
 <xref rid="pone.0184474.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. In this study, to investigate the long-run relationship (which refers to two or more time series with a common drift way) among the variables being modeled, we adopted the ARDL bound test. In comparison to other cointegration techniques, the ARDL model has several advantages [
 <xref rid="pone.0184474.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]: (1) ARDL can be applied irrespective of the same order of integration of the variables. Thus, ARDL is appropriate irrespective of whether the variables in the model are purely I(0) (which means that the variables were stationary in their level form and were integrated at order zero) or I(1) (which means that the variables were stationary in their differences and were integrated at order one) or mutually cointegrated. The order of integration, denoted I(d), is a summary statistic for a time series that reports the minimum number of differences required to obtain a covariance stationary series [
 <xref rid="pone.0184474.ref061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. (2) ARDL can be used for small data samples. (3) ARDL can be applied to estimate short-run and long-run coefficients simultaneously. The short-run coefficients are the relationship between the deviation of the dependent variable from its long-run trend and the deviation of the independent variable from its long-run trend. More importantly, the ARDL methodology includes the bias-corrected bootstrap method and non-linear functions of the coefficients of the conditional error correction model, which can be used to estimate reliable statistical inferences for the long-run relationship among variables.
