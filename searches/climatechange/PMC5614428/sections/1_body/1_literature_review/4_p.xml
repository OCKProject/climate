<p class="p">The abovementioned studies have not drawn consistent conclusions about the impact of climate change on wheat growth and yield due to the use of different time scale, geography locations and methods. In addition, these studies did not synthesize the effects of climate change and agriculture progress factors into crop yield-climate functions to examine their impact. Most importantly, agriculture technical progress, agriculture policy and cropping systems largely differ by province in China. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the impacts of climate change and agricultural technology on wheat at the provincial level. In this study, we used an ARDL model to simultaneously examine the effects of climate change and progress in agricultural technology on wheat yield in order to identify a conclusive relationship between them.</p>
