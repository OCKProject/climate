 <xref rid="pone.0184474.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>] investigated the effects of irrigation and nitrogen regimes on wheat growth and yields based on field experiments in Henan Province and found that the wheat yield was significantly impacted by irrigation and nitrogen fertilization. You et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0184474.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] argued that using physical inputs could compensate for the negative effects of climate change on the wheat yield. Martín et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0184474.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>] modeled the impact of climate change on the wheat yield under different climate change scenarios using a calibrated version of AFRCWHEAT2 and found that agriculture management factors such as altering sowing the date and the nitrogen fertilization increased wheat yields.
