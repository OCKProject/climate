<p class="p">In fact, the wheat yield is jointly influenced by climate factors, the use of modern inputs and crop management, and it is difficult to separate one factorâ€™s influence on the wheat yield from that of the other factors [
 <xref rid="pone.0184474.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Most previous studies failed to employ climate factors, agriculture technical progress factors (e.g., fertilizer, machinery, irrigation) and agriculture management practices in the same crop yield-climate functions. Therefore, it is necessary to build a unified framework or method to examine the relationship between the wheat yield, climate change and agricultural technology progress. You et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0184474.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>] tested the effects of physic input (e.g., seeds, fertilizer, pesticide, machinery and so on) and climate factors (e.g., temperature, rainfall and solar radiation) on wheat yield using Cobb-Douglas function. However, when doing so, if a co-integration relationship between non-stationary time series data does not exist, then the regression models based on the time series data are likely to produce spurious regression results. The ARDL model can effectively avoid the spurious regression problem. Additionally, it can not only consider the long-run equilibrium relationship and the short-run fluctuation relationship between variables but also can effectively distinguish between them [
 <xref rid="pone.0184474.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. Thus, the ARDL model is an effective method for estimating the relationship between climate change, technical progress and the wheat yield.
