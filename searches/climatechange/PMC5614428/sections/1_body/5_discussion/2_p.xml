<p class="p">Our results demonstrated that the increased wheat yield per unit area in Henan Province is mainly explained by agriculture technical progress, such as increasing the input of machines and fertilizers, which is consistent with previous research [

 <xref rid="pone.0184474.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. Liu et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0184474.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>] argued that the amount of irrigation water applied is very important to quantify the contribution of irrigation to the wheat yield. Wang [
 <xref rid="pone.0184474.ref070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>] examined the share of effective irrigation area of the total cultivated area to test its impact on wheat yield. However, in this study, we found that there was a strong correlation between the effective irrigation area and the wheat planting area (r = 0.82) [
 <xref rid="pone.0184474.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>], as Henan is dominated by non- rain-fed agriculture. Furthermore, due to a lack of consumption data for irrigation water, we did not investigate this factor. In addition to increasing the use of physical inputs, R&amp;D investment and institutional changes (e.g., the household contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output) in China are also considered to be stimulating factors that improve the wheat yield [
 <xref rid="pone.0184474.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>], which should be investigated in a follow-up study.
