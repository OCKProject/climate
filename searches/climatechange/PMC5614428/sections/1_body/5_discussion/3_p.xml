<p class="p">Fertilizer use was considered as a dominant factor in the increase of wheat yields, especially in the eastern production areas of the North China Plain [
 <xref rid="pone.0184474.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>].Our results once again demonstrated this conclusion. However, in our study, we found that the effect of fertilizer use is negative when short-run effect is considered. The reason may be that, in the short term, the use of excessive fertilizer will destroy soil structure and break the soil ecosystem balance, resulting in wheat production. Since 1980s, even though the average yield of cereal crops is stagnating, fertilizer application has continued to increase in China, which led to decrease fertilizer use efficiency and increase environment pollution [

 <xref rid="pone.0184474.ref072" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>] argued that the higher the fertilizer input, the lower the yield per unit chemical fertilizer input. Thereby, in the future study, the relationship between fertilizers input intensity and wheat yield per unit area should be investigated.
