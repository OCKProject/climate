<p class="p">Most of the previous studies have focused on investigating the impact of climate change on crop yields at the national level [

 <xref rid="pone.0184474.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] or the regional level [

Hence, in order to design well-targeted adaptation policies and to ensure food security, there is a need to extend this study to other provinces. Such follow-up studies should not only focus on the impact of climate factors, agriculture technology progress and other input factors on crop yields, but also pay more attention to the differences among the different provinces.
