<p class="p">To test the long-run and short-run relationships among the variables, it was first necessary to determine whether cointegration relationships existed among the variables. 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0184474.t003" class="xref">Table 3</xref> shows the results for cointegration from applying the ARDL bound test. The computed F-statistic of 4.306 is higher than the upper-bound critical value (at the 2.5% significance level) when the wheat yield per unit area is the dependent variable. Therefore, these results indicated the existence of cointegrating relationships among the variables when the wheat yield per unit area is used as the dependent variable.
