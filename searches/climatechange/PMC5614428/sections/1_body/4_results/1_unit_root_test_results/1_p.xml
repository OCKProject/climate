<p class="p">Therefore, we need to investigate the stationarity properties of the variables by employing the most commonly used unit root tests. To check the order of integration of each variable, we useed Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) and Phillips Perron (PP) unit root tests. 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0184474.t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref> shows the results for the unit root test of the variables in the models. According to both the ADF and PP tests, the M, A, and Y variables were not stationary in their level forms but became stationary at their first differences at the 1% level of statistical significance. In addition, the variables F, P and T were both stationary in their level forms and at their first differences. In fact, the temperature and precipitation in Henan Province are impacted by other provincesâ€™ temperature and precipitation levels due to the space-adjacent relationship. However, in this study, we only considered the time-series relationship among the variables based on historical data; thus, we did not run spatial stationary tests of temperature and precipitation in Henan Province.
