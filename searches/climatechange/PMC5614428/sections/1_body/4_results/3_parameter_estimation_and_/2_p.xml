<p class="p">The long-run coefficients of agricultural machinery and fertilizer use are statistically significant (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0184474.t004" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). These results suggest that a 1% increase in machine use leads to a 0.21% (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0184474.t004" class="xref">Table 4</xref>, row 4, column 3) increase in the per unit area wheat yield. Furthermore, the magnitude of 0.1969 implies that a 1% increase in fertilizer use will increase the per unit area wheat yield by 0.19% (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0184474.t004" class="xref">Table 4</xref>, row 5, column 3) when long-run effects are considered. In the long term, the area used for wheat cultivation does not significantly impact the wheat yield per unit area. It is worth noting that the long-run coefficient of precipitation is negative, which implies that an increase in precipitation leads to a decreased wheat yield per unit area. Indeed, a 1% increase in precipitation leads to a 0.55% (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0184474.t004" class="xref">Table 4</xref>, row 7, column 3) decrease in the wheat yield per unit area. However, the impact of temperature on the wheat yield per unit area in the long run is found to be not significant during the whole wheat growth period.
