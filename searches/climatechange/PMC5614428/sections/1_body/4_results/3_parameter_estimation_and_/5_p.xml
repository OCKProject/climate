<p class="p">We can infer from the results of the analysis that promoting the efficiency of the agricultural machinery used would be a good way to increase the wheat yield per unit area in the long run. In addition, appropriately increasing the aggregate quantity of fertilizer used may also be worthy of consideration in the long run. Important conclusions can be drawn from the short-run test results. To resolve any the adverse effects on the wheat yield, it may be necessary to pay more attention to expanding the area of wheat cultivation. It should be noted, however, that it might not be possible to immediately expand the land area for wheat cultivation because the available arable land could be limited. In fact, mountainous and hilly areas account for 44.3% of Henan Province, which makes cultivating more arable land improbable. Converting barren land in mountainous and hilly areas to arable land for the cultivation of wheat is a laborious task that takes substantial time. Thus, the best remedy in response to the reduction in the wheat yield may be to better utilize the arable land by increasing the cultivation intensity through the use of agricultural machinery.</p>
