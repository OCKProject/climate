<p class="p">For the short-run relationship, the coefficient of machine use is not significant when the wheat yield per unit area is the dependent variable. The coefficient of fertilizer use is negative. The coefficient of the wheat cultivation area shows that there is a positive and significant relationship between the area used for wheat cultivation and the wheat yield per unit area. This result implies that in the short run, an increase in the wheat cultivation area will play an important role in increasing the wheat yield in Henan. A 1% increase in the wheat cultivation area leads to an increase in the wheat yield per unit area by 1.98% (

The sign of the precipitation coefficient is positive and statistically significant in the short run, which is the opposite of the relationship between precipitation and the wheat yield in the long run. The coefficient of P is 0.3071 which implies that a 1% increase in precipitation will lead to a 0.31% (
