<p class="p">The lagged error correction coefficient, ECM
 <sub class="sub">t-1</sub>, is correct in sign, and significant in verifying the established cointegration relationship among the variables. The coefficient of ECM
 <sub class="sub">t-1</sub> shows the speed of the adjustment back to the long run equilibrium after a short run shock. In 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0184474.t004" class="xref">Table 4</xref>, the coefficient of ECM
 <sub class="sub">t-1</sub> is -0.8167 (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0184474.t004" class="xref">Table 4</xref>, row 14, column 3), which is between 0 and -1 and means that approximately 0.82% of the disequilibria in the wheat yield per unit area of the previous yearâ€™s shock adjust back to the long-run equilibrium in the current year.
