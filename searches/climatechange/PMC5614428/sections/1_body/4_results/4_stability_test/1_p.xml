<p class="p">For the goodness of fit for the ARDL model, tests using the cumulative sum (CUSUM) and the CUSUM of squares (CUSUMSQ) were carried out after confirming the cointegration relationship among variables. CUSUM and CUSUMSQ tests were conducted based on the recursive regression residuals as suggested by Brown [
