<p class="p">The autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bound test as discussed by Pesaran et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0184474.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] enabled us to ascertain whether a long-run relationship among the variables existes. This approach has been used in some recent empirical studies examining the impact of climate change and other factors on agriculture in many regions, such as Europe [
 <xref rid="pone.0184474.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], Pakistan [
 <xref rid="pone.0184474.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>], Ghana [
 <xref rid="pone.0184474.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>], and India [
 <xref rid="pone.0184474.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. It differs from previous methods in that this method can be used to identify long-run/short-run relationship among variables. In addition, ARDL can be applied irrespective of the order of integration of the variables and it is suitable for small data samples. Therefore, our study employed ARDL model to examine the impacts of different variables on the wheat yield.
