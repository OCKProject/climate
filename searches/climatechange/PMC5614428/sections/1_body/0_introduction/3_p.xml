The main advantages of these statistical models are their transparent assessment of the model uncertainties and their decreased reliance on field calibration data; thus, these types of models are regarded as a common alternative to process-based models [

In addition, the related literature indicates that progress in agricultural technology has been the main driving force promoting increased wheat yield in major wheat-producing regions of the world over the past three decades [

Especially since 1978, the development of China’s agricultural biochemistry technology, mechanical technology, and cultivation technology has been rapid; in addition, the use of chemical fertilizers and large agricultural machinery (such as cutters, drills, rotary cultivators) and the construction of irrigation and water conservancy facilities have also played an important role in increasing wheat yield [
