<p class="p">Research on the impact of climate change on wheat growth and yield has been a hot topic in China [

 <xref rid="pone.0184474.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. In the field of natural science, there are two approaches to estimating the potential impacts of climate change on agricultural systems: Exploring the effects of long-term climate change/variability on the wheat yield (1) using crop simulation models [
 <xref rid="pone.0184474.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0184474.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] (e.g., CERES-Wheat, C-CAM, EPIC, and others) and climate change scenarios [
 <xref rid="pone.0184474.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0184474.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0184474.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] and (2) using field experiments or artificial climate chamber experiments [
 <xref rid="pone.0184474.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Crop simulation modeling is the most commonly used approach and is often used in combination with climate change scenarios and crop simulation models. However, modeling typically relies on many input factors, such as rainfall, soil, temperature, nutrition, evapotranspiration, the economic environment, atmospheric circulation, and carbon circulation, which make the approach laborious and expensive. In addition, uncertainties in parameter values substantially increase the uncertainty estimates for model projections [
 <xref rid="pone.0184474.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. And researchers do not fully understand the mechanisms driving crop growth; this lack of understanding leads to prediction risk. Field experiments require more time and a larger budget than other approaches, but the results of field experiments are often more straightforward [
