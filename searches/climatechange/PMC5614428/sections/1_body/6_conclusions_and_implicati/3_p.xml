<p class="p">The findings of this study have several policy implications that could ensure continuous increases in the wheat yield per unit area and food security under climate change in Henan Province. Large-scale mechanical operations and intensive cultivation could be effective measures to increase the wheat yield. Therefore, central and local governments should fund agriculture mechanical operations. The amount of cultivated area was not the main driving factor for the increased wheat yield in the long term. Protecting the arable land cultivated for wheat is necessary to increase the wheat yield because the amount of arable land is limited. Precipitation had a negative impact on the wheat yield. The water required for wheat growth in Henan Province is mainly derived from irrigation. Therefore, under climate change, the government may also need to repair and expand the existing irrigation facilities to avoid the negative effects of drought. In addition, the present study also found evidence that fertilizer use positively impacts the wheat yield per unit area in the long run. The uptake of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium during the period of wheat growth must change based on the characteristics of particular wheat varieties, cultivation techniques, the soil, and climate change. In addition, the required amount and proportion of nutrient absorption is different during each wheat growth period. Thus, the government may need to make fertilizer available to farmers at no cost or at subsidized prices. In addition, agro-technicians could be arranged to guide farmers regarding the reasonable use of fertilizers, based on the climate, the soil, wheat variety and growth period characteristics.</p>
