<p class="p">In the long run, the results of the analysis show that the coefficients of machine use and the aggregate quantity of fertilizer used were positive and statistically significant, suggesting that these factors have improved the wheat yield per unit area in Henan Province. In contrast, the results also show that precipitation during the wheat growth period has led to a decrease in the wheat yield per unit area. In the short run, the coefficient of the aggregate quantity of fertilizer used was negative. Precipitation and the area used for wheat cultivation had a significantly positive impact on the wheat yield. There was no significant short-run or long-run impact of temperature on wheat yield per unit area in Henan Province. It is concluded that wheat yield per unit area are mainly improved by machine use and aggregate quantity of fertilizer used from 1970 to 2014 in Henna province.</p>
