<p class="p">In this paper, we examined the relationships among the wheat yield per unit area, machine use, the area used for wheat cultivation, the aggregate quantity of fertilizer used, precipitation and temperature in Henan Province over the period between 1970 and 2014. Based on the analytical results of this work, two issues can be resolved. One is whether the threat of climate change impacted the wheat yield per unit area in Henan Province. The other is whether technical progress, i.e., machine use and aggregate quantity of fertilizer used, increased the wheat yield per unit area. For this purpose, we applied the ARDL model to test the influence of climate change and technical factors on the wheat yield per unit area in the long run. The results of the ARDL bound test for cointegration suggest that there is cointegration among the variables.</p>
