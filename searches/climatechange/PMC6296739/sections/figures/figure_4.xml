    <italic class="italic">cuvieri</italic>, with circle colour showing the regions within the study area: North, from the Oiapoque River basin to the Maroni River (light blue); Centre, Araguari River basin (red); Southeast, included Jari and Vila Nova River basins (yellow); and Mamiá and Jatuarana villages, state of Pará (blue).
   </bold> Based on cyt-b the haplotype network (bottom) has branch lengths corresponding to the nucleotide substitutions. The number of mutational steps of the largest branches is shown in the figure captions. Circle sizes correspond to the number of individuals sharing the same haplotype. Circle colors correspond to the colors of the regions identified on the map. Circles in black correspond to the mean vectors. The clusters recovered by BAPS are outlined and identified as C1, C2, C3 and C4 on the map and haplotype network.
