<p class="p">Intense landscape changes, such as the expansion of drier vegetation and the fragmentation of forest blocks related to the decrease in temperatures during the Pleistocene, and the intense geomorphological changes occurring in the estuary of the Amazon River around this time, had distinct impacts on the northern and southern portions of eastern Guianas. This climate and landscape changes probably drivers the diversification of the two spiny rats. Consequently, 
 <italic class="italic">Proechimys cuvieri</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">guyannensis</italic> populations in the eastern portion of the Guiana region were geographically structured. Apparently two events were important in the structuration of populations in both species of spiny rats, first the geomorphological changes having occurred during the early Pleistocene (having led to the different clusters in each species: 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206660.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>) and much later the climatic changes in Late Pleistocene (LGM) resulting in the structuration of some clusters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206660.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206660.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). Then, the clusters G1 and C1 went through a demographic expansion (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206660.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>) with the end of the LGM, probably resulting in a founding effect, mainly in 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">guyannensis</italic> (G1). The genetic distances recorded associated with the structured population clusters, reinforce the need for a more detailed investigation of the comparative ecology and phylogeography of both species, with special attention to 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">guyannensis</italic> for testing its well-marked structuration. Likely different ecological traits, use of space, preferred resources, adaptive ability to face habitat modifications, should be described more deeply. For a more detailed systematic review of the genus, it is necessary to include specimens from throughout the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">Proechimys</italic>, employing wider genetic or genomic approaches and karyotyping.
