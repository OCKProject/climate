 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206660.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). The haplotypes in the northern part of the study area, including samples from French Guiana and one location in the state of Amap√° on the Anotaie River, a tributary of the Oiapoque, formed cluster G1. The haplotypes from the south-east of the study area, from the localities on the Jari and upper Vila Nova rivers formed group G3. Group G4 brings together the samples from two localities between the Jari and Trombetas rivers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206660.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). The haplotype network recovered the clusters identified by the BAPS, resulting in four clusters separated from each other by more than 20 mutational steps. The geographical layout encompasses clusters distributed from north to south. Significant haplotype sharing was observed in the Cayenne locality (point 12 in
