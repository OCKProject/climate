 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206660.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>) which make up cluster C1 in the BAPS results. The C1 cluster includes the haplotypes from the northern-most area within the study region, between the Maroni and Sinnamary rivers in French Guiana. The haplotypes distributed between central French Guiana and central Amapá, north of the Araguari River, form cluster C2. Haplotypes from the south-east region were recovered in a cluster together with a haplotype from Santana Island, in the Amazon Estuary formed cluster C3. Finally, the C4 cluster linked the samples from the Mamiá, a tributary of the Curuá River, with haplotypes from the Jari River and Baramita, in Guyana (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206660.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). The haplotype network also presented a topology similar to that of the haplotype tree, although the two clades P and R formed a single cluster (C1), in agreement with the BAPS results. The

 <italic class="italic">cuvieri</italic> clusters were separated from each other by fewer mutational steps, between six and 13. There was relatively little sharing of haplotypes, and a large number of unique haplotypes (
