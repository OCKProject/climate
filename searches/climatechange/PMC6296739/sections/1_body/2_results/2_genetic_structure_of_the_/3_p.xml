<p class="p">We found the largest intraspecific genetic distances for both species when we compared the clusters identified by the BAPS, with p-distance ranging from 3.35% to 4.23% (
 <xref rid="pone.0206660.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>) in

 <italic class="italic">guyannensis</italic>. Smaller values (0.84–1.48%) were found when comparing the interfluves (Maroni-Oiapoque, Oiapoque-Araguari, Araguari-Jari, Jari-Trombetas). Similarly, while we found high genetic distance values between interfluvial regions in

 <italic class="italic">cuvieri</italic> (p-distances: 1.2–2.53%), they were still lower than those recorded between clusters (1.84–3.17%; 
 <xref rid="pone.0206660.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Intraspecific genetic distances were smaller in interfluves comparisons than in inter-clusters comparisons. This is well-marked in 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">guyannensis</italic> (p-values &lt;0.01 in t-tests and Mann-Whitney tests) but less pronounced in 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">cuvieri</italic> (p-values 0.08 in t-tests; not significant in Mann-Whitney test).
