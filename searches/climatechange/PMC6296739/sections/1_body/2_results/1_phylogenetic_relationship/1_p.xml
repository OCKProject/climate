 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206660.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). The samples from Amazonas, Roraima, and Venezuela formed clade J. In clade C, the samples were organized in four subclades: the haplotypes from French Guiana and northern Amapá (clade D), central Amapá (clade I), south-east Amapá (clade H) and two localities in Pará (clade G). These clades were well-supported statistically either with bootstraps (ML) or posterior probabilities (Bayesian analysis), with the exception of clade D, which was supported only weakly by the ML analysis (

These clades were supported statistically by the PP or bootstrap analysis (
