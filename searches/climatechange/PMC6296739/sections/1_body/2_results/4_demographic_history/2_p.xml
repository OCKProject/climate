<p class="p">In the complete

 <italic class="italic">cuvieri</italic> dataset, the only deviation from neutrality was found in Fuâ€™s Fs (
 <xref rid="pone.0206660.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). In the analysis of the clusters, we recorded significant Fs values for clusters C2 and C4, and significant R2 values for clusters C1 and C3. In the analysis of the interfluves, we recorded significantly R2 and Fs values for the Araguari-Jari interfluve (
 <xref rid="pone.0206660.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The Mismatch distribution suggest a significant expansion for G1 only (both SSD and Raggedness tests 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>&lt;0.05), and to a less extent for G2 (Raggedness 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>&lt;0.05, SSD 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> value = 0.08) and G4 (SSD 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>&lt; 0.01). Bayesian reconstruction of the demographic history revealed an expansion event for both species. In 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">guyannensis</italic>, the most recent expansion was recorded for cluster G1 and important expansion (revealed by all statistical tests), occurring over the past 30,000 years, whereas in cluster G2, expansion was either quite older and/or of a lower extent (

 <italic class="italic">cuvieri</italic>, although they benefited from a lower statistical support (
