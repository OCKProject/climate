<p class="p">We obtained significant results for the R2 (-2.3781), D (-2.3781), and Fs (-4.572) parameters for the

 <italic class="italic">guyannensis</italic> cluster G1. When we analyzed the whole dataset, however, no significant values were obtained, although a significant R2 value was obtained for cluster G4 (
 <xref rid="pone.0206660.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). We obtained similar results when we analyzed the data organized by interfluve, with significant values being recorded for all the parameters for the Oiapoque-Maroni interfluve (Fs = -4.168; D = -2.3200; R2 = -0.0617), which has haplotypes similar to the G1 cluster.
