 <italic class="italic">Proechimys</italic> spiny rats comprise the most species-rich genus within the family Echimyidae. The genus distribution includes tropical South America and Central America south from Honduras [
 <xref rid="pone.0206660.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. These terrestrial rodents are also characterized by considerable genetic and morphological variation found both within and between populations, which has hindered taxonomic studies and the reliable delimitation of geographic ranges [

 <xref rid="pone.0206660.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Twenty-two species arranged in 10 species groups are currently recognized for the genus

 <italic class="italic">Proechimys cuvieri</italic> Petter, 1978 is monotypic and part of the

 <italic class="italic">Proechimys guyannensis</italic> (E. Geoffroy, 1803) is also considered monotypic (despite high intraspecific variation; see comments in Patton &amp; Leite, [
 <xref rid="pone.0206660.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]) and belongs to the 
 <italic class="italic">guyannensis</italic> species group. Both species are characterized by considerable karyotypic and molecular variability [
