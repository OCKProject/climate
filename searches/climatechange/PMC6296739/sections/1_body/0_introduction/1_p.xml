 <xref rid="pone.0206660.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] was the first naturalist to observe that major rivers could represent barriers between populations separated in different margins, promoting allopatric speciation. The so-called riverine barrier hypothesis has been corroborated by a number of studies, in particular with birds and primates [

 <xref rid="pone.0206660.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], but this model was not upheld for other mammalian taxa [

 <xref rid="pone.0206660.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Leite &amp; Rogers [
 <xref rid="pone.0206660.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] postulated that the effect of a river as a barrier depends largely on the vagility of the focal organism and that is conditioned to the geography and historical formation of the drainage system. An alternative hypothesis invoking Pleistocene refugia postulates that climatic oscillations during this period modified patterns of vegetation cover and the degree of landscape connectivity, promoting isolation among populations [

 <xref rid="pone.0206660.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. However, palynological and geomorphological studies [
 <xref rid="pone.0206660.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] and climate modeling [
 <xref rid="pone.0206660.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] suggested that vegetational changes in the Quaternary were not enough to fragment the Amazon forest into a mosaic of forest fragments isolated by open vegetation.
