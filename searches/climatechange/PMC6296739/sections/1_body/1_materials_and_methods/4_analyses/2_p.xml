 <xref rid="pone.0206660.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>] was used to select the HKY+G like the best evolutionary model for the datasets based on Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The BI phylogenetic tree was reconstructed in MrBayes 3.2.1 [
 <xref rid="pone.0206660.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>], using 10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup> Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) generations, with the first 25% being discarded as burn-in. The ML analysis was run in RAxML in the CIPRES Science Gateway [
 <xref rid="pone.0206660.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Nodal support was estimated with 100 bootstrap replicates. We estimated the divergence time between the lineages using the relaxed lognormal uncorrelated molecular clock and the Yule Process pure-birth speciation model, run in BEAST 1.6.2 [
 <xref rid="pone.0206660.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. The substitution rate used in the analysis was the 3.6% divergence per million year, derived from Fabre et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0206660.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. We used the following times inferred from Fabre et al. [

 <italic class="italic">Hoplomys</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Proechimys</italic> set at 5.5 Ma (95% CI: 4.6–6.7), with these dates being used as calibration for the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA), considering a normal distribution. Since no more recent calibration point was available, we confirmed the absence of substitution saturation on the [
