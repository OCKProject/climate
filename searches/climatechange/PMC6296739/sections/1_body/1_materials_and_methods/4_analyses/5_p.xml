<p class="p">We calculated Fu’s Fs [

 <xref rid="pone.0206660.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>] and R2 [
 <xref rid="pone.0206660.ref068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>] to assess potential deviations from neutrality. We used the program DNASP version 5.0 [
 <xref rid="pone.0206660.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>] and significance was determined from 10,000 coalescent simulations. For each 
 <italic class="italic">Proechimys</italic> species, we analyzed the complete dataset, the clusters from BAPS analyses, and samples separated by main interfluves (Maroni–Oiapoque; Oiapoque–Araguari; Araguari–Jari; Jari–Trombetas). We used the Mismatch Distribution Analysis [
 <xref rid="pone.0206660.ref070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>] with the sum of square deviations (SSD) between the observed and the expected mismatch and the ragggedness index as statistic tests and generated a Bayesian Skyline Plot (BSP) in BEAST 1.6.2 [
 <xref rid="pone.0206660.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>] to assess the demographic history of the clusters for both species over time. We only inferred BSP for clusters with more than 10 sequences. We used HKY+G evolutionary model and Yule prior. We ran 10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup> MCMC generations, excluding the first 25% samples as burn-in. Effective sample sizes, parameter estimates, and convergence of the Markov chains were determined using TRACER 1.6 [
