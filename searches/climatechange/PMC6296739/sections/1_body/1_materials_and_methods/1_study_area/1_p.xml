<p class="p">Tissue samples used in this study were distributed from French Guiana and the Brazilian states of Amapá and Pará, situated in the eastern portion of the Guiana region. This region is well-preserved, with large areas of forest protected by a network of conservation units on both sides of Brazil and French Guiana [

 <xref rid="pone.0206660.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] located between the forests of the interior portion and the coastal region. The coastal zone of southern Amapá is influenced primarily by the adjacent Amazon River, which forms extensive areas of seasonally flooded habitats, with many lakes and islands [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206660.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). The Brazilian portion of the study area is the most impacted, with extensive deforestation and human colonization along the Atlantic coast and the northern margin of the Amazon River in Pará State [
 <xref rid="pone.0206660.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. A more recent impact is the ongoing expansion of soybean plantations into the savannah habitats of Amapá State [
