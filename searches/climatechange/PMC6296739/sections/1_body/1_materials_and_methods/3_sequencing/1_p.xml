<p class="p">The DNA was extracted from tissue samples, obtain of the muscle and skin byopsy, preserved in 95% ethanol. The DNA was extracted using the NucliSENS EasyMag robot (Biomérieux, Craponne, France) and Wizard Genomic DNA Purification (Promega) kits, according to the manufacturers’ protocols. Three overlapping fragments of the cytb were amplified using internal and external primers. We amplified the first fragment, of 400–500 bps, using the primers 
 <monospace class="monospace">H6 (5'TCTTCCATGAGGACAAATATC3') and L15 (5’TCTCCATTTCTGGTTTACAAGAC3'),</monospace> and the final fragment (also 400–500 bps) using the primers H8 [

 <monospace class="monospace">5' TACCATGAGGACAAATATC’</monospace>). The intermediate fragment, with approximately 400 bps, was amplified using the primers 
 <monospace class="monospace">PRO 197F (5´TTACACAYATTTGYCGAGAYG3´) and PRO 665R (5´GGGTGRAATGGRATTTTGTCTGA3´),</monospace> which were designed specifically for this study. The samples were amplified in 40 μL reaction volumes using Platinum Taq (Life Technologies Corp.) containing 4.0 μL of each primer, 5.0 μL of reaction buffer, 3.0 μL of MgCl
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> 50 mM, 5.0 μL of dNTP mix, 0.5 μL of polymerase, 2.0 μL of the DNA template, and 16,5 μL of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycle consisted of initial denaturation at 94°C for 3 min, followed by 30 amplification cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 sec, annealing at 45°C for 1 min and extension at 72°C for 2 min, with a final extension at 72°C for 10 min.
