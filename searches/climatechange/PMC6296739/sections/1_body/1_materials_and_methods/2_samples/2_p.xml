<p class="p">We sequenced 1100 base pairs (bp) of the CYTB gene in 37 samples of 
 <italic class="italic">Proechimys cuvieri</italic> from 22 localities and 54 samples of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">guyannensis</italic> from 20 localities within the study area, between northern French Guiana and Brazil, north of the Amazon River (Amapá and Pará). The two species were sympatric at 11 sites (
