<p class="p">Patton et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0206660.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] assessed the genetic divergence in 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">cuvieri</italic> samples from Brazil (Amazonas and Par√°), together with localities in Peru, Venezuela and French Guiana, using sequences of the cytb gene and confirmed the monophyly for eastern Amazonia, including Guianas region clade. Our phylogenetics analyses recovered a clade of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">cuvieri</italic> in northeastern of the Amazon region which appeared distinct from samples of the other Amazon regions. For 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">guyannensis</italic> the haplotypes of northeastern region were recovered in a clade separated from the other samples of the distribution area of this species (Amazonas, Roraima and Venezuela). Based on the analysis of cytb and of karyotypes for 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">guyannensis</italic> samples, Bonvicino et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0206660.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] recovered three clades in the Guiana region including one north-eastern clade (French Guiana) and two western clades (Roraima and Amazonas/Venezuela).
