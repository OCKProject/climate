<p class="p">In spite of the limitation of mitochondrial data, it has already been shown to be robust [
 <xref rid="pone.0206660.ref076" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>] and has long been considered as a standard for phylogeography and for assessing genetic variation within and between populations [
 <xref rid="pone.0206660.ref077" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. Further, high ration of copies compared to nuclear genome allows for isolation from long dead tissues and collection-preserved samples, and consequently favor work on large dataset, not requiring new field captures for fresh and/or high quality samples. Here we significantly increased the knowledge about the phylogeography of these two species Amazonian Spiny rats [
 <xref rid="pone.0206660.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0206660.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] confirming the uniqueness of the western portion of the Guyana region. Our conclusions and interpretations should be confirmed by other molecular characters, complex processes of fragmentation, expansion and admixture—as can be inferred from our study—should be confirmed through the use of several and complementary types of molecular markers.
