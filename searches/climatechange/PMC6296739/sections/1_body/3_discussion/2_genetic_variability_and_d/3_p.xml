These two datings, almost similar, might be the result of a process of genetic isolation in forest fragments produced by the intense changes in the configuration of the regionâ€™s vegetation that occurred during the early Pleistocene and late Pliocene [

 <xref rid="pone.0206660.ref083" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>]. Cold and warm periods of the Pleistocene, isolating populations and promoting backward and forward migrations, may also have led to competitive interactions between the two species, and facilitated structuration, in a dynamic process comparable to the disturbance-vicariance hypothesis [
