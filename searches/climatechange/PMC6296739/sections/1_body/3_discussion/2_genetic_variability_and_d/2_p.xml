With the increase of the sampled area in northeastern Amazonia, we identified a cluster (G1) that groups samples from northern of French Guiana to Oiapoque River, with a large number of shared haplotypes. This cluster includes a haplotype (H1) that is shared with the majority of the samples from Cayenne, with one principal haplotype (H35) that forms the center of a star-like network, which may reflect recent colonization and/or are expanding population [
