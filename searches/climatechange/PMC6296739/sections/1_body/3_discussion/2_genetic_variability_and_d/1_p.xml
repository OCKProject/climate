<p class="p">Different hydrological factors, including size and course stability [
 <xref rid="pone.0206660.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], may influence the effectiveness of a river to act as a barrier to gene flow. Previous studies suggested ther is no evidence for a major role of rivers in the genetic differentiation of most Amazonian rodents [
