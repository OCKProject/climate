 <p class="p">The spiny rats, genus 
  <italic class="italic">Proechimys</italic>, have the highest species richness within the Echimyidae family, as well as species with high genetic variability. The genus distribution includes tropical South America and Central America south to Honduras. In this study, we evaluate the phylogeographic histories of 
  <italic class="italic">Proechimys guyannensis</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">cuvieri</italic> using cytochrome b, in a densely sampled area in northeastern Amazon where both species are found in sympatry in different environments. For each species, Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analysis were congruent and recovered similar clades in the studied area. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis using a relaxed molecular clock showed that these clusters of haplotypes diversified during Pleistocene for both species. Apparently, the large rivers of the region did not act as barriers, as some clades include specimens collected from opposite banks of Oiapoque, Araguari and Jari rivers. Bayesian skyline plot analysis showed recent demographic expansion in both species. The Pleistocene climatic changes in concert with the geologic changes in the Amazon fan probably acted as drivers in the diversification that we detected in these two spiny rats. 
  <italic class="italic">Proechimys cuvieri</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">guyannensis</italic> show genetic structure in the eastern part of the Guiana region. Greater genetic distances observed in 
  <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">guyannensis</italic>, associated with highly structured groups, suggest that more detailed studies of systematics and ecology should be directed to this species.
