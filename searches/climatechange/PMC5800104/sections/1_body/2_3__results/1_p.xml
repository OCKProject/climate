<p class="p">We discuss the relationship between the SSPs and each building block in turn. The figures in each subsection outline the key differences between SSP1/5, SSP2, and SSP3/4, and also distinguish any differences between SSP1 and SSP5, as well as SSP3 and SSP4, respectively. We group SSP1 and SSP5 together, and SSP3 and SSP4 together, because these SSPs have similar implications for health systems. However, there are distinctions between them. In general, SSP1 and SSP5 are distinguished by the lack of mitigation capacity in the latter, which results in greater damage from climate and development shocks, and creates uncertainty for proactive adaptation. SSP3 and SSP4 are distinguished by high levels of inequality in the latter, resulting in greater intranational variation in responses, with some regions responding relatively adequately to climate and health risks, while poorer regions have few, if any, resources with which to plan. SSP2 represents an intermediate pathway between SSP1/SSP5 and SSP3/SSP4, and is not extensively discussed in this text. For each of the building blocks, health sector responses are projected to be strongest under SSP1/SSP5, and weakest under SSP3/SSP4.
