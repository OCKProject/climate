<p class="p">Under SSP3/SSP4, high-income countries are most likely to fund climate and health efforts, albeit at insufficient levels. Low/middle-income countries, which are likely to experience more severe fiscal pressures due to other development priorities, are unlikely to devote sufficient funds to these efforts, resulting in poorer population health outcomes. Because of a lack of mitigation efforts, demand for adaptation funding grows, especially in low/middle-income countries, even as the supply of these funds from high-income countries is limited. This tension places substantial strain on intergovernmental relationships, and makes effective international partnerships to address climate and health challenges virtually impossible. Moreover, donor organizations created to finance climate change adaptation efforts in low/middle-income countries receive minimal support from high-income countries. Under SSP3, the funding and partnerships that do materialize are largely regionally concentrated, with high-income countries supporting the preparedness efforts of nearby countries as a way of bolstering regional security and reducing the possibility of refugee flows. Under SSP4, because of pervasive inequality, financing partnerships that are formed are generally not designed to reach the most vulnerable populations domestically or abroad, resulting in worsened health disparities.</p>
