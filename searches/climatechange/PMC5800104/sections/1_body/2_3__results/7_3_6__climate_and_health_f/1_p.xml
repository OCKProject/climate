<p class="p">Prioritizing and securing sufficient financing is likely to serve as a major obstacle to adapting health systems to challenges associated with climate change. A key element of financing policy is ensuring that climate and health system adaptation is provided a line item on health services and donor budgets, ensuring that there is continued attention of policymakers to climate and health issues and that funding is likely to be sustained over time. Additionally, a robust funding system also includes resources to sustain partnerships between the Global North and South, helping to improve adaptation capacity in under-resourced countries. Such funds are likely to flow through one of the already-existing international climate funds (Green Climate Fund, Climate Investment Funds, Adaptation Fund, etc.) that are set up to finance adaptation projects in low/middle-income countries. It will be important in a climate-resilient future that these and similar institutions remain intact to ensure the stability of funding streams and partnerships over the coming decades. </p>
