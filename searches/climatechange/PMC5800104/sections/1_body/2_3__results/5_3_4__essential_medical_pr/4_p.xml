<p class="p">Of particular note is that under SSP5, unlike SSP1, an increasing share of health system budgets are likely to be spent on facility repair and upkeep due to severe weather and climate events, leaving fewer funds available for training, staff wages, and patient care. This is especially true in low/middle-income countries, where there is generally higher vulnerability to severe storm and flood events, as well as lower construction standards. This unfortunate combination is likely to result in an increased number of health facilities being non-operational during and after severe weather, leading to overcrowding at facilities that manage to stay open. </p>
