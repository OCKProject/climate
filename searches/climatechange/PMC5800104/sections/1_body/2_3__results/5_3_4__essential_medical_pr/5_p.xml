<p class="p">Under SSP3/SSP4, growing fiscal pressures in countries at all income levels make improving the resilience of healthcare infrastructure to climate change an issue of minimal concern. Fiscal strains require that new health facilities are sited primarily on capital cost considerations, even if such facilities are more vulnerable to climate shocks that increase long-term maintenance and operating costs. Few funds are available to retrofit older facilities to be more climate-resilient. As a consequence, major storms and flood events cause catastrophic damage to health facilities, endangering the health and well-being of patients and staff, and thus making recovery more expensive. After these events, some facilities may not be repaired due to the cost, resulting in overcrowding at remaining facilities. Finally, few steps are taken to increase the resilience of medical supply chains to disruptions from climate variability and change, or to improve storage and prescription practices around temperature-sensitive pharmaceuticals. </p>
