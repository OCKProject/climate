<p class="p">SSPs differ in terms of how quickly and robustly physical infrastructure improvements are made to health facilities to ensure they are climate-resilient (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-00003-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>). Under SSP1/SSP5, governments in countries at all income levels plan physical health infrastructure that is resistant to damage from climate shocks through the use of appropriate materials and siting away from hazardous areas. In cases where health facilities lack redundant systems for food storage, water, and electricity, governments make provisions to provide funding for these systems so that facilities are more resilient during disasters. In addition, health facilities practice proper infection control practices.
