<p class="p">Integrated early warning and risk monitoring systems provide timely, detailed information on current and future environmental indicators that may affect health outcomes and the ability of health systems to provide services. Such metrics include information on temperature, rainfall, pollution, allergens, and water quality, among other indicators [

Additionally, they include recent epidemiological surveillance to measure changes in incidence over time of diseases likely to be affected by climate change and mitigation efforts, such as vector- and waterborne diseases, as well as health conditions that may become less prevalent due to mitigation measures, such as respiratory diseases. These systems also incorporate spatial and climatic information to contextualize the effects of climate change on particular conditions. These monitoring systems are coupled with communication networks (early warning systems) designed to alert members of the public when potential environmental hazards may affect public health, as is increasingly being done with heat events in many countries [

 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-15-00003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. This information allows interested parties to better understand the health risks associated with particular environmental conditions, helping to focus staff time and resources, as well as identify vulnerable populations that may need to be targeted with special outreach efforts.
