<p class="p">By contrast, under SSP3/SSP4, VCAs are rarely conducted, particularly in low/middle-income countries, partly as a result of a lack of available data. As a result, policymakers lack guidance upon which to make informed climate and health policies. Surveillance networks to assess health and climate vulnerabilities are poorly planned and funded in high-income countries, providing little useful information for stakeholders. In low/middle-income countries, these networks are generally not developed due to competing demands on resources, as well as a lack of partnerships with high-income countries. Additionally, research on health and climate change receives minimal funding and government support in high-income countries. The research that occurs emphasizes short-term vulnerabilities to the effects of climate variability. Low/middle-income countries are unable to fund significant climate and health research agendas under these pathways, and receive very little, if any, research funding support from high-income countries. This lack of research and development weakens population health activities, hampering responses to infectious disease outbreaks.</p>
