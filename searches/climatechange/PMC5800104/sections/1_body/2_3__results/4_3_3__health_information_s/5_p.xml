<p class="p">SSPs vary considerably in terms of investments made in knowledge-gathering, resulting in high-quality information under SSP1/SSP5, and lower quality information (and often substantial gaps in knowledge) under SSP3/SSP4 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-00003-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>). Under SSP1/SSP5, VCAs are regularly conducted and updated to comprehensively assess vulnerabilities and iteratively improve health system functioning as more is learned about the effects of climate change. Policymakers and health leaders understand likely disease risks, as well as which populations are most vulnerable, and have personnel and procedures to specifically address likely hazards. Additionally, governments in countries of all income levels develop and finance integrated surveillance and early warning systems (where feasible) that rapidly provide a variety of climate-relevant health information to clinicians, researchers, policymakers, and the public. Finally, research programs with ample funding and strong partnerships within and outside governments across regions enhance understanding of climate and health linkages, making responses more timely and effective. Collectively, these efforts are likely to improve health system efficiency as information is used to improve resource allocation.
