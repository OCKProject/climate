<p class="p">SSPs differ with respect to the strength of workforce training plans and strategies to ensure continuity of services even during climate-related disruptions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-00003-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). Under SSP1/SSP5, government policies incentivize or require information on climate change to be incorporated into the training provided for healthcare providers at all levels, so that health workers can appropriately respond to climate risks, resulting in improved quality of services. Moreover, workforce plans also contain redundancy and resiliency strategies so that in the event of losses of personnel, health infrastructure, or both due to climate-related events, there is sufficient reserve capacity within health services to meet immediate needs. Health workforce plans also develop financing and incentive mechanisms to address health disparities and inequities associated with climate change and ensure that health workers are available and can be placed in underserved areas, as some communities are likely to face greater risks than others.
