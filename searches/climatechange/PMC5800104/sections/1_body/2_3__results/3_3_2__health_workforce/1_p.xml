<p class="p">Maintaining a healthy and effective practitioner workforce is a critical challenge for health systems grappling with the potential effects of climate change. Preparing the health workforce for the effects of climate change requires policymakers to think carefully about health worker training, as well as health system capacity. There are several elements of health worker training that policymakers must consider in relation to climate change. First, providing health staff with more extensive training on locally relevant environmental health topics, such as air pollution and water-borne diseases, as well as related topics such as ecology, will be important in ensuring that providers can adequately treat patients [

This may include extended modules on environmental health during training for health professionals, and incorporation into continuing education curricula as environmental conditions change. Second, given that conditions associated with climate change are uncertain, risk communication should be a focus of provider training, so that patients can assess the health risks associated with particular environmental conditions and make decisions about their health accordingly [

Third, as climate change alters the disease burden in a particular area, workers with particular specialties are more likely to be in demand. This includes infectious disease and environmental health specialists, as well as pediatricians and emergency medicine physicians [

Policymakers should use projections about changes in disease patterns to allocate resources for specialist training accordingly. Fourth and finally, health workers are not immune from the health risks of climate change, including climate-related diseases. Health workers may be unable to provide services if their homes or facilities are damaged due to flood or storm events or if an infectious disease outbreak makes travel too risky [

Ensuring that there is sufficient redundancy in the health workforce to provide continuity of operations during a disease outbreak or severe weather event is crucial for maintaining public health. Thus, more health workers may need to be trained than in the past and workers may need to be assigned to certain work locations depending on local climate risks.
