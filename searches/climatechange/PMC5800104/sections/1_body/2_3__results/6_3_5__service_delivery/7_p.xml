<p class="p">Under SSP3/SSP4, lack of surveillance, as well as a reactive approach to policymaking, result in increasingly polluted food, water, and air, and substantial health risks associated with poor quality waste disposal. Regulations, if they do exist, are rarely enforced and fail to prevent frequent pollution discharges that result in large-scale disease outbreaks. Few health professionals, except those serving the social elite, change their practices as a result of environmental surveillance or similar data, if these data exist. Moreover, population health remains poor in many low- and middle-income countries as few additional countries achieve universal health coverage under these pathways. Because of poor population health conditions and the poor quality of health services provided, climate shocks remain particularly deadly. Finally, emergency preparedness efforts are minimal, with governments reacting to disasters with incomplete information, as well as poorly trained and equipped staff, leading to ineffective responses. In addition, low levels of education make it substantially more difficult to communicate risks to members of the public during disasters, leading many individuals to continue to engage in behaviors (such as using contaminated water or continuing to inhabit an area at risk of storm damage) that place them at high risk of morbidity or mortality.</p>
