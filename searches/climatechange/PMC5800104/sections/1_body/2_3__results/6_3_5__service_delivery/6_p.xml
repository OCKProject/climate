Under SSP1/SSP5, health systems actively collaborate with other agencies to ensure that environmental regulations are based on up-to-date scientific understandings, and that rules are effectively enforced to ensure compliance. Effective planning and training efforts result in health professionals of all specialties capable of delivering high-quality climate-adapted health services, ensuring that patients receive care tailored to changes in environmental conditions, as well as care delivered during natural disasters with minimal interruption. In addition, under SSP1/SSP5, universal health coverage is realized in the vast majority of countries around the world, resulting in substantial improvements to baseline health indicators. Moreover, high education levels under these pathways help ensure that public health messages are understood, and members of the public take proactive steps to protect their health before, during, and following climate shocks.
