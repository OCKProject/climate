<p class="p">SSPs differ with respect to the strength of national strategies on climate change and health, as well as the degree to which partnerships are emphasized (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-00003-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). Under SSP1/SSP5, clear actions are taken to plan for the health effects of climate and development shocks. Thus, these health systems are most likely to promote accountability and resilience. In high-income countries, this may include an emphasis on responding to epidemics of vector-borne diseases or improving the resilience of health infrastructure to natural disasters. In low/middle-income countries, there is likely to be a greater emphasis on reducing mortality from preventable causes that may be exacerbated by climate change, such as diarrhea or malaria. When appropriate, health authorities under these pathways work closely with nongovernmental organizations to build capacity and improve responses to climate change and health challenges.
