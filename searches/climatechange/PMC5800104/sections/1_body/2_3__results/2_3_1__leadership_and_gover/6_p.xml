<p class="p">Under these pathways, regional and global institutions are badly under-resourced and largely fail to prepare for climate and health challenges. Some regional blocs may emerge among high-income countries that advance planning and policy around climate and health, however, these activities are not likely to incorporate low/middle-income countries that require the greatest technical and financial support, such as developing and operating surveillance networks. As a result, when disease outbreaks or natural disasters related to climate change occur, international institutions are unable to provide meaningful support to low/middle-income countries. National-level responses from these countries are slow and ineffective, resulting in health systems being overwhelmed by patients, with associated high death tolls. </p>
