<p class="p">Under SSP1 and SSP5, regional and global institutions take strong and decisive measures to prepare and plan for the effects of climate change on health services, and include provisions for technical and financial support to be provided to low/middle-income countries to enhance the adaptation and mitigation capacity of their health services, including through integrated surveillance systems, helping to generate more equitable health outcomes globally. As a result, when infectious disease outbreaks or natural disasters occur as a result of climate change, international responses are swift, well-funded, and effective, resulting in low levels of property damage and deaths. </p>
