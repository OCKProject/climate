<p class="p">Under SSP3 and SSP4, governments take few, if any, steps to plan for the effects of climate variability and change on health services, resulting in less accountable and resilient health systems. Countries that do take steps are likely to be higher-income countries, as these countries have resources that can be invested in planning. However, the steps taken in such countries are meager, with vague and incomplete plans created. Government planning on climate change and health focuses only on challenges viewed as very likely to occur, such as high-income countries making plans to strengthen physical health infrastructure to reduce the impacts of stronger storms or flood events. </p>
