<p class="p">Climate change is projected to affect health outcomes in a variety of ways, including increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme temperatures and storm events, expansion of the geographic ranges for disease vectors such as mosquitoes, and changes in crop yields that affect nutritional intake [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-15-00003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Climate change will also likely affect the ability of health systems to function effectively as a result of changes in demands for services, the effects of climate variability on health infrastructure, and increased costs to provide services in a world impacted by climate change. However, these effects will vary locally as the impacts of climate change are not uniform. Rather, there are a variety of factors that will likely influence outcomes, including a country’s physical location and exposure to climate shocks, current and projected levels of socioeconomic development, as well as healthcare capacity and spending, and finally, changes in the capacity to cope with climate shocks in the future [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-15-00003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. It is this final factor—changes in the capacity to plan, provide, and finance effective healthcare services in a world impacted by climate change—that we focus on in this paper. Thus, we discuss how different development trajectories may affect health systems, as well as briefly highlight the implications of these effects on changes in causes of mortality and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
