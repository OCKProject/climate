<p class="p">The storylines we discuss below have implications for mortality as well as the SDGs. A world with effective health system responses to climate change is likely to face different health challenges than a world where responses are less effective. In the former, health systems are likely to face growing challenges associated with noncommunicable diseases and other health problems associated with aging populations. By contrast, weak responses are likely to be associated with high levels of drivers of childhood mortality, such as diarrheal disease and undernutrition. In addition, these responses have implications for the SDGs, particularly SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being). Effective health systems are a critical component of meeting the SDGs in a world of environmental change, particularly targets associated with child mortality, as this mortality is largely preventable with effective public health responses [
