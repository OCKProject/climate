<p class="p">To date, there has been limited work exploring the implications of climate change on health outcomes under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) [
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-15-00003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. We expand upon earlier narratives describing the relationship of climate change to health systems—defined by the World Health Organization as the “organizations, people and actions whose primary intent is to promote, restore or maintain health” [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-15-00003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. For this purpose, we adopt two frameworks. First, we use the SSP framework, which was developed to describe potential future socioeconomic development trajectories in a world impacted by climate change [
 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-15-00003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. The SSP framework is a successor to the earlier Special Report on Emissions Scenarios that are increasingly dated [
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-15-00003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. The SSPs are designed to be combined with greenhouse gas emission pathways (representative concentration pathways, RCPs), in a scenario matrix [
 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-15-00003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-15-00003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-15-00003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. This design allows researchers to test different combinations of socioeconomic development and emissions, producing a range of quantitative estimates of risk. Researchers have used this design to quantify aspects of the pathways, including GDP [

 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-15-00003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], population [
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-15-00003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], and urbanization [
 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-15-00003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. The design combines the work of the integrated assessment modeling community and the impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability community into a single framework, facilitating interdisciplinary collaboration.
