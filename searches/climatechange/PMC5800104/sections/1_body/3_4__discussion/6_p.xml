<p class="p">Although baseline rates of mortality attributable to climate-related causes are higher in low/middle-income countries, strong partnerships established under SSP1 and SSP5 result in these countries eventually catching up with high-income countries in low rates of communicable disease. As a result, in the coming decades, a substantially greater fraction of mortality is associated with cancer and cardiovascular disease in virtually all countries around the world. Under SSP2, mortality from preventable conditions falls, but more slowly than under SSP1 and SSP5, as health and climate interventions under this pathway are less robust. In low/middle-income countries, health outcomes improve, although government resources are sometimes stretched thinly, as health systems struggle to balance the health needs of a growing middle class increasingly experiencing chronic conditions with the challenges of poorer populations that continue to experience preventable diseases exacerbated by climate change. </p>
