<p class="p">Under SSP3/SSP4, a failure to mitigate the effects of climate change and invest in health services results in slower declines in mortality rates in countries at all income levels. In high-income countries, mortality from respiratory diseases increases due to fossil fuel use. In some cases, poor public health preparation and significant climate shocks precipitate the return of vector-borne diseases to places where they had been previously eradicated, such as the American South. Thus, increased deaths from malaria and in some cases, diarrheal disease, displace deaths that would have occurred due to cancer or cardiovascular conditions. In low/middle-income countries, the mortality transition stalls nearly completely, with undernutrition, malaria, and diarrheal diseases continuing to serve as major causes of death, particularly among young children. Lack of effective early warning systems and low adaptation capacity due to poverty results in high mortality from weather events, particularly heat waves and floods. However, the stochastic nature of these events results in substantial interannual variability in causes of death, with cataclysmic levels of mortality from heat waves and floods experienced in some years, while in other years, few, if any, deaths result from these causes. Specifically, under SSP4, a small, but wealthy elite experiences improved quality of life and a shift towards diseases of affluence, while the poorer majority of the population experiences continued vulnerability to malnutrition, diarrhea, and malaria. Mitigation measures such as the promotion of active transport and clean cookstoves under this pathway result in improved overall health and reductions in deaths from respiratory diseases.</p>
