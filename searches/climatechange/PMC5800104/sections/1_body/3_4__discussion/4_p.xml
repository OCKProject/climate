<p class="p">Under SSP2, it is likely that governments will come closer to meeting Goal 3 targets than under SSP3 or SSP4, although given the lack of strong and deliberate steps to improve health care in SSP2, it is likely that these reforms will be insufficient to actually meet the targets. By contrast, most of the targets under SDG 3 are unlikely to be met under SSP3 or SSP4 given the failure of governments in these pathways to sufficiently adapt health systems to climate challenges. Other SDGs that have clear implications for health, such as SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), are likely to be affected in similar ways as SDG 3, where achievement is most likely under SSP1/SSP5 due to increases in GDP and sustainable development policies, and least likely under SSP3/SSP4. </p>
