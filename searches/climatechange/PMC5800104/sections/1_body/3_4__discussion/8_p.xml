<p class="p">Finally, readers should keep in mind that the discussion above relates to a world where all countries follow a single SSP. It is possible that some high-income countries have different development trajectories than their low- and middle-income counterparts, or that there is strong heterogeneity within country income groupings. In that event, the analysis presented above may become more complicated, with different national or regional outcomes depending on development pathways chosen. Further, as shown in the preceding discussion, there are likely to be interactions across various drivers within a SSP, thereby increasing the complexity.</p>
