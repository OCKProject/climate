<p class="p">Under SSP1/SSP5, most of the SDG 3 targets appear achievable, including Target 3.2 to end preventable childhood mortality, and Target 3.3 to end the AIDS, TB, and malaria epidemics, particularly in light of the fact that health systems under these SSPs are likely to deliver higher-quality and more equitable services A key difference between SSP1 and SSP5 is that SDG 3 targets affected by environmental variables sensitive to fossil fuel development, such as Target 3.9 to reduce deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water, and soil pollution, are less likely to be met under SSP5, given continued fossil fuel development under this pathway. However, projections suggest that air pollution levels for most contaminants are lower under SSP5 than under other SSPs except for SSP1, implying that some of these fossil fuel-affected targets may also be achievable under SSP5 [
