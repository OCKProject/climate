<p class="p">We outline some of the major ways through which health systems are likely to be affected under different SSPs, illustrating that very different health system responses are possible under each pathway, with substantial implications for population health and the mortality distribution. Further research should seek to explore different cases at a variety of scales to examine how different health systems are coping with health and climate change challenges, and to what extent best practices are emerging in this field which can be promoted and adapted by other health systems facing similar challenges. Moreover, efforts to quantify the change in the mortality distribution under different SSPs and by geographic region will provide essential information for policymakers seeking to understand how to best allocate health resources in a world stressed by climate change. Such quantifications also should include temporal considerations, such as what could be the range of characteristics of health systems in the 2030s, when the increase in global mean surface temperature will be about 1.5Â° above pre-industrial temperatures. These quantifications would inform modeling of the health risks of climate change, to support policy development within and outside health systems that promotes sustainable and resilient health systems in a changing climate. </p>
