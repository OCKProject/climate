<p class="p">SSP5 represents a future with low challenges to adaptation and high challenges to mitigation [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-15-00003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. While overlapping in many respects with SSP1, SSP5 is distinguished by challenges posed by increasingly severe climate and development shocks, which, despite careful planning efforts, require substantial resources to mitigate. While development outcomes are strong under this pathway, they are not as strong as in SSP1, partly because of the need to devote significant resources to coping with the effects of shocks, as well as the lack of health co-benefits from mitigation activities.
