<p class="p">SSP2 represents a future with moderate challenges to adaptation and mitigation [
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-15-00003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Adoption of sustainable technologies proceeds, although at a less rapid pace than under SSP1. Governments face growing budgetary pressure as climate change hampers the work of various ministries, and more funding is devoted to repairing infrastructure damage from climate and development shocks. In low/middle-income countries, standards of living improve gradually, due in part to continued fossil fuel use as well as by the steady adoption of renewable energy sources. However, pockets of poverty remain entrenched in many of these countries, with additional budgetary pressures resulting from the consequences of extreme weather and climate events.
