 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-15-00003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. These projections include different assumptions about mortality trends, which extrapolate from current global declines in mortality, but at different rates to account for distinctions between the SSP narratives. Readers can find detailed information concerning how these projections were conducted in [
 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-15-00003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. While we anticipate that global mortality will continue to decline, as climate change becomes an even greater threat to global health, we project that an increasing share of variability between countries in mortality outcomes will be explained by health system responses to climate change, which serves as our rationale for expanding the SSP narratives to include additional information on health system effects. We briefly discuss each SSP to provide context for our analyses below.
