<p class="p">SSP3 represents a future with high challenges to adaptation and mitigation [
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-15-00003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Continued socioeconomic challenges in low/middle-income countries result in minimal improvements to living standards. Governments have little political will and minimal, if any, capital to invest in climate mitigation activities, resulting in increased vulnerability to the effects of climate and development shocks. In high-income countries, moderate levels of income growth along with continued fossil fuel use allow countries to maintain development gains, albeit with minimal improvements over time and inequality within countries. SSP3 depicts a world where inequality and security concerns lead to a resurgence of nationalism, and in some cases, regional cooperation, with very little cooperation between high- and low/middle-income countries on climate change or other issues and limited investment in international coordinating organizations.
