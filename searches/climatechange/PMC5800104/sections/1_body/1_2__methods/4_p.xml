<p class="p">SSP1 represents a sustainable future, where the world experiences low challenges to adaptation and mitigation [
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-15-00003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Countries rapidly develop sustainable technologies that result in improved quality of life for all citizens while mitigating further damage to the climate. In addition, development in low/middle-income countries results in improved living standards, leading to an increasingly narrow gap in living standards between low/middle-income countries and high-income countries. High-income countries actively cooperate with and support low/middle-income countries, developing partnerships and funding packages to help facilitate climate adaptation.
