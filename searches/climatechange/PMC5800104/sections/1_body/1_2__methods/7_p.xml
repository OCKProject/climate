<p class="p">SSP4 represents a future with high challenges to adaptation and low challenges to mitigation [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-15-00003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. While overlapping in many respects with SSP3, SSP4 is distinguished by very high levels of inequality within and between countries, where capital and political power is increasingly concentrated in a global elite, leaving low-income countries and poorer residents of high/middle-income countries behind. While the use of renewable energy technologies spreads rapidly, particularly in wealthier countries, poorer populations in countries at all income levels experience significant challenges to adaptation, resulting in a growing divergence of demographic, economic, and health outcomes within and between countries.
