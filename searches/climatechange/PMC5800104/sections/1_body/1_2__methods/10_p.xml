<p class="p">We use the qualitative descriptions provided in SSP background papers, as well as the building blocks and suggested outputs in the WHO framework to illustrate how health system responses are likely to vary under different socioeconomic development pathways. In particular, we take the WHO recommendations as indicative of effective responses, and in general, assume that these will be followed in SSP1 and SSP5. When discussing responses under other SSPs, we assume that responses will be suboptimal based on the WHO framework, in order to draw conclusions about how health systems will less effectively respond to climate change challenges. </p>
