<p class="p">As climate change is expected to have a significant impact on species distributions, there is an urgent challenge to provide policy-makers with valuable information to guide conservation biodiversity policies. To address this challenge, modeling approaches should be enhanced with the aim of increasing the confidence of the future forecasting [

In particular, mammalian species richness will be dramatically reduced throughout the Mediterranean basin; however, the trend will not be uniform for all taxa. For instance, Mustelidae (e.g., badger, weasel) will decrease while Canidae (e.g., wolf), Hyaenidae (e.g., hyena) and some families of Chiroptera (bats) will increase [
