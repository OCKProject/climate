<p class="p">The purpose of this study is to explore the benefits of including remotely sensed descriptors of the temporal dynamics and spatial patterns of ecosystem functioning into spatial distribution models in order to enhance the reliability of future forecasts of terrestrial mammal habitat quality. We compared the future forecasts obtained by using models with and without incorporating remotely sensed descriptors. We used the European badger in an arid region of southeastern Spain as a case study. In this region the species is not abundant and at risk of local extinction due to climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0172107.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. We built generalized linear models (using climate, and land use variables as predictors) to project the EVI-derived variables under the Inter-governmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) and land cover and land use change scenarios. Then, we incorporated the uncertainty derived from these models into future forecast by using the distribution of residuals. Finally, we discuss how the forecasted distribution based on our approach can guide policy-makers to review current policies and biodiversity conservation programs.
