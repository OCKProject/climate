<p class="p">Because of the performance of models (i. e., Climate-models and EVI-models) with weighted PAs was lower than the models without weighted PAs, we only used the former to forecast future distribution. Badger was predicted to experience an increase in habitat suitability (positive change in intensity) and considerable spatial change when we just considered climate variables (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172107.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). A2 scenario forecasted the most favourable conditions for badger with these variables. However, when EVI-derived variables were incorporated into the distribution models, habitat suitability was predicted to decrease (negative change in intensity), and spatial pattern change was greater than without EVI-derived variables. The increase of spatial changes could be driven by LCLC change scenarios used to predict EVI variables. LCLU changes are considered to be a major driver of global environmental change and biodiversity loss [

For this reason, future forecasts that not include them, e.g. based only on climate variables, could harbour an important bias, particularly, at a regional scale where the landscape features, such as vegetation and land use, are key for the species [

Although the forecasts obtained from the different IPCC scenarios and land cover and land uses change were similar for EVI-models, the decrease of habitat suitability was more moderate with the increase of irrigated crop than crop abandonment. Finally, the forecasts predicted by Climate-models and EVI-models were significantly different at a 0.5 level of confidence (see Table A, Figs A and B in
