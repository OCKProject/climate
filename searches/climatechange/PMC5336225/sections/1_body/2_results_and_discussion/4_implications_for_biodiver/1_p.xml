<p class="p">Since the validity of future forecast based only on climate variables is currently questioned [
 <xref rid="pone.0172107.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>], policies and biodiversity conservation programs supported by such information could have a biased vision and overestimate or underestimate the potential changes in the species distribution derived from climate change. The incorporation of ecosystem functional attributes derived from remote sensing in the modeling of future forecast may contribute to the improvement of detection of ecological responses under climate change scenarios. In addition, our approach would allow incorporating the uncertainty derived of these attributes when they are projected to future under both climate, and land use change scenarios. In consequence, the future forecast obtained would be more reliable and help policy-makers to review the existing policies and biodiversity conservation programs.
