<p class="p">At this point, a key question arises: how much more reliable are these future distribution forecasts?. Addressing this question goes beyond the goal of this study, however, our results show that EVI-derived variables could help to decrease the underlying ecological bias of the future forecasts based just on climate variables. In this regard, EVI-models forecasted a decreased of the habitat suitability for badger. Macdonald et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0172107.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] found that badger life history parameters (such as survival, fecundity or body-weight) are correlated with annual variability of both temperature and rainfall mediated by food supply. Therefore, climate trends might influence badgers population growth directly and through correlations with food availability [
 <xref rid="pone.0172107.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Primary production is at the base of food webs, and therefore a decrease would translate into lower food availability for higher trophic levels. Supported by findings of Alcaraz-Segura et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0172107.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], we consider that EVI-derived variables could represent the interactions between climate and food availability for badger as descriptors of the temporal dynamics and spatial patterns of primary production. On a local scale, the composition of the badger diet is influenced primarily by human land use and management [
 <xref rid="pone.0172107.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. More specifically, in the southeastern Iberian Peninsula, badger diet depends on fruit orchards and other derived food resources (e.g., insects) [
 <xref rid="pone.0172107.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. EVI-derived variables have been suggested as proxies of the spatial and temporal variability of food resources for badgers in these environments [
 <xref rid="pone.0172107.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Therefore, future forecasts based on both EVI-derived and climate variables would capture not only climate change but also correlations between climate and ecosystem functioning through the dynamic of primary production and land use change. According with this, our results showed that the decrease of habitat suitability with an increase of irrigated crops was less than with the abandonment crops.
