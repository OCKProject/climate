<p class="p">Our results suggest that future forecasts based only on climate variables should be interpreted with caution because the temporal dynamics and spatial patterns of ecosystem functioning may play an important role in determining the species distribution and the dynamics of its change. At a global scale, the bioclimate envelope approach (i.e., modeling the association between climate variables and species distribution) can provide a first approximation as to the potentially dramatic impact of climate change [

 <xref rid="pone.0172107.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] and therefore, the ecological limits predicted by climate may be misleading and the future forecasts obtained could underestimate or overestimate the potential changes in species distribution derived from climate change. In fact, we show how Climate- models and EVI-models forecasted opposed futures for the badger under both A2 and B1 scenarios in Mediterranean arid environments. Supporting this finding, Requena-Mullor et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0172107.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] showed that EVI descriptors of ecosystem functioning are useful to describe drivers of the spatial distribution of badger in these environments, in consequence, the future forecast derived from EVI-models may suggest more reliability.
