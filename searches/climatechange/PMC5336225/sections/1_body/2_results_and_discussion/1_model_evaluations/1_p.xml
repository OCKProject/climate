<p class="p">All global models showed a good performance (AUC &gt; 0.8) and therefore the 48 models were used in the ensemble modeling. However, when we selected the models at regional scale, we used different AUC values as thresholds with the aim to maximize the performances obtained. For the Climate-models, the AUC values were 0.55 and 0.6 for with and without weighted PAs models, respectively; in this form, 3 and 6 models were selected to forecast the badger spatial distribution into future scenarios. For the EVI-models, the AUC values used were 0.55 and 0.7 (with and without weighted PAs) and the number of models selected was 9 and 5, respectively.</p>
