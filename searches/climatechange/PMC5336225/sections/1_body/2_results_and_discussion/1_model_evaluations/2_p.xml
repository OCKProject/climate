 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172107.g002" class="xref">Fig 2A</xref>). When we compared between models with weighted PAs, EVI-models were also better than Climate-models (
 <italic class="italic">W</italic> = 439, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>&lt;0.001), but the AUCs were still lower (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172107.g002" class="xref">Fig 2B</xref>). The comparison of the performance between models with and without weighted PAs but using the same type of variables, revealed that weighting the PAs did not significantly improved discrimination between areas where badger was present and where it was not recorded (PAs) (

 <italic class="italic">W</italic> = 506,
