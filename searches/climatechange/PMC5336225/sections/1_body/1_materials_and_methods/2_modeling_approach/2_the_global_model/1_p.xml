 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172107.g001" class="xref">Fig 1A</xref>). We extracted species occurrence from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://data.gbif.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://data.gbif.org</ext-link>) at a minimum resolution of 2.5´ x 2.5´. We used 16279 records of occurrence after post-processing the data to remove those presences with unrealistic coordinates (e. g., sea, incomplete coordinates). From the 19 available bioclimatic variables at a 2.5´ spatial resolution of the WorldClim database (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.worldclim.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.worldclim.org/</ext-link>), we selected seven with a Spearman rank-correlation lower than 0.6, i.e., annual mean temperature, mean diurnal range, temperature seasonality, temperature annual range, mean temperature of wettest quarter, annual precipitation and precipitation seasonality. Following to Gallien et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0172107.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], we modeled species distribution using six algorithms available in the “biomod2” package version 3.1–64 [
 <xref rid="pone.0172107.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] in R (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.R-project.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.R-project.org/</ext-link>): a generalized additive model (GAM), a classification tree analysis (CTA), a multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), a boosted regression trees (BRT), an artificial neural networks (ANN) and a random forest (RF). We kept the default models options. For each algorithm, two PAs datasets (20000 each time) were randomly selected and four-fold cross-validations performed (48 models in total) by randomly selecting 70% of the presence locations to train the models, and the remainder 30% to evaluate them using the AUC [
 <xref rid="pone.0172107.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Then, only those models obtaining an AUC score above 0.8 were used to build the committee averaging map. The committee averaging method is an ensemble forecasting method [
 <xref rid="pone.0172107.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] by which the predicted probability maps of species habitat suitability are not averaged, but instead are transformed into binary maps (using for each model the threshold that maximizes both sensitivity and specificity). Thus, this method gives both a prediction and a measure of uncertainty. When the prediction is close to 0 or 1, it means that all models agree to predict 0 and 1 respectively (see [
 <xref rid="pone.0172107.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] for details).
