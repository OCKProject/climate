<p class="p">The presence records for the badgers were obtained from published data [
 <xref rid="pone.0172107.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] and personal databases from the authors (i. e., 184 occurrence registers). We reduced locally dense sampling by thinning the records to one per 5 x 5 km grid cell to avoid spatial autocorrelation problems. A total of 73 presence records were used in the modeling (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172107.g001" class="xref">Fig 1C</xref>). Presence samples were distributed across a wide gradient of altitude (0–1500 meters), temperature (annual minimum mean temperatures range: -1.6–15°C, annual maximum mean temperatures range 17–24.5°C), annual precipitation range (165–419 mm/year), and annual evapotranspiration range (343–1038 mm/year). Vegetation is mainly constituted by Mediterranean shrubland (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Pistacia lentiscus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Macrochola tenacissima</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Anthyllis spp</italic>.) with more xerophytic species in lower zones near to the coast (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus spp</italic>., 
 <italic class="italic">Salsola spp</italic>.). Woodland is very scarce and is present inland and at higher altitude (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus halepensis</italic>). Extensive crops (e.g., fruit orchards) are associated with the main river courses where together with natural vegetation constitute the preferred habitats of the badger [
