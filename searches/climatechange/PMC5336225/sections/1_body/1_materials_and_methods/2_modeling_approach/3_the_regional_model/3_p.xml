<p class="p">We selected six variables associated to ecological requirements of the European badger and which have high predictive power in terms of habitat suitability [

 <xref rid="pone.0172107.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Variables were related to climate (mean annual precipitation (
 <italic class="italic">PREC</italic>) and mean value of monthly maximum temperatures (
 <italic class="italic">TMEDMAX</italic>)), relief (mean slope (
 <italic class="italic">SLOPE</italic>)), and spatio-temporal patterns of primary production (EVI annual mean (
 <italic class="italic">EVIMEAN</italic>), intra-annual coefficient of variation of EVI (
 <italic class="italic">EVIC</italic>), and spatial standard deviation of EVI annual mean (
 <italic class="italic">EVISTD</italic>)). To avoid collinearity between predictors, we checked that Spearman rank-correlations were less than 0.85 [
 <xref rid="pone.0172107.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. The maximum Spearman correlation value obtained was -0.37, corresponding to
