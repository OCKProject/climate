<p class="p">Our three functional descriptors of the spatiotemporal patterns of primary production were derived from satellite images captured by the MODIS sensor onboard the NASA TERRA satellite (

We used the MOD13Q1 EVI product, which consists of 16-day maximum value composite images (23 per year) of the EVI at a 231 x 231 m pixel size. This product has atmospheric, radiometric and geometric corrections. We used EVI instead of NDVI because it is less influenced by soil background and saturation problems at high biomass levels [
 <xref rid="pone.0172107.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. We first used the Quality Assessment (QA band) information of this product to filter out those values affected by high content of aerosols, clouds, shadows, snow or water. Next, we calculated the mean seasonal EVI profile (average year) for the 2001â€“2013 period and derived the EVI annual mean (
 <italic class="italic">EVIMEAN</italic>) as the mean of the 23 images of the average year and the intra-annual coefficient of variation of EVI (
 <italic class="italic">EVICV)</italic> as the intra-annual standard deviation divided by 
 <italic class="italic">EVIMEAN</italic>. The spatial standard deviation of 
 <italic class="italic">EVIMEAN</italic> (
