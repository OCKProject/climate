<p class="p">We first designed a set of SDMs at global scale (i.e., including the distribution range of the badger) using presence-only data and climate variables. We assembled them by a committee averaging method (see below a detailed description). Then, using the global model output to weight the pseudo-absences (PAs), we built four sets of SDMs at regional scale (i.e., in an arid region of southeastern Spain). Two of these sets included EVI-derived, climate and topographic variables (hereafter EVI-models). The other two sets included only climate and topographic variables (hereafter Climate-models). The pseudo-absences were just weighted in one set of EVI- and Climate-models, respectively [

Best performance was based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). We note that to predict the future EVI-variables used in forecasting the potential spatial distribution, we built generalized linear models (GLMs) (using climate, and land cover and land use variables as predictors) and projected them under IPCC and land cover and land use change scenarios. We incorporated the uncertainty derived from GLMs into future forecast by using the distribution of residuals.
