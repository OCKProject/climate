<p class="p">To check if both measures (i.e., intensity and Hellinger distance) yielded by Climate-model and EVI-models, respectively, were significantly different, we explored the probability distributions of the normalized pairwise differences for each measure by a bootstrap method (10.000 replicates) and then, we calculated which of these differences fell above the 95th percentile and below the 5th percentile.</p>
