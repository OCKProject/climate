<p class="p">We used a distance-based method [
 <xref rid="pone.0172107.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] to compare the current and future spatial distributions yielded by the different regional models and scenarios. This method combines aspects of image analysis with distance-based statistical test to extract two types of information from an ensemble of SDM output maps: intensity and spatial difference.
