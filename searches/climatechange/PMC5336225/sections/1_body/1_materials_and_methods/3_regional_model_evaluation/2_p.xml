<p class="p">Two scenarios proposed by the IPCC were considered: A2 and B1. The A2 scenario assumes a continuously increasing global population, economic development that is primarily regionally oriented and focused on economic growth and technological changes that are more fragmented and slower than in other storylines. The B1 scenario assumes that economic structures rapidly change towards a service and information economy, and that resource-efficient technologies are introduced. The projected 
 <italic class="italic">PREC</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">TMEDMAX</italic> (100 x 100 m cell size) variables for the 2071–2099 period were obtained from statistical downscaling methods (i.e., multiple linear regression) [
 <xref rid="pone.0172107.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] of these IPCC scenarios available at the Environmental Information Network of Andalusia (see above). The simulated daily temporal series for the projected period were summarized by the annual mean with the aim of creating a representative year (see [
 <xref rid="pone.0172107.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] for details). Then, we resampled to the 231 x 231 m grid using bilinear resampling. Although slope has been described as a relevant factor for sett digging, in low density areas of Mediterranean landscapes, setts were located almost everywhere [
 <xref rid="pone.0172107.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Since slope seems not to be so limiting and was not available for future scenarios due to the complex drivers and predictors behind this process, we considered it static through time. The three projected functional descriptors derived from EVI (i.e., 
 <italic class="italic">EVIMEAN</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">EVICV</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">EVISTD</italic>) were predicted by GLMs. Although precipitation and temperature are the main two climate factors that drive primary production of the biosphere, at the regional scale, the response of primary production to these climate drivers can vary both spatially and temporality, modulated by different vegetation types [
 <xref rid="pone.0172107.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Therefore, 
 <italic class="italic">EVIMEAN</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">EVICV</italic> were predicted by a GLM that used as explanatory variables the current 
 <italic class="italic">PREC</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">TMEDMAX</italic> variables, land cover and land use and slope. Then, future 
 <italic class="italic">EVIMEAN</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">EVICV</italic> were projected using the fitted models with future climate variables of each A2 and B1 scenario. In addition, we simulated three future scenarios of land cover-land use change: (1) irrigated crop scenario: the 5% and 10% of the natural vegetation and rainfed crop patches, respectively, converted into irrigated crop patches; (2) crop abandonment scenario: the 7.5% and 7.5% of rainfed and irrigated crop patches, respectively, converted into natural vegetation parches; (3) no land change scenario (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0172107.s001" class="xref">S1 Fig</xref>). These scenarios were based on the future projections obtained by Piquer-Rodríguez et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0172107.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] for the southeastern Iberian Peninsula and were simulated using the MOLUSCE plugin in QGIS (

 <italic class="italic">EVISTD</italic> variable was obtained by using a 3 x 3 km moving window on the projected 
 <italic class="italic">EVIMEAN</italic> variable (as explained above).
