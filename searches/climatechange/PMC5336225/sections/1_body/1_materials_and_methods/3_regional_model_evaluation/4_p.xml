<p class="p">Errors are assumed to be normally distributed with expectation 0 and variance Ïƒ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. We exploited this assumption to incorporate the uncertainty derived from the projected EVI-derived variables into future forecasts. To do this, we generated 1000 projections of these variables by adding in each iteration the errors estimated from the GLMs. We obtained these errors using the distribution of residuals provided by the GLMs output (see
