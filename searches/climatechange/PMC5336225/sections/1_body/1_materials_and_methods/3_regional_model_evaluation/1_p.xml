<p class="p">We evaluated the performance of regional models by AUC using the remainder of the presence records (i.e., 111) after selecting the samples used to build the models (see above). With the aim to obtain as reliable as possible future forecasting, we forecasted the badger spatial distribution for future climate scenarios in each set of models by using the best models based on AUC developed under current environmental conditions. A one-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to assess whether increases in overall AUC in the EVI-models relative to those in the Climate-models were statistically significant [
