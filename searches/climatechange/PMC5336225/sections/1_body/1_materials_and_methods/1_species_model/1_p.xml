<p class="p">The European badger is a medium-sized carnivore widely distributed across Europe. In the arid southeastern limits of its range (i.e., the Mediterranean drylands of Iberian Peninsula) the European badger prefers mosaic landscapes consisting of fruit orchards and natural vegetation, which provide shelter and food resources [
