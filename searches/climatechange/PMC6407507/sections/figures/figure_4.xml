  <title class="title">The changes in annual mean temperature (A and B) and temperature seasonality (C and D) of ecoregions with expansion potential of IPS across different biomes between current and RCP 4.5 scenarios.</title>
  <p class="p">The red points represent the average changes in annual mean temperature and temperature seasonality of ecoregions with expansion potential of IPS for each biome. The bars represent the standard deviation of changes in annual mean temperature and temperature seasonality of ecoregions with expansion potential of IPS for each biome.</p>
