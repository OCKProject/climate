   <p id="Par42" class="p">“Keeling’s first report (Keeling 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">1960</xref>) is a landmark, documenting the seasonal cycle and, more gloomily, the annual rise of CO
    <sub class="sub">2</sub>” (Nisbet 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2007</xref>, p. 789).

   <p id="Par43" class="p">“Since then, the Keeling curve, the famous saw-toothed curve of rising CO
    <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations, has become the environmental icon of the century” (Fleming 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">1998</xref>, p. 126).

   <p id="Par44" class="p">“Keeling’s measurements … are the single most important environmental data taken in the twentieth century” (Harris 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2010</xref>, p. 7865).

   <p id="Par45" class="p">“Within a few years, Keeling’s inexorably rising CO
    <sub class="sub">2</sub> curve was widely cited by scientific review panels and science journalists. It became the central icon of the greenhouse effect” (Weart 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2008</xref>, p. 35).
   </p>
   <p id="Par46" class="p">“Keeling’s data put a capstone on the structure built by Tyndall, Arrhenius, Callendar, Plass, and Revelle and Suess. This was not quite the discovery of global warming. It was the discovery of the possibility of global warming” (Weart 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2008</xref>, p. 37).
