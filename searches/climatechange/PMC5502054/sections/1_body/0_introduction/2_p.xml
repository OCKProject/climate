A good example is a profound article presented under the rubric “National Historic Chemical Landmarks” of the American Chemical Society (ACS) entitled: “The Keeling curve: Carbon dioxide measurements at Mauna Loa”. The ACS states that “Keeling’s legacy includes a measurement program that endures to this day, providing an authoritative record of atmospheric CO

He was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1986 and a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1994. In 2002, Keeling was awarded the National Medal of Science, the nation’s highest award for lifetime achievements in science. In 2005, he received the Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement for his data collection and interpretation” (ACS
