<p id="Par6" class="p">In this study, we undertake a bibliometric analysis of Keeling’s publications. Bibliometrics is based on the assumption that important contributions to science receive high citation numbers. However, this is not always the case: Keeling’s contributions were definitely important for climate change research. However, we will demonstrate that his most important early publications are lower cited than expected in consideration of their importance for climate change. Their citation profiles are reminiscent of cases of slow reception and weak recognition. We will explore reasons for the under-citedness of Keeling’s papers.</p>
