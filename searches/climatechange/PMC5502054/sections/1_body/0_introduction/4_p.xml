<p id="Par5" class="p">One of his most important characteristics was his persistency and subject-specific determination: (1) He refused a job offer (for an indoor job in a dark cellar lab) from the Division of Meteorological Research in the Weather Bureau in Washington, DC. (2) Under Roger Revelle at Scripps Institution of Oceanography he refused to take only snapshots of the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration every few years or every decade. (3) He continued to measure, although the up and down of the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration measured within the first year seemed to confirm the previously measured inconsistent dataâ€”and the general impossibility to measure a baseline CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration. (4) He refused to replace his gas analyzer by newer instruments to avoid calibration problems and to ensure a highly consistent data row. In 1963, the work almost had to shut down. It was the so-called Sputnik-shock after the launch of the Soviet satellite in 1957 that boosted funding for all areas of science and education and allowed Keeling to continue his measurements at Mauna Loa.
