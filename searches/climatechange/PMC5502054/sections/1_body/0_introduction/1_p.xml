<p id="Par2" class="p">Charles David Keeling (1928–2005) started his scientific career as chemist at the Department of Geochemistry at Caltech, studying groundwater in the pristine Big Sur wilderness. Around 1956, Roger Revelle, director of the Scipps Institution of Oceanography near San Diego (California), invited Keeling to perform atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) measurements for the International Geophysical Year (IGY). Keeling had proposed that he could deploy a new analytical tool called infrared (IR) gas analyzer to perform continuous measurements of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in air samples. The first analyzer was sent to Antarctica and a second one was prepared for installation aboard a research ship. In March 1958, an analyzer was installed on the top of Mauna Loa (Hawaii) with the intention to measure pristine air over the Pacific Ocean. Keeling soon detected strong seasonal variations in CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> levels, oscillating from peak levels in the northern hemisphere spring (before the beginning of the growing season) and minimum levels in autumn. Since 1960, Keeling’s data revealed that CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> levels were rising steadily in what became known as the “Keeling curve”. The data collection of Keeling’s measurement program is the longest continuous record of atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in the world and shows that its concentration has grown from 315 ppm (parts per million) in 1958 to 408 ppm in May 2015 and is correlated to usage of fossil fuel as energy source.
