<p id="Par16" class="p">Since Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> does not show, which publications determined the massive impact since the mid-1990s, we investigated how the citation impact is distributed across the years of Keeling’s publications. Thus, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> shows a vintage diagram with the number of citations as function of the publication years of his papers. This kind of diagram shows the citation impact contribution of publication years relative to each other (and thereby of the corresponding papers published in the specific years).
