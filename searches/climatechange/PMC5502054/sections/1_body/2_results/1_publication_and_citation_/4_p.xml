 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">1976</xref>) are his most important contributions to climate change research, they do not appear as the highest bars in the vintage diagram of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>. His 1995, 1996, 1997, and 2003 papers received significantly more citations. However, these papers (two of them with Keeling as co-author) do not deal primarily with measurements of the CO
