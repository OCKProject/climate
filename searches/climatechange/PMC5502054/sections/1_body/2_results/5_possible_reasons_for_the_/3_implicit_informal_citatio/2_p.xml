 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref> indicates that many formal citations are omitted. As a consequence, the overall impact of his pioneering paper cannot be entirely determined by merely counting their citations. Also, the book mentions of the term “Keeling curve/Curve” in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref> show the very late recognition: No mentions are found prior to 1987, more than ten years after the publication of Keeling’s (
