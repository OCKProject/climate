<p id="Par36" class="p">For many historical papers, a basic process limits the meaning of citation counts as a measure of scientific impact: “obliteration by incorporation”. This phenomenon was firstly described by the sociologist Robert K. Merton (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">1968</xref>). The process of obliteration affects seminal works offering novel ideas that are rapidly absorbed into the body of scientific knowledge. Such work is soon integrated into textbooks and becomes increasingly familiar within the scientific community. As a result of this absorption and canonization, the original sources fail to be cited in the reference lists. Seminal work is often cited by mentioning only the author’s name or name-based items (“implicit citations” or “informal citations”) instead of citing the source as a footnote (“formal citations”) (Marx and Cardona 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2009</xref>; McCain 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">2012</xref>). The number of informal citations is often many times higher than the number of formal citations, in particular when the name of an author or his/her contribution has become a household word (like “Keeling curve”). Therefore, the works of Keeling are possibly subject to this phenomenon. According to Google Scholar, 1150 records mention the term “Keeling curve/Curve”. Google’s Ngram Viewer reveals a strong increase of book mentions since around 2000 (see Fig.
