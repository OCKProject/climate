<p id="Par27" class="p">In agreement with the results reported above, the RPYS does not reveal the importance of Keeling’s works in the form of comparatively highly cited references within the subject specific literature: There are no pronounced peaks in the reference publication years 1960 and 1976, respectively, indicating the impact of Keeling’s early works on his Mauna Loa measurements of the atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration. A second RPYS aproach based on a publication set searched in the multidisciplinary WoS via search terms (without the possibility to specify CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> using its CAS RN) resulted in a quite similar spectrogram.
