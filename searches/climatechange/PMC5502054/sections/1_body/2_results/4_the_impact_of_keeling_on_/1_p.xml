<p id="Par26" class="p">The under-citedness of Keeling’s papers and their slow reception might be due to the fact that we have based the analyses on the entire WoS database, which is a multidisciplinary literature database. The specific contribution of his papers might become visible with a focus on the impact analysis of publications dealing with the measurement of the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration in the earth’s atmosphere. For determining the contribution of Keeling’s landmark papers, we analyzed, which references have been most frequently cited by the papers dealing with the measurement of the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration in the earth’s atmosphere. The RPYS spectrogram resulting from the analysis of the cited reference years via the CRExlorer software is shown in Fig.
