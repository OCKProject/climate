<p id="Par28" class="p">The only distinct peak in the spectrogram of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref> can be assigned to a paper by Weiss (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">1974</xref>). This publication delivers basic information concerning the solubility of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in water and sea water, respectively. Studies about the solubility of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in water concern the long discussed and most important question, which amount of the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> released by fossil fuel burning will remain in the atmosphere, and which portion will be solved in the oceans. In other words, such studies are connected to the question: Is the increasing CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration of any relevance with regard to an anthropogenic greenhouse effect—and by this to future climate?
