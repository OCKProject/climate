<p id="Par20" class="p">In the case of papers that do not attract significant attention until decades after their publication, such as the Keeling (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">1960</xref>) paper, one refers to “slow reception” or “delayed recognition”. Also, these papers are called “sleeping beauties”. According to van Raan (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2004</xref>), “a ‘Sleeping beauty in science’ is a publication that goes unnoticed (‘sleeps’) for a long time and then, almost suddenly, attracts a lot of attention (‘is awakened by a prince’)” (p. 461). Given the long time period of low citation rates and the unusually late impact, this definition formally fits the Keeling (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">1958</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">1960</xref>) papers. However, delayed recognition not necessarily implies a high citation impact.
