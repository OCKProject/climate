<p id="Par24" class="p">The standardization procedure was done as follows: (1) The annual number of climate change papers was determined using the WoS query ‘ti = (climat* OR paleoclimat* OR palaeoclimat* OR “global temperature*” OR “global warming” OR “greenhouse effect” OR “greenhouse gas*” OR “greenhouse warming”) and py = 1950–2015’. This query is based on a carefully constructed and tested query (Haunschild et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2016</xref>; Marx et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2017b</xref>). In contrast to the previous studies, here we searched only in the title field, because abstracts and keywords are not available reliably before 1991. (2) The number of citations from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> is divided by the number of publications as determined in the previous step. (3) Finally, all standardized citations are multiplied with a factor of 1000.
