<p id="Par21" class="p">The slow reception of Keeling’s papers is no exception in the climate change research literature. An inspection of the citation history of the papers assigned to the peaks in the RPYS spectrogram of the overall climate change research literature (see Marx et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2017b</xref>) showed that this phenomenon is not rare: Most of the papers analyzed are cases of delayed recognition; it seems to be a frequent phenomenon within climate change research. Good examples are the citation histories of Thornthwaite (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">1948</xref>), Stommel (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">1961</xref>), Dansgaard (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">1964</xref>), and Bjerknes (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">1969</xref>), which are presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>. Thornthwaite (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">1948</xref>) devised a moisture based climate classification system that is still in use worldwide. Stommel (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">1961</xref>) presented a model for the driving forces of the ocean circulation system. Dansgaard’s (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">1964</xref>) work is very important for the reconstruction of the past climate based on ice core samples. Bjerknes (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">1969</xref>) helped toward an understanding of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO).
