<p id="Par25" class="p">According to Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>, the four Keeling papers do not attract an increasing attention, when the booming climate change research is considered. Also, the overall citation impact, in particular of the 1960 paper, is not as high as one would expect in consideration of the basic importance of this work for climate change. After decades, such significant papers often have accumulated many thousands of citations. Hence, Keeling’s early works are cases of under-cited influential publications—not typical cases of sleeping beauties. Hu and Rousseau (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">2016</xref>) explain this phenomenon of under-citedness in an empirical study. They state that “a scientific contribution is not always what it looks as seen from a citation perspective” (p. 1081) and they present some cases of “fundamental work ahead of transformative research” (p. 1081). Inspecting the citing papers of Keeling (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">1960</xref>) reveals that 8 out of the 182 citing papers received more citations (ranging from 222 to 1427 citations at the date of searching: January 14, 2017) than the cited Keeling paper, although they have much shorter citation windows.
