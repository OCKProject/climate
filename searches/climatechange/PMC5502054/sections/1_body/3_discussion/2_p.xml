<p id="Par39" class="p">Keeling’s scientific contributions and the evolution of his citation impact show that, “sometimes, discovery comes slowly, not with a flash revelation but creepingly, as larger patterns emerge painfully from years of data” (Nisbet 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2007</xref>, p. 789). Keeling’s measurement program also raises questions concerning past and present funding practices: “Although some scientists immediately recognized the importance of Keeling’s work, no agency felt responsible for funding a climate study that might run for many years. In 1963, the work almost had to shut down” (Weart 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2008</xref>, p. 35). The Sputnik-shock after the launch of the Soviet satellite in 1957 boosted funding and allowed Keeling to continue his CO

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2010</xref>, p. 7870).
