<p id="Par12" class="p">The importance of individual papers within the literature of a specific research field can be detected by using a bibliometric method called “Reference Publication Year Spectroscopy” (RPYS, see Marx et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2014</xref>), preferably in combination with a recently developed tool named CRExplorer (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.crexplorer.net" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.crexplorer.net</ext-link>, see Thor et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2016</xref>). This method is based on the following findings: The analysis of the publication years of the references cited by all the papers in a specific research field shows that some publication years occur particularly frequently among the references. The years appear as pronounced peaks in the distribution of the reference publication years. The peaks are frequently based on single (or few) publications, which are highly cited compared to other publications published in the same year and are thus of specific significance to the research field in question (Marx et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2014</xref>). In recent years, several studies have been published, in which the RPYS was applied to examine the seminal papers of research fields (Marx et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2017a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">b</xref>; Marx and Bornmann 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2014</xref>; Comins and Hussey 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2015a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">b</xref>). The results were generally in accordance with the historical overviews of science historians.
