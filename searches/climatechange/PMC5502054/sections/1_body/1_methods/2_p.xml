<p id="Par11" class="p">In collaboration with CAS, we used both databases via the new platform of the Scientific and Technical Information Network (STN
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>) International. The CAplus publication records contain index terms (IT, keywords which are carefully selected and assigned by the database producer CAS). We searched for either one of the terms “anal?” or “occurr?” in combination (i.e. via the L operator of the STN retrieval language) with either of the terms “air” or “atmospher?” (? = truncation symbol to include “atmospheric” etc.) in combination with CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in the form of its CAS RN. This query returns all publications, which have words beginning with “anal” or “occurr” in their index terms, if the same index term group also contains “air” or a word starting with “atmospher”, and if the CAS RN of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is listed in that index term group. The cited references within the resulting publication set (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>
 <sub class="sub">p</sub> = 2322 papers and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>
 <sub class="sub">r</sub> = 58,012 cited references) have been extracted.
