<p id="Par22" class="p">To determine how camouflage affects mortality, we recorded predation events on brown and white stuffed models (Gosig mus, IKEA Article Number 501.454.73). Models were modified to make them longer and slimmer with a shorter tail to maximise resemblance to a weasel (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). We exposed models against contrasting backgrounds, either on bare ground not covered with snow or on the snow layer. Hence, when weather conditions were stable, we placed camera traps (Bushnell Natureview HD MAX) at different locations, with two models, one of each colour, placed approximately three to five meters apart and about ten meters from the camera (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). Cameras were triggered by motion sensing and were programmed to record 15-second videos after each taken picture. We conducted the experiments during the following time intervals: March–April 2015, January–March and November–December 2016. Each recording session lasted from one to two weeks at 4 to 6 sites located at least 100 meters apart, and chosen randomly in the open meadows of the study area. The locations of the experiments were changed randomly after every session. A brown model on snow and a white model on snow-free ground implied camouflage mismatch, whereas the opposite was considered completely cryptic. Detection was confirmed when the following predator behaviours occurred on the models: taking, attacking, urinating, sniffing and observing. To avoid any speculation, events where the models were taken without any camera record, or where the predator’s behaviour was unclear, were removed from the analyses. Predators from the same species were considered as two distinct individuals whenever there was a discontinuity in the time of detection and if no distinguishing characteristic was found.
