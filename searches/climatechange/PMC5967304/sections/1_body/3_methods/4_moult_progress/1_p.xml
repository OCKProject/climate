 <italic class="italic">nivalis</italic> individuals we used data collected between 2002 and 2017, using 45 video-records and 85 trapping-records. For the video-records, we were unable to distinguish between individual animals, but for the trapping-records we included the same individuals (in total 64 different animals) if they were trapped at different stages of moult. From January 2014 till February 2016, twelve special camera traps were distributed evenly at the three different sites (Białowieża National Park, open grasslands and Narewka river valley). We placed the traps 500 meters apart at fixed locations, following linear features (roads, fences and riverbanks). Cameras (Bushnell Natureview HD MAX) were triggered by motion sensing and were programmed to record 15-second long videos. Camera-traps worked continuously, and the data was retrieved every 2–3 weeks. For every video-recorded individual we recorded the date and time, type of morph (
 <italic class="italic">nivalis</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">vulgaris</italic>) and moulting stage (summer fur, winter fur, moulting). We classified all individuals into five groups: completely white (winter), dorsal part less than 25% brown, dorsal part 25–50% brown, dorsal part &gt;75% brown, or completely brown dorsal part of the body (summer) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). Finally, we estimated the proportion of individuals at different moulting stages (5 groups) during every 10-day period of each month. Data on snow cover duration was collected from the meteorological station in Białowieża village. We used climate data collected between 1967 and 2017, which approximately corresponds with the records of weasel skins in the collection of the Mammal Research Institute PAS in Białowieża.
