 <italic class="italic">nivalis</italic> share in the summer-autumn population (dependent variable) with number of days with snow cover during the preceding winter (explanatory variable). Another linear model was performed to study both the progress of snow cover over the years and changes of mean ambient temperatures during the spring and autumn moult, in which the year was used as an explanatory variable. Both linear models were checked for normality of residuals, homoscedasticity and over-dispersion.
