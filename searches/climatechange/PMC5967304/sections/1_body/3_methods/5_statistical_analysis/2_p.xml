<p id="Par25" class="p">We restricted our field experiment’s analyses to the situations when, according to the video-recordings, there was a predator present that either ignored or detected at least one model. To assess the main effect of camouflage on detection, we used a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) with a binomial distribution for the response variable (0 = undetected, 1 = detected) and logit link function. The fixed explanatory variables were as follows: camouflage as a two-level factor (0 = not camouflaged, 1 = camouflaged), model colour (two-level factor, brown or white), duration of experimental session (days) and percentage of area covered by snow. We were able to estimate snow cover during each of the experiments from the pictures and videos, not in terms of depth but as a range of values from 0 to 100%. The random variables used in the model were as follows: site number (models were present at 4–6 sites during each session) nested within experimental session and year. The significance of random variables was estimated using the log likelihood ratio test. Both random variables were non-significant, but we decided to keep them in the model to control for the independence of observations (there were two models - brown and white, present at every site). When performing the initial analyses, we also used interactions between the fixed terms, but they turned out to be non-significant; thus we did not include them in the final analyses. All analyses were performed using R Studio 1.0.44.</p>
