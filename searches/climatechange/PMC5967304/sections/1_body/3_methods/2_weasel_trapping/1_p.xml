<p id="Par21" class="p">We live-trapped weasels at three sites (Forest, Meadows and River valley) between 1997 and 2007. Trapping was done once in spring (April–June), three times in summer (July–September), once in autumn (October–November) and twice in winter (December–February). We set 20 to 40 traps, about 50 m apart, on transects (1.0–2.0 km of length) following linear features of the landscape, which are preferred by weasels, such as fences and ditches
