<p id="Par12" class="p">Analysis of weather data collected in Białowieża Forest over the last 50 years (between 1967 and 2017) revealed that the autumn moult correlates with the beginning of permanent snow cover (snow depth &gt;5 cm lasting for at least 5 days) in this area (on average 20th December, 95% CI: 14th December – 26th December). On the other hand, in spring, permanent snow cover ends on average on the 2nd March (95% CI: 14th February –10th March), thus before all animals complete their moults (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">S1</xref>). During the analysed period, the mean number of days with permanent snow cover decreased from around 80 days down to only 40 days (Table

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.07, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). This was mainly caused by the overall shortening of winter: at the beginning of the studied period snow completely disappeared on average on the 16th March, whereas in recent years it has been disappearing on the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> February (LM, F
 <sub class="sub">1,49</sub> = 4.84, p = 0.03, R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.07). Over the same period, there has been no change in the start of permanent snow cover (LM, F
 <sub class="sub">1,49</sub> = 0.01, p = 0.927, R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.00). A second factor that has contributed to the decrease in the mean number of days with permanent snow cover is the occurrence of mid-winter snow-free breaks, which last on average 31.8 days (SD = 14.33 days, range 15–56 days). During the analysed period, the frequency of mid-winter snow-free periods has increased significantly (LM, F
 <sub class="sub">1,49</sub> = 4.40, p = 0.041, R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.06), as in the past they happened on average once every 3.4 years, whereas recently they have been occurring once every 1.9 years (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). Mean temperatures in November-December (autumn moult) have not changed significantly over the last 50 years (LM, F
 <sub class="sub">1,49</sub> = 3.47, p = 0.069, R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.07), whereas during the analogous period, in March-April (spring moult) mean temperature has increased on average by 3.6 °C (LM, F
 <sub class="sub">1,49</sub> = 23.54, p &lt; 0.001, R
