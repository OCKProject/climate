<p id="Par9" class="p">We found that camouflage was the most significant factor affecting detection by a predator: weasel models with incompatible camouflage were detected more often than those matching the background colour (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Detection rates also decreased with increasing percentage of snow cover, but this effect was not significant (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Neither duration of experimental session nor model colour significantly affected detection rate (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Random variables in the model were year and site identity (ID), nested within experimental session, but both were non-significant (likelihood ratio &lt;0.000006, df = 1, p = 0.99 and likelihood ratio = 1.399, df = 3, p = 0.706, respectively). After removing the non-significant fixed terms from the model (see methods section), the effect of snow cover also became significant (GLMMs, z = −2.148, p = 0.032).
