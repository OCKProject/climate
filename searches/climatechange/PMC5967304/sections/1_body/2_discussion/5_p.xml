 <italic class="italic">nivalis</italic> is also further constrained by the fact that the decreasing number of days with snow cover is not only caused by the overall shortening of winter, but also by a substantial increase in the frequency of mid-winter snow-free periods. Therefore, even if weasels are able to modify their response to photoperiod
