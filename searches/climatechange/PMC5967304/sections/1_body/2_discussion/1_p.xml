 <italic class="italic">nivalis</italic>, a morph that changes its pelage colour to white in winter, decreased along with a simultaneous decrease in the number of days with snow cover in the region. Furthermore, the results of the field experiment with differently coloured weasel models revealed that detection decreased when the model was camouflaged and when snow cover increased in the study area. These results support the hypothesis that predation pressure can be one of the main natural factors affecting the selective mortality of weasels in winter. However, our predictions are based only on experiments with artificial models, whereas live animals may exhibit many anti-predatory behaviours. Thus the actual selective pressure on individuals with mismatched seasonal camouflage could be much lower, but probably high enough to cause local changes in the abundances and distributions of both weasel morphs. In any case, artificial models have been successfully used for a long time to study the effects of camouflage mismatch on the mortality of different animals
