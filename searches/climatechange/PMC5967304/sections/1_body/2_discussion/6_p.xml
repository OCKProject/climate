 <italic class="italic">vulgaris</italic>, with the latter usually characterized by a higher resting metabolic rate (RMR). This may restrict the presence of this form in the generally harsher conditions of Central and Eastern Europe. Nonetheless, more data on the physiological mechanisms of both subspecies is required in order to understand the potential shifts of their ranges and population distributions in future climatic conditions. Moreover, camouflage plays a very important role for weasels when they cover long distances on the snow’s surface. Thus when snow is present,

 <italic class="italic">vulgaris</italic> probably minimizes its exposure to predation, which may in turn limit its ability to exploit new hunting areas or limit its speed when moving, because of the necessity to stay under the cover of snow. This may lead to higher mortality of this subspecies, as weasels’ energy demands are high
