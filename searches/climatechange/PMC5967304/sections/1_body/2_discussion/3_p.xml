 </sup>. This means that climate change will strongly influence the mortality of the 
 <italic class="italic">nivalis</italic>-type due to prolonged camouflage mismatch, which will directly affect the numbers and geographical distribution of this subspecies. However, the limited plasticity of weasels during the autumn moult most probably results from the relatively unchanged ambient temperatures in November-December, which affect the onset of pelage change. The most important factor driving the process of moult in mustelids is a hormonal cascade induced by photoperiod

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>
 </sup>, but ambient temperatures also modify this process

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>
 </sup>. Thus as early winter temperatures (November–December) have been relatively stable over the last fifty years, there has been no reliable signal to cause weasels to delay pelage change from brown to white. In contrast, spring mean ambient temperatures have been gradually increasing, which has caused weasels to moult earlier. A future increase in early winter temperatures caused by climate warming could potentially delay moulting in

 <italic class="italic">n</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">nivalis</italic>, which would shorten the time of camouflage mismatch and decrease their mortality.
