<p id="Par19" class="p">We demonstrated that camouflage mismatch in seasonal coat colour can result in selective predation and be an important factor in natural selection. According to our results, increased mortality due to camouflage mismatch may lead to local extinction of the white winter morph and replacement by the brown one. If a change in winter pelage colour is an adaptive trait, there should be an association between mortality (fitness measure) and the genes (or alleles) that determine winter whitening. Thus future research on seasonally moulting animals should focus on the genetic component of this process and potential for evolutionary adaptations

 </sup>. More knowledge is also needed to understand what other factors than photoperiod and ambient temperature can modify the timing of moult and affect the plasticity of this trait.
