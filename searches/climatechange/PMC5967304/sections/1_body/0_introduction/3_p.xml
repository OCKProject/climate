<p id="Par4" class="p">The main aim of our study was to examine how camouflage mismatch and moult plasticity affect the fitness and distribution of individuals representing different phenotypes in two colour morphs of the least weasel 
 <italic class="italic">Mustela nivalis</italic>. In weasels, two main subspecies (distinct colour morphs) have been described, which occur in different climatic conditions

 <italic class="italic">vulgaris</italic> has expanded to the north and east, and both morphs currently occur sympatrically in several places, e.g. in Białowieża Forest (K. Zub, unpublished data). These morphs also exhibit some variation of the patterns of their summer colouration, but the differences between their winter pelages are far more important, as
