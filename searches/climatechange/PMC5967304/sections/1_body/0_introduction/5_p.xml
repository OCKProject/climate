<p id="Par6" class="p">To test this hypothesis, we analysed the effect of winter weather conditions on the survival of different morphs of weasels from trapping data. Next, we performed an experiment to examine the effect of camouflage mismatch on weasel mortality. Finally, we analysed the plasticity of moulting in

Based on the results of this study, we propose possible explanations for the present distribution of different weasel morphs and potential shift of their ranges due to climate change.
