  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>
 </sup>. Studies on snowshoe hares (
 <italic class="italic">Lepus americanus</italic>) that considered different climate change scenarios have shown that phenotypic mismatch in seasonally moulting species will increase in the future
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>
 </sup>. This would lead to extreme decreases in individual fitness if no evolutionary or adaptational changes occur
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>
 </sup>. Many animals have limited moulting plasticity; thus to respond to changing climatic conditions they exhibit many behavioural adaptations to minimise the fitness costs due to increased predation pressure. For instance, foraging willow ptarmigans 
 <italic class="italic">Lagopus</italic> 1. 
 <italic class="italic">lagopus</italic> select habitats characterised by lower food quality, but which offer optimal camouflage
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>
 </sup>, whereas rock ptarmigans 
 <italic class="italic">Lagopus mutus</italic> change from conspicuous to cryptic by soiling their plumage
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>
 </sup>. However, for other species (e. g. snowshoe hare) there is no evidence of behavioural adaptations for minimizing predation risks relating to colour mismatch
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>
 </sup>. Thus there is a need for experimental work as well as observational/correlative studies to investigate camouflage mismatch in all moulting species to understand the demographic consequences of such stressors.
