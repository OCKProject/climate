 <p id="Par1" class="p">Direct phenological mismatch caused by climate change can occur in mammals that moult seasonally. Two colour morphs of the weasel 
  <italic class="italic">Mustela nivalis</italic> (
  <italic class="italic">M</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">n</italic>.) occur sympatrically in Białowieża Forest (NE Poland) and differ in their winter pelage colour: white in 
  <italic class="italic">M</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">n</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">nivalis</italic> and brown in 
  <italic class="italic">M</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">n</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">vulgaris</italic>. Due to their small body size, weasels are vulnerable to attacks by a range of different predators; thus cryptic coat colour may increase their winter survival. By analysing trapping data, we found that the share of white subspecies in the weasel population inhabiting Białowieża Forest decreases with decreasing numbers of days with snow cover. This led us to hypothesise that selective predation pressure should favour one of the two phenotypes, according to the prevailing weather conditions in winter. A simple field experiment with weasel models (white and brown), exposed against different background colours, revealed that contrasting models faced significantly higher detection by predators. Our observations also confirmed earlier findings that the plasticity of moult in 
  <italic class="italic">M</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">n</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">nivalis</italic> is very limited. This means that climate change will strongly influence the mortality of the 
  <italic class="italic">nivalis</italic>-type due to prolonged camouflage mismatch, which will directly affect the abundance and geographical distribution of this subspecies.
