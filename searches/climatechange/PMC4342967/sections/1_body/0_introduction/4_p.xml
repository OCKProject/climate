<p class="p">An additional challenge in understanding the impacts of climate change is the sheer number of components in the biology of vectors, hosts and pathogens that are potentially influenced by climate, including survival rates and phenology of immature and mature ticks, fecundity, host encounter rates, vector competency, as well as replication rates of the pathogen and the community dynamics of hosts. The myriad climatic variables, influences and interactions have posed a significant challenge to researchers attempting to understand and predict the net effect of climatic conditions and climate change on tick-borne disease [
