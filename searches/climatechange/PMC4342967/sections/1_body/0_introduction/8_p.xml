<p class="p">In this paper, we review the literature on: laboratory and field studies linking abiotic conditions to tick demography and behaviour (§2); phenomenological models of ticks and tick-borne diseases affected by climate (§3); mechanistic models of tick dynamics and distributions as affected by climate (§§4 &amp; 5); climate effects on important hosts and pathogens (e.g. via changing phenologies) (§§6 &amp; 7). Last, in §8, we will point out knowledge gaps and suggest new approaches.</p>
