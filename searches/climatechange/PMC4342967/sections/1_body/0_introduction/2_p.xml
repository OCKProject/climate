<p class="p">Anthropogenic climate change over the past century has led to mean global temperatures consistently above those historically recorded as well as to increased variability in temperature and precipitation [

 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Although there is no shortage of predictions for how infectious disease will expand or shift in range, most are built upon the assumption that current climatic conditions are what limit the distribution of these diseases, e.g. [

 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], in part because of difficulties demonstrating the cause(s) of absence [
