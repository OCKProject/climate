<p class="p">Climate change is frequently invoked as a primary cause of expansions in incidence of tick-borne diseases, particularly Lyme disease. In the nearly 40 years since Lyme disease was first described, both the number and geographical range of reported human cases have increased dramatically in North America [

Other tick-borne diseases, including tick-borne encephalitis, human babesiosis and granulocytic anaplasmosis, have also emerged and expanded on these continents. Although these increases in incidence and range have been occurring simultaneously with warming trends, the effects of climate are difficult to disentangle from other potential causes. First, case reports typically increase with increasing awareness of emerging diseases on the part of healthcare providers and the public, but these trends might not reflect actual increases in infection or disease. Second, ticks and tick-borne diseases may be expanding for reasons that have nothing to do with climate, for instance, because of recolonization of regions that were previously unsuitable following large-scale land clearing, but with no clear impact of climate change [
