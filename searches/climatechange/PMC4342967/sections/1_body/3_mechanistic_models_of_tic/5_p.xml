<p class="p">Lastly, all these models continue to rely on few empirical data and best guesses about key parameters. For example, the effects of changing photoperiod and temperature on tick diapause and the dependence of tick feeding probability on host density and tick density are poorly known yet critical parameters affecting model results [
