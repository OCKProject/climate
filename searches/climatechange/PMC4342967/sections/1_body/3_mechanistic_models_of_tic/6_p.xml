<p class="p">It is noteworthy that despite their divergent approaches, both mechanistic and phenomenological models suggest dramatic range expansions of ticks and tick-borne disease as the climate warms. However, each modelling exercise has produced different maps based on different assumptions about the impacts of abiotic conditions on ticks and tick-borne pathogens. These inconsistencies, serious data limitations regarding the key tick-demographic and climatic processes, the limited ability to demonstrate situations in which climatic conditions are responsible for prohibiting tick-borne disease, and only limited incorporation of non-climatic processes, have weakened the application of this rich area of research to public health policy or actions.</p>
