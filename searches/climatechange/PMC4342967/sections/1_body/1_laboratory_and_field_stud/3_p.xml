 <italic class="italic">Ixodes scapularis</italic> is highly susceptible to desiccation when relative humidity drops below approximately 90% [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Even a few hours at low humidity can be lethal, but ticks returned to humid air may suffer little mortality [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. As ticks are very capable of avoiding desiccating conditions, for instance by remaining in the humid leaf litter or soil until conditions become more favourable, dry conditions may not directly restrict tick populations, although long dry periods can reduce longevity [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Environmental conditions may also constrain ticks' ability to quest for hosts. In summer, for instance, high temperatures and low relative humidity limit tick movement and questing activity [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Thus, hot and dry summer conditions may delay or prevent ticks from obtaining the necessary blood meal. This delay may not be very restrictive as questing ticks seem able to survive for several months or longer [

 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. However, there may be combinations of biotic and abiotic conditions where ticks rarely quest and encounter blood-meal hosts, which could potentially limit tick populations.
