<p class="p">Cold winter temperatures appear to have a more direct effect than do warm temperatures on 
 <italic class="italic">Ixodes</italic> survival and population dynamics. Newly moulted nymphal and gravid female 
 <italic class="italic">I. scapularis</italic> overwinter before emerging in spring to quest for a blood-meal host or oviposit, respectively. Even short-term exposure to extreme cold (e.g. below −15°C) can be lethal to

 <italic class="italic">I. ricinus</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] so cold winter weather could be responsible for a significant amount of mortality, and might constrain 
 <italic class="italic">Ixodes</italic> populations. Establishing the lower critical temperatures in the laboratory, however, is similarly of dubious relevance to climatic limitations in nature, if ticks can escape extreme conditions for sufficient periods. A recent field experiment by Brunner 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>], for instance, found that the hazard of overwintering mortality of nymphs in field enclosures was essentially constant in two locations, regardless of temperature. In addition, a recent laboratory study by Herrmann &amp; Gern [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>] suggested that frequent temperature variation may be more important for 
 <italic class="italic">I. ricinus</italic> survival than low temperatures, so relating laboratory results to natural environments remains a challenge.
