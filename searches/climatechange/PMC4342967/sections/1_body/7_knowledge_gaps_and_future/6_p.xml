<p class="p">There is also a need to better understand what controls the phenology of nymphal emergence and activity. (At least in North America, it appears that larval emergence is controlled by temperature-dependent rates of development.) If the emergence of nymphs is not strongly influenced by changing temperatures or has a different relationship with temperature than larvae, then there is potential for increasing or decreasing delays between larval and nymphal activity and therefore for selection favouring different strains of pathogens.</p>
