<p class="p">There is a need for theory and empirical studies of tick questing behaviour and particularly success in finding a host under various climatic conditions. To what degree are questing ticks limited by conditions (i.e. by time available to quest) versus by host density? Of course these are not independent—if hosts are abundant then even a small amount of time questing may suffice—but the precise relationship between these two aspects of host-finding is not clear, and may be critical [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C98" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>]. If, for instance, host density is more important than climatic constraints on questing success over a range of conditions, this would change the focus of discussion. Note, too, that the discussion so far assumes that host density and activity are not influenced by climatic conditions, but neither assumption is safe. In particular, it will be important to determine how host populations may change in distribution and abundance in a changing climate.
