<p class="p">Early seedlings survived for the entire experimental period (40 d) up to a water stress of 15% PEG 6000 (-3.25 MPa). At a PEG 6000 concentration of 20% (-5.34 MPa), seedlings perished. Post-seedlings survived for the entire experimental period (90 d) up to a water stress of 1/4 WHC (-4.46 MPa), but perished under the 1/5 WHC (-5.64 MPa) treatment.</p>
