<p class="p">Results of the 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> field experiment revealed that seedling emergence was related to seed germination and was found to be significantly different between sowing treatments and months (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0182012.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Seedling emergence lasted from September to November and the emergence rate was 23.89% in pots and 0.85% in field during the first month (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182012.g001" class="xref">Fig 1B</xref>). The highest seedling emergence rate was reached in November, which corresponded to 56.61% in the pots and 23.69% in the field. Seedling emergence stopped from the end of November. As found in the germination experiments, the potted treatment had significantly higher seedling emergence than the field treatment.
