<p class="p">The SDS experiment on early seedling growth revealed that all growth indices (root length, shoot length and fresh weight) decreased significantly with an increase in PEG 6000 concentrations (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0182012.t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Compared to the distilled water control, the growth of seedlings decreased by more than four times and fresh weight decreased by seven times at the PEG 6000 concentration of 10% (-1.66 MPa). No significant differences were observed in any of the parameters under PEG 6000 concentrations of 10% and 15% (
