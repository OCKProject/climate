<p class="p">Seedling survival in the pots was significantly different to that in the field across the different months (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0182012.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The seedlings survived in both the pot and field experiments decreased from November (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182012.g001" class="xref">Fig 1C</xref>). In the field treatment, the survival rate was 23.69% in November, dropping to 10.50% in December and reaching 0 in January, indicating that all seedlings perished under natural conditions. However, the seedling survival rates in the pot treatment only decreased slightly, retaining 53.00% survival in January.
