<p class="p">Results of the 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> field experiments revealed that the rate of seed germination in 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">yunnanensis</italic> was significantly different between the sowing treatments (pot and field) and months (from September to January; 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0182012.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Seed germination began one week after sowing in September and was determined to be 25.81% in the pots and 6.64% in the field (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182012.g001" class="xref">Fig 1A</xref>). It increased with time and reached its highest value in November. The highest germination rate in the pots was 66.61%, while in the field it was 40.69%. During the following two months there were no significant changes in both treatments. This suggests that seed germination terminates at the end of November under conditions of both sufficient and natural moisture. Seed germination in the pots was significantly higher than that in the field during the germination period (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.01); soil water potential in the pots (-0.01 MPa) was kept in saturation state during the entire period of seed germination, while in the field it decreased progressively i.e., -1.10 MPa in Sep., -2.50 MPa in Oct., -4.30 MPa in Nov., -5.40 MPa in Dec. and -5.60 MPa in Jan.
