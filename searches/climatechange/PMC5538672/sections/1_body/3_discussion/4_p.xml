 <xref rid="pone.0182012.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Global climate change is projected to produce more frequent droughts in many regions of the world [

 <xref rid="pone.0182012.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], and can trigger regeneration failure in natural forests [
 <xref rid="pone.0182012.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. According to the meteorological records of Puwen Forest Farm over the past 55 years, the climate in the natural distribution area of 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">yunnanensis</italic> has changed dramatically. There has been a clear decreasing trend in annual mean rainfall and relative humidity, declining by 21.7% and 6.3% respectively from 1960 to 2014, while annual mean temperature has increased by 6.0% (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182012.s001" class="xref">S1 Fig</xref>). In the context of decreased precipitation, higher temperatures are associated with an increased occurrence of drought due to higher rates of evapotranspiration. Importantly, decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature from September to February (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182012.s002" class="xref">S2 Fig</xref>) intensifies the soil moisture deficit during the key growth phrases of seedling establishment of 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">yunnanensis</italic>. It appears that water stress as a result of decreasing rainfall severely influences the integrity of 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">yunnanensis</italic> seedlings, especially when autotoxicity is concerned. According to Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0182012.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], the autotoxic effects of 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">yunnanensis</italic> might be concentrated under lower water potential conditions, thereby further hindering seed germination and seedling establishment. Thus, climatic change-induced drought may be primarily responsible for the regeneration failure of 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">yunnanensis</italic>, resulting in a decline in population size. In addition to the changes in global climate trends, the microclimate changes in natural habitat of 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">yunnanensis</italic> are influenced by local production activities. For instance, many local natural forests have been replaced by rubber, coffee, tea and other plantations [
 <xref rid="pone.0182012.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Therefore, the conservation strategies for 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">yunnanensis</italic> should encompass physiological or adaptive obstacles in seedling establishment, preventing habitat loss as a result of human disturbances, as well as the maintenance of microclimate stability.
