 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> field experiment, seed germination and seedling establishment were significantly lower under field conditions with naturally available moisture than under potted conditions with a sufficient moisture supply, across all three sites. Furthermore, seed germination, seedling emergence and seedling survival continued to increase until November, corresponding to a soil water potential of -4.30 MPa. Thereafter, seed germination and seedling emergence terminated physiologically in both the potted and field experiments. Seedlings began to perish in Dec. (-5.40 MPa), and had all died -off by Jan. at a soil water potential of -5.60 MPa in the field treatment. This implied that a soil water potential of -5.40 MPa severely limits
