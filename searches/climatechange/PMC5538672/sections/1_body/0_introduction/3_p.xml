 <italic class="italic">Nyssa yunnanensis</italic> is a critically endangered and range-restricted tree species known only from two small populations, consisting of five and three mature individuals respectively. It distributed in ravine rainforest and remained in the tropical forest region of southern Yunnan Province, southwestern China [

 <xref rid="pone.0182012.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. It has been delineated on the China's Flora Red List [
 <xref rid="pone.0182012.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] and the IUCN Red List as a Critically Endangered Species. Although 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">yunnanensis</italic> naturally produces abundant seeds, no seedlings were found surrounding the mother trees upon inspection of the locality. Chen et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0182012.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] suggested that difficulties in seed germination and seedling growth in wild populations of 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">yunnanensis</italic> hamper its regeneration. Studies on the taxonomy, morphology, seed germination characteristics and reproductive biology of

 <xref rid="pone.0182012.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] have not identified any physiological constraints to regeneration. However, Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0182012.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] proposed that regeneration in 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">yunnanensis</italic> may be negatively impacted by its autotoxicity. Moreover, autotoxic effects were found to be concentration-dependent, such that rainfall and soil moisture availability becomes a significant influencing factor. Significantly, meteorological records since 1960 have indicated that annual precipitation in the natural distribution areas of 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">yunnanensis</italic> has decreased significantly during the past half century [
 <xref rid="pone.0182012.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. However, the impacts of drought stress on the suppression of 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">yunnanensis</italic> regeneration and survival under climate change are not currently known.
