<p class="p">Seed germination and seedling establishment are two critical early life stages in which drought stress affects forest regeneration [

 <xref rid="pone.0182012.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Increases in temperature as well as moisture limitation may make species particularly susceptible to climate change during these life stages. For many plant species, constraints experienced during the phases of seed germination and seedling establishment severely limit regeneration [
