 <xref rid="pone.0182012.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. In fact, increased drought has already resulted in ecological change in many forest communities [

 <xref rid="pone.0182012.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], water-related stresses have more severe effects on the future distributions of endangered plant species, as these species usually have restricted distributions and do not possess the physiological and morphological adaptations to prevent excessive water loss. Furthermore, plants in early life stages are more sensitive to changes in climate, which can present a major bottleneck to recruitment [
