<p class="p">A repeated-measure one-way ANOVA (SPSS V. 16.0) was performed to determine the effect of sowing treatments in 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> experiments. Data obtained from the laboratory experiments, including seed water absorption, germination rate, early seedling growth and post seedling growth were evaluated using one-way ANOVA. If ANOVAs were significant, LSD was used to separate means at the 5% level. As the early seedlings in Experiment 1 did not survive under the treatment with 20% PEG 6000 solution (-5.34 MPa), and similarly, the post-seedlings in Experiment 2 did not survive under the 1/5 WHC (-5.64 MPa) treatment, they were excluded from the above analyses.
