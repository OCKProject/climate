 <italic class="italic">Nyssa yunnanensis</italic> were harvested from both remaining populations in August 2013 from their native habitat in Puwen Forest Farm,Yunnan Academy of Forestry. They were stored in a cold room (4°C) after drying at room temperature (20°C). In order to exclude the autotoxic effects of its pericarp, a seed-washing treatment was employed to break dormancy [

Before sowing, the seeds were selected based on size homogeneity and surface-sterilized to prevent decay by soaking in 5% Na-hypochlorite for five min, followed by washing five times with distilled water. We used 50 post seedlings in the follow-up experiments. They were cultivated for five weeks in a growth chamber (Safe Experimental Instrument Company, Haishu, Ningbo, China) at 20/15°C (day/night), under a 14-h photoperiod and a light intensity of 100–110 μmol m

The seedlings were then transplanted into pots containing sterilized bed soil (60% vermiculite, 20% cocopeat and 20% of other additives such as zeolite, loess and peat moss), and were placed into regular microcosm pots (10 cm dia. × 7 cm depth) in a greenhouse.
