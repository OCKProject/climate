 <italic class="italic">Effects of watering treatments on post-seedling growth</italic>: A water-controlled experiment was conducted to study the effects of simulated water conditions corresponding to various soil moistures on seedling growth. In this experiment, one-year-old seedlings were subsequently subjected to five soil moisture levels: 1 WHC (water holding capacity), 1/2 WHC, 1/3 WHC, 1/4 WHC and 1/5 WHC encompassing the range of soil moistures experienced in the field. The corresponding soil water potentials were determined using the filter paper technique [
