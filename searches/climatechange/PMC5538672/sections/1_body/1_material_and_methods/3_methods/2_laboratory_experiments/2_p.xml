<p class="p">Seed germination and early seedling growth were evaluated under five concentrations of PEG 6000 treatment (5%, 10%, 15%, 18% and 20%), corresponding to water potentials of -0.58, -1.66, -3.25, -4.29 and -5.34 MPa, respectively, while distilled water was used as the control (-0.01 MPa). The experiment was performed in Petri dishes (9 cm diameter) in a greenhouse. A 1-factorial seed germination experiment was designed with five PEG 6000 concentrations including six replicates, resulting in a total of 30 Petri dishes.</p>
