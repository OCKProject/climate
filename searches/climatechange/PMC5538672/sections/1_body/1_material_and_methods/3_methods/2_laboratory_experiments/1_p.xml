 <italic class="italic">Effects of simulated drought stress (SDS) on seed germination and early seedling growth</italic>: This experiment was carried out to determine the effects of simulated drought stress on germination and early seedling growth. Osmotic solutions of polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000) were used to induce drought stress reproducibly under 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> conditions, and to maintain consistent water potential throughout the experimental period. The solutions were prepared by dissolving the required amount of PEG 6000 in distilled water and shaking in a shaker bed (at 25Â°C) for 12 h.
