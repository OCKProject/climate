<p class="p">The pots were arranged in a greenhouse and positioned in a way that they would have likely received uniform amounts of sunlight, amount of shading, etc. Seedlings were irrigated daily with deionized water. Annual seedlings used in the experiment were propagated. All of the seedlings received watering for approximately one month prior to the initiation of experiments in order to help them acclimatize, as well as to minimize initial mortality. Desired soil moisture levels were obtained by allowing the soil to dry until it approached the selected moisture level, as determined gravimetrically on a parallel set of identical pots maintained for this purpose in the glasshouse (Khurana and Singh, 2004). The pots were weighed on alternate days and the required amount of water was added in order to maintain the respective moisture levels as accurately as possible. The plants were harvested following 90 days of growth. The aboveground organ of each plant was cut at the soil level and dried at 65°C until a constant mass was achieved, and then biomass was determined by weighing. Pots were placed at 4°C until roots could be washed (within one week). Belowground mass was separated from the growing media by washing with water, and dried at 65°C until a constant mass was reached. Growth measurements were determined as follows: leaf area ratio (LAR) = total leaf area/ total biomass; specific leaf area (SLA) = total leaf area/ total leaf biomass.</p>
