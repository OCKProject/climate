<p class="p">The seeds were sterilized by soaking in a 5% solution of H

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> for five min. After the treatment, the seeds were washed several times with distilled water. Thirty seeds based on size homogeneity were placed on filter paper moistened with the respective PEG 6000 solutions in each 9 cm diameter Petri dish. The Petri dishes were covered with parafilm to prevent the loss of moisture by evaporation. The dishes were then placed in an incubator for 40 days at 25°C. After 40 days of incubation, seed germination and early seedling growth indicators including shoot length, root length, seedling length and seedling fresh weight were measured. Seeds were considered germinated when the emergent radical reached 2 mm in length. Time to 50% germination (time taken to reach 50% germination) was calculated referred to Cavallaro et al. [
