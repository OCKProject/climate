<p class="p">The aim of the field experiment was to examine seed germination and seedling emergence of

 <italic class="italic">yunnanensis</italic> in 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> soil cultures within their natural environment. A 1-factorial experiment was designed consisting of two treatments: sowing in pots, and sowing directly in the soil in the field. In the “pot” treatment, five microcosm pots (30 cm dia. ×25 cm dep.) containing 5 kg of 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> soil were placed under the canopy of each target mother tree and treated with sufficient moisture artificially in the morning every two days. A 0.8 m tall fence was installed around the perimeter of the plot to deter entry and subsequent trampling. In the”field” treatment, five furrows were dug (45 cm long × 20 cm wide) in the field close to the pots, and received only natural moisture. Three 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">yunnanensis</italic> mother trees bearing fruits were used for the study. In total, there were 15 replicates for the three target mother trees in each treatment. No additional nutrients were added to either treatment. One hundred seeds were sown in each plot. Seed germination rate, seedling emergence, seedling survival and soil water potential (using a soil moisture sensor: Watermark, Spectrum, USA) were recorded monthly during the experimental period. The equation to calculate germination rate is: GR = seeds germinated /total seeds × 100.
