<p class="p">That is why these models are also called crop simulation models. Each type of model has advantages and disadvantages as well as limitations. However, all are useful tools when considering the potential impact of climate change. Researchers select the model that best suits the application. From the point of view of the present question, the major limitations of the first three approaches are that they cannot capture future climate-soil-crop relationships, adaptation through crop management and carbon dioxide fertilization effect, though there are techniques to estimate the latter in statistical methods (
