<p class="p">Approaches used to assess the impacts of climate change on agriculture include four major types. 
 <list list-type="order" class="list">
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Climate or more generally, environmental index-based methods (
    <xref rid="pcx141-B97" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Olesen et al. 2011</xref>) utilize a multidimensional scoring system of production determining factors to provide a quasi-quantitative assessment of the vulnerability of the investigated agricultural system or area.

  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Statistical models express the relationship between yield or yield components and weather parameters in a form of regression equations (
    <xref rid="pcx141-B76" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lobell and Burke 2010</xref>) or other type of more ‘black-box’ models (
    <xref rid="pcx141-B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Delerce et al. 2016</xref>) which are calibrated by using corresponding observed yield and weather data varying in time or space or in both domains.

  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Niche-based models describe the geographical distribution of a crop species using either a set of explicit fuzzy-logic equations that specify how environmental suitability (a continuous variable in the range 0–1) varies across an environmental gradient (
    <xref rid="pcx141-B144" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zabel et al. 2014</xref>) or a statistical model fitted with presences and absences of the crop in question (
    <xref rid="pcx141-B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Estes et al. 2013</xref>).

    <xref rid="pcx141-B96" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">M�ller et al. 2017</xref>) are the mathematical (and nowadays usually computer-based) representation of the most important processes of the soil-plant system consisting of a set of ordinary or partial differential equations and empirical equations organized into procedures or modules where the outputs of one procedure can serve as input to other procedures and the model as a whole is able to describe the temporal pattern of the key system parameters.
