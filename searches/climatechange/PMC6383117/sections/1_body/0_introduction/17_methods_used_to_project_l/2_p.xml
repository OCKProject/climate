<p class="p">The ‘No Change’ scenario is the extrapolation of the current trends, i.e. assuming that no major GHG emission reductions will be achieved by the introduction of mitigation policies or enhanced climate-smart agro-technologies. Moreover, the scenario predicts that increases in income and urbanization will drive a global dietary transition that involves increasingly higher consumption of refined sugars, fats, oils and meats (
 <xref rid="pcx141-B125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tilman and Clark 2014</xref>). Together, these features will result in increased demands for maize and soybean production. In contrast, the ‘Major Change’ scenario envisages successful and effective GHG mitigation policies, together with the instigation of new GHG emission reducing agricultural practices. This will involve significant health-driven changes in diets and adoption of alternative diets such as Mediterranean, pescetarian or vegetarian diets that are characterized by higher consumption of fruits, vegetables and pulses and a lower meat consumption (
 <xref rid="pcx141-B125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tilman and Clark 2014</xref>). The vast majority of soybean (75%) is currently used to feed livestock, with only about 6% used directly as human food. Future decreases in meat consumption will therefore lead to large decreases in soya demand. Global crop production area maps were created using these scenarios with a 10 km (5 arc minute) spatial resolution. According to current land use (LU) given by (
