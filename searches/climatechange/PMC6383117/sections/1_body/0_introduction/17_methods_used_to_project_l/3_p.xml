<p class="p">The objective of the projections shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcx141-F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcx141-F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref> is to highlight likely changes in land use patterns. The crop production scenarios reported here predict significantly different demands for land use for maize (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcx141-F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>) and soybean (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcx141-F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>) production. Both the used and the not-used cells may remain in the same land use category or may be changed in the future providing four options that can be defined by certain rules for both scenarios (
 <xref rid="pcx141-T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). If land is ‘used’ today according to the definitions used above, we assume that these areas will be unaltered in the future (2071–2100) in the ‘Major Change’ scenario, if the suitability increases by at least 10%. If suitability increases less than 10% or decreases until 2071–2100, we assume that these areas will be abandoned and not be used in the future.
