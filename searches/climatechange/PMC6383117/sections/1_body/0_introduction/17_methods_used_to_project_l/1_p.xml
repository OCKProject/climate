 <xref rid="pcx141-B144" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zabel et al. (2014)</xref> by incorporating data on local daily climate (temperature, precipitation, solar radiation), soil (texture, hydraulic characteristics, pH, organic carbon content, salinity, sodicity) and topography (elevation, slope). We consider 16 economically important staple and energy crops (including maize and soybean) at a spatial resolution of 30 arc seconds. The parameterization of the membership functions that describe each of the crops’ specific natural requirements is taken from 
 <xref rid="pcx141-B120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sys et al. (1993)</xref>. As a result of the fuzzy logic approach, values in a range between 0 and 1 describe the suitability of a crop for each of the prevailing natural conditions at a certain location. The smallest suitability value over all parameters finally determines the suitability of a crop. Daily climate data are taken from the global climate model ECHAM5 (
