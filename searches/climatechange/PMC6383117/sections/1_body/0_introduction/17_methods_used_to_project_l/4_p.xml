<p class="p">Crucially, areas that are currently not used for maize (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcx141-F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>B) production will probably be added if future land suitability is higher than the 67th percentile of today’s global suitability on used areas. Conversely, areas that are currently not used will also not be used in the future if suitability is lower than the 67th percentile. Since demands for soybean and maize production are higher in the ‘No Change’ scenarios than in the ‘Major Change’ scenarios, more areas will be required for the production of these crops. Accordingly, we assume lower thresholds for future land suitability, as well as lower percentiles of suitability on today’s production areas for maize and soybean respectively. Hence, greater areas of marginal land will have to be used for the cultivation maize and soybean in order to fulfill increasing demands.
