<p class="p">Crop models have a central role in informing agro-industry and policymakers about the risks and potential of adaptation strategies to counter climate change, as well as directing plant scientists and breeders towards the required traits in improved varieties and cropping systemsâ€™ management practices to mitigate global climate change impacts. Crop model inter-comparison studies have identified large uncertainties and biases (e.g.

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> world on the global production of maize and soybean. Currently, maize is the most important grain crop and soybean the fourth most important in terms of global production. Since 1960, soybean and maize grain yields increased 7.6 and 2.6 times, respectively. Together, the USA, Brazil and Asia (mainly China and India) account for respectively 92% and 84% of the world soybean and maize production. However, while the land area on which grain legumes, such as soybean, are grown has gradually increased over the past 50 years, this is still only a quarter of that planted to cereals, such as maize (

In addition, while increases in cereal production over this period have been predominantly due to increases in yield, driven by the introduction of new varieties and improvements in agronomic practices, increases in grain legume production are due to both increases in land area planted and grain yield (
 <xref rid="pcx141-B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Foyer et al. 2016</xref>). For soybean in particular, grain yields have increased in proportion to the land area planted. Moreover, year-on-year increases in soybean yields are slowing while area planted is increasing, suggesting that more marginal land is being planted.
