<p class="p">There is now an extensive literature on the responses of plant biology to growth under high [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] conditions, with reviews ranging from the control of photosynthetic electron transport and re-programming of photosynthetic gene expression that accompanies the suppression of photorespiration (
 <xref rid="pcx141-B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Foyer et al. 2012</xref>) to effects on abiotic stress tolerance (
 <xref rid="pcx141-B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">AbdElgawad et al. 2016</xref>). It is not our intention therefore to describe the complex and many-faceted responses of plants to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> enrichment but rather to highlight a few of the salient points that form the basis for current assumptions made in crop models.
