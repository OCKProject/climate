<p class="p">Current atmospheres have a CO

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> ratio of 0.00194 but this may increase to values as high as 0.0047 by the end of this century (
 <xref rid="pcx141-B58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">IPCC 2013</xref>), because CO

 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> (
 <xref rid="pcx141-B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dlugokencky and Tans 2017</xref>). This will benefit plants such as soybean that rely on C3 photosynthesis. High atmospheric [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] in FACE experiments resulted in increased soybean photosynthesis rates of up to 46 % (
 <xref rid="pcx141-B70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Leakey et al. 2009a</xref>). This enhancement is possible because the current atmospheric [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] of 400 
 <bold class="bold">μ</bold>LL
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> is insufficient to saturate the enzyme responsible for photosynthetic carbon assimilation, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco; 
 <xref rid="pcx141-B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Farazdaghi 2011</xref>). Gaseous CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is much more soluble in water than O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, and thus the local CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>:O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> ratio in the chloroplast environment is currently about 0.026 at 25�C. Rubisco has about a 100-fold greater affinity for CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> than O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in higher plants, dictating that this enzyme catalyzes between two and three cycles of carboxylation for every cycle of oxidation. In this way, carbon is partitioned between the assimilatory C3 cycle and the photo-respiratory pathways. Hence, higher CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>:O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> ratios will competitively inhibit the oxygenase activity of Rubisco and C3 carbon fixation will be favored over photorespiration. However, the potential benefits offered by increased carbon gain are often not fully realized because of insufficient sink capacity when C3 plants are grown at elevated [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] (
 <xref rid="pcx141-B101" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Paul and Foyer 2001</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcx141-B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bernacchi et al. 2005</xref>). This results in carbohydrate accumulation in source leaves, a signal that causes repression of genes encoding photosynthetic proteins leading to a down-regulation of photosynthesis and a decrease in leaf nitrogen (N) content (
 <xref rid="pcx141-B70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Leakey et al. 2009a</xref>). Limitations in soil nitrate availability can also lead to down-regulation of photosynthesis in plants grown at elevated [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>]. The ‘progressive N limitation’ hypothesis suggests that under CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> enrichment, plant N uptake from soils fails to keep pace with photosynthesis and shoot carbohydrate accumulation (
 <xref rid="pcx141-B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Foyer et al. 2009</xref>). Growth at elevated [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] can also significantly reduce leaf litter N availability, and lead to poor soil quality because of suppressed decomposition and increased microbial immobilization (
 <xref rid="pcx141-B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cha et al. 2017</xref>). It has also been argued that photorespiration plays an important role in providing the reductant required to drive the assimilation of nitrate into ammonium (
 <xref rid="pcx141-B104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rachmilevitch et al. 2004</xref>). Hence, that increasing [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] will favor C3 plants, particularly in environments where NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>+ is available as a nitrogen source. The increase in carbon gain achieved by C3 plants under CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> enrichment may also serve ameliorate problems associated with ammonium toxicity (
