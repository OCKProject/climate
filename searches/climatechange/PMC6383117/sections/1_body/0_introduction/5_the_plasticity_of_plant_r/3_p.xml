<p class="p">The effects of increasing [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] on plant architecture and partitioning of biomass between roots and shoots remains uncertain. Much depends on the C/N balance in roots and shoots. N-availability signals in the shoot influence the root system. The shoot promotes root growth in proportion to total N-demand. Plant architecture responses to increasing [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] are likely to involve complex pathways of root-to-shoot and shoot-to-root signaling. Signaling molecules include the small C-terminally encoded peptide (CEP) family peptides, which control root system architecture (
 <xref rid="pcx141-B92" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mohd-Radzman et al. 2015</xref>) and the CLAVATA signaling pathway, which controls root development and involves small signaling peptides of the clavata3/embryo surrounding region (CLE) family that are important in the regulation of stem cell division and differentiation in an N-responsive manner (
 <xref rid="pcx141-B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Araya et al. 2016</xref>). In N-deprived roots CEP peptides are produced and transported to the shoot, where they induce of expression of ‘CEP-downstream’ peptides that are transported back to the root to increase the expression of N-uptake transporters. There is a paucity of literature to date concerning how high [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] influences whole plant signaling.
