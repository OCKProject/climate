<p class="p">Crop modeling has been used for various applications over the past few decades. Field-scale applications for decision support have a long history (
 <xref rid="pcx141-B55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hoogenboom et al. 1994</xref>) that in turn enabled work with seasonal weather forecasting (
 <xref rid="pcx141-B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hansen 2005</xref>), frameworks to link crop and climate models (
 <xref rid="pcx141-B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Challinor et al. 2003</xref>), or integrated assessments within watersheds or across multiple sectors (

 <xref rid="pcx141-B141" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wriedt et al. 2009</xref>). Crop models have been used to develop adaptation options (

 <xref rid="pcx141-B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Challinor 2009</xref>) and there is now recognition of the need for combined assessments of adaptation and mitigation, in support of achieving emissions targets (

 <xref rid="pcx141-B112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Shirsath et al. 2017</xref>). The need to quantify uncertainty (
 <xref rid="pcx141-B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Challinor et al. 2013</xref>) and to improve models has led to an increasing number of international collaborations across modeling groups (
 <xref rid="pcx141-B109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rosenzweig et al. 2013</xref>), as well as to linking crop models to climate model ensembles (
 <xref rid="pcx141-B105" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ramirez-Villegas et al. 2013</xref>). Recognition of the importance of vulnerability and agricultural management in determining impacts and adaptation options has led to work across the natural-social science interface (
