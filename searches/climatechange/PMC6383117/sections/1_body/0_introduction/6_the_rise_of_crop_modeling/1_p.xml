<p class="p">Crop models are designed to calculate crop yield (and other important parameters of the soil-plant system) as a function of weather and soil conditions, plant-specific characteristics as well as a choice of agricultural management practices (see 
 <xref rid="pcx141-T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> for definitions for key terms used hereafter). Models of cropping systems were first conceived in the 1960s (
 <xref rid="pcx141-B61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jones et al. 2017</xref>). Although it is fundamentally a curiosity-driven activity, the development of crop models received major boosts from various economic, technological and political events. During the Cold War, fueled by the unexpected large volume purchase of wheat by the Soviet Union in 1972, another type of curiosity played an important role in the development of key components of the DSSAT model suite (

The current version of DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer) software application comprises crop simulation models for various cereals, grain legumes and root crops. Outside simulating plant growth, development and yield formation the model is calculating the soil heat, water and nitrogen balance as a function of the soil-plant-atmosphere dynamics and agro-management options. Governmental funds helped experts from different disciplines to develop crop models with new capabilities: EPIC (
 <xref rid="pcx141-B137" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Williams et al. 1989</xref>) with a soil erosion module, APSIM (
 <xref rid="pcx141-B64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Keating et al. 2003</xref>) able to simulate large number of different crops including trees and weeds. The Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model is a cropping systems model that was developed to estimate soil productivity as affected by erosion. Today, EPIC simulates approximately eighty crops with one generic crop growth model using unique parameter values for each crop. It predicts effects of management decisions on soil, water, nutrient and pesticide movements, and their combined impact on soil loss, water quality, and crop yields. The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) software is a modular modeling framework developed to simulate biophysical processes in agricultural systems, particularly as it relates to the economic and ecological outcomes of management practices with regards to climate risks. APSIM is structured around plant, soil and management modules comprising diverse range of crops, pastures and trees, soil processes including water balance, N and P transformations, soil pH, erosion and a full range of management controls. The release of the first personal computers in the early 1980s revolutionized not only the use and development of crop models but it led to many innovations in other fields (computer graphics, statistical analysis, GIS, etc.) that have contributed to the modeling of agricultural systems (
