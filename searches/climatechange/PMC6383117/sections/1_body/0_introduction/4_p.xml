<p class="p">In this review, we will provide a brief overview of our current understanding of the molecular, metabolic and physiological responses of plants to increasing atmospheric [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] and briefly summarize the history and types of crop models that are currently available. We then specifically address the question of how increasing atmospheric [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] will alter global soybean and maize production patterns. Using 118 peer-reviewed publications (31 for soybean and 87 for maize), we review the main issues that should be taken into account when modeling these two important crops, namely model inputs, the roles of [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] adaptation, mitigation, and modeling uncertainties. Finally, we discuss projected land-use change as a major determining factor for future global crop production.
