<p class="p">Representative concentration pathways (RCPs) are four greenhouse gas concentration trajectories (
 <xref rid="pcx141-B58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">IPCC 2013</xref>), all of which are plausible depending on how much greenhouse gases are emitted in the years to come. The four RCPs, RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6, and RCP8.5, are named after the prospective radiative forcing values in the year 2100 relative to pre-industrial values (+2.6, +4.5, +6.0, and +8.5 Wm

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> respectively). The ultimate aim of climate change mitigation policies is to reduce emissions consistent with specific targets, thus helping to avoid high-end emissions scenarios such as RCP8.5. The Paris Agreement (2015), for example, aims at maintaining global average temperature well below 2�C above pre-industrial levels; this has been reported to significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change (
 <xref rid="pcx141-B114" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Schleussner et al. 2016</xref>). This aim could be achieved in many ways including the use of low-carbon technologies, renewable energy sources, transportation optimization, as well as promoting individual-lifestyle changes (cycling instead of driving, alternative diets, etc.). In the agricultural sector, climate change mitigation policies may be implemented via promoting reforestation, low input soil management, resource efficient farm management, more sustainable fertilizer subsidy provision, and improving knowledge and transfer mechanisms all aiming at increasing carbon sequestration and/or decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. Climate mitigation policies play an important role in ensuring that new technologies are implemented and mitigation targets are met. They are hence central to avoiding future global yield losses.
