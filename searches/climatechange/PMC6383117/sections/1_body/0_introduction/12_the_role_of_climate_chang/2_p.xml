<p class="p">Across the soybean studies reviewed here, mitigation policies are typically addressed by modeling crop yields for different RCPs. Comparison between different RCPs allows determination of the likely benefits of climate change mitigation. For example, the yield reduction reported by 
 <xref rid="pcx141-B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Deryng et al. (2014)</xref> was the result of using the most extreme RCP8.5 based climate projections which is in fine agreement with the findings of 
 <xref rid="pcx141-B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bhattarai et al. (2017)</xref> who, on the other hand, used not only RCP8.5 but RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 based projections resulting in marginal yield losses (âˆ’2%) for RCP8.5 and yield gains (11 and 13%) for RCP2.6 and RCP4.5, respectively. The studies reviewed here thus strongly suggest that successful climate change mitigation policies that secure the future [CO
