<p class="p">Another important aspect of future crop production is the extent to which areas where crops are grown may shift as conditions change. Some studies have shown that there is a large northerly and southerly shift in land that is suitable for soybean production (

Thus, due to the projected future yield and sowing area gains an expansion of soya production could be expected worldwide, although as with projected yield changes, these shifts in production areas could change depending upon the emissions pathway.
