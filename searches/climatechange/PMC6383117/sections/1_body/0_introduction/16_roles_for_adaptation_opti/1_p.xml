<p class="p">Modeling studies do not depict a clear positive or negative picture for future global maize production but they clearly emphasize the need for explicit adaptation actions such as breeding of heat/drought tolerant hybrids. The majority of the studies (13 out of 20) that assessed certain adaptation options concluded that a shift in planting date, together with the use of longer maturing hybrids and alternative soil and nitrogen management practices will be insufficient to counter negative impacts of climate change (

Studies also agree that the more extreme the scenario (RCP8.5 or similar scenarios form the earlier IPCC reports) the more severe the yield losses that could be expected. This highlights the necessity and opportunities for joint mitigation-adaptation efforts. A global study suggest that the drastic climate mitigation policy of RCP2.6 could avoid more than 80% of the projected global average yield losses (USA: −20%, Brazil: −50%, Argentina: −40%) that are otherwise projected by the 2080s under RCP8.5 (
