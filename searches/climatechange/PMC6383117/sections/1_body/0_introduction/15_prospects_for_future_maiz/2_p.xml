<p class="p">Regional gridded modeling studies are particularly important in maize yield projections because they are able to distinguish between sub-regions that may be positively or negatively affected by climate change. The currently high yielding sub-regions of China may face yield decreases while the current low yielding sub-regions may expect yield increase (
 <xref rid="pcx141-B142" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Xiong et al. 2007</xref>). Current high yielding sub-regions are near-optimum zones providing very favorable conditions for maize production. Almost any environmental change in these areas could only be negative as it would distance the system from its near-optimum state. On the other hand, marginal areas (far from the optimum) most likely benefit from the environmental changes, by getting closer to the optimum state of the system. However, yield losses per unit area do not necessarily translate into overall productivity for a given region, because the projected area of cultivated land used for multiple-cropping systems may be significantly increased as a result of climate change (

Such factors could significantly alter the pest management landscape of North American maize production, leading to substantial economic impacts through increased seed and insecticide costs, as well as decreased yields.
