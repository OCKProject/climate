 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilisation into account. Many studies accounted the predicted yield reduction by one or more of the three main reasons: (i) Increasing frequency and severity of drought; (ii) Increasing risk of heat waves around flowering; (iii) Shortening of the vegetation period. However, it may also be the case that current models fail to account for the water-saving mechanisms afforded by C4 metabolism and physiology appropriately. Higher water use efficiencies would be expected in maize under high [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>]. Thus, models failing to take this feature into account might underestimate biomass and yield gains under high [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>].
