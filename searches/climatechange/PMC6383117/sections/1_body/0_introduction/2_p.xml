<p class="p">Since high [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] will favor photosynthetic carbon assimilation and depress photorespiration in plants with the C3 pathway of photosynthesis, it is generally assumed that C3 plants will benefit from increased carbon gain that will translate into increased biomass and yield. Many aspects of plant metabolism, molecular physiology, structure and development are modified by growth under high atmospheric [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>], not least because the assimilation of carbon is tightly linked to primary nitrogen assimilation (Terashima et al. 2015 and articles cited therein). Moreover, increased [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] reduces the density of stomata and also decreases the aperture of the stomatal pores resulting in decreased evapotranspiration (

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is far from resolved, particularly at the whole plant level. Much of our current understanding of the responses of crop growth to high atmospheric [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] has come from either studies in free air CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> enrichment (FACE) sites or chamber (closed or open-top) experiments. Unfortunately, such studies have not always yielded consistent results. CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> enrichment does not necessarily enhance plant growth or yield and differences in the responses of these traits have been reported even within the same species (
