<p class="p">In a global study, 
 <xref rid="pcx141-B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Blanc and Sultan (2015)</xref> showed that the projected changes for maize production were highly model-dependent, ranging from a 15% decrease to a 20% increase in yield in the Corn Belt. However, large scale investigations may contradict local (country scale) studies even if the same model was used. For example, 
 <xref rid="pcx141-B119" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Supit et al. (2012)</xref> projected a yield increase for Turkey as a result of climate change while 
 <xref rid="pcx141-B111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sen et al. (2012)</xref> predicted that yields will decrease in this region. One reason for this kind of discrepancy could be the lack of use or quality in the soil data used for yield projections (
 <xref rid="pcx141-B122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tatsumi et al. 2011</xref>). The impact of climate change on specific regions could vary significantly because of differences in soil characteristics (
 <xref rid="pcx141-B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chipanshi et al. 2003</xref>). Surprisingly, no local model-based impact studies were found for France, Indonesia, Ukraine or South-Africa, although these countries are among the top 10 global maize producers.
