<p class="p">Fifteen different models were used to assess the potential climate change impacts on soybean. However, only two models were used in more than two studies. CROPGRO and EPIC model results were reported in 15 and 4 papers, respectively. Seventeen studies investigated more than one location (from two to 100) within the study area (point-based studies) and 11 studies used the gridded modeling approach covering the total investigated area with a specific spatial resolution. No studies used gridded and point-based estimates jointly. Regarding uncertainty quantification, only two papers used more than one crop model, though this technique helps avoiding model-related biases in the climate change impact projections. Conversely, with the exception of two studies, all used several (two to 72) future climate projections to assess (or show) the uncertainty arising from different climate model- and/or climate change scenario-related issues. The projected temperature rise used in the climate projections (compared to the baseline) varied between 0.9 and 9�C, but the majority of the studies examined the effect of a 2–4�C temperature rise. These temperature changes were associated with an increase in the atmospheric [CO
