<p class="p">Crop models have been widely used to estimate the potential impacts of climate change on future agricultural productivity. The protocols of the assessments vary to such an extent that they impose serious limitations to cross-study syntheses and increase the potential for bias in projected impacts (
 <xref rid="pcx141-B138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">White et al. 2011</xref>). Despite this fact, the available results allow us to draw some robust conclusions that are outlined below. With the help of the SCOPUS database, we reviewed 118 peer-reviewed publications (31 for soybean and 87 for maize) that used crop models to investigate the impact of climate change on the production of maize and soybean worldwide in the second half of the 21st century. These modeling studies covered all the most important production areas in America, Asia, Europe and Africa. Using these studies, we summarized the key findings on model inputs, consideration of [CO
