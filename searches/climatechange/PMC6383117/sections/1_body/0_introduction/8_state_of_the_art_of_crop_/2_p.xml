There are currently two large modeling initiatives, AgMIP (agmip.org) and Modeling European Agriculture for Climate Change (MACSUR: macsur.eu). These networking hubs coordinate and support crop model development, together with crop model based studies and impact assessments, providing information for producers, policy-makers and the public in the area of integrated climate change risk assessment for global agriculture and food security. The projections described for maize and soybean below are results of the collaboration of several groups from the AgMIP and MACSUR modeling initiatives.
