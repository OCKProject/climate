<p class="p">Twenty-one different models were used for assessing the potential climate change impacts on maize. The two most frequently used models were the CERES (member of the DSSAT model suite) and EPIC that were used in 45 and eight studies, respectively. About a third (23) of the assessments were based on data of only one particular site of the study area and/or applied only one climate projection for the future. The projected temperature rise and the associated atmospheric carbon dioxide increase of the climate projections of the maize studies were similar to those of the soybean studies. Regarding crop model uncertainty, twenty-two studies used the gridded modeling approach and five papers used more than one crop model for the impact assessments. The most comprehensive of these was the study of

(2014)</xref>, which evaluated 23 maize simulation models for four locations representing a wide range of maize production conditions in the world. They found that only an ensemble of models (a minimum of about eight to 10 needed) was able to simulate absolute yields accurately and that there was a large uncertainty in the yield response to [CO
