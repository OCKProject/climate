<p class="p">Crop models have an important role to play in informing plant scientists and breeders of essential traits that must be developed in future crop varieties. However, there is a wide gulf between plant science and crop modeling such that much of our current knowledge of plant responses to elevated atmospheric [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] is not taken into account in many current models. Crucially, current models do not incorporate the latest findings about how crops respond to a changing climate. There is therefore an urgent need for a new interface of information exchange between crop modelers and plant scientists highlighting weaknesses and overlooked processes, and to influence how models are built, to include how recent changes in our understanding of [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>]-mediated effects on plants might be formalized and incorporated into models. It is thus timely to renew discussions in order to remove the large uncertainties and biases in some current crop models, as well as informing plant scientists of the essential underpinning traits that will ensure food security over the next 50 years. Current crop varieties are not well suited to future unpredictable weather patterns caused by climate change. Modern breeding programs have selected for dwarf shoot systems, minimizing the production of vegetative tissues. Moreover, elite crop varieties are developed and bred under ideal growth conditions so the selective pressure for plant performance under sub-optimal conditions has largely been removed. This has favored small root systems, a trait that may have inadvertently decreased the resilience of plants to both abiotic and biotic stresses, which are likely to increase as a result of climate change.
