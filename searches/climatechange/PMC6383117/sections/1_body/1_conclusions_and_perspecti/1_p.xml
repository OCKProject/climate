Major changes in policy, agricultural practice and diet imply that major shifts will occur in the area used for maize and soya production. Our assessment of modeling outputs predicts that large portions of current areas of significant maize and soya production may be abandoned in the future. On the other hand, large new areas will become available in the future (
 <xref rid="pcx141-T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>) in order to meet the increasing demands on maize and soya production, particularly if no significant policy, agro-technological and diet-related changes take place in the future. According to the projections Europe will face major challenges in both production scenarios, especially in case of maize. Aligned to other studies (

At the other end of the spectrum is Africa, where climate change may allow a massive increase in soybean production no matter which production scenario becomes a reality in the future. It is not surprising that soybean is called Africa’s Cinderella crop (

 <xref rid="pcx141-T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). These crop models provide essential underpinning information to farmers, agro-industries and policymakers, so that appropriate cropping systems and/or management practices can be put in place to counter global climate change.
