    <xref rid="pcx141-B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Boote et al. 2013</xref>). Recent progress in crop, ecosystem, and climate modeling has led to integration of these disciplines in support of integrated assessments of agro-ecosystems at the global or regional level (e.g. 
    <xref rid="pcx141-B98" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Osborne et al. 2007</xref>,

    <xref rid="pcx141-B132" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wang et al. 2005</xref>). In these cases, crop models may provide the underlying information, parameters and mathematical formulations that underpin the vegetation models used. Nevertheless, much work remains to be done in crop simulation models if these are to be fully integrated within vegetation models. Foremost, adequately simulating vegetation within complex agro-ecosystems requires detailed consideration of CO

    <xref rid="pcx141-B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cramer et al. 2001</xref>). While progress has been made in developing and testing leaf-to-canopy assimilation in some crop models, only a handful of models for the major crops, including maize and soybean, include detailed photosynthesis-respiration routines for both assimilation and CO

Moreover, respiration costs associated with the maintenance of existing tissue (maintenance respiration) and the production of new tissue (growth respiration) are either highly uncertain or not estimated or reported in crop simulation studies. Furthermore, testing of CO

    <italic class="italic">Canopy temperature and evapotranspiration:</italic> The importance of models predicting global warming effects on crop yield to include canopy temperature instead of using air temperature was demonstrated by 
    <xref rid="pcx141-B62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Julia and Dingkuhn (2013)</xref>. They found that rice panicle temperature varied between 9.5 below and 2�C above air temperature at 2 m depending on the microclimate and therefore heat stress causing sterility was more likely to occur in warm-humid than hot-arid environments due to humidity effects on transpiration cooling. Even though some crop models calculate canopy from air temperature, which is then used on some but not necessarily all temperature-related processes in the crop model, 
    <xref rid="pcx141-B135" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Webber et al. (2015)</xref> found that this did not necessarily improve yield simulations. The study compared nine process-based crop models that used three different approaches of simulating canopy temperature (empirical, energy balance assuming neutral atmospheric stability, and energy balance correcting for the atmospheric stability conditions) in their ability to simulate heat stress in irrigated wheat in a semi-arid environment. Methods assuming neutral atmospheric stability determine the resistance of the surface to transfer water vapor and heat to the air as a function of crop height and wind speed whereas methods correcting for atmospheric stability include canopy temperature in the calculations. They found that for all models the reduction in the root mean square error was larger if canopy temperature was only used for the processes simulating heat stress but that using canopy temperatures for all processes did not necessarily improved yield simulations. Models that performed well in simulating yield under heat stress had varying skill in simulating canopy temperature (the method energy balance assuming neutral atmospheric stability performed worst). Models differ in parameter values which might be able to somewhat alleviate the impact from using air temperature. Unfortunately the models could not be tested with observed canopy temperature as it was not measured continuously throughout the growing season. 
    <xref rid="pcx141-B135" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Webber et al. (2015)</xref> concluded that a more systematically understanding of heat stress events and how to model them is needed.

    <xref rid="pcx141-B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Avnery et al. 2011</xref>). However, the negative effects of ozone are included only in a few crop models. For example, the WOFOST model accounts for ozone damage to crops by using a flux-based approach in which the ozone flux inside the plant is regulated by the stomatal conductance (
    <xref rid="pcx141-B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cappelli et al. 2016</xref>). The model shows that for wheat there are large yield losses under high ozone exposure (i.e. up to 30% loss for ozone concentration of 60 ppb; 
    <xref rid="pcx141-B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cappelli et al. 2016</xref>). While the effects of ozone on plant biology have been extensively studied, the effect of pollution on crop productivity and quality is an important area for future work, particularly as global ozone concentrations are projected to remain at high levels (
    <xref rid="pcx141-B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fowler et al. 2008</xref>). The responses of plants to atmospheric ozone should be assessed in combination with other stresses to address current as well as the future responses under climate change.
