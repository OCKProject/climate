  <p class="p">Current maize growing areas (blue), together with predicted abandoned (red) and added (green) maize growing areas by 2100. Gray shade shows the areas that are not used for producing the specific crop. The ‘No change’ scenario (A) is the extrapolation of the current trends with no major GHG emission reductions or no major changes in dietary trends that would result in an increasing need for maize production. The ‘Major change’ scenario (B) will be attained if successful GHG mitigation policies are enforced and significant health-driven changes in diets occur that result in a decreasing need for maize production.</p>
