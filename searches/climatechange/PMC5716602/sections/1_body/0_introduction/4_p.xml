<p class="p">Studies on adult stages of CCA show that elevated temperature exacerbates the negative impacts of OA causing tissue bleaching and mortality in tropical and temperate CCA [

 <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. However, it is unknown whether the effects of climate change stressors differ between the early and adult life history stages of reef-building coralline algae. In this study we first ask the question whether spore germination and early settlement of the key reef-building alga 
 <italic class="italic">Porolithon</italic> cf. 
 <italic class="italic">onkodes</italic> is sensitive to climate changes stressors, and secondly we ask whether the effects of pCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> on the CCA are exacerbated by the interactions with increased seawater temperature and irradiance. To address these questions we conducted manipulative (factorial) experiments with different pCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, temperature and irradiance levels using a flow-through experimental system at Heron Island on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia.
