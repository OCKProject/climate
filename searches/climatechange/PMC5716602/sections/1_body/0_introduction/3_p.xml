<p class="p">Ocean acidification (OA) is a global problem caused by increased carbon dioxide (CO

 <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. OA reduces net calcification rates and can cause skeletal dissolution in many calcifying organisms including corals [

 <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] and CCA [

 <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. The skeletons of CCA are mainly composed of high-magnesium (High-Mg) calcite, a carbonate mineral form more soluble than the aragonite of corals [
 <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], making CCA among the calcifying organisms most sensitive to OA [

 <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Although responses of CCA to OA appear to vary between species [

 <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Importantly, laboratory and field experiments show a reduction in the abundance of recruitment of CCA in response to elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, and it has been proposed that space competition with fleshy seaweeds is a major driver of the observed recruitment failure [
 <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>,

 <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. An alternative hypothesis is that OA directly reduces germination rates of early life stages of CCA, which has a negative implication for recruitment success. However, it is unknown whether spore germination of reef-building CCA is sensitive to elevated pCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and how climate change stressors independently, and in interaction with other environmental factors, affect the supply-side ecology of CCA [
