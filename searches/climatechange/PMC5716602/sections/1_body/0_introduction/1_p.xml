<p class="p">The persistence of marine benthic populations depends on the success of reproduction and early life history processes, such as fecundity, spore/gamete release, germination, settlement, and recruitment [

 <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Therefore, understanding how global climate change affects marine populations requires consideration of the ecology of early stage processes. Our study focuses on the process of algal germination, which in the broader sense is defined as the stage after attachment in which a germ starts to sprout, grow and develop [

 <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Following spore maturation within the reproductive structures, spores are released to the external environment where they attach to the substrate and germinate. Subsequent cell division occurs, a germination disk is formed, and in the case of calcifying red algae, calcification takes place further cementing the crusts to the substrate, completing the settlement process [

 <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Germlings and propagules are the stages most susceptible to mortality in many marine organisms life history because they can be killed by extreme habitat conditions or overgrown by other organisms, creating bottlenecks for marine populations [

Despite the fundamental importance of early life stages to most marine organisms, there is a critical knowledge gap of the interactive effects of climate change stressors (ocean acidification and warming) with other environmental factors on the development of marine algae (e.g. [
