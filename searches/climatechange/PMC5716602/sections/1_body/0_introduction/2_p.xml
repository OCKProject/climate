<p class="p">Crustose coralline algae (CCA) are a group of calcifying red algae that play several important roles in marine ecosystems. CCA are a major calcifying component of the marine benthos, contributing to the formation and growth of tropical and temperate reefs worldwide through deposition of calcium carbonate (CaCO
