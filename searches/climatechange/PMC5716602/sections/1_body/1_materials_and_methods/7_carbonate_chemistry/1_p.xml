<p class="p">Total alkalinity was measured for seawater sampled every six hours for 24 hours from the six sumps and one experimental tank of the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> x temperature treatment combination. One sample per sump, time and treatment combination was taken. Total alkalinity was measured using Gran titration with an open-cell potentiometric titrator (model T50 Mettler-Toledo). Subsamples (2–3) were run until a maximum 1% error was met. Results from sumps and tanks were compared to explore any potential contribution from algal metabolism to changes in carbonate chemistry, and no significant differences were found (Student’s t-test, p = 0.611,
