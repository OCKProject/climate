<p class="p">Germination was quantified using two complementary metrics: 
 <italic class="italic">germination success</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">germling growth rate</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">Spore germination success</italic> was measured on 10 randomly selected spores from the microscopic field previously delimited on the petri dish by estimating the percentage of spores that successfully formed a germination disc. This estimate was recorded 48 (Â±3) hrs following the first observation of spore attachment (T0). Photographs taken between T0 and the final time (at 48 hr) were used to document spore development but not used in the quantification (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189122.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). Because the number of spores varied considerably among microscopic fields (e.g. 10 to 60), and the process of germination occurring rapidly in our experimental species, we limited our observations to 10 spores in one microscopic field. 
 <italic class="italic">Germling growth rate</italic> was estimated by the change in surface area of 5 individual germlings (spores) over a period of 48 hrs beginning at T0. A considerable number of spores coalesced during the course of the experiment (process not quantified in this study) and this limited the number of individual spores that could be followed effectively through time because the margin of the individual crusts fused with others.
