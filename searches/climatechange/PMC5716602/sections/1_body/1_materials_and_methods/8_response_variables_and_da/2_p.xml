<p class="p">In addition to germination metrics, we also quantified the 
 <italic class="italic">percentage of abnormalities</italic> in germling development and this was assessed by calculating the proportion of germlings with abnormal cell divisions or sizes in a subsample of 10 spores. Normal development in this study refers to germlings whose cell divisions were clearly observed and followed a circular symmetry (especially during the first cell divisions) as described by Chihara [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189122.g002" class="xref">Fig 2A</xref>). Coralline algal spores follow a characteristic pattern of cell division to form a germination disc that is symmetrical and clearly visible even after few days of development (Chamberlain 1993). This characteristic pattern was considered “normal development” in this study. Finally, we calculated the 
 <italic class="italic">Change of percent area covered</italic> by germlings: due to the coalescence of many germlings we were unable to continue measuring individual germling growth rate as the experiment progressed, therefore we additionally estimated the changes in total percent cover of the CCA population by measuring total area covered by all spores (coalescent and single spores) on the first day and fourth day of the experiment; data were normalized to initial cover to obtain a percentage. At the end of the experiment, photographs were analysed using Image J software (University of Wisconsin-Madison).
