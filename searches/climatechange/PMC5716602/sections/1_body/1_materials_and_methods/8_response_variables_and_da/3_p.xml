For germling growth rates, five germlings were measured per experimental tank, and values averaged per tank. When significant interactions occurred among factors, we conducted additional 2-way and one-way ANOVAs within treatment combinations [

Data normality and homogeneity of variance were tested using Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Cochranâ€™s test respectively. Data were arc-sin transformed to meet criteria prior the analyses.
