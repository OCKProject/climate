<p class="p">Three replicate tanks, initially containing three individual adult thalli in each tank and later containing the spores of these adults were randomly allocated to each treatment combination of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (three levels), temperature (two levels) and irradiance (two levels). There were a total of 12 treatment combinations and 36 experimental tanks. pCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and temperature were manipulated into 120 L mixing sumps (6 sumps: 3 CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> levels x 2 temperature levels) and treated seawater was then continuously pumped into the experimental tanks at a rate of 500 mL min
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup>. The sumps were constantly fed with filtered seawater drawn from the Heron Island reef lagoon. Two types of filters were used: a hand-made sand filter containing a cotton filter mat and a house water filter OMNI OPAQUE with a 5 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>m cartridge to avoid contamination by spores from other algae coming from the reef lagoon. This way we excluded competing organisms such as filamentous algae during the experiment.
