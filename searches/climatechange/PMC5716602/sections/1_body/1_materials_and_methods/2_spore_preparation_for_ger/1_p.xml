<p class="p">To obtain spores for the germination experiments we induced the release of spores following a combination of methods described in Jones and Moorjani [
 <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], Ichiki et al. [

 <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>], however we did not quantify the actual release of spores or reproductive output of the experimental CCA. Fertile CCA were placed in a shallow tray without water in a dark cold room (18°C) for 30 min. Sterilized seawater was then added to the tray so that individuals were submerged (ca. 2 cm depth); individuals were then exposed to artificial halide and blue lights (160 μmol. photons m
 <sup class="sup">-2</sup> s
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup>) for a period of 7 hours. After this period the majority of CCA began releasing tetraspores, and at this stage (i.e. onset of spore release), the adults with spores released on their surface were gently transferred to each experimental tank (1L plastic tanks) in which they were exposed to the experimental CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, temperature and light conditions. Adults continue to release spores in the experimental tanks. We used three adult CCA fragments (belonging to different individual thalli) per experimental tank, to guarantee the availability of sufficient number of spores to commence the germination trials. Polystyrene, transparent petri dishes (94 mm × 16 mm diameter) positioned at the bottom of each experimental tank were used as a substrate for spore settlement and to facilitate manipulation when viewed under the microscope. Water flow produced by the incoming water into the experimental tanks (500 mL min–1) was sufficient to disperse spores on the petri dishes. After placing the adults in the tanks, 8 randomly selected petri dishes were examined every hour during 3–4 hrs for spore attachment and initial stages of cell division, indicative of the onset of germination. Attachment was recognised by the presence of a halo (mucus) surrounding the spore [
 <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] and by gently brushing the spores to ensure spores did not detach easily. Commencement of the first cell division was initially detected in some spores at ca. 3–4 hours, and at this moment, adults were removed from the tank and a representative area on the petri dish was delimited and photographed using an Olympus digital camera DP72 mounted on a compound Microscope Olympus BX5 using a 10x objective lenses (the area of the microscope field analysed was 3.8mm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) for further analysis (this corresponded to T0 for our germination measurements, see below). Subsequent photographs of the same marked area were taken every 6 to 12 hrs for two days to study germination (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189122.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>), and then every 24 hrs for additional two days for further population analyses. This photographic sequence allowed us to follow the development of individual spores through time. Adults were removed from the tanks to minimise a mixture of spores with different ontogenetic stages at the commencement of the measurements (see below), particularly since spore release under laboratory conditions is not synchronous among conceptacles (per. obs.). Despite removing the adults, the total number of spores varied across the experimental tanks at the beginning of the experiment (e.g. 10 to 60 spores were counted in microscopic fields of 3.8mm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>).
