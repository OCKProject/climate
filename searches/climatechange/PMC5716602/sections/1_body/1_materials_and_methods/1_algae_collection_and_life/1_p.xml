<p class="p">To investigate the effects of ocean acidification, temperature and irradiance on the germination of the CCA 
 <italic class="italic">Porolithon</italic> cf. 
 <italic class="italic">onkodes</italic>, we conducted multifactorial (orthogonal) laboratory manipulations of the three factors at Heron Island Research Station (HIRS), Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia. 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. cf. 
 <italic class="italic">onkodes</italic> was chosen because it is one of the most important reef-building CCA species in tropical regions [
 <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] and is common in shallow GBR reefs [
 <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>], especially around Heron Island [
 <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. The algal collection and experiments were conducted in February-March 2014 during the summer season, which is when 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. cf. 
 <italic class="italic">onkodes</italic> is more reproductive [
 <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Fertile fragments (3 x 3 cm) of tetrasporophytic plants were collected from the shallow reef crest (ca 5 m depth at highest tide) at Harry’s Bommie (Heron Island, GBR, 23°.27ˈ.631ˈˈS, 151°.55 ˈ.798 ˈˈE) using hammer and chisel. Fragments were transported to HIRS, carefully cleaned of epiphytes or other organisms and rinsed with sterilized seawater before spore release was induced. Algal collections were conducted under permit G12/34877.1 granted by Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.
