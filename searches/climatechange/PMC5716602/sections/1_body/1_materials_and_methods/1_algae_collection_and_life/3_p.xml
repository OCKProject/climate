<p class="p">Fertile plants used in the experiment corresponded to the tetrasporophytic phase, which is a phase of their diplohaplontic and isomorphic (“Polysiphonia type”) sexual life cycle [
 <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. This means that the tetrasporangial plants (or tetrasporophytes, diploid, 2n) are morphologically similar to the gametangial plants (gametophytes, haploid, n). There is a further microscopic stage that develops inside the reproductive structure of a fertilized female plant (called the carposporophyte stage, which produces carpospores). Tetrasporophytic plants (2n) produce tetraspores (n) that are released to the environment and develop into haploid gamete-producing plants (n), the gametophytes (female or male). Tetraspores were the subject of this investigation. Coralline algae also have an asexual life cycle in which the tetrasporophytic plants produce self-perpetuating bisporangia. However, bisporangia were not observed in our samples.
