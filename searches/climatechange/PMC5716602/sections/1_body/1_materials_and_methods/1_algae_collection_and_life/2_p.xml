 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. cf. 
 <italic class="italic">onkodes</italic> (Heydrich) Foslie is an encrusting coralline alga, with a smooth surface and granular appearance due to the presence of numerous tightly packed mega cells in horizontal fields (trichocytes fields), reproductive structures are contained in small, flush or slightly raised unipored conceptacles, cells are connected by fusions and thallus organization is non-coaxial [

 <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. We have further used the colour of specimens in the field to make sure we were collecting the same species. Our specimens were pink-orange in colour. Our field observations and molecular work (in progress) indicate that crusts’ colour (for specimens occurring in the same light environment) can assist in the selection of samples to be collected to ensure that individuals of the same species are used in the experiment. Until the taxonomy of the 
 <italic class="italic">Porolithon “onkodes”</italic> group is not resolved (e.g. [
 <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]), we prefer to use 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. cf. 
 <italic class="italic">onkodes</italic> for our experimental species.
