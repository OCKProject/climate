<p class="p">Tetrasporophytic plants were recognised in the laboratory by removing the roof of the reproductive structures (conceptacles) using a blade and checking for the presence of tetraspores (zonately arranged spores). Carpospores are not zonately divided and are much larger than tetraspores (individual tetraspores measure 15â€“20 um), and conceptacles of male and female gametophytes produce spermatangia and carpogonia respectively, reproductive structures that are very different morphologically and anatomically to the tetrasporophytic structures [
