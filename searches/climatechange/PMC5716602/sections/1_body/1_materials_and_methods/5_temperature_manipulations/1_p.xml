<p class="p">Two temperature levels were used: ambient control (25–27°C) and elevated temperature (27–29°C), representing two degrees above the average maximum summer temperature in the study area. Temperature was manipulated in the mixing sumps using aquarium heaters (Heater Jager 250W). In addition to monitoring pH and temperature using the Aquatronica system, both parameters were checked in twelve randomly selected experimental tanks every day for three days using a portable pH and temperature meter (Meter Toledo portable watertight IP67 dual-channel meter). This was to ensure pH and temperature constancy in experimental tanks compared to sumps during the experiment.</p>
