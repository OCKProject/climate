<p class="p">Artificial halide lights (OCEANLIGHT PLUS 1X150W+2T5 24W) provided a 12h light: 12h dark photoperiod. Two irradiance treatment levels were used: high irradiance (140–160 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>mol photons m
 <sup class="sup">-2</sup> s
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup>) and low irradiance (40–60 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>mol photons m
 <sup class="sup">-2</sup> s
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup>); the latter achieved using a black mesh placed over experimental tanks. In Heron island, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. cf. 
 <italic class="italic">onkodes</italic> can be found in a wide range of irradiances and depths in the fore-reef (Ringeltaube and Harvey [
 <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] and per. obs.), from the intertidal to 8–10 m depth. We have recorded large variation in irradiance intensity in the fore-reef of the study site, from 800 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>mol photons m
 <sup class="sup">-2</sup> s
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> in the intertidal to 50 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>mol photons m
 <sup class="sup">-2</sup> s
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> at 8 m during sunny summer days. The irradiance levels used in our experiment mimic two light environments in which 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. cf. 
 <italic class="italic">onkodes</italic> can occur at a depth of 5–6 m: well-lit areas (140–160 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>mol photons m
 <sup class="sup">-2</sup> s
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup>) and low irradiance microhabitats such as crevices (40–60 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>mol photons m
 <sup class="sup">-2</sup> s
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup>)(per. obs.). All specimens used in the experiment were collected approximately at 6m from well-lit microhabitats. Light measurements in the reef and in the experiment were taken using the underwater quantum sensor LI-192 connected to the light meter LI-250A from LI-COR.
