The aquarium control system (Aquatronica, AEB technologies, Italy) was used to monitor the seawater pH using temperature compensated pH electrodes (Mettler-Toledo, inPro4501VP), and temperature every 30 seconds within the mixing sumps. pH and temperature were also monitored in one experimental tank. When seawater pH in the mixing sumps exceeded the desired threshold, the control system opened solenoid valves to inject pCO
