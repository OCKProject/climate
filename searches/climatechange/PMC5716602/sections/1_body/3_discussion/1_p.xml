<p class="p">Our study is the first to explore factor interactions in early life stages of CCA in the context of OA research and provides experimental evidence that increasing pCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/low pH may affect germination of a major reef-building organism, both directly and in combination with other climate change and environmental factors. The effects of pCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> on spore abnormalities and growth are stronger than the effects and interactions of the other factors we examined. This provides empirical support to a body of work that suggests a vulnerability of germlings and propagules of other groups of marine organisms to climate change (reviewed in [

 <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>], our results highlight the importance of studying not only adults but other stages of the life cycle to better understand the impacts of ocean acidification and warming on reef-building processes and reef resilience. CCA play critical roles in reef cementation and induction of coral larval settlement, therefore, a disruption of CCA germination and growth may impair reef stability and recovery potential as the oceans continue to acidify and warm in the future.
