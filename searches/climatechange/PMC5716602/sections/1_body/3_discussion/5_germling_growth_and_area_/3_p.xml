<p class="p">Variation in irradiance played a minor direct role in germling growth compared to the effects of pCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and temperature, however, irradiance interacted with the climate stressors to determine the direction and magnitude of the CCA responses. High irradiance slightly enhanced individual growth by 14%. This is not surprising as

 <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref076" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>] findings. However, when temperature was increased, the direction of the response shifted enhancing algal growth rates, both under ambient CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and high CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, alleviating the negative impacts of ocean acidification. As explained before, temperature may have accelerated physiological processes which could explain these results. Our study, once again, highlights the importance of considering multiple factors when studying the response to different environmental stressors.
