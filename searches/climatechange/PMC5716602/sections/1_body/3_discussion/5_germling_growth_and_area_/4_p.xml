<p class="p">Our study focussed on germination, an important process in the supply-side ecology of coralline algae. There are other early life history processes that may also be sensitive to the impacts of OA and that may exert considerable control on population and community structure of reef building CCA, but that have not been considered in the context of ocean acidification and climate change research. These include fecundity or reproductive output [

Information on the direction and magnitude of the responses of these processes to environmental stressors will enable a better understanding of CCA dynamics. For instance, coalescence in seaweeds (a process observed but not quantified in our experimental CCA germlings) has been suggested to enhance growth on some fleshy macroalgae, potentially conferring adaptive advantages to populations of coalescing seaweeds [
