<p class="p">Importantly, we provide a mechanistic understanding of how recruitment failure occurs in CCA in response to OA. Elevated pCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> reduces the rate of spore germination and growth, and produces abnormalities in recently germinated spores, independently of space competition with other organisms such as filamentous and fleshy algae, as suggested by earlier research [

 <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. The formation of the germination disc and the development of spore cells, as well as the growth of germlings are all directly and negatively impacted by ocean acidification. Post-germination processes, such as the growth of germlings, however, increased with moderate pCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> enrichment, suggesting that different aspects of the early life stages of CCA respond differently to environmental stressors, and that moderate CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> increases may benefit growth of CCA juveniles. Our study isolated the effects of spore germination from space competition by filamentous algae as potential drivers of recruitment failure in CCA exposed to ocean acidification. However, filamentous algae can indirectly affect CCA spores, either positively (e.g. [

 <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]) or negatively (e.g. [

 <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]). Therefore, future studies should consider the relative contribution of space competition by filamentous algae and spore germination on CCA recruitment, preferably in natural habitats where the natural variability in ecological processes can be considered, variability that cannot be incorporated in laboratory experiments.
