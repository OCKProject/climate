<p class="p">In conclusion, independently from other factors, elevated pCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> has a strong negative effect directly on spore germination of the reef-building coralline alga 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. cf. 
 <italic class="italic">onkodes</italic>. It decreases spore germination success, generates abnormalities and hampers growth rates (although moderate pCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> increase enhances growth). However, irradiance and temperature could intensify these effects. Our paper provides a mechanistic understanding of the likely causes of recruitment failure in CCA when exposed to OA, and identifies spore germination as a key process highly sensitive to the impacts of elevated pCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Subsequent competition for space with filamentous algae may exacerbate the negative effects of OA on recruitment (but see Short et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0189122.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]). Our results have also underlined the critical importance of simultaneously studying the effects of multiple stressors related to global environmental change, not only on the adult phase, but also on other stages of the life cycle of marine organisms. The influence of different environmental factors on the early stages of CCA will not only be reflected on adult populations and their communities, but on the role that these organisms play in coral reefs ecosystems.
