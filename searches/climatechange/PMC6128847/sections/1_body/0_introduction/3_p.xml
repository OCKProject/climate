<p id="Par4" class="p">To analyze the potential synergistic impacts of climate change on pollutant bioaccumulation, we simulated forward-looking scenarios for the bioaccumulation of MeHg and PCBs (i.e. as the sum of congeners, ∑PCB; please see Supplementary Information) in a regional marine food web in the Northeastern Pacific (Supplementary Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>) by using the Ecotracer module in Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) (see Methods; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). The model accounts for the flow of biomasses and contaminants across 20 species groups in the ecosystem through their trophic interactions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>), and includes the mean temperature tolerance (MTT) in marine invertebrates and fish (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>) and contaminant input data (Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>), but it does not account for some pollutant biogeochemical processes such as PCB cycling and increased rates of mercury methylation in a warming environment. We hypothesize that bioaccumulation of organic pollutants, specifically MeHg and PCBs, can be amplified in the food web by climate change and that the level of bioamplification may vary between different pollutants.
