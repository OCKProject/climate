<p id="Par5" class="p">Interactions between biogeochemical climate change drivers and pollutants were modelled through deterministic simulations under climate change forcing scenarios, including Representative Concentrations Pathway (i.e. RCP 2.6-‘strong mitigation’/low CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions and RCP 8.5-‘business-as-usual’/high CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions), and compared against a reference baseline (control) scenario with no-climate change forcing, i.e. no changes in CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> levels and biogeochemical variables from the present conditions (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Our model represented the effects of the changes in sea surface temperature, dissolved oxygen level and pH (i.e. ocean acidification) on the metabolic efficiency of functional groups, resulting in increased or decreased biological productivity (see Supplementary Information). Metabolic efficiency was determined by the ratio of consumption to production of each functional group that changed dynamically as trophic interactions were modified by the climatic forcing. Projected changes in primary production were represented by changing phytoplankton biomass (i.e. phytoplankton forcing function under either RCP 2.6 or RCP 8.5) in the ecosystem model (see Supplementary Information). Changes in ocean variables were based on outputs from the NOAA’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamic Laboratory Earth System Model 2M (NOAA-GFDL ESM2M) (see Methods; Supplementary Information; Figs
