<p id="Par6" class="p">We accounted for model uncertainties associated with the biases between observed and predicted contaminant levels as well as the internal variability of the projections (Supplementary Information; Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S7</xref>). Specifically, model bias (

 <italic class="italic">MB</italic> standard deviation (i.e. 
 <italic class="italic">MB</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">SD</italic>
 </sub>, an indicator of variability and uncertainty of trophodynamic model predictions) were calculated by using projections of historical concentrations of PCBs and MeHg (i.e. from 1930–2010) simulated in southern resident killer whales, 
 <italic class="italic">Orcinus orca</italic> (SRKW hereafter), and Chinook salmon (
 <italic class="italic">Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</italic>) with Ecotracer, and empirical PCB data reported for these species (see Methods; Supplementary Information). This is done by comparing the simulated contaminant data to the empirical contaminant data observed in these species to test the performance of the modelling approach and reveal any underlying variations linked to contaminant concentrations and lipid content reported in the literature.
