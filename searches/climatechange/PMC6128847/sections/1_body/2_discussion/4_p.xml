<p id="Par19" class="p">The increase in projected MeHg concentrations observed in salmon and SRKW can be explained by the continuous accumulation of MeHg through diet combined with a slow elimination and also a long biological half-life in these animals

 </sup>. Mercury concentrations in large predatory fish and cetaceans are strongly influenced by the length of and changes in structure of the food web

 </sup>. Moreover, low trophic level organisms from coastal-marine food webs can play a crucial role in the trophic transfer of MeHg, as climate change can increase its exposure and enhance the MeHg bioaccumulation factor in zooplankton by a factor of 2 to 7, as reported by Jonsson

 </sup>. Here, we demonstrated that bioaccumulation in zooplankton increases by 3% under RCP 2.6 and by 12% under RCP 8.5 relative to the reference baseline (control) scenario (i.e. no climate change) for the simulation period 2005–2099 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2B</xref>). The increase in MeHg concentration in zooplankton is much higher (i.e. 9.5% for RCP 2.6 and 22% for RCP 8.5) at the end of the century (i.e. simulation period 2070–2099; see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2A</xref>).
