 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref> for input data and references). MeHg biogeochemistry was not directly accounted in the model. Water column and sediment MeHg concentrations can be changed by SST, pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration (e.g., photodegradation rate formation/reductions rates of MeHg)
