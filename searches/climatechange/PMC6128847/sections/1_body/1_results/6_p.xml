<p id="Par12" class="p">Similar to Chinook salmon, the contribution of Chinook salmon as the major prey item of SRWK, through which most of PCBs and MeHg intake is from, is projected to decrease from 90% in 2005 to 86.7% by 2100 under RCP 2.6; however, Chinook salmon remains relatively constant as a prey (~90%) under RCP 8.5. For the secondary prey of SRKWs, chum salmon (

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S8</xref> (Supporting Information) shows that the RCP 8.5/RCP 2.6 ratio for Coho salmon dwindles from 1.0 at the initial time of simulation to 0.3 by 2100 (i.e. 70% reduction).
