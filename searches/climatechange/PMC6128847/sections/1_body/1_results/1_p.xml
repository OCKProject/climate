<p id="Par7" class="p">Our model projected climate-amplification of MeHg concentrations in the food web, with varying sensitivities among functional groups (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1A–F</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Average concentrations of MeHg were higher under both RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 by the 2080 s (average of 2070–2099, representing the end of the 21
