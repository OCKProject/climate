 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Specifically, the significant contribution of MeHg of squid under RCP 8.5 is further compensated by the increased bioaccumulation of other functional groups (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) serving as prey items for Chinook salmon (Fig.
