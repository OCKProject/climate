<p id="Par9" class="p">In contrast to MeHg, although PCB concentrations were also projected to be amplified by climate change, the level of amplification was lower under the higher emission RCP 8.5 scenario (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3A–F</xref>). Average PCB concentrations from 2070–2099 under the ‘strong mitigation’ (RCP 2.6) and ‘business-as-usual’ (RCP 8.5) scenarios were 40 and 20%, respectively, higher for all functional groups relative to the reference scenario (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4A</xref>). However, except for killer whales, amplifications of bioaccumulation of PCBs in most other species groups were projected to be lower by 2090 under RCP 8.5 relative to RCP 2.6. For instance, from 2005–2099, the average (±95% CI) percent increases in PCBs under each scenario were 17.5% (±1.41%) and 10% (±0.84%) in Chinook salmon under RCP 2.6 an RCP 8.5 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>), respectively. In contrast, PCBs concentration in SRKW increases by 0.35% (±0.23%) and 3.0% (±0.17%) in SRKW under the low and high emission scenarios, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4B</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>).
