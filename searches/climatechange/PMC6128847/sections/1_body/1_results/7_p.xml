<p id="Par13" class="p">The trophic magnification factor (TMF; see Methods) was calculated as metric of biomagnification for PCBs and MeHg in the food web for the entire simulation period subject to climate change forcing. A significant increase in predicted log-PCB and log-MeHg concentrations correlated with trophic level for both RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 scenarios (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5A–D</xref>) was predicted. The TMF of PCB and MeHg under RCP 2.6, RCP 8.5 and the no climate change scenarios was significantly greater than one (TMF &gt; 1), i.e. 4.99–5.30 for PCBs; and, 52.4–53.1 for MeHg across the climate change scenarios (Supplementary Table
