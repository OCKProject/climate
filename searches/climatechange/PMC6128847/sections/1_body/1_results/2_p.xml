<p id="Par8" class="p">Amongst the functional groups, MeHg bioaccumulation in Chinook salmon and SRKW (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1E,F</xref>) is more sensitive to climate change (i.e. species-specific response to the effect of climate change forcing) relative to other lower trophic level groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1A–D</xref>). While Chinook salmon showed high concentration pulses under RCP 8.5, SRKW exhibited an increasing, smooth trend in MeHg concentrations until reaching steady state toward the end of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1F</xref>). Although MeHg concentrations tend to reach steady state in plankton over time, the projections for other low trophic level species unveiled increasing concentrations at the very beginning of the simulation, followed by a rapid decline with temporal pulses in the long term (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1A–E</xref>).
