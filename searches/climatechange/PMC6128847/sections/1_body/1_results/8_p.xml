<p id="Par14" class="p">While the TMF values for MeHg were higher than those for PCBs (i.e. average MeHg-TMF/PCBs-TMF ratio ≈ 10), TMFs were basically similar under the RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 scenarios as well as under the no climate change scenario for either PCBs or MeHg, as shown in Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S8</xref>. These findings suggest the lack of attributable effects by climate change on TMFs in the simulations for this particular food web despite the increasing changes projected across most species groups, under the influence climate change forcing (Figs
