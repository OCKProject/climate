<p id="Par11" class="p">While projected PCB concentrations in phytoplankton, zooplankton, forage fish, and squid displayed large temporal variations under long-term climate signals (RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5) with positive trends towards the end of the century under changes in sea surface temperature and net primary production (Supplementary Figs S4 and S5; Supplementary Information), fluctuation in PCB concentrations were not projected (i.e. steady state) under the no climate change scenario, i.e. reference baseline (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3A–D</xref>). Conversely, Chinook salmon (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3E</xref>) exhibited an initial, moderate period of decreasing concentrations (i.e. over 2005–2010) followed by a slight increasing trend in PCB concentrations after 2050. Such non-linear trend is driven by an initial decrease in dietary intake of more PCB-contaminated forage fish and squid, both of which also exhibit relatively higher PCB concentrations over the 2050–2010 period (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3C,D</xref>). In the long term, the simulations show increases in squid biomass (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S6</xref>), and thus, in prey for Chinook salmon (i.e. the % of squid as prey increased from ~10% in 2005 to &gt;20–30% by 2100 under RCP 8.5) although the availability of forage fish continue to decrease (as % of prey, forage fish decreased from 33% in 2005 to &gt;20–30% by 2090–2100 under RCP 8.5; Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S6</xref>). The percent of prey consumed by Chinook salmon under RCP 2.6 is relatively constant over the simulation period (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S7</xref>) in comparison to the prey proportion under RCP 8.5 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S6</xref>).
