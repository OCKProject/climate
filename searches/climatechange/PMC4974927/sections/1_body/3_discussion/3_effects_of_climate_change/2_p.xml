<p class="p">Further, our study shows that the lost habitat for some species is not at the edge of distributions but mainly in the core (central) region of their ranges (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-5" class="xref">Fig. S3</xref>). The core distribution region is very important for a species because it acts as a hub that connects patches, allowing the genetic exchange between different populations. Habitat loss and fragmentation have been identified as one of the major causes of amphibian decline globally (
 <xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Stuart et al., 2004</xref>). Our study shows that future climate change might not only reduce the range of some amphibians, but also make it more fragmented. This finding is similar to that reported for amphibians in other regions (
 <xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mokhatla, RÃ¶dder &amp; Measey, 2015</xref>). The observed synergic effect would accelerate the decline and/or local extinction of certain amphibians (e.g. 
 <italic class="italic">Amolops ricketti</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Pachytriton labiatus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Megophrys minor</italic>). On the other hand, species predicted to undergo area expansion such as 
 <italic class="italic">Hynobius leechii</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Hylarana macrodactyla</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Fejervarya multistriata</italic> were not affected by fragmentation, which would benefit them and allow them to expand more easily.
