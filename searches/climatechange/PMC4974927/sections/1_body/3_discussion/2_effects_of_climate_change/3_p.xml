<p class="p">Organisms often show species-specific environmental requirements and global climate change has different effects on the ranges of different species. For example, 
 <xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lawler et al. (2010)</xref> predict that amphibian species in several areas in Central and western South America would experience high species turnover and would experience larger range contractions by 2071. 
 <xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Li et al. (2013)</xref> assess the vulnerability of 208 endemic or endangered species (including 13 amphibians) in China and predict that climate-induced shifts in ranges will lead 50% of species to undergo range reduction another half to increase range. 
 <xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Foden et al. (2013)</xref> document that 11–15% of amphibians, 6–9% of birds and 6–9% of coral species are highly vulnerable to climate change. Our study confirmed that the responses of amphibians to future climate change are complex: some species will undergo distribution reduction, whereas others will expand their ranges. Following our results, amphibians that move westwards (drier habitats), southwards (warmer habitats) and to higher altitudes will undergo distribution reduction. The main reason may be that compared with the original habitats of amphibians, there are fewer suitable habitats in the west and south parts of China where there are many mountains.
