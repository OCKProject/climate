<p class="p">The average temperature of the earth’s surface will rise by up to 6.4 °C by 2100, and species would thus need to migrate to higher latitudes and/or elevations following their climatic requirements (

 <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Raxworthy et al., 2008</xref>). When temperature undergoes one degree change, elevation needs to change 100–200 m and latitude about 0.5° (about 55 km of polar movement, though latitude has a complex and variable relationship with temperature) (
 <xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Peterson &amp; Vose, 1997</xref>). Our study confirmed these general trends and that under climate warming the suitable habitat of Chinese amphibians will predominantly migrate to higher altitudes and latitudes, which has the same movement direction reported for amphibians in other regions (

However, the direction and speed of migration depend on the climate scenario and species modelled.
