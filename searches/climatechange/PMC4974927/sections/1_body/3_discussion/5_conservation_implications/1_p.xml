 <xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dâ€™Amen et al., 2011</xref>). Distribution shift, habitat loss and fragmentation caused by climatic change are the potential threats to amphibians in China, and the current network of natural reserves does not include some key regions for amphibians. In addition, many existing nature reserves have not sufficient to prevent amphibians from declining from threats of climatic change because their conservation objects and policies are not for amphibians, though they have a key role in protect amphibians. We should protect the amphibians under the climate change with the following strategies. First, we need to develop a conservation plan to estab1ish a network of national reserves covering populations of all threatened amphibian species in China. Second, we need to implement conservation action plans in all currently existing reserves to maintain viable populations and protect the habits for some vulnerable species with high habit loss (e.g.
