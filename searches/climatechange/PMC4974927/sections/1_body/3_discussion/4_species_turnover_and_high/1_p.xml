 <xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Peterson et al., 2002</xref>), however our results revealed that areas with high turnover ratios were not the same as areas with high turnover sums. This is because an area with a low turnover sum can have a high turnover ratio if the area has a very low species richness under the current climate (e.g. northwestern China). We considered grid cells with turnover ratios greater than 50% and turnover sums greater than 20 as areas of potentially large future shifts in amphibians. We found several such areas including the Sichuan Basin and surrounding areas, the Qinling Mountains, the Dabie Mountains, the Wuyi Mountains and western Guizhou, and hypothesize that these regions may see major shifts in amphibians as a result of the combined action of several factors. First, the Sichuan Basin and surrounding areas, western Guizhou province and Dabie Mountains are located in an area of transition from the northern subtropics to warm temperate climate; there are relatively large climatic gradients in these areas (

 <xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fei et al., 2009</xref>); areas containing many range limits are expected to experience greater turnover than those containing few range limits. Third, mountainous regions, such as the Qinling Mountains form a natural (north or south) boundary for many species and so may experience significant faunal change. Under climate change, habitat loss, especially that resulting from changes to freshwater ecosystems, is the greatest risk to amphibians (
