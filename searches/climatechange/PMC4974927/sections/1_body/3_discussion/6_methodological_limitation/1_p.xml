<p class="p">Our models assume that only climatic variables affect species range, and that all species have the potential to migrate to areas climatically suitable for them. Many important factors such as vegetation canopy, land use, movement barriers, mountain topography and biological characteristics of focal species were not taken into account. Our results therefore simplify the real effects of climate change because amphibians in nature are affected by numerous biotic and abiotic factors (

However, this simple picture does provide useful information on the potential effects of future climate change on Chinese amphibians, and their possible trends of migration. Our study is the first to investigate how Chinese amphibians would respond to future climate change.
