 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>). Areas with the highest 
 <italic class="italic">TR</italic> are located in Northwest China where amphibian species richness is lower. Areas with high 
 <italic class="italic">TS</italic> are located in Central and Southern China and these areas were inconsistent with areas of high

 <italic class="italic">TR</italic> &gt; 50% and 
 <italic class="italic">TS</italic> &gt; 20) (one-half of its maximum value as the criterion), climate strongly influenced amphibian distributions in five regions: the Qinling Mountains, Wuyi Mountains, Dabie Mountains, Sichuan Basin and surrounding areas, and western Guizhou province (
