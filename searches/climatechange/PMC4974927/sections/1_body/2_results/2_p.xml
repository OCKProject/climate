<p class="p">The suitable habitat of the majority of species (92.5% in the 2050s, and 91.8% in the 2070s) will move northwards (mean latitude increased), with a mean latitude shift of 0.60° by the 2050s and 0.83° by the 2070s (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" class="xref">Fig. 2A</xref>). The suitable habitat of the majority of species (76.9% in the 2050s, and 84.3% in the 2070s) will move westwards (mean longitude will decrease) across all future scenarios ranging from 0.03–4.51° (mean 1.35°) in the 2050s, and from 0.03–6.87° (mean 1.72°) in the 2070s. The number of species with the furthest longitudinal movement (more than 0.5° and more than 1°) are 75 and 56 in the 2050s, respectively, and 84 and 68 in the 2070s (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" class="xref">Fig. 2B</xref>). Virtually all species (95.5% in the 2050s, and 97.0% in the 2070s) will move to higher altitudes under climate change (from currently 137–4,124 m to 286–4,396 m in the 2050s or 314–4,448 m in the 2070s), with a mean range shift of 287.2 m by the 2050s and 387.8 m by the 2070s (
