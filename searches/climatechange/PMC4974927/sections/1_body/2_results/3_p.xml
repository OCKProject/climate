<p class="p">Area change will vary from −52.8–324.5% by the 2050s and from −57.6–418.1% by the 2070s. The 70.9% of species in the 2050s (38.1% for area contraction and 32.8% for area expansion) and 75.4% of species in the 2070s (37.3% for area contraction and 38.1% for area expansion) will undergo a significant change in distribution of greater than 10% (
