 <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Raxworthy et al., 2008</xref>) and significant species turnover (
 <xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Peterson et al., 2002</xref>), but few considered the effect of climate change on fragmentation of current species populations. Here we used MaxEnt (a common SDM) and 40 climate scenarios to study the effect of different greenhouse gas scenarios on the distribution of amphibians in China, assuming that species have no limits to dispersal such that its future distribution becomes the entire area projected by the species distribution model. Our aims are: (1) to quantify the effect of current global warming on Chinese amphibians via potential range shifts, the directions of predicted range shifts and fragmentation of future predicted distributions; (2) calculate the temporal turnover of species composition; and (3) identify priority areas for amphibian conservation across China.
