<p class="p">The prediction of climate-driven shifts in species’ potential ranges under future climate scenarios relies on the application of species distribution models (SDMs) (

 <xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Eskildsen et al., 2013</xref>). SDMs use current climate data to model species’ existing distributions, and forecast potential future distributions under various climate scenarios, assuming that species can follow future climate envelopes (
 <xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Elith &amp; Leathwick, 2009</xref>). These models are needed to understand the possible responses of species to future climate change and how current species’ ranges are determined by potential causal factors (

 <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pounds et al. (2006)</xref> observed a decline in amphibian populations under climate warming using SDMs and 
 <xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lawler et al. (2006)</xref> used SDMs to assess the relative vulnerability of amphibians to future climate change, observing that several regions in Central America will experience high species turnover. More recently, 
 <xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ochoa-Ochoa et al. (2012)</xref> showed that species with a low dispersal capability have high extinction rates, and that climate-driven population declines may be species- and region-specific.
