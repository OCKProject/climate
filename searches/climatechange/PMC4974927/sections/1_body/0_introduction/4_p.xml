<p class="p">Locations and regions with many endemic or endangered species, known as hotspots, are more sensitive to climate change (

 <xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fei et al., 2009</xref>). Some 440 amphibian species, of which 263 are endemic, have been found in China, and the potential remains for further discoveries or redescriptions (

 <xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">IUCN (2015)</xref> reported that 28% of amphibians in mainland China are threatened or at risk of extinction and 65% of these are endemic. Most of these species are distributed in forests, farmlands and wetlands. Climate change has been hypothesized to have severe synergistic effects on Chinese amphibians because it may exacerbate the adverse effects of habitat destruction and fragmentation associated with anthropogenic land-use change that may increase amphibian extinction risk (
 <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hof et al., 2011</xref>). Quantifying the general trends of the climate change-driven shifts in species distribution and abundance is extremely important for adequate conservation policies. However, despite the high endemism and richness of amphibian species in China, to our knowledge, no one has attempted to predict climate change-driven shifts in distribution and abundance.
