In order to improve the accuracy of prediction, we did not include species with less than ten different geo-referenced occurrences. We obtained a total of 134 species (20 urodeles of the families Cryptobranchidae (1), Hynobiidae (7) and Salamandridae (12), and 114 anurans of the families Bombinatoridae (3), Bufonidae (6), Dicroglossidae (17), Hylidae (6), Megophryidae (27), Microhylidae (10), Ranidae (35) and Rhacophoridae (10) (
