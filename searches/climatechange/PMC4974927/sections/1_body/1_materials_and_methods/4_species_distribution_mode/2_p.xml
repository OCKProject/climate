 <xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Elith et al. (2011)</xref>. For each species, occurrence points were randomly partitioned into two subsets (calibration and validation, at a ratio of 4:1); this was repeated 100 times, each time choosing different random combinations of occurrence points for the calibration/validation datasets. Next, we calculated model parameters and used them to predict future distributions.
