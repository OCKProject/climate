<p class="p">MaxEnt is a commonly used algorithm in species distribution modelling because of its good predictive performance (

 <xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Varela et al., 2014</xref>). MaxEnt predicts speciesâ€™ probability distributions of habitat suitability by calculating the maximum entropy distribution and constraining the expected value of each of a set of environmental variables to match the empirical average (
 <xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Phillips, Anderson &amp; Schapire, 2006</xref>). Using presence-only data, MaxEnt fits an unknown probability distribution within the environmental space defined by the input variables of the cells with known species occurrence records. This unknown probability distribution is proportional to the probability of occurrence (
