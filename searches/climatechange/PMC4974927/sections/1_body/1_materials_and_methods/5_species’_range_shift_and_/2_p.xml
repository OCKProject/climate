<p class="p">To evaluate overall changes in amphibian diversity and distribution in China we calculated species turnover sum (
 <italic class="italic">TS</italic>) and turnover ratio (
 <italic class="italic">TR</italic>) in each grid cell within the potential geographical range shifts for all species. 
 <italic class="italic">TS</italic> was calculated as the total number of newly occurring species (
 <italic class="italic">NC</italic>) and extinct species (
 <italic class="italic">NE</italic>) in a given grid cell: 
 <italic class="italic">TS</italic> = 
 <italic class="italic">NC</italic> + 
 <italic class="italic">NE</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">TR</italic> was calculated as 
 <italic class="italic">TS</italic> divided by the sum of current species in each grid cell (
 <italic class="italic">NT</italic>) and 
 <italic class="italic">NC</italic>: 
 <italic class="italic">TR</italic> = 
 <italic class="italic">TS</italic>/(
 <italic class="italic">NT + NC</italic>) × 100% (
 <xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Peterson et al., 2002</xref>). In order to choose some significant areas under future change, we artificially set these significant areas had higher 
 <italic class="italic">TR</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">TS</italic>, and their numbers were suitable (5∼10). By comparing their different combinations of thresholds of 
 <italic class="italic">TR</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">TS</italic>, we used the one-half of its maximum value as the criterion (with 
 <italic class="italic">TR</italic> &gt; 50% and 
 <italic class="italic">TS</italic> &gt; 20).
