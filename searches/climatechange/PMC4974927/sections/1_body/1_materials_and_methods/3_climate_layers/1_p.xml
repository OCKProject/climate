<p class="p">Our prediction is based on bioclimatic envelope modeling, which changes with coupled AOGCMs. Different AOGCMs and greenhouse gas scenarios will lead to various changes in species’ distributions in the future. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) proposes four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). RCPs may be better than the emission scenarios developed in the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) and hence RCPs have replaced SRES standards (

Five AOGCMs (Integrated Earth System Model (MIROC-ESM), Beijing Climate Center Climate System Model (BCC-CSM1-1), Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS-E2-R), Community Climate System Model (CCSM4) and Institute Pierre Simon Laplace (IPSL-CM5A-LR)) were used for the years 2050s and 2070s. For each AOGCM, we used all four RCPs to evaluate different greenhouse gas scenarios. Hence, the total number of climate scenarios considered was 40 (20 scenarios and two time steps).
