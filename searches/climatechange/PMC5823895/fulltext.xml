U.S. Great Plains, due to its significance in national food production, evident climate variability, and extensive irrigation is an ideal region of investigation for climate impacts on food production. This paper evaluates climate impacts on maize, sorghum, and soybean yields and effect of irrigation for individual counties in this region by employing extensive crop yield and climate datasets from 1968&#x02013;2013. Variability in crop yields was a quarter of the regional average yields, with a quarter of this variability explained by climate variability, and temperature and precipitation explained these in singularity or combination at different locations. Observed temperature trend was beneficial for maize yields, but detrimental for sorghum and soybean yields, whereas observed precipitation trend was beneficial for all three crops. Irrigated yields demonstrated increased robustness and an effective mitigation strategy against climate impacts than their non-irrigated counterparts by a considerable fraction. The information, data, and maps provided can serve as an assessment guide for planners, managers, and policy- and decision makers to prioritize agricultural resilience efforts and resource allocation or re-allocation in the regions that exhibit risk from climate variability.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The global drivers of agricultural production and their variability include technology, genetics, climate, soil, field management practices and associated decisions such as fertilizer applications, tillage and crop hybrid selection, irrigation management, row spacing, panting date and depth, population density, etc. A significant portion of the advances in agricultural production is a result of technological advances in genetics, agronomic and resource use practices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.

The Fifth Assessment Report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> stated that the last century experienced an increase of 0.74&#x02009;&#x000b0;C globally in air temperatures due to increased greenhouse gas emission concentrations and the period of 1983&#x02013;2012 was the warmest 30-year span over the last 800 years for the Northern Hemisphere. Also, it reports evidence of increasing precipitation, especially in mid latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere with medium confidence since 1901, but high confidence after 1951. These changes have had considerable and spatially variable effects on crop production at the global scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, resulting in significant yield and economic losses as well as associated challenges in terms of meeting the feed, fiber, and food production of growing human population. On the contrary, there are studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> that have shown that negative trends in growing season air temperatures from 1982 to 1998 that caused up to 20% yield increase in maize and soybean yields.</p><p id="Par4">The aforementioned contrasting natures and magnitudes of the impacts of the climate trends are anticipated, owing to the large scale agro-climatic variations (climatological growing period length, growing degree days, rainfall patterns, and prevalence of different crop varieties) that occur in different regions. The complexity of these processes can be realized by emphasizing that the climatic factors governing crop growth and development are subject to change in both direction and magnitude spatially. Moreover, even similar trends in climate factors can result in dissimilar impacts on crop performance, which can also vary between regions. These impacts are much likely to differ among various crop species as well. As a consequence, the investigation of the climate&#x02019;s impacts on crop yields requires analyses at finer scales to discern the differential spatial responses of crops to climate variability.</p><p id="Par5">The U.S. Great Plains region is crucial for quantification of spatially variable impacts of historical climate onto crop yields, because of its vast geographical extent and substantial spatial and temporal variation in environmental and crop developmental factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and region&#x02019;s significant contribution to national agricultural production and economy. The U.S. Great Plains region we consider it in this study encompasses nine states and contributes to 46%, 89% and 36% of the national maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic> L.), sorghum (<italic>Sorghum bicolor</italic>), and soybean (<italic>Glycine max</italic>) production and growing a significant number of other crop varieties. Moreover, this region is home to the Ogallala aquifer, which is the major source of irrigation in conjunction with surface water and is one of the largest underground aquifers in the world. This provides a unique opportunity to investigate if the climate impacts on crop yields are a function of irrigation, which is not explicitly and sufficiently reported in the literature, especially quantitatively. In the light of its contribution in the national food production and the climate variability that the region is subjected to, there are several scientific and difficult questions that need to be addressed to provide insight and scientific information and data to policy and decision makers and resource planners and managers at the national, state, and local levels for enhancing the scientific understandings of climate vs. agricultural production dynamics, which can lead to enhancements of agricultural production practices in response to changing climatic conditions:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par6">

In answering the above scientific questions, this manuscript serves to potentially enhance our knowledge on climate-crop performance interactions substantially in the light of recent work in the literature. First, this manuscript focuses on three important crops for the Great Plains region, namely maize, sorghum, and soybean. While the past studies explore maize yield variability, followed by soybean<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, sorghum has not received enough attention in this direction. It is often generally stated that sorghum is more resilient to environmental stresses than its other C<sub>4</sub> counterpart, maize. By including sorghum in our study, we aim to seek observational/empirical evidence to test this prevalent claim. Moreover, sorghum contrastingly differs from maize and soybean in terms of management and technological (genetic) advancements and demonstrates slower rates of yield improvement over the course of recent decades. In fact, sorghum has been experiencing declines in planting and harvested area as well as production in the Great Plains region [Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(e,h</xref>)]. Thus, it is of crucial importance to investigate the climate impacts in influencing sorghum yields to generate insights into this slowly fading crop in terms of cultivated area. Secondly, our study addresses determination of actual historical climate impacts in terms of crop yield/production (scientific question 5) by quantifying sensitivity magnitudes of crop yields to unit changes in temperature and precipitation (scientific question 4). In addition, role of climate-induced yield trends relative to the overall observed yield trends was also evaluated by quantifying time equivalent of temperature and precipitation impacts on crop yields (scientific question 6). Addressal of these questions is critical as there is limited scientific knowledge on these aspects. A greater emphasis has been placed in the literature to determining the changes in crop yield variability and the climate contribution to influence this variability (scientific questions 1, 2 and 3). For example, Leng<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> reports changes in county-level crop yield variability and the varying strength of temperature vs. yield relationship during 1980&#x02013;2010 for maize in the United States. Finally, our study assesses climate impacts during 1968&#x02013;2013 (46 years), which is longer than the past studies (30 years). This is particularly important in the context of determining differences in irrigated and non-irrigated crop yields, as irrigation practices in the region became prevalent in the 1960&#x02019;s; thus, studies that use time period after substantial irrigation development occurred may not be able to effectively capture and evaluate the differences between irrigated and non-irrigated crop yields in relation to climate impacts. Overall, our study encompasses addressal of the fundamental of the questions such as characterizing yield variability and climate trends to more complex ones as the climate-influenced crop yield gain/loss within a single comprehensive framework, which in itself is the novelty of our work.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Variability and Trends in Crop Yield</title><p id="Par14">In this section, we attempt to answer our first scientific question, that is where and by what magnitude have the crop yields (pooled, irrigated and non-irrigated) varied inter-annually across counties during 1968&#x02013;2013.

For maize, substantial variability existed across counties, where Nebraska, western Kansas, Texas panhandle, eastern Colorado, and Iowa had relatively lower variability than counties in North Dakota, South Dakota, Oklahoma, and central Texas. For sorghum, relatively higher CV magnitudes, which represent greater relative variability, were found in North Dakota counties than the remainder of the region. However, the region average variability was comparable to that of maize. Soybean exhibited the lowest magnitudes of CV among all three crops (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), with Iowa showing the least variability.

Some of the highest maize yield increasing trends were found in eastern South Dakota, northern Nebraska, and Texas Panhandle with the highest magnitudes for Hooker County, Nebraska (261&#x02009;kg/ha/yr). On the contrary, there were counties with decreasing maize yield trends that were concentrated in northwestern Kansas and Eastern Colorado, among which the most negative trend was in Kiowa County, Colorado (&#x02212;54 kg/ha/yr). Over the study period, the region showed an average increasing maize yield trend of 98&#x02009;kg/ha/yr, and regional average decreasing trend of 31&#x02009;kg/ha/yr. Sorghum had a regional increasing trend of 34&#x02009;kg/ha/yr, and a decreasing trend of 24&#x02009;kg/ha/yr. Similar to maize yield trends, high geographic variability exists for sorghum yields where the highest increasing trends were in South Dakota and Nebraska with the maximum positive trend in Aurora County, South Dakota (101&#x02009;kg/ha/yr). Decreasing trends were primarily concentrated in Northern Texas and Southwest Kansas counties (water-limiting areas) and the greatest negative trend was in Hansford County, Texas (83&#x02009;kg/ha/yr). Lastly, soybean yields, regionally, increased at a rate of 27&#x02009;kg/ha/yr, while the decreasing trends (only observed in six counties in Oklahoma and Texas) averaged at 3&#x02009;kg/ha/yr. Higher soybean yield increasing trends were in North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska (the highest) and Iowa among which the highest magnitude was in Dundy County, Nebraska (69&#x02009;kg/ha/yr).

For all three crops, it was observed that the variability in yields was considerably greater for non-irrigated crops than the irrigated crops. Visual differences in the maps in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(b),(c),(e),(f),(h) and (i)</xref> support this observation, where lower magnitudes of CV (darker blue) were found in the irrigated crops than non-irrigated crops, for the same county. It should be noted that the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) reports irrigated and non-irrigated crop yields for counties which have considerable irrigated acreage and not for all cultivated region. However, the overall crop yields [Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(a),(d),(f)</xref>] include all the cropped area irrespective of irrigation practices. When averaged across the same counties, the variability (CV) in non-irrigated yields was 77% (maize), 69% (sorghum) and 63% (soybean) greater than that in irrigated yields, which implies that irrigated systems have been producing more consistent yields. Irrigated yields are on an average 100% (maize), 69% (sorghum) and 53% (soybean) greater than non-irrigated yields. Crop yield trends computed under irrigated and non-irrigated settings also differed, with irrigated maize and soybean yields increasing at a greater rate than non-irrigated yields, but at a slower pace for sorghum. Specifically, irrigated maize and soybean yields increased at a rate of 60% and 85%, respectively, greater than the rate of increase of non-irrigated yields. For sorghum, however, irrigated yields increased at a rate that was lower by 17% than the non-irrigated yields.

In other words, the regions which show warming trends are roughly the same as those show drying trends (decreasing precipitation trends), and the areas with cooling trends (decreasing temperature trends) the ones that show wetting trends (increasing precipitation trends).

Averaged across the counties where either temperature or precipitation had statistically significant impacts, 18, 23, and 23% of the variability in maize, sorghum, and soybean were explained by climate variability.

These differences can be better highlighted by averaging and comparing CEYV magnitudes across the mutual counties (possess data for both irrigated and non-irrigated CEYV).

Similarly, CEYV in non-irrigated sorghum (23%) and non-irrigated soybean (35%) yield was 160% and 728% higher than irrigated sorghum (9%) and irrigated soybean (4%). This suggests that the irrigated cropping systems are relatively robust to encounter climate variability than their non-irrigated counterparts in that irrigation practices are effective drought-mitigation strategy in term of maintaining grain yield and non-irrigated yields are substantially more vulnerable to climate impact(s) on yields.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Climatic Driver(s) of Crop Yield Variability</title><p id="Par24">The observed climate-driven crop yield variability has to be further characterized to understand what specific factor(s) (temperature, precipitation, or both) play a dominant role in influencing crop yield variability. Spatial differences in these drivers of crop yields as well as the crop-specific and irrigation-dependent controls were highlighted in this section. Our analyses revealed that considerable variability exists in the dominance of climatic factors in explaining US Great Plains maize, sorghum, and soybean yield variability (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Temperature alone was able to explain maize yield variability in northwest and southeast Nebraska and southern counties in Iowa while it was responsible in explaining sorghum yield variation in almost all significantly affected counties in Texas, except a few counties in the southeastern part. In contrast, temperature solely did not explain soybean yield variability, except for only a few scattered counties in Southeast South Dakota and Northwest Iowa. Precipitation, on the other hand, was able to explain maize yield variability in central and northeast South Dakota, central, southwest and northeast Nebraska. For sorghum and soybean, precipitation was responsible for explaining yield variability in considerable proportion of counties. These regions were Kansas and eastern Colorado for sorghum and eastern Nebraska, eastern Iowa and some parts of Kansas for soybean. Interestingly, and importantly, there were counties where both temperature and precipitation explained variability in crop yields such as southeast South Dakota for maize, central Nebraska and western Kansas for sorghum and Kansas for soybean yields.

In addition, our analyses establishes that the dominant climate factors than explain yield variability also varies among irrigated and non-irrigated crops. Overall, it was found that the non-irrigated crop yield variability was largely explained by precipitation alone and both precipitation and temperature, whereas temperature alone explained irrigated crop yield variability primarily. For instance, temperature only explained irrigated maize yield variability in southwest Nebraska, irrigated sorghum yield variability in Texas Panhandle, and irrigated soybean yield variability in central Nebraska, whereas counties where precipitation only or temperature and precipitation explained irrigated crop yields were minimal. The exact was opposite for non-irrigated crop yields, where temperature and precipitation explained maize yield variability in the eastern Nebraska and precipitation only in the rest of the state, precipitation only explained sorghum yield variability in southern Nebraska, southwest and eastern Nebraska and southeast Colorado, and finally precipitation only primarily explained soybean yield variability.</p><p id="Par26">We also analyzed which dominant climate factor explained crop yield variability in what percentage of counties, and further how much these counties contribute to the overall Great Plains crop production.

Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> presents the percentage of crop growing counties and their contribution to the Great Plains production for each climate factor that dominantly explains crop yield variability. Temperature alone explained yield variability in 14%, 6% and 4% of the maize, sorghum, and soybean growing counties, respectively, which contribute to 26%, 11% and 6% of the total Great Plains production. Precipitation alone, on the other hand explained 7%, 17% 18% of maize, sorghum, and soybean growing counties, which was lower for maize and higher for sorghum and soybean than what was attributed to temperature. The counties where crop yield variability was dominantly explained by precipitation alone contributed to 16%, 49% and 32% of Great Plains&#x02019; maize, sorghum and soybean production, respectively. Interestingly, the counties where precipitation explained sorghum (central and western Kansas) and soybean (eastern Nebraska) yield variability contributed to half (sorghum) and a third (soybean) of the Great Plains production, which is substantial. Lastly, temperature and precipitation combined dominantly explained yield variability in 5%, 4% and 9% of maize, sorghum, and soybean growing counties, respectively, which contributed 7%, 7% and 10% to the Great Plains total yield production. Irrigated crop yield variability is explained dominantly by temperature alone for sorghum and soybean, but equally by temperature and precipitation alone for maize. Again, for irrigated sorghum, counties where yield variability was explained by temperature alone were only 3% of irrigated sorghum counties, but they contributed to 21% of the Great Plains irrigated sorghum production.

The sensitivity magnitudes in combination with the climate trends result in actual estimates of climate impacts on crop yields. The sensitivity metric aids to inform the change in crop yields that occur with a unit change in climate factors. In this section, we present magnitude and direction of change in crop yields (as percentage of mean crop yields over 1968&#x02013;2013 period) per 1&#x02009;&#x000b0;C increase in temperature and per 10&#x02009;mm increase in precipitation. Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> and <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> show the sensitivity of crop yields to growing season temperature and precipitation, respectively for the region. Temperature rise was found to negatively affect maize yields in eastern Nebraska and Iowa, with instigating up to 22% decrease in yield with 1&#x02009;&#x000b0;C rise in temperature. However, in western Nebraska and eastern North Dakota, it positively affected maize yields, implying that temperature rise in these regions is beneficial to crop yields. For sorghum, a positive relationship existed among yields and temperature in Nebraska and western Kansas, while a negative correlation was found in Texas. Soybean crop yields were positively impacted by temperature rise in central Nebraska and eastern South Dakota, whereas they were negatively affected in Kansas. It is noteworthy that the extremes in sensitivity magnitude in either direction were found in sorghum growing regions, ranging from &#x02212;21% to 17%, which are the highest among the three crops. Precipitation, on the other hand was found to primarily have a positive correlation for maize and sorghum crops, while a negative correlation did exist for soybean. Some key areas where maize yields benefit from precipitation increase are western, central, and northeastern Nebraska, northeastern Iowa, eastern South Dakota, and North Dakota. Similarly, Kansas, southern Nebraska, eastern Colorado, and western and central Oklahoma show positive correlation of sorghum yield with precipitation. Soybean, on the contrary showed both positive and negative correlations with yields, especially in Iowa. Among the three crops, sorghum yields show highest positive sensitivity to precipitation (3%).<fig id="Fig8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Crop yield sensitivity to temperature for (<bold>a</bold>) Maize; (<bold>b</bold>) Irrigated maize; (<bold>c</bold>) Non-irrigated maize; (<bold>d</bold>) Sorghum; (<bold>e</bold>) Irrigated sorghum; (<bold>f</bold>) Non-irrigated sorghum; (<bold>g</bold>) Soybean; (<bold>h</bold>) Irrigated soybean; (<bold>i</bold>) Non-irrigated soybean yields in the Great Plains counties over the period 1968&#x02013;2013.

Irrigated maize shows positive correlation in western Nebraska, as opposed to the negative correlation in southeastern Nebraska for non-irrigated maize. Sorghum yields show highly negative sensitivity (22%) with temperature rise for both irrigated and non-irrigated conditions in the Texas panhandle, in addition to some counties in southeastern Kansas and southern Texas, showing negative correlation for non-irrigated sorghum. Soybean yields however, show positive correlation with temperature rise in central Nebraska under irrigated conditions, and negative correlation in south-central Nebraska under non-irrigated conditions. Precipitation rise had significant positive sensitivity for almost all counties under non-irrigated conditions, which implies that all rainfed crop yields are benefitted by any increase in precipitation. For irrigated crops, relatively lesser proportion of counties show positive sensitivity, and with lower magnitudes than non-irrigated conditions, with increase in precipitation. Irrigated maize show both positive correlation (in western Nebraska) and negative correlation (in eastern Nebraska), whereas irrigated sorghum and soybean show positive correlations. On average, sensitivity (negative) to temperature of non-irrigated maize was twice that of irrigated maize, however, irrigation did not result in improved (lower) sensitivity in sorghum as the sensitivity of irrigated sorghum was 0.1 times greater than non-irrigated sorghum. Precipitation sensitivity, was higher for non-irrigated yields for all crops, and was 43 times (maize), 3.1 times (sorghum), and 3.6 times (soybean) that of irrigated yields.</p><p id="Par29">The manifestation of a climate impact at a location is governed by nature (positive or negative correlation) and magnitude (percentage change in yield) of sensitivity (discussed in the section above) and the climate trends at that location (discussed earlier).

This assists to visualize the degree of climate-induced yield change as percentage of average yields and realize and conclude if the climate impact in a county is substantial or negligible. The higher the percentage, the higher is the yield change due to climate with respect to the average yield obtained and vice-versa. Moreover, a positive sign indicates that the trends in temperature and precipitation, whether increasing or decreasing, have positively impacted crop yields, while a negative sign indicates that trends in temperature and precipitation, had negative impact on crop yields. For all crops, the yields were observed to be affected both positively and negatively by trends in climate. As is clear, the areas where the three crops are grown are different, especially for sorghum (shares the least common area with maize and soybean). The temperature and precipitation trends were highly spatially variable and inconsistent, and hence it is anticipated that the impacts of these trends on crop yields are spatially dependent as well.

Assessing how the impacts of climate trends compare to all these other factors is important and is also one of our scientific questions. We calculated this indicator as a ratio of the climate-induced yield trend by the overall yield trend (from the county yield time series) for each county. This metric serves to emphasize the importance of climate relative to all other yield-influencing factors. The metric is interpreted as climate effect in the equivalent number of years of overall yield gains. For instance, a value of &#x02212;0.05 means that 20 years of the trend in climate (temperature or precipitation) is equivalent to a setback of 1 year of technological gains, and similarly a value of +0.2 means that 5 years of the trend in climate is equivalent to advancement of 1 year of technological gains.</p><p id="Par35">The measure reveals high degree of variation across the counties owing to the differences in both yield trends of the crops and climate impacts on them.

While temperature-induced impacts accelerated yield trends in maize (it takes 47 years to advance a year of technological gains), they slowed sorghum (takes 6 years to setback a year of technological gains) and soybean (takes 91 years to setback a year of technological gains) yield trends. However, in case of precipitation-induced impacts, yield trends were accelerated for the three crops, but with varying magnitudes (51, 31, and 30 years to advance a year of technological gains for maize, sorghum, and soybean, respectively). Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> also presents these magnitudes for irrigated and non-irrigated conditions, but a comparison might be challenging as the yield growth rates as well as the geographic regions are subject to variations among irrigated and non-irrigated crops.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par36">This study builds upon a comprehensive approach to realize the impacts of climate variability on crop yields and production by addressing a series of constituent questions in a stepwise fashion. Crop yields were studied to discover the trends and inter-annual variability during the 4.6 decades period over the Great Plains region. A key observation was high CV in crop yields for some regions such as North Dakota and South Dakota, which point towards the facts that areas with lower yields or less contribution to regional production demonstrate higher inter-annual variation than the key producing regions such as Nebraska, Kansas, and Iowa. This finding has also been reported on U.S. national and global scales, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Overall, soybean yields exhibited lowest variability relative to maize and sorghum. <italic>Leng et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> showed that similar spatial patterns exist in maize and soybean yield variability in the Great Plains region, although their analyses differed from ours in terms of: (a) the use of standard deviation to interpret crop yield variability, and (b) the period of analyses (1983&#x02013;2012). Stability in crop yields is important, especially now than ever, when demands for food, feed, and fiber are increasing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> due to rapidly growing global population, and productivity rates have been lagging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Crop yield variability, and hence variability in production, can affect national food stocks, spikes in food prices, and the livelihood of the citizens and other stakeholders involved. Therefore, the regions which contribute largely to national production should ideally be more resilient to variability to avoid these ramifications as even small levels of variability can affect productivity drastically. At the same time, greater variability in the regions of less consequence to regional or national production, would result in similar impacts in the local food availability scenario of these regions. Hence, our efforts to quantify crop yield variability in this study generate critical information on the state of these regions in the context of food security and quantitatively emphasizes that regions differ in their susceptibility to factors that can affect crop yields.</p><p id="Par37">Further, we establish how much of the crop yield variability is explained by climate and its dynamics across the spatial domain. We found that there was considerable number of counties where climate explained more than 20% of the crop yield variability. The average magnitudes of CEYV of 18%, 23%, and 23% in qualifying counties translate to staggering fluctuations of 32 million tons, 3 million tons, and 10 million tons of regional maize, sorghum, and soybean crop production, which can have tremendous local, regional, and national economic as well as social implications. <italic>Leng et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> demonstrated similar spatial patterns in CEYV for the Great Plains region, when maize and soybean yield was investigated as a function of precipitation and temperature only (excluding radiation). It was discovered that contribution of counties to regional food production is an important indicator to employ while assessing climate impacts. For example, we found that precipitation alone explained sorghum yield variability in 17% of the total Great Plains counties. However, these counties are responsible for 49% (almost half) of the regional sorghum production, which is of much larger proportion than the proportion of number of counties. This is also true for soybean, where precipitation explains yield variability in 18% of the counties, which constitutes 32% (almost a third) of regional production. Thus, reporting merely proportion of affected counties, rather than proportion of crop production affected might lead to misinterpretation of actual representation of magnitude of climate-explained yield variability. We suggest that our study is novel in the light of discovering and highlighting the critical importance of this course of action and recommends using this measure in the future for more robust and realistic determinations of climate vs. crop production dynamics.</p><p id="Par38">The climate-driven impacts in the region were shown to be variable across crop types and also geographically for a particular crop. Temperature-induced impacts were beneficial for maize yields, but negative for sorghum and soybean yields, with sorghum yields suffering by much higher magnitudes. Although crop yields were negatively affected by the temperature rise (sensitivity), maize was worst affected per 1&#x02009;&#x000b0;C increase, followed by soybean and sorghum. However, the actual impacts realized for each crop, as explained earlier, is a function of yield sensitivity to a fixed change in climate and the actual observed climate trends in the crop growing regions. Both maize and soybean growing regions showed cooling (maize regions cooler than soybean regions); however, sorghum growing regions were subjected to substantial warming, which lead to negative temperature-induced impacts on sorghum yields, and positive impacts on maize yields. Similarly, all crops benefitted from a unit rise in precipitation; however the magnitudes of the sensitivity varied, with sorghum being the most sensitive, followed by maize and soybean. The observed precipitation trends were highest for maize growing region, followed by soybean and the least for sorghum, although all regions showed wetting trends. The resultant precipitation induced impacts were hence, maximum for maize, followed by sorghum and soybean. Overall, the regional effect of climate (combined temperature and precipitation) was shown to be beneficial to maize and soybean yields (although low magnitude) and slightly detrimental for sorghum. This is primarily due to the positive precipitation impacts countering (or advancing) the negative (or positive) temperature-induced impacts. Despite evaluating the climate impacts for the entire region, we still strongly suggest that the county-specific impacts be given attention while studying climate impacts as these can be, and have been shown to be substantially different than regional magnitudes. Hence, different regions have to be investigated in terms of their susceptibility/robustness against changes in climate to develop robust and meaningful, and realistic strategies to mitigate climate&#x02019;s negative impacts on crops and the sensitivity and climate impacts maps can serve considerably in this regard.</p><p id="Par39">Irrigated and non-irrigated yields differed in all the metrics employed in this study when investigating and demonstrating the impacts of climate variability on crop yields. First, the variability (CV) in latter was 77% (maize), 69% (sorghum), and 63% (soybean) greater than the former. Further, the CEYV in non-irrigated crops was 436% (maize), 160% (sorghum), and 728% (soybean) higher than irrigated crops, with the non-irrigated crop yield variability largely explained by precipitation alone and both precipitation and temperature, whereas temperature alone explained irrigated crop yield variability. Irrigation also decreased the sensitivity of crops to temperature rise, especially for maize, and increased sensitivity of all crops to precipitation rise. Finally, precipitation and temperature-induced actual yield impacts were more beneficial for non-irrigated maize, sorghum, and soybean, with the only exception of temperature and precipitation-induced sorghum yield losses. All these findings suggest that irrigated systems are generally robust (mitigates against negative impacts of temperature and/or precipitation change) than non-irrigated systems. These differences have also been reported on global scales<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. This could be the result of: (i) irrigation reducing impacts of extreme temperatures, hence reducing or eliminating the water stress, which could otherwise reduce the yield substantially, (ii) greater transpiration rates (higher water availability) leading to evaporative cooling in the crop canopy microclimate, and (iii) greater yields due to greater magnitude of transpiration, because transpiration and grain yield are strongly and linearly correlated. Since sorghum tends were observed to be less than irrigated maize, the effects of irrigation weren&#x02019;t detectable as much as for maize, which implies that effect of irrigation may be variable in certain crops due to the variations in irrigation timing and amount and irrigation method used in practice.</p><p id="Par40">Any empirical model-based study has its limitations and likewise, we have identified some of these in the framework of our study. In addition to temperature and precipitation variability, there is a range of other factors that can affect crop yields such as solar radiation, wind speed, extreme temperature and precipitation, soil moisture availability (although we somewhat addressed this through irrigated vs. non-irrigated yield analyses), dry and wet spells, nutrient availability, conservation tillage, mulching and multiple cropping. Moreover, our study does not address effects of elevated carbon dioxide on crop yields. A 0.065% increase in C<sub>3</sub> crop yields per ppm of CO<sub>2</sub> increase and a negligible increase in C<sub>4</sub> crop yields, because of the photosynthetic pathway for C<sub>4</sub> crops being independent of ambient CO<sub>2,</sub> has been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Hence, the effect of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> would be an important factor to consider in C<sub>3</sub> crops such as soybean (maize and sorghum are C<sub>4</sub> crops), which is outside the scope of our study. The county-specific statistical model(s) that have been employed in the study are chosen assuming linear climate-crop yield relations, which might not be true under certain conditions. As shown by studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, crop growth has been shown to respond non-linearly to climate. Also, we did not account for changes in crop spatial distribution pattern, which has recently been shown to modulate the response of crop yields to climate and ignoring these changes could possibly result in biased estimates of climate change impacts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Measures to quantify and reduce sampling uncertainty were not adopted in this study. However, accounting for sampling uncertainty is crucial because empirical models such as ours are dependent on finite observational records<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, we estimated our county-specific multiple linear regression model uncertainty using a simple root mean squared error (RMSE) for each county. Averaged over the counties where at least one of the climate factors significantly explained yield variability, the RMSE of the linear model relative to mean crop yields were 16%, 20% and 15% for maize, sorghum and soybean, respectively. We also do not address covariability of climate variables, which has also been demonstrated to have a role in estimating accurate sensitivity of crop yields to climate factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Finally, we did not consider the adaptations that have possibly already been taken (although our observations indicate to a very limited extent, at least in the Great Plains region) by the producer community against climate change such as planting date shifts, adoption of newer drought-tolerant hybrids, cultivars, varieties, regional crop pattern shifts, and other management strategies.</p><p id="Par41">Our study, hence is a scientific, data-driven, and informative guide to evaluate and quantify climate&#x02019;s role in yield variability of maize, sorghum, and soybean (three of the major grain commodities) grown in the U.S. Great Plains and further quantifies the actual impacts realized by this contribution in the constituent counties. This can be used to guide future research efforts in the regions that are shown to be critical in terms of climate impacts and inform concerned natural resources and policy agencies and decision makers in the region.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Crop Yield and Climate Datasets</title><p id="Par42">County-level crop yield datasets were obtained for maize, sorghum, and soybean for the period of 1968&#x02013;2013 from the United States Department of Agriculture-National Agricultural Statistics Service (USDA-NASS). The beginning date of the study period (1968) was based on the start of the state level crop yield records. The earliest year with crop yield records available for all nine states studied was 1968 and, hence was chosen as the beginning of the study period. The USDA-NASS obtained yield data were reported in bushels per acre of wet weight. To make the data convenient for our use as well as for the greater scientific community, conversions were made to kilogram per hectare on a dry weight basis (adjusting to standard 15.5% grain moisture content), by using conversion factors of 62.77 for maize and 67.25 for soybean. The analysis on crop yield variability was limited to counties with data available for least 60% of the study period. It should be noted that the sorghum yield dataset was highly discontinuous prior to 1972 and following 2007 for majority of the counties, hence all analysis for sorghum was conducted for a 36-year period instead (1972&#x02013;2007). Daily weather dataset consisting of maximum air temperature, minimum air temperature, and precipitation were obtained from the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) provided through the National Climatic Data Centre of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NCDC-NOAA). The GHCN datasets are subjected to rigorous quality assurance reviews. Historical daily weather datasets for the period 1968&#x02013;2013 were obtained for over 800 weather stations distributed over the study area. The selection is performed so that all the weather stations selected possess regular data during the temporal span of 46 years. Out of these sites, 672 sites are geographically located in nine states studied. The remainder of the sites was selected from the surrounding states along the boundaries of the study area, specifically Arkansas, Idaho, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Minnesota, New Mexico, Utah, and Wisconsin to perform accurate and continuous interpolation of various variables along the edges of the study area. Lastly, the boundary datasets for various governmental units such as states and counties that were used to aid in the analysis and representation in the GIS environment were obtained from the USDA-Geospatial Data Gateway.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Development of County-Based Climate Data</title><p id="Par43">For the purpose of exploration and investigation of impacts of climate on the agricultural crop yields, it is crucial that both datasets (climate and crop yields) are at the same spatial and temporal scales, hence rendering them suitable for inter-comparison. These scales have to be appropriate in terms of space and time so that the resulting climatic impacts are represented in a detailed, consistent, and relatable manner. In this study, a county has been chosen as an appropriate scale to investigate and report the findings. This is because several other sets of information such as commodity prices, crop yields, fertilizer inputs and management practices are reported on county-level basis. Thus, quantifying climate impacts on agricultural production on a county basis results in increased potential for the application of these findings by the state and federal agencies working in the disciplines of agriculture and natural resource conservation. Air temperature and precipitation surfaces (datasets) used in this study were developed by <italic>Kukal and Irmak</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> using over 800 sites for inverse distance weighing (IDW) interpolation technique in ArcGIS 10.2. We computed zone-based (counties) values from these spatial datasets using zonal statistics tool in ArcGIS 10.2. These operations resulted in a database of county-averaged growing season mean temperature and growing season total precipitation for all 834 counties in the study region for the period of 1968&#x02013;2013, which is consistent with the crop yield dataset.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Trends in Climate and Crop Yields</title><p id="Par44">We focused on the trends that occurred in crop yields and growing season climatic variables (average air temperature, T<sub>avg</sub>, and precipitation, P) during the period of 1968&#x02013;2013. Trends were calculated for county level maize, soybean, and sorghum yields (kg ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> yr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and county averaged T<sub>avg</sub> (&#x000b0;C yr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and P (mm yr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) during the crop growing season (May 1<sup>st</sup>- September 30<sup>th</sup>) using linear regression analysis. Qualitatively, these trends in yield and climate can be realized as the direction of change in these values over the 46-year period, whereas in quantitative terms, the trends are slope of the linear regression analysis performed with yield or climate on the ordinate and the time (year) on the abscissa. This process resulted into 2,502 regressions for yield (834 counties&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;3 crops) and 1,668 regressions for climate (834 counties&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 variables). The outcomes of these regression analyses, including both directions and magnitudes of the trends were represented using maps, to better observe the trends in a spatial context, and acknowledge the extent of variability that occurs in both yield and climate change on spatial scales.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Estimation of Climate Contribution towards Crop Yields</title><p id="Par45">A series of steps and computations were involved in quantifying the contribution of climate towards trends in crop yields (climate-driven yield trends). Since the climate dataset was complete in all regards (all 834 counties and all 46 years), the analyses were restricted by the availability of crop yield records. It was decided that the analyses be performed for only those counties which had continuous crop yield data for all years during the study period (1968&#x02013;2013). Since the analysis was primarily statistical, missing data were not included in the analyses keeping in mind the potential errors it can introduce into the analyses.

Also, the coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) for the regression provides information about what magnitudes of variability in yields can be explained by variability in climate (i.e., temperature and precipitation) for different counties (or climate explained yield variability, CEYV).
