   <bold class="bold">i</bold>) Non-irrigated soybean yields in the Great Plains counties over the period 1968â€“2013. The values range from 0 to 1. A value of 1 implies that complete variability in crop yields was explained by climate variability and likewise a value of 0.2 implies that 20% of the variability in crop yields was explained by climate variability. Counties with striped lines indicate that at least one climate factor significantly explained crop yield variability in that county at 95% confidence level. Regions with no data indicate that the crop yield dataset for a particular county was not complete. We created the maps using ESRI ArcMap 10.4.1 software
