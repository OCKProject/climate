<p id="Par36" class="p">This study builds upon a comprehensive approach to realize the impacts of climate variability on crop yields and production by addressing a series of constituent questions in a stepwise fashion. Crop yields were studied to discover the trends and inter-annual variability during the 4.6 decades period over the Great Plains region. A key observation was high CV in crop yields for some regions such as North Dakota and South Dakota, which point towards the facts that areas with lower yields or less contribution to regional production demonstrate higher inter-annual variation than the key producing regions such as Nebraska, Kansas, and Iowa. This finding has also been reported on U.S. national and global scales, respectively

 </sup> showed that similar spatial patterns exist in maize and soybean yield variability in the Great Plains region, although their analyses differed from ours in terms of: (a) the use of standard deviation to interpret crop yield variability, and (b) the period of analyses (1983â€“2012). Stability in crop yields is important, especially now than ever, when demands for food, feed, and fiber are increasing

 </sup>. Crop yield variability, and hence variability in production, can affect national food stocks, spikes in food prices, and the livelihood of the citizens and other stakeholders involved. Therefore, the regions which contribute largely to national production should ideally be more resilient to variability to avoid these ramifications as even small levels of variability can affect productivity drastically. At the same time, greater variability in the regions of less consequence to regional or national production, would result in similar impacts in the local food availability scenario of these regions. Hence, our efforts to quantify crop yield variability in this study generate critical information on the state of these regions in the context of food security and quantitatively emphasizes that regions differ in their susceptibility to factors that can affect crop yields.
