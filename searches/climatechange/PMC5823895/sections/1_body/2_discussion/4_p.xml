<p id="Par39" class="p">Irrigated and non-irrigated yields differed in all the metrics employed in this study when investigating and demonstrating the impacts of climate variability on crop yields. First, the variability (CV) in latter was 77% (maize), 69% (sorghum), and 63% (soybean) greater than the former. Further, the CEYV in non-irrigated crops was 436% (maize), 160% (sorghum), and 728% (soybean) higher than irrigated crops, with the non-irrigated crop yield variability largely explained by precipitation alone and both precipitation and temperature, whereas temperature alone explained irrigated crop yield variability. Irrigation also decreased the sensitivity of crops to temperature rise, especially for maize, and increased sensitivity of all crops to precipitation rise. Finally, precipitation and temperature-induced actual yield impacts were more beneficial for non-irrigated maize, sorghum, and soybean, with the only exception of temperature and precipitation-induced sorghum yield losses. All these findings suggest that irrigated systems are generally robust (mitigates against negative impacts of temperature and/or precipitation change) than non-irrigated systems. These differences have also been reported on global scales

 </sup>. This could be the result of: (i) irrigation reducing impacts of extreme temperatures, hence reducing or eliminating the water stress, which could otherwise reduce the yield substantially, (ii) greater transpiration rates (higher water availability) leading to evaporative cooling in the crop canopy microclimate, and (iii) greater yields due to greater magnitude of transpiration, because transpiration and grain yield are strongly and linearly correlated. Since sorghum tends were observed to be less than irrigated maize, the effects of irrigation werenâ€™t detectable as much as for maize, which implies that effect of irrigation may be variable in certain crops due to the variations in irrigation timing and amount and irrigation method used in practice.
