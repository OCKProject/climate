<p id="Par40" class="p">Any empirical model-based study has its limitations and likewise, we have identified some of these in the framework of our study. In addition to temperature and precipitation variability, there is a range of other factors that can affect crop yields such as solar radiation, wind speed, extreme temperature and precipitation, soil moisture availability (although we somewhat addressed this through irrigated vs. non-irrigated yield analyses), dry and wet spells, nutrient availability, conservation tillage, mulching and multiple cropping. Moreover, our study does not address effects of elevated carbon dioxide on crop yields. A 0.065% increase in C
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> crop yields per ppm of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> increase and a negligible increase in C
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> crop yields, because of the photosynthetic pathway for C
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> crops being independent of ambient CO
 <sub class="sub">2,</sub> has been reported

 </sup>. Hence, the effect of elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> would be an important factor to consider in C
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> crops such as soybean (maize and sorghum are C
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> crops), which is outside the scope of our study. The county-specific statistical model(s) that have been employed in the study are chosen assuming linear climate-crop yield relations, which might not be true under certain conditions. As shown by studies

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>
 </sup>, crop growth has been shown to respond non-linearly to climate. Also, we did not account for changes in crop spatial distribution pattern, which has recently been shown to modulate the response of crop yields to climate and ignoring these changes could possibly result in biased estimates of climate change impacts

 </sup>. Measures to quantify and reduce sampling uncertainty were not adopted in this study. However, accounting for sampling uncertainty is crucial because empirical models such as ours are dependent on finite observational records

 </sup>. Nevertheless, we estimated our county-specific multiple linear regression model uncertainty using a simple root mean squared error (RMSE) for each county. Averaged over the counties where at least one of the climate factors significantly explained yield variability, the RMSE of the linear model relative to mean crop yields were 16%, 20% and 15% for maize, sorghum and soybean, respectively. We also do not address covariability of climate variables, which has also been demonstrated to have a role in estimating accurate sensitivity of crop yields to climate factors

 </sup>. Finally, we did not consider the adaptations that have possibly already been taken (although our observations indicate to a very limited extent, at least in the Great Plains region) by the producer community against climate change such as planting date shifts, adoption of newer drought-tolerant hybrids, cultivars, varieties, regional crop pattern shifts, and other management strategies.
