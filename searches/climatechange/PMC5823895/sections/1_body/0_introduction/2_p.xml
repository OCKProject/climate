<p id="Par3" class="p">Amongst these factors, weather and climate are prominent drivers or influencers of agricultural production systems and it has been shown that recent trends in change of climate variables may be responsible for substantially affecting crop yield trends despite advances in technology and other fronts. The Fifth Assessment Report

 </sup> stated that the last century experienced an increase of 0.74 °C globally in air temperatures due to increased greenhouse gas emission concentrations and the period of 1983–2012 was the warmest 30-year span over the last 800 years for the Northern Hemisphere. Also, it reports evidence of increasing precipitation, especially in mid latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere with medium confidence since 1901, but high confidence after 1951. These changes have had considerable and spatially variable effects on crop production at the global scale
