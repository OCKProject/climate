<p id="Par13" class="p">This manuscript analyses extensive datasets to answer the above questions for maize, sorghum, and soybean crops in the Great Plains region during the period 1968–2013. In answering the above scientific questions, this manuscript serves to potentially enhance our knowledge on climate-crop performance interactions substantially in the light of recent work in the literature. First, this manuscript focuses on three important crops for the Great Plains region, namely maize, sorghum, and soybean. While the past studies explore maize yield variability, followed by soybean

 </sup>, sorghum has not received enough attention in this direction. It is often generally stated that sorghum is more resilient to environmental stresses than its other C
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> counterpart, maize. By including sorghum in our study, we aim to seek observational/empirical evidence to test this prevalent claim. Moreover, sorghum contrastingly differs from maize and soybean in terms of management and technological (genetic) advancements and demonstrates slower rates of yield improvement over the course of recent decades. In fact, sorghum has been experiencing declines in planting and harvested area as well as production in the Great Plains region [Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1(e,h</xref>)]. Thus, it is of crucial importance to investigate the climate impacts in influencing sorghum yields to generate insights into this slowly fading crop in terms of cultivated area. Secondly, our study addresses determination of actual historical climate impacts in terms of crop yield/production (scientific question 5) by quantifying sensitivity magnitudes of crop yields to unit changes in temperature and precipitation (scientific question 4). In addition, role of climate-induced yield trends relative to the overall observed yield trends was also evaluated by quantifying time equivalent of temperature and precipitation impacts on crop yields (scientific question 6). Addressal of these questions is critical as there is limited scientific knowledge on these aspects. A greater emphasis has been placed in the literature to determining the changes in crop yield variability and the climate contribution to influence this variability (scientific questions 1, 2 and 3). For example, Leng

 </sup> reports changes in county-level crop yield variability and the varying strength of temperature vs. yield relationship during 1980–2010 for maize in the United States. Finally, our study assesses climate impacts during 1968–2013 (46 years), which is longer than the past studies (30 years). This is particularly important in the context of determining differences in irrigated and non-irrigated crop yields, as irrigation practices in the region became prevalent in the 1960’s; thus, studies that use time period after substantial irrigation development occurred may not be able to effectively capture and evaluate the differences between irrigated and non-irrigated crop yields in relation to climate impacts. Overall, our study encompasses addressal of the fundamental of the questions such as characterizing yield variability and climate trends to more complex ones as the climate-influenced crop yield gain/loss within a single comprehensive framework, which in itself is the novelty of our work.
