<p id="Par4" class="p">The aforementioned contrasting natures and magnitudes of the impacts of the climate trends are anticipated, owing to the large scale agro-climatic variations (climatological growing period length, growing degree days, rainfall patterns, and prevalence of different crop varieties) that occur in different regions. The complexity of these processes can be realized by emphasizing that the climatic factors governing crop growth and development are subject to change in both direction and magnitude spatially. Moreover, even similar trends in climate factors can result in dissimilar impacts on crop performance, which can also vary between regions. These impacts are much likely to differ among various crop species as well. As a consequence, the investigation of the climateâ€™s impacts on crop yields requires analyses at finer scales to discern the differential spatial responses of crops to climate variability.</p>
