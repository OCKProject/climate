<p id="Par2" class="p">The global drivers of agricultural production and their variability include technology, genetics, climate, soil, field management practices and associated decisions such as fertilizer applications, tillage and crop hybrid selection, irrigation management, row spacing, panting date and depth, population density, etc. A significant portion of the advances in agricultural production is a result of technological advances in genetics, agronomic and resource use practices
