<p id="Par34" class="p">As discussed earlier, there are several other factors, in addition to climate, that play a role to determine yield trends (in the past or future). Assessing how the impacts of climate trends compare to all these other factors is important and is also one of our scientific questions. We calculated this indicator as a ratio of the climate-induced yield trend by the overall yield trend (from the county yield time series) for each county. This metric serves to emphasize the importance of climate relative to all other yield-influencing factors. The metric is interpreted as climate effect in the equivalent number of years of overall yield gains. For instance, a value of âˆ’0.05 means that 20 years of the trend in climate (temperature or precipitation) is equivalent to a setback of 1 year of technological gains, and similarly a value of +0.2 means that 5 years of the trend in climate is equivalent to advancement of 1 year of technological gains.</p>
