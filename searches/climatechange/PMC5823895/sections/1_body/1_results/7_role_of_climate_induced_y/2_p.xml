<p id="Par35" class="p">The measure reveals high degree of variation across the counties owing to the differences in both yield trends of the crops and climate impacts on them. The metric’s average regional magnitudes for each crop are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. While temperature-induced impacts accelerated yield trends in maize (it takes 47 years to advance a year of technological gains), they slowed sorghum (takes 6 years to setback a year of technological gains) and soybean (takes 91 years to setback a year of technological gains) yield trends. However, in case of precipitation-induced impacts, yield trends were accelerated for the three crops, but with varying magnitudes (51, 31, and 30 years to advance a year of technological gains for maize, sorghum, and soybean, respectively). Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> also presents these magnitudes for irrigated and non-irrigated conditions, but a comparison might be challenging as the yield growth rates as well as the geographic regions are subject to variations among irrigated and non-irrigated crops.
