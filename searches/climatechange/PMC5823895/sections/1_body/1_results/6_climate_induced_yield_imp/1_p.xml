<p id="Par30" class="p">This metric serves to inform the relative proportion of the climate-induced yield change in a particular county as compared to the average county-specific yield or regional average yield. This assists to visualize the degree of climate-induced yield change as percentage of average yields and realize and conclude if the climate impact in a county is substantial or negligible. The higher the percentage, the higher is the yield change due to climate with respect to the average yield obtained and vice-versa. Moreover, a positive sign indicates that the trends in temperature and precipitation, whether increasing or decreasing, have positively impacted crop yields, while a negative sign indicates that trends in temperature and precipitation, had negative impact on crop yields. For all crops, the yields were observed to be affected both positively and negatively by trends in climate. As is clear, the areas where the three crops are grown are different, especially for sorghum (shares the least common area with maize and soybean). The temperature and precipitation trends were highly spatially variable and inconsistent, and hence it is anticipated that the impacts of these trends on crop yields are spatially dependent as well.
