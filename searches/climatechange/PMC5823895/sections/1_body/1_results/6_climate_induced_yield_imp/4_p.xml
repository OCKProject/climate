<p id="Par33" class="p">Differences in temperature- and precipitation-induced yield impacts existed when irrigated and non-irrigated conditions were considered. Overall, non-irrigated crops exhibited greater magnitudes of yield impacts, in case of both temperature and precipitation impacts. On average, among the same counties, temperature-induced non-irrigated maize yield gains were 52% greater than temperature-induced irrigated maize yield gains, while temperature-induced non-irrigated sorghum yield losses were 98% greater than temperature-induced irrigated sorghum yield losses (no common impacted counties were found for irrigated and non-irrigated soybean). Precipitation-induced yield gains were greater for non-irrigated maize than irrigated maize by 228%, and the precipitation induced yield losses were lower for non-irrigated maize than irrigated maize by 57%. Similarly, precipitation induced yield gains for non-irrigated sorghum were greater than irrigated sorghum by 287%; however, the precipitation-induced yield losses were higher for non-irrigated than irrigated sorghum by 153%. Finally, precipitation-induced yield gains were higher for non-irrigated soybean than irrigated soybean by 372%, while there were no common counties where significant precipitation-induced gains were found for both irrigated and non-irrigated counties.</p>
