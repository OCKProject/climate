<p id="Par32" class="p">Precipitation-induced impacts were less prevalent for maize (significant impacts found in 35% lesser counties), and more prevalent for sorghum (significant impacts found for 116% additional counties) and soybean (significant impacts found for 96% additional counties). Moreover, unlike temperature impacts, the proportion of positively impacted counties was greater than that of negatively impacted counties for all the crops. In fact, majority of the impacts were positive with only 12%, 30%, and 19% of impacted counties suffering yield losses for maize, sorghum, and soybean, respectively. The regional average precipitation-induced yield gains were 5.2%, 3.4%, and 2.8%, whereas the precipitation-induced yield losses were 1.4%, 3.5%, and 1.7% for maize, sorghum, and soybean, respectively. Overall, the net impacts for the region were positive (yield gains) of 2.0%, 1.6%, and 1.4% for maize, sorghum, and soybean, respectively. Maize yield benefited from the precipitation change almost throughout the region, but the highest yield gains were found in South Dakota and North Dakota (up to 20%). Sorghum yield impacts were found mostly in Kansas, Nebraska, and Colorado with negative impacts in northwest Kansas and positive impacts elsewhere. Lastly, soybean yield impacts were primarily found in central Iowa (both positive and negative). Finally, while considering counties where both temperature and precipitation had significant impacts, we found climate-induced net yield gains of 5.4%, 1.5%, and 0.4% for maize, sorghum, and soybean, respectively.</p>
