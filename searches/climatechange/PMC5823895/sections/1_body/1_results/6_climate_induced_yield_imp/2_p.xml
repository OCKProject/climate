<p id="Par31" class="p">In the respective crop regions, the proportion of negatively impacted counties (with temperature-induced losses) were higher than positively impacted counties (with temperature-induced gains) for soybean and sorghum, while the opposite was true for maize. Although the highest magnitudes of impacts were much higher, the regional average temperature-induced yield gains were 4.3%, 3.9%, and 2.2%, while the temperature-induced yield losses were 1.9%, 9.8%, and 2.6% for maize, sorghum and soybean, respectively. On average, temperature-induced net impacts were 1.6%, −2.2%, and −0.5% for maize, sorghum, and soybean, respectively, which imply that on average maize yields benefitted and sorghum and soybean yields suffered from the temperature changes. For maize, the regions of negative impacts were central Nebraska and North Dakota, while the rest of the region primarily observed to be positively impacted. Sorghum was found to have negative impacts in Texas counties with the Texas panhandle experiencing severe yield losses of up to 34% of the county average yields during the 46-year period. Impacts on soybean yields were located in counties in central and eastern Kansas, central Nebraska, southeastern South Dakota, and northern Iowa.</p>
