 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> presents the inter-annual variability (CV) of crop yields for counties studied in the region. We focused on the counties where at least 50% (23 years) of crop yield data were available. For maize, substantial variability existed across counties, where Nebraska, western Kansas, Texas panhandle, eastern Colorado, and Iowa had relatively lower variability than counties in North Dakota, South Dakota, Oklahoma, and central Texas. For sorghum, relatively higher CV magnitudes, which represent greater relative variability, were found in North Dakota counties than the remainder of the region. However, the region average variability was comparable to that of maize. Soybean exhibited the lowest magnitudes of CV among all three crops (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>), with Iowa showing the least variability. Over the last 4.5 decades, the region had a regional average variability (standard deviation, SD) of 1.8, 1.0, and 0.6 tons/ha in maize, sorghum and soybean yields, respectively, which translate to 29, 28, and 26% of regional average yields of 6.2, 3.4 and 2.2 tons/ha, for the same crops, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>).
