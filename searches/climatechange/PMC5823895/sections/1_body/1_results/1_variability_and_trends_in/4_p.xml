<p id="Par17" class="p">Irrigated and non-irrigated crop yields were subjected to similar analyses and differences were found among them with respect to yield variability. For all three crops, it was observed that the variability in yields was considerably greater for non-irrigated crops than the irrigated crops. Visual differences in the maps in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3(b),(c),(e),(f),(h) and (i)</xref> support this observation, where lower magnitudes of CV (darker blue) were found in the irrigated crops than non-irrigated crops, for the same county. It should be noted that the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) reports irrigated and non-irrigated crop yields for counties which have considerable irrigated acreage and not for all cultivated region. However, the overall crop yields [Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3(a),(d),(f)</xref>] include all the cropped area irrespective of irrigation practices. When averaged across the same counties, the variability (CV) in non-irrigated yields was 77% (maize), 69% (sorghum) and 63% (soybean) greater than that in irrigated yields, which implies that irrigated systems have been producing more consistent yields. Irrigated yields are on an average 100% (maize), 69% (sorghum) and 53% (soybean) greater than non-irrigated yields. Crop yield trends computed under irrigated and non-irrigated settings also differed, with irrigated maize and soybean yields increasing at a greater rate than non-irrigated yields, but at a slower pace for sorghum. Specifically, irrigated maize and soybean yields increased at a rate of 60% and 85%, respectively, greater than the rate of increase of non-irrigated yields. For sorghum, however, irrigated yields increased at a rate that was lower by 17% than the non-irrigated yields. This is attributed to the prevalence of some counties in Eastern Colorado and Texas Panhandle, which had negative irrigated sorghum yield trends and positive non-irrigated sorghum yield trends, reducing the difference between irrigated and non-irrigated sorghum yields.
