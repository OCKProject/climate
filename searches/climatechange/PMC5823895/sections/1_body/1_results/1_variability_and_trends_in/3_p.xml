<p id="Par16" class="p">In addition to analyzing inter-annual variability, it is crucial to investigate the trends in crop yields to identify regions where the technological and management improvements have been adopted efficiently and others where challenges have hampered yield growth. Trends in grain yield during 1968–2013 on a county scale are presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>. Some of the highest maize yield increasing trends were found in eastern South Dakota, northern Nebraska, and Texas Panhandle with the highest magnitudes for Hooker County, Nebraska (261 kg/ha/yr). On the contrary, there were counties with decreasing maize yield trends that were concentrated in northwestern Kansas and Eastern Colorado, among which the most negative trend was in Kiowa County, Colorado (−54 kg/ha/yr). Over the study period, the region showed an average increasing maize yield trend of 98 kg/ha/yr, and regional average decreasing trend of 31 kg/ha/yr. Sorghum had a regional increasing trend of 34 kg/ha/yr, and a decreasing trend of 24 kg/ha/yr. Similar to maize yield trends, high geographic variability exists for sorghum yields where the highest increasing trends were in South Dakota and Nebraska with the maximum positive trend in Aurora County, South Dakota (101 kg/ha/yr). Decreasing trends were primarily concentrated in Northern Texas and Southwest Kansas counties (water-limiting areas) and the greatest negative trend was in Hansford County, Texas (83 kg/ha/yr). Lastly, soybean yields, regionally, increased at a rate of 27 kg/ha/yr, while the decreasing trends (only observed in six counties in Oklahoma and Texas) averaged at 3 kg/ha/yr. Higher soybean yield increasing trends were in North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska (the highest) and Iowa among which the highest magnitude was in Dundy County, Nebraska (69 kg/ha/yr). The highest negative soybean yield trend was in Leflore County, Oklahoma (6 kg/ha/yr).
