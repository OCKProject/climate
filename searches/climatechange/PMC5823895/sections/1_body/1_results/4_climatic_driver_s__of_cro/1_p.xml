<p id="Par24" class="p">The observed climate-driven crop yield variability has to be further characterized to understand what specific factor(s) (temperature, precipitation, or both) play a dominant role in influencing crop yield variability. Spatial differences in these drivers of crop yields as well as the crop-specific and irrigation-dependent controls were highlighted in this section. Our analyses revealed that considerable variability exists in the dominance of climatic factors in explaining US Great Plains maize, sorghum, and soybean yield variability (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). Temperature alone was able to explain maize yield variability in northwest and southeast Nebraska and southern counties in Iowa while it was responsible in explaining sorghum yield variation in almost all significantly affected counties in Texas, except a few counties in the southeastern part. In contrast, temperature solely did not explain soybean yield variability, except for only a few scattered counties in Southeast South Dakota and Northwest Iowa. Precipitation, on the other hand, was able to explain maize yield variability in central and northeast South Dakota, central, southwest and northeast Nebraska. For sorghum and soybean, precipitation was responsible for explaining yield variability in considerable proportion of counties. These regions were Kansas and eastern Colorado for sorghum and eastern Nebraska, eastern Iowa and some parts of Kansas for soybean. Interestingly, and importantly, there were counties where both temperature and precipitation explained variability in crop yields such as southeast South Dakota for maize, central Nebraska and western Kansas for sorghum and Kansas for soybean yields. Lastly, there were counties where climate variability did not explain crop yield variability significantly (

 </sup> reported dominant climate factors significantly explaining crop yield variability for maize and soybean, and included seven possible combinations of climate factors that could be assigned to a particular county, in contrast to the three factors employed in this study. Observations of spatial dependence of dominant climatic factors vividly demonstrate that influence of climate variability on crop yield variability are highly site-specific and should be addressed at finer scales, rather than statewide, national, continental, or global scales.
