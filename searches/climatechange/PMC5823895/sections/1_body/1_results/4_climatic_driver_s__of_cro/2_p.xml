<p id="Par25" class="p">As seen previously, irrigated crop yield variability was explained by a different magnitude than non-irrigated crop yield variability. In addition, our analyses establishes that the dominant climate factors than explain yield variability also varies among irrigated and non-irrigated crops. Overall, it was found that the non-irrigated crop yield variability was largely explained by precipitation alone and both precipitation and temperature, whereas temperature alone explained irrigated crop yield variability primarily. For instance, temperature only explained irrigated maize yield variability in southwest Nebraska, irrigated sorghum yield variability in Texas Panhandle, and irrigated soybean yield variability in central Nebraska, whereas counties where precipitation only or temperature and precipitation explained irrigated crop yields were minimal. The exact was opposite for non-irrigated crop yields, where temperature and precipitation explained maize yield variability in the eastern Nebraska and precipitation only in the rest of the state, precipitation only explained sorghum yield variability in southern Nebraska, southwest and eastern Nebraska and southeast Colorado, and finally precipitation only primarily explained soybean yield variability.</p>
