<p id="Par26" class="p">We also analyzed which dominant climate factor explained crop yield variability in what percentage of counties, and further how much these counties contribute to the overall Great Plains crop production. These analyses would help us interpret the relative potential impacts of climate factors to the regional food security and eventually, the national food security. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref> presents the percentage of crop growing counties and their contribution to the Great Plains production for each climate factor that dominantly explains crop yield variability. Temperature alone explained yield variability in 14%, 6% and 4% of the maize, sorghum, and soybean growing counties, respectively, which contribute to 26%, 11% and 6% of the total Great Plains production. Precipitation alone, on the other hand explained 7%, 17% 18% of maize, sorghum, and soybean growing counties, which was lower for maize and higher for sorghum and soybean than what was attributed to temperature. The counties where crop yield variability was dominantly explained by precipitation alone contributed to 16%, 49% and 32% of Great Plains’ maize, sorghum and soybean production, respectively. Interestingly, the counties where precipitation explained sorghum (central and western Kansas) and soybean (eastern Nebraska) yield variability contributed to half (sorghum) and a third (soybean) of the Great Plains production, which is substantial. Lastly, temperature and precipitation combined dominantly explained yield variability in 5%, 4% and 9% of maize, sorghum, and soybean growing counties, respectively, which contributed 7%, 7% and 10% to the Great Plains total yield production. Irrigated crop yield variability is explained dominantly by temperature alone for sorghum and soybean, but equally by temperature and precipitation alone for maize. Again, for irrigated sorghum, counties where yield variability was explained by temperature alone were only 3% of irrigated sorghum counties, but they contributed to 21% of the Great Plains irrigated sorghum production. Non-irrigated crop yield variability, as stated earlier, was dominantly explained by precipitation alone for 10%, 8% and 14% of Great Plains counties growing maize, sorghum, and soybean, respectively.
