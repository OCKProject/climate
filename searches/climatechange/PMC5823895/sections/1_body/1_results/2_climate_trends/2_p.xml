<p id="Par19" class="p">Similar to the trends in average temperature, high spatial variability was observed in the precipitation trends across the Great Plains. The highest positive trend (increasing trend or becoming wetter) observed was 30 mm/decade in Marshall County, South Dakota, while the highest negative trend (decreasing trends or becoming drier) was −58 mm/decade in Brazoria County, Texas. For precipitation, 424 counties showed increasing trends, while 410 counties showed decreasing trends, as opposed to temperature trends, where the majority of trends were increasing. The regional averages of the increasing and decreasing trends were 9 mm/decade and −12 mm/decade, respectively. In a very similar manner as the trends in temperature, the geographic distribution of the precipitation trends can be considered of increasing/decreasing trends separated by an imaginary line through northwest edge to southeast edge. In other words, the regions which show warming trends are roughly the same as those show drying trends (decreasing precipitation trends), and the areas with cooling trends (decreasing temperature trends) the ones that show wetting trends (increasing precipitation trends). The proportion of counties where significant trends were found were considerably lower as compared to temperature trends and 8% and 8.5% of the counties showing increasing and decreasing trends, respectively.</p>
