<p id="Par18" class="p">The trends that were observed in average air temperature and total precipitation during the growing season (1
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> May-30
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> September) for 1968–2013 period for each county of the Great Plains region are presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>. It is evident that these trends, like crop yield trends, are characterized by high geographic variability, in both nature and magnitude of the trend. Trends in growing season average temperature varied from a negative (cooling) trend of 0.28 °C/decade in Audubon County, Iowa to a positive (warming) trend of 0.45 °C/decade in Midland County, Texas. The southern and western parts of the region, which included counties in Texas, Colorado, and Wyoming, western parts of Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas, and western and eastern Oklahoma generally showed increasing trends. On the contrary, the northern, central and eastern parts, consisting of counties in the eastern Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas, Central Oklahoma, and Iowa showed negative trends. The regional average of warming trends (for 578 counties that show warming trends) was 0.18 °C/decade, while the regional average of cooling trends (for 256 counties) was −0.08 °C/decade. Of these trends, 51% and 7% county-level trends were statistically significant (
