<p id="Par28" class="p">Sensitivity of irrigated and non-irrigated crop yields to climate factors also varied among each other. Irrigated maize shows positive correlation in western Nebraska, as opposed to the negative correlation in southeastern Nebraska for non-irrigated maize. Sorghum yields show highly negative sensitivity (22%) with temperature rise for both irrigated and non-irrigated conditions in the Texas panhandle, in addition to some counties in southeastern Kansas and southern Texas, showing negative correlation for non-irrigated sorghum. Soybean yields however, show positive correlation with temperature rise in central Nebraska under irrigated conditions, and negative correlation in south-central Nebraska under non-irrigated conditions. Precipitation rise had significant positive sensitivity for almost all counties under non-irrigated conditions, which implies that all rainfed crop yields are benefitted by any increase in precipitation. For irrigated crops, relatively lesser proportion of counties show positive sensitivity, and with lower magnitudes than non-irrigated conditions, with increase in precipitation. Irrigated maize show both positive correlation (in western Nebraska) and negative correlation (in eastern Nebraska), whereas irrigated sorghum and soybean show positive correlations. On average, sensitivity (negative) to temperature of non-irrigated maize was twice that of irrigated maize, however, irrigation did not result in improved (lower) sensitivity in sorghum as the sensitivity of irrigated sorghum was 0.1 times greater than non-irrigated sorghum. Precipitation sensitivity, was higher for non-irrigated yields for all crops, and was 43 times (maize), 3.1 times (sorghum), and 3.6 times (soybean) that of irrigated yields.</p>
