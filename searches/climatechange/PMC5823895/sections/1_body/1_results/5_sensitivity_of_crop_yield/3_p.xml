<p id="Par29" class="p">The manifestation of a climate impact at a location is governed by nature (positive or negative correlation) and magnitude (percentage change in yield) of sensitivity (discussed in the section above) and the climate trends at that location (discussed earlier). There may be locations which are highly sensitive to temperature and/or precipitation, but the actual change in temperature and/or precipitation is low, or vice versa, which will have an impact on the actual effect realized at that location.</p>
