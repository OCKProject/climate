<p id="Par27" class="p">In order to estimate the spatial impacts of individual climate factors on crop yields over the study period, it is necessary to quantify the sensitivity of the crop yields to the climate factors. The sensitivity magnitudes in combination with the climate trends result in actual estimates of climate impacts on crop yields. The sensitivity metric aids to inform the change in crop yields that occur with a unit change in climate factors. In this section, we present magnitude and direction of change in crop yields (as percentage of mean crop yields over 1968–2013 period) per 1 °C increase in temperature and per 10 mm increase in precipitation. Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref> show the sensitivity of crop yields to growing season temperature and precipitation, respectively for the region. Temperature rise was found to negatively affect maize yields in eastern Nebraska and Iowa, with instigating up to 22% decrease in yield with 1 °C rise in temperature. However, in western Nebraska and eastern North Dakota, it positively affected maize yields, implying that temperature rise in these regions is beneficial to crop yields. For sorghum, a positive relationship existed among yields and temperature in Nebraska and western Kansas, while a negative correlation was found in Texas. Soybean crop yields were positively impacted by temperature rise in central Nebraska and eastern South Dakota, whereas they were negatively affected in Kansas. It is noteworthy that the extremes in sensitivity magnitude in either direction were found in sorghum growing regions, ranging from −21% to 17%, which are the highest among the three crops. Precipitation, on the other hand was found to primarily have a positive correlation for maize and sorghum crops, while a negative correlation did exist for soybean. Some key areas where maize yields benefit from precipitation increase are western, central, and northeastern Nebraska, northeastern Iowa, eastern South Dakota, and North Dakota. Similarly, Kansas, southern Nebraska, eastern Colorado, and western and central Oklahoma show positive correlation of sorghum yield with precipitation. Soybean, on the contrary showed both positive and negative correlations with yields, especially in Iowa. Among the three crops, sorghum yields show highest positive sensitivity to precipitation (3%).
