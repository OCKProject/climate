<p id="Par22" class="p">The inter-annual variations in crop yields that can be explained by inter-annual variations in climate are presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>, which shows information for counties with complete data record for grain yield (246 counties for maize, 242 for sorghum, and 225 for soybean). The climate explained a wide range of variation in crop yields, ranging from no explanation to 52% variability explained across counties. Averaged across the counties where either temperature or precipitation had statistically significant impacts, 18, 23, and 23% of the variability in maize, sorghum, and soybean were explained by climate variability. For maize, the counties along the boundary adjoining northeast Nebraska and southeast South Dakota primarily showed relatively higher (&gt;20%) explanation of maize yield variation by climate variation. The soybean CEYV is highly variable most of the counties show small (&lt;10%) and moderate (10–20%) CEYV, especially in Kansas and Texas Panhandle. For soybean yields, most of the highest CEYV magnitudes were found in Kansas and northeast Nebraska. Most of the counties in Iowa showed small to medium magnitudes of CEYV (0–20%).
