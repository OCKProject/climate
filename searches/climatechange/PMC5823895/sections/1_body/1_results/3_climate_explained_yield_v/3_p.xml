<p id="Par23" class="p">Irrigated and non-irrigated crops differed in the degree of explanation of their yield variability by climate variability. The contrasting representation of the CEYV in irrigated and non-irrigated crops in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> evidently signifies these differences. These differences can be better highlighted by averaging and comparing CEYV magnitudes across the mutual counties (possess data for both irrigated and non-irrigated CEYV). The analyses revealed that irrigated and non-irrigated maize showed CEYV of 8% and 41%, respectively, with the latter being 436% higher than the former. Similarly, CEYV in non-irrigated sorghum (23%) and non-irrigated soybean (35%) yield was 160% and 728% higher than irrigated sorghum (9%) and irrigated soybean (4%). This suggests that the irrigated cropping systems are relatively robust to encounter climate variability than their non-irrigated counterparts in that irrigation practices are effective drought-mitigation strategy in term of maintaining grain yield and non-irrigated yields are substantially more vulnerable to climate impact(s) on yields.
