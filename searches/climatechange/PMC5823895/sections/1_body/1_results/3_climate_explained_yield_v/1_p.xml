 <sup class="sup">2</sup> of the county-specific models of yield residuals and climate residuals indicates the degree of variability in crop yields that can be explained by climate variability. At what locations and by what degree the climate variability was responsible for variability in crop yields was highly site-specific, crop-specific, and irrigation class-specific (i.e., irrigated or non-irrigated). We present the results of these analyses for each crop, which further include the pooled general crop datasets and irrigation-based classification (irrigated and non-irrigated).
