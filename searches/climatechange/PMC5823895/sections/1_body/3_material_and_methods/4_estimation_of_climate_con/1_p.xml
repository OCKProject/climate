<p id="Par45" class="p">A series of steps and computations were involved in quantifying the contribution of climate towards trends in crop yields (climate-driven yield trends). Since the climate dataset was complete in all regards (all 834 counties and all 46 years), the analyses were restricted by the availability of crop yield records. It was decided that the analyses be performed for only those counties which had continuous crop yield data for all years during the study period (1968–2013). Since the analysis was primarily statistical, missing data were not included in the analyses keeping in mind the potential errors it can introduce into the analyses. The following procedure outlines the constituent steps involved:
 <list list-type="bullet" class="list">
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p id="Par46" class="p">The county-level crop yields were detrended using linear regression, with crop yield as the dependent variable and time (year) as the independent variable. This was done to remove the effects of non-climatic variables from the raw time series of yield records. Primarily, the non-climatic variables include technological improvements, genetic advancements, and crop and soil management improvements. This step considers inter-annual sensitivity to climate/weather factors as a proxy for sensitivity to long-term changes in climate, which is widely accepted practice for scientific studies that have similar natures to ours

     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>
    </sup>. Detrending results in crop yield residuals (kg ha
    <sup class="sup">−1</sup> yr
    <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), which would be used in the further calculations.

   <p id="Par47" class="p">Similarly, the county level climate variables (growing season T
    <sub class="sub">avg</sub> (averaged from May 1
    <sup class="sup">st</sup> to September 30
    <sup class="sup">th</sup>) and growing season total P (summed from May 1
    <sup class="sup">st</sup> to September 30
    <sup class="sup">th</sup>) were detrended using each of the climate variables as the dependent variables and time as the independent variable. Consequently, this resulted in T

    <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and mm yr
    <sup class="sup">−1</sup>)

  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p id="Par48" class="p">Using multiple linear regression, the yield residuals were regressed against climate residuals. The purpose of this step was the evaluation of sensitivity of yields to individual climate variables. The resulting slope coefficients from these analyses represent yield increments per unit change (or sensitivity) in the T
    <sub class="sub">avg</sub> (kg ha
    <sup class="sup">−1</sup> °C
    <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and P (kg ha
    <sup class="sup">−1</sup> mm
    <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). Also, the coefficient of determination (R
    <sup class="sup">2</sup>) for the regression provides information about what magnitudes of variability in yields can be explained by variability in climate (i.e., temperature and precipitation) for different counties (or climate explained yield variability, CEYV). Moreover, statistical significance of the impacts of individual climate variables on yields was also tested at 90% confidence interval.

  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p id="Par49" class="p">The multiple regression coefficients derived from afore-explained steps were multiplied with the climate trends (°C yr
    <sup class="sup">−1</sup> or mm yr

    <sup class="sup">−1</sup> yr
    <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). Further, total change in yield during the study period that was attributed to climate was calculated by multiplying the obtained values by the number of study years (46).

  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p id="Par50" class="p">Mean county-level yields during the study period were calculated to represent average levels of yields obtained in a particular county. The contribution of individual climate variables towards yield trends were represented (in percent) as the ratio of absolute change in climate-attributed yield to the county-average yield as well as region-average yield. This was done to represent the proportion of changes in yields due to climate trends relative to average yield of a county and whether the climate impact on yield was positive or negative.</p>

   <p id="Par51" class="p">Finally, the climate-induced yield trend was divided by overall yield trend for the period 1968–2013 for each relevant county to quantify the relative importance of climate in the overall yield trends.</p>
