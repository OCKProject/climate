<p id="Par44" class="p">We focused on the trends that occurred in crop yields and growing season climatic variables (average air temperature, T
 <sub class="sub">avg</sub>, and precipitation, P) during the period of 1968–2013. Trends were calculated for county level maize, soybean, and sorghum yields (kg ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and county averaged T
 <sub class="sub">avg</sub> (°C yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and P (mm yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) during the crop growing season (May 1
 <sup class="sup">st</sup>- September 30
 <sup class="sup">th</sup>) using linear regression analysis. Qualitatively, these trends in yield and climate can be realized as the direction of change in these values over the 46-year period, whereas in quantitative terms, the trends are slope of the linear regression analysis performed with yield or climate on the ordinate and the time (year) on the abscissa. This process resulted into 2,502 regressions for yield (834 counties × 3 crops) and 1,668 regressions for climate (834 counties × 2 variables). The outcomes of these regression analyses, including both directions and magnitudes of the trends were represented using maps, to better observe the trends in a spatial context, and acknowledge the extent of variability that occurs in both yield and climate change on spatial scales.
