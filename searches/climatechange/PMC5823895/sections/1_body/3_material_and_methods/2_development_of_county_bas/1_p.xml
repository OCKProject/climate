<p id="Par43" class="p">For the purpose of exploration and investigation of impacts of climate on the agricultural crop yields, it is crucial that both datasets (climate and crop yields) are at the same spatial and temporal scales, hence rendering them suitable for inter-comparison. These scales have to be appropriate in terms of space and time so that the resulting climatic impacts are represented in a detailed, consistent, and relatable manner. In this study, a county has been chosen as an appropriate scale to investigate and report the findings. This is because several other sets of information such as commodity prices, crop yields, fertilizer inputs and management practices are reported on county-level basis. Thus, quantifying climate impacts on agricultural production on a county basis results in increased potential for the application of these findings by the state and federal agencies working in the disciplines of agriculture and natural resource conservation. Air temperature and precipitation surfaces (datasets) used in this study were developed by

 </sup> using over 800 sites for inverse distance weighing (IDW) interpolation technique in ArcGIS 10.2. We computed zone-based (counties) values from these spatial datasets using zonal statistics tool in ArcGIS 10.2. These operations resulted in a database of county-averaged growing season mean temperature and growing season total precipitation for all 834 counties in the study region for the period of 1968â€“2013, which is consistent with the crop yield dataset.
