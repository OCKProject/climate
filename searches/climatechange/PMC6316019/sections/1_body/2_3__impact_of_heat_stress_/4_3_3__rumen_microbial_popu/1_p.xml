<p class="p">Heat stress induced rumen function impairment is mainly associated with an increase of 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococcus</italic> genus bacteria and a decrease in the bacteria of 
 <italic class="italic">Fibrobactor</italic> genus [
 <xref rid="B31-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Further, Tajima et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] also reported these changes along with altered rumen bacterial diversity with a decrease in uncultivated Cluster E group sequences during heat stress. Similarly, Uyeno et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] observed a decrease in the 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococcus</italic> genus and an increase in both 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococcus</italic> spp. and 
 <italic class="italic">Clostridium coccoidesâ€“Eubacterium</italic> genus in the rumen. Changes in the rumen microbial ecosystem due to heat exposure can influence feed digestibility and composition of the end products by altering the rumen fermentation pattern [
 <xref rid="B32-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Further, Bernabucci et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] observed a decline in the concentrations of amylolytic and cellulolytic bacteria in animals exposed to ambient conditions having a temperature humidity index (THI) 85. The decreased dry matter intake and passage rate in heat stressed animals could reduce the bacterial diversity ultimately culminating in decreased diet digestibility [
 <xref rid="B9-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. There are few research reports available on how high ambient temperature selectively affects microbial population. However, this impact could be attributed to the sensitivity of certain rumen microbes to increased temperature exposure.
