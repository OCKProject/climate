<p class="p">Ionophore supplementation is another extensively researched CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> abatement strategy. Ionophores cause a shift in the rumen fermentation pattern from acetate and butyrate production to propionate by increasing the gram-positive bacteria population, resulting in decreasing the production of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> [

 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production was observed on addition of 10% encapsulated fumarate to the diet without any negative effect on animal growth [
