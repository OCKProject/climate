<p class="p">Microbial feed additives are another important nutritional intervention in the CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> mitigation studies. Apart from the effects on CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> mitigation, probiotic feeding can improve the growth performance of meat animals and it can also reduce the incidence of diarrhoea [
 <xref rid="B67-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. However, studies proving the efficiency of direct fed probiotics to reduce the production of enteric CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> are few [
 <xref rid="B68-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. The same authors also reported that nitrate as feed additive can reduce rumen methanogenesis in different ruminant species and production conditions [
 <xref rid="B68-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. Chaucheyras-Durand et al. [
 <xref rid="B69-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>] showed that yeast cells can reduce the production of enteric CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> by deviating hydrogen atoms from methanogens to acetogenic strains of ruminal bacteria to enhance the production of acetate. Yeasts such as

 <italic class="italic">Propionibacterium</italic> spp. and 
 <italic class="italic">Megasphaera elsdenii</italic> can decrease rumen methanogenesis when included in the diet as supplements [

 <xref rid="B61-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>] found that replacing ordinary rice feed with red yeast rice, which is a traditional Chinese culinary and medicinal product, resulted in a 13% reduction in CH
