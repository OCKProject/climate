<p class="p">Although several anti-methonogenic compounds are well proved in terms of their CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> reduction potential, certain individual components have antinutritional properties that inhibit their commercial usage. However, data obtained from anti-methonogenic supplementation studies are good models and they can pave a way towards effective CH

 <xref rid="B61-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. Abecia et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] conducted an experiment in Murciano-Granadina lactating goats to evaluate the potential of bromochloromethane (BCM) complex to reduce enteric CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production and they observed 32% reduction in BCM fed goats as compared to the control group. In another experiment conducted in Murciano-Granadina goats, Martínez-Fernández et al. [
 <xref rid="B62-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>] observed 33% and 64% methane reduction per kg of dry matter intake with propyl propane thiosulfinate (PTS) and BCM supplementation, respectively. Further, Murciano–Granadina goats supplemented with PTS and BCM decreased CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production by 48% and 98%, respectively, which was attributed to the redirection of H

 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production to propionate metabolic pathways [
 <xref rid="B63-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. Similarly, Mitsumori et al. [
 <xref rid="B64-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>] also reported 71% and 91% reductions in CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production in Shiba Japanese goats supplemented with 2 g/100 kg Live Weight and 5 g/100 kg LW of BCM, respectively. Candyrine et al. [
 <xref rid="B65-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>] conducted a study on Saanen goats with three levels of lovastatin (naturally produced from fermentation of palm kernel with 
 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus terreus</italic>) supplementation and the authors observed 7.8%, 20% and 21% CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> reduction for low (2 mg lovastatin/kg BW/day), medium (4 mg lovastatin/kg BW/day) and high (6 mg lovastatin/kg BW/day) treatment groups, respectively. Further, Azlan et al. [
 <xref rid="B66-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>] reported 32% reduction in enteric CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production when supplementing Boer crossbred goats with 14 mg/kg BW of lovastatin produced from rice straw treated with
