 <sub class="sub">4</sub> and this is mainly due to change of fermented substrate from fibre to starch [
 <xref rid="B48-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. In an experiment conducted on Murciano-Granadina goats in late lactation, Ibáñez et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>] observed a lower CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production in goats fed with concentrate (ground corn) diet than beet pulp fed goats. However, concentrate feeding beyond a certain limit is not appreciable as it can cause severe damage to the animal itself and to its production performance. In addition, grains that may be used for concentrates are more valuable for human feeds in arid and semi-arid regions where much of the global goat production is located.
