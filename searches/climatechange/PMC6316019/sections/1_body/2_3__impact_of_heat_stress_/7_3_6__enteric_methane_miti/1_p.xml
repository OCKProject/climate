<p class="p">Apart from its major role in global warming and the greenhouse effect, enteric CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> is also considered as a dietary energy loss of around 2â€“12% in ruminants. Consequently, the global scientific community is targeting the development of suitable CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> mitigation strategies to reduce both global warming and dietary energy loss. The various strategies that can be implemented to mitigate enteric CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> include feeding feed sources containing plant secondary metabolites, ration manipulation, fat and oil supplementation, bacteriocin supplementation, rumen modification, etc. [
