<p class="p">Selection of genetically superior animals with less CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production per unit feed intake is another management strategy that can be employed to reduce CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production from the ruminants [
 <xref rid="B92-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>]. The direct selection of low CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> producing animals is practically impossible because of high cost for measuring CH
 <sub class="sub">4.</sub> However, selection is possible through the indirect means such as rumen digesta retention time and feed intake [
 <xref rid="B80-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. Genetic selection of goats with higher feed conversion efficiency generates a reduced amount of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>. Further, genetic selection for the less CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production indirectly helps the farmer to increase their profits without any extra carbon credits by increasing the feed conversion efficiency and growth rate per animal [
 <xref rid="B92-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>]. A 3â€“10% reduction in CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production can be achieved through improving the feed use efficiency by 10% [
