<p class="p">In the majority of regions around the globe, goats are raised under continuous grazing systems, where animals have ad libitum access to pasture. However, unrestricted access to the pasture can result in the elimination of edible pasture and the domination of less edible pasture due to the uncontrolled selective grazing [

 <sub class="sub">4</sub> and to improve productivity. In these systems, grazing land is divided into different paddocks that are alternatively grazed and rested until the pasture restores its quality. A continuous supply of uniform quality feed throughout the year enables animals to increase their production and to decrease CH
