<p class="p">Reductions in enteric CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production can be achieved through efficient pasture management practices in goats. Feeding animals high quality fodder can reduce the wastage of dietary energy. Improving quality of the forage also increases feed intake and reduces the retention time of digesta in the rumen, thereby stimulating energetically more efficient post-ruminal digestion and decreases the percentage of energy transformed to CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> [
 <xref rid="B79-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]. Sejian et al. [
 <xref rid="B82-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>] reported a reduced CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emission in animals fed with high quality fodder as compared to animals consuming low quality fodder. Reductions in enteric CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production can also be achieved through feeding high quality fodder with higher soluble carbohydrates and lower fibre or through grazing on less-matured pastures [
 <xref rid="B48-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="B79-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]. Harvesting or grazing of forage at early stages of maturity also reduces the plant cell wall lignification, thereby increasing digestibility and reducing the CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emission per unit of digestible dry matter [
 <xref rid="B83-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>]. Similarly, Pinares-Pati√±o et al. [
 <xref rid="B84-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>] conducted a grazing experiment in timothy pasture at four different vegetative phases, namely, early vegetative stage, heading, flowering and senescence, and they observed lower CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production only at heading stage, which confirms the significance of growth stages of forage in CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production. Waghorn and Hegarty [
 <xref rid="B85-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>] calculated that animals grazing on high quality pasture (20% higher ME value) may show a reduction in enteric CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production of approximately 50%. Likewise, animals consuming certain high quality tropical and temperate legumes show reduced enteric CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production, as the legumes contain condensed tannins that are toxic to methanogenic archaea, ciliate protozoa, and fibre degrading bacteria [
 <xref rid="B86-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>]. Further, the grasses with high concentrations of water-soluble carbohydrates have been investigated as suitable tool to reduce enteric CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emission from the ruminant livestock [
 <xref rid="B87-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>]. De Ramus et al. [
 <xref rid="B88-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>] reported 22% reduction in enteric CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production annually through the efficient use of grazed forage crops through management-intensive grazing. Furthermore, around 5% reduction in enteric CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production is possible through improving total tract NDF digestibility [
 <xref rid="B53-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Archimede et al. [
 <xref rid="B89-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>] reported 17% more CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production from animals fed with C4 grasses than the animals fed with C3 grasses.
