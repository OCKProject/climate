<p class="p">Improving management strategies not only reduces enteric methane emission but also helps to improve animal productivity [

 <xref rid="B80-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. In subsistence production systems, reduction in the herd size allows distribution of adequate amount of feed and proper veterinary care to all animals. Additionally, selective culling can reduce CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production both per unit of animal product and for the total herd [
 <xref rid="B81-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. However, in some subsistence farming systems, there may be insufficient high breeding value animals to allow selective culling. Slaughter weight of goats can be advanced at a young age through early finishing approaches. This can potentially reduce the lifetime net CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions, thus making available proportionally few CH
