<p class="p">Another plausible method of biological control of methanogens is the use of CH

 <sub class="sub">4</sub> reduction. Another novel approach for enteric CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> reduction is through the genetic modification of fermentation characteristics of rumen bacteria. However, research is still in the preliminary stages and very little progress has been made pertaining to applying the molecular techniques to characterize and quantify the microbial populations [
