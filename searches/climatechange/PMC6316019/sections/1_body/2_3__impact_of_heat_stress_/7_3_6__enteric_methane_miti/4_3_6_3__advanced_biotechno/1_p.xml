<p class="p">The inhibition of enteric CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emission in ruminant animals is possible though biotechnological interventions. One of the possible future strategies to reduce enteric CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production is to immunize the animals against their own methanogens. In an experiment conducted in Australia using vaccines against three selected methanogens, Wright et al. [
 <xref rid="B94-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>] reported 8% reduction in CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production. However, another experiment conducted in different geographical zone with vaccines prepared using different set of bacteria could not elicit any positive response [
 <xref rid="B94-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>]. The reasons for the immunization failures could be due to the variation in rumen methanogenic diversity present in the animals raised in different conditions and the replacement of the biological niche left by the targeted species by another methanogen [
 <xref rid="B95-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">95</xref>]. CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> inhibition was also attempted through oral supplementation IgY as a feed additive [
 <xref rid="B96-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>]. Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B97-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">97</xref>] conducted an experiment in Boer goats to evaluate the efficiency of a candidate vaccine protein (EhaF) on the rumen methanogens and microbes but did not find any changes in CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production among control and vaccinated goats. However, vaccination influenced the composition of rumen bacteria.
