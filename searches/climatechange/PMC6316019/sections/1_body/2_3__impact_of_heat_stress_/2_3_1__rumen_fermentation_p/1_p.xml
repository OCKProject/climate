<p class="p">Environmental factors such as temperature and relative humidity (RH) can have significant role in the feed consumption of animals. An increase in temperature and RH decreases the dry matter intake of the animals and rumination as a result of increased amount of buffering agents entering the rumen and this could be attributed to the reduced chewing activity [
