 <xref rid="B29-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Similarly, Tajima et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] reported a decrease in acetate and acetate to propionate ratio and an increase in butyrate level in heat stressed animals, which they attributed to alterations in the number of rumen microbiota during the periods of heat stress. Likewise, Hirayama et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] reported a reduction in plasma acetate and VFA concentrations in heat exposed (35 °C) Saanen goats compared to Saanen goats kept under thermoneutral conditions (20 °C). They attributed these changes to reduced feed intake and rumen microbial diversity. Further, in a study conducted in indigenous goat breeds, we [
 <xref rid="B28-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] reported a reduced production of acetate concentrations in heat exposed Osmanabadi and Malabari goats, whereas the Salem goats did not exhibit any change. In the same experiment, we also observed an increase in propionate concentration in the Salem black goats and a decline in the propionate production in Malabari goats. These variations in the heat stress response could be explained by the differences in the adaptive capability among the breeds, suggesting Salem black as the superior adaptive breed in the climate change scenario. Further, Chaidanya et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] reported a reduction in VFA concentrations in rumen of goats exposed to high ambient temperature coupled with high relative humidity. The reduction in the VFA concentration could be attributed to the increased rumen temperature during the heat stress periods.
