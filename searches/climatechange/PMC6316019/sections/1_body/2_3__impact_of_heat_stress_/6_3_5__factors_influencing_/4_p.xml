<p class="p">Breed is another important factor that determines enteric CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production [
 <xref rid="B43-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. These breed-to-breed differences in enteric CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production could be attributed to their variation in body size, adaptation, rumen volume and the variation in the feed intake [
 <xref rid="B43-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Rumen associated factors such as rumen pH, type of volatile fatty acids fermented, type of substrates fermented, rate of fermentation, absorption capacity of rumen wall, and rumen protozoa concentration determine the level of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production [
 <xref rid="B44-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Rumen methanogens remove H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> molecules that are synthesized during the organic matter fermentation produced during fermentation of organic matter in the hind gut and rumen and produce CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> [
 <xref rid="B45-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Further, the increased production of propionate decreases the CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production by consuming H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> molecules [
 <xref rid="B46-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>].
