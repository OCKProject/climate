<p class="p">Composition of feed is the primary factor that determines the rumen fermentation pattern and enteric methane emissions [
 <xref rid="B37-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Further, the propionate to acetate ratio also influences the rumen fermentation pattern and is determined by the concentrate to forage content of the diets [
 <xref rid="B38-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. In comparison with roughage feed, concentrates contain less structural carbohydrates, so the intake of concentrates may increase the production of propionate and decrease the production of acetate, ultimately resulting in reduced CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production. An increase in concentrate intake is associated with increased propionate production and this may reduce the number of H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> atoms available to the methanogenic bacteria, again resulting in reduced methane production. However, the higher level of concentrate feeding can cause sub-acute acidosis, both sub-clinical and clinical, which may adversely impact normal ruminal fermentation processes through both alteration of the functions of essential rumen microbes and impaired VFA absorption due to low ruminal pH [
