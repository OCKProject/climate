<p class="p">Geographic location and climate are known to be the most crucial factors significantly affecting CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production and this could be due to ambient temperature differences as well as difference in feed resources available [
 <xref rid="B44-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Animals reared in arid and semi-arid regions have been reported to produce less CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production compared with animals in temperate regions, and this could be due to the differences in the type or amount of feed consumed in different locations [
 <xref rid="B44-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Among the climate variables temperature, humidity, solar radiation and wind velocity are the important variables that influences CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production. Increased ambient temperature coupled with high relative humidity (RH) directly affects CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production by altering the rumen fermentation profile and indirectly by altering the quality of pasture or forage [
 <xref rid="B46-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Although heat stress may reduce the feed intake, the increased methane emission could still be attributed to the heat stress associated negative impact on feed digestibility by inhibiting the rumen microbial populations that are essential for the normal digestion process. The various factors influencing enteric methane production from goats are summarized in
