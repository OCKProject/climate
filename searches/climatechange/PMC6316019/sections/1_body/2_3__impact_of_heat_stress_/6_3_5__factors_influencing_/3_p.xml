<p class="p">In recent years, the usage of microbial feed additives has increased to improve growth performance of meat animals. In addition, some microbial feed additives have been used to reduce CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production in ruminant animals. Malik et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] used acetogens as a feed additive to replace prominent CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>-producing methanogenic bacteria to reduce enteric methane production by acting as alternate hydrogen. The prominent CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>-producing methanogenic bacteria have a low H
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> threshold level, thus do not allow the naturally resident acetogens to utilize hydrogen. Other feed additives such as fat and oil supplements have also been reported to have an effect on the rumen fermentation profile, thereby reducing rumen protozoan population and CH
