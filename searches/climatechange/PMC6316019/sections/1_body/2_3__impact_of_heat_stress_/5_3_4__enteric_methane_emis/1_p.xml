<p class="p">Environmental temperature is a key factor that determines CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production, since feed intake and digestibility differ with ambient temperature. Mbanzamihigo et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] reported an increase in enteric CH

Similarly, in another experiment conducted in young wethers grazing a moist hilly island pasture, a perennial rye grass/white clover dominant pasture and a late summer season pasture showed CH

 <sub class="sub">4</sub> yield in wethers grazing late summer season pastures is attributed to the quality deterioration (poor dry matter digestibility, lower protein and soluble carbohydrate content and increased cell wall content) of the pastures during the summer season [
