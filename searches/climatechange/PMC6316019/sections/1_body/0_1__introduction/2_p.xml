<p class="p">A changing climate scenario for extensive grazing systems exposes the animals to various types of stressors that may affect their production, health and survival [
 <xref rid="B6-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Among these, heat stress seems to be the major stressor which negatively influences the animal performance [
 <xref rid="B7-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Furthermore, heat stress can also affect the digestion and rumen fermentation pattern of goats which contributes to the reduction in production performance [
 <xref rid="B8-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The ability of an animal to cope and adapt itself to a changing climate depends on maintaining appropriate functioning of the rumen and ruminal microbes [
 <xref rid="B9-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Elevated ambient temperature may prove detrimental to these processes and may ultimately result in influencing the level of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production particularly with respect to the intensity of its production in goat and this will require appropriate mitigation strategies to curtail such emissions to sustain goat production in the changing climate scenario [
 <xref rid="B8-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Given that goats are considered more climate resilient than other ruminant species, research efforts are therefore needed to understand goat productivity during exposure to high ambient temperatures. This review is therefore an attempt to collate and synthesize existing knowledge and recent research pertaining to the effects of heat stress on rumen fermentation, enteric CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions, and the various mechanisms associated with CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production and its mitigation in goats.
