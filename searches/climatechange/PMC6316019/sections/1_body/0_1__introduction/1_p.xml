<p class="p">Morphologically versatile goat species with unique browsing potential adapt to a changing climate more readily than other ruminant species and consequently they continue to be an important source of income and nutrition to many poor and marginal farmers around the world [
 <xref rid="B1-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Goats are also the major means of employment and income for women, children and aged people in tropical and subtropical regions [
 <xref rid="B2-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. The important sources of income from the sector include milk, meat, manure, wool and skin [
 <xref rid="B3-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Small ruminant, and in particular goat, farming is very important because of the relatively low input requirements and the corresponding high expected output [
 <xref rid="B4-animals-08-00235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Furthermore, goats emit less enteric methane (CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>) than all other domestic ruminant animals per unit body weight [
