<p class="p">But how can one promote long-term thinking so that people in their actions effectively cross the borders of time? We offer two solutions. One is to emphasize that the young and vulnerable are the ones who deal with these futures. Indeed, the combination of “young” and “vulnerable” is especially able to trigger empathy—for example, the suffering of one young puppy can enhance empathy, sometimes even more than the suffering of other human beings (

 <xref rid="bibr25-0963721417753945" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nowak, 2006</xref>), and therefore kinship cues should be relatively effective in crossing the borders of time (e.g.,

 <xref rid="bibr31-0963721417753945" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Schelling, 1995</xref>). The recommendation therefore is to include children in public education campaigns for increasing awareness of climate change. Children serve the cue of vulnerability and trigger the need for caring and protection. In doing so, intergenerational unfairness could also be conveyed—the truism that irreversible harm is imposed by us on future generations (who have not harmed us in any way).
