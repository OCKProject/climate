   <p class="p">On the whole, precipitation in the northern region is decreasing in the summer and autumn and, in the southern region, it is decreasing in the spring and autumn while increasing in the summer and winter. Precipitation changes faster in the southern region than that in the northern region. This change in the southern region are contributing to rainfall misdistribution between seasons. Annual variation is unevenly distributed in the southern region.</p>

   <p class="p">The results show that extreme precipitation is strengthening in the southern region. This may contribute to reinforce the precipitation pattern of the “southern flood and northern drought.” Based on the GLM analyzing, Wang et al. considered that this phenomenon is mainly affected by the warming tendency on a large-scale [

   <p class="p">Combined CDD with CWD indicators, we can see that both of these two indexes are growing in the Tibetan Plateau despite the fact that this region is the high value center of these two indexes. This means that precipitation distributed concentration is on a temporal scale. In other words, the wet-season and dry seasons are more clearly divided in the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
