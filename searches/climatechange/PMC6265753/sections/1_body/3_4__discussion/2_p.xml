<p class="p">On the whole, a warming tendency is observed in all seasons nationwide (except for some central regions where temperature descended in the spring). Specifically, the northern region has a greater temperature rise than the south. The warming is faster in the winter and the spring than in the summer and autumn. Therefore, this phenomenon may lead to reduced gaps in temperature spatially between the north and south as well as temporally among the four seasons.

   <p class="p">Similar results are reported in some other works. Yan et al. [
    <xref rid="B23-ijerph-15-02540" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] conducted a wavelet analysis for a day-by-day temperature change and fluctuation in Europe and China during the last 100 years and results showed that seasonal fluctuations lessened under the influence of global warming.

   <p class="p">In our research, the warm day indicator increased and the cool night indicator decreased, which indicates that extreme hot weather in the daytime is enhancing and extreme cold weather in the nighttime is weakening. Some research deemed that the latter indicator changes faster than the former, which leads to a narrower diurnal temperature variation [

   <p class="p">At the same time, a cold spell duration indicator is continuing to decrease in the western inland areas and increase in the eastern region while the warm spell duration indicator has the opposite trend. This phenomenon gives rise to a narrower regional temperature difference between eastern and western inland areas.</p>
