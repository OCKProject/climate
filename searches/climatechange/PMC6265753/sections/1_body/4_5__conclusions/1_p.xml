<p class="p">This research analyzes and discusses the temporal and spatial variation characteristic of temperature, precipitation, and extreme weather, which can draw a conclusion that, for a temperature change, a warming tendency is observed in all seasons nationwide and the spatial-temporal change shows temperature gaps spatially narrows between the north and the south as well as temporally among the four seasons. In addition, an extreme temperature shares the similar change trend, performance as a narrower regional temperature difference between Eastern and Western China, and a narrower diurnal temperature variation. For precipitation change, it shows as a misdistribution between seasons in the southern region. Extreme precipitation change emphasizes the precipitation pattern of the “southern flood and northern drought” is strengthening. Additionally, we consider that climate change potentially narrowed the temperature gap and widened the precipitation gap on a temporal and spatial scale in China. This is a preliminary study for recognizing critical meteorological elements and key regions for responding to climate change. In addition, further research should pay more attention to more meteorological elements and conduct analysis combined with the influence on the socio-economic level, the agricultural level, and the ecosystem. While in this study, the major shifts in policy or technology are not considered. This will be improved in our future study.</p>
