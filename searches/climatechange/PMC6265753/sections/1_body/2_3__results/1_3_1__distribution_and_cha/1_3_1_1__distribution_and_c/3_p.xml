 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02540-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref> illustrates a seasonal temperature change and fluctuation during the 60-year period. In the spring, the temperature decreased in Southern China and grew in the north and west regions, which indicates that cold regions are getting warmer and hot regions are cooling. In the summertime, the temperature demonstrates a rising tendency except in central China where a cooling process is observed. Furthermore, Hei Longjiang, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Gansu, Xinjiang, and Tibet are found to have a relative high rate of a temperature rise at 0.26–0.43 °C/10a. In the autumn, there is almost a uniform warming tendency except in several cities in the central region and a higher warming rate is observed in the northern region. In the winter, the temperature change is similar to that in autumn and the overall warming rate is higher than in the summer and in autumn.
