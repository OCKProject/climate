Better awareness of climate change on urban and regional scale are essential for actively responding to the adverse effects of climate change that is necessary for reducing fatalities and injuries to a large extent. Our research collects and arranges 60 yearsâ€™ daily meteorological data in China and calculates the spatial distribution and temporal variation characteristic of climatic elements on a city scale. Based on the assessment, we formulate and describe the characteristics of climatic change in China. This paper presents preliminary work for clearing and delimiting the critical regions and cities for combating climate change and providing some data supports.
