<p class="p">The percentile threshold method defines the threshold of extreme weather though a relative percentile-based temperature or precipitation indices. WMO has used this method to confirm the extreme weather threshold value (such as 1%, 5% as its maximum or minimum value) on its published climatological data, which exceeds the threshold value. This is considered climatic extremes. Percentile-based temperature/precipitation indices are emphasizing the need to remove the small probability of unusual weather from the climate mean state to predict the real extreme weather. Percentile-based indices are facing a wide geographical range. This method underlines the peculiarity of variations from region to region when evaluating the extreme weather.</p>
