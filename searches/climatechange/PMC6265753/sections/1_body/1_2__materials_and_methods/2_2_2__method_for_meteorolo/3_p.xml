<p class="p">(2) Analyzing the variation tendency. A linear regression model is used to detect climate changes in trend by using the ordinary least squares (OLS) method. In this method, the linear relationship between a dependent variable (
 <italic class="italic">y</italic>) and an independent variable (
 <italic class="italic">x</italic>) is calculated below [
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-15-02540" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. 
 <disp-formula class="disp-formula">
  <italic class="italic">y</italic> = α + β
  <italic class="italic">x</italic> + ε   
  <italic class="italic">x</italic> = 1, 2, …, 
  <italic class="italic">n</italic> (year)
  <label class="label">(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> in which α is the intercept, β is the slope, and ε is the error term. When β &gt; 0 (or β &lt; 0), it stands that the evaluative feature is increasing (or decreasing).
