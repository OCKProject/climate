After basic cleansing, we use the ArcGIS10.1 (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA) to interpolate the station data on the whole country scale and then analyze the climate element changing in time sequence by using the least square method. Annual and seasonal distinction is considered, which is divided into December to next February as winter, March to May as spring, June to August as summer, and September to November as autumn.
