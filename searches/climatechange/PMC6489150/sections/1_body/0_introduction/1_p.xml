<p class="p">Climate change is real, evident and convincing. Significant research has been conducted on climate change and its impact on human health, revealing the vulnerability of developing nations to the phenomenon (Haines et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). The changing climate is evident by rising sea level, increasing temperatures, hydrological cycle modification and increased climate variability (droughts, hailstorms, floods and extreme heat, cold and veld fires). Many such extreme weather events significantly impact human health. Among the key health risks identifiable are air pollution, increased susceptibility to infectious and animal vectors causing diseases, food and water stress as well as displacement of population. Such health risks cause malnutrition, with more than 18% of the affected population in developing nations (Food and Agricultural Organisation [FAO] 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). The reasons for such health risks include weak public health systems (Ford 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) coupled with high poverty levels and inequality, low technology use and innovation and weak institutions that exacerbate vulnerability (Walpole, Rasanathan &amp; Campbell-Lendrum 
 <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). To this end, if climate change impacts are not dealt with intensively, they could hinder the attainment of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) in general (Nhamo 
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>) and those SDGs related to health.
