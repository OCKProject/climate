<p class="p">Climate change is prompted to exacerbate infectious, food and vector-borne diseases, and other communicable diseases (Campbell-Lendrum et al.

 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) observations, climate change will negatively impact access to health services and nutritional security. Such health impacts may be direct, through the outbreak of diseases among the human population, or can be indirect, in terms of outbreaks that impact plants and domesticated animals (Springmann et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). These negative impacts on the health system will likely affect trade, agriculture and ultimately food security. This has raised concern to focus on the spread and future distribution of infectious diseases with population increase and mobility (Tatem 
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). The changing climate is also known for causing environmental pollution that threatens human health. Accumulation of harmful chemicals in human bodies through air, food and water may lead to diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancers and diabetes (Depledge et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Other adverse impacts include threat to food availability and water security, all with repercussions on human health.
