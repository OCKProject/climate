<p class="p">Africa is more vulnerable to climate change because of increased exposure to environmental threats resulting from the changes in global environment, increasing population growth and low adaptive capacity (Hajat et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). This leads to two assumptions: firstly, the wide range of health impacts on human health and, secondly, the need to develop appropriate adaptation strategies in the face of the changing climate. Impacts of the changing climate on human health are either direct or indirect. Among the direct impacts are extreme weather events such as cold spells, heat waves, cyclones, droughts and hailstorms (Louis &amp; Hess 
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). Indirect impacts include air pollution, infectious and vector-borne diseases, and all these affect human health (Haines et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>). Adaptation can be defined as the ‘ability of a system (policies, projects and programs) to reduce vulnerability to impacts of climate change’ (Papadaskalopoulou et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>:96). Adaptive capacity in this context refers to the ability of countries to engage in adaptation. To reduce the negative effects of climate change, appropriate and sound adaptation strategies must be employed. The adaption options can be drawn on a range of possible technological, behavioural changes and socio-economic status and among these are improved surveillance of infectious epidemic diseases in potential areas, early warning systems for human health, health vulnerability assessments to climate change, public health and environmental education and institutional coordination and disaster preparedness.
