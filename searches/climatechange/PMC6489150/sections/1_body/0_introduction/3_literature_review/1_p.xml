<p class="p">According to Haines et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>), climate change is reportedly claiming over 150 000 lives and 5.5 million disability-adjusted life years per year since 1970 globally. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has estimated further deterioration of the health sector in the near future. The Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC-AR5 concluded that, globally, rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns were linked to a range of health outcomes (IPCC 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Climate change-related alterations in weather and climate patterns would affect many determinants of health like thermal stress, floods, storms, droughts, bushfires, and food and water quality and quantity. Climate change will further affect the geographic range and activity of infectious diseases. The climate change impacts are associated with the time period between 2030 and 2050 (Smith et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). In the assessment, sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is projected to have the greatest burden of mortality impacts attributable to climate change by 2030 (World Health Organization [WHO]

 <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). The projections show a dramatic increase in climate and extreme weather events-related deaths by the 2050s, with heat exposure resulting in over 100 000 deaths annually (WHO
