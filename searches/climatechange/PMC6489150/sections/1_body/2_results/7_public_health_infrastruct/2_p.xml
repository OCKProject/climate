<p class="p">South Africa is promoting public health buildings through modifying architectural designs to suit weather changes and regimes (DEA 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). The government is encouraging new building infrastructure that can curtail energy use and enable natural cooling. Roofs are being made stronger to be able to resist heavy storms and strong winds that can be disastrous to people. For example, at a 3.28 ÂºC rise in temperature, human health and comfort can be adversely affected (DEA 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). In addition, The Gambia is promoting proper waste disposal to prevent toxic contamination and pathogenic during floods (Government of Gambia 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). There are many technologies under consideration to reduce the impacts of the changing climate on human health populations. An example is in Kanifing Municipal Council (KMC), where there is improvement of public health infrastructure through the enforcement of building regulations and promotion of health-housing environment. Improved technological and preventative measures are being considered in high-risk areas where majority of people use untreated water. Sierra Leone is working on initiatives to change building designs to reduce heat stress (Government of Sierra Leone 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). Other technological adaptation options include sustainable housing design standards in areas subjected to strong winds and high rainfall. A good example is that the government is encouraging people to paint their house roofs with white or silver to reduce heat absorption, cross-ventilation of windows and to pay attention to settlements design.
