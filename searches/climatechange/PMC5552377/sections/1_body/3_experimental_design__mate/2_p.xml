Participants were recruited by three methods. First social media (Facebook) posts and ads were used to encourage survey completions with no monetary reward to participants. Secondly, a Texas Tech University daily announcement email (TechAnnounce) was used to recruit members of the University community. Lastly, Amazon Mechanical Turk was used to recruit participants. Individuals who completed the survey through Mechanical Turk were rewarded with $0.05–0.10 per survey completion. Recruiting participants through Mechanical Turk was by far the most effective means, and roughly 600 of the surveys 746 respondents replied via Mechanical Turk. At the completion of the polling period, data was downloaded from the Google forms site for reporting.
