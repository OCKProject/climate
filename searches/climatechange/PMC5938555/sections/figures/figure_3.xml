  <p class="p">Grain yield (GY) of seven plant height categories in a winter wheat population of 250 varieties and breeding lines grown in Turkey and Iran (1, very short; 2, short; 3, short-medium; 4, medium; 5, medium tall; 6, tall; and 7, very tall). Twenty sets of 10 genotypes were randomly selected of each height category to model height and associated grain yield 
   <bold class="bold">(A)</bold>. Average grain yield associated with each height category was calculated as an average of all sets (assembled with 10 genotypes of each category in 
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>).
