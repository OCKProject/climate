  <p class="p">Grain production using three sets of international trials including 
   <bold class="bold">(A)</bold> Turkey and Iran for 4 years (eight trials with low yielding environments) in a total of 20 ha, 
   <bold class="bold">(B)</bold> 64 trials across the globe for the international nursery 23rd ESWYT (Elite Selection Wheat Yield Trials- high yielding environments) in a total of 320 ha, and 
   <bold class="bold">(C)</bold> 66 trials across the globe for the international nursery 21st SAWYT (Semi-Arid Wheat Yield Trial â€“ low yielding environments) in a total of 330 ha. BESTALL is the actual best wheat genotype in the whole set of environments (based on grand means across all environments), BESTSELECTED corresponds to the best wheat genotype selected in a subset of training environments (based on grand means across half of the environments), and MIX corresponds to the best five selected genotypes in a subset of training environments and grown together in 2 ha plots side by side. Different letters indicate significant differences using LSD test at 
   <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05. Error bars indicate SD across random sets of environments.
