  <p class="p">Grain yield (GY) of seven phenology categories in a winter wheat population of 250 varieties and breeding lines grown in Turkey and Iran (1, very early; 2, early; 3, early-medium; 4, medium; 5, medium late; 6, late; and 7, very late). Twenty sets of 10 genotypes were randomly selected of each phenology category to model phenology and associated grain yield 
   <bold class="bold">(A)</bold>. Average grain yield associated with each phenology category was calculated as an average of all sets (assembled with 10 genotypes of each category in 
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>).
