<p class="p">Field experiments were conducted at three locations (Konya, Turkey; Diyarbakir, Turkey; and Maragheh, Iran) during four growth cycles (2012–2013, 2013–2014, 2014–2015, and 2015–2016) using an alpha lattice design with two replications. In Diyarbakir, trials were conducted at the International Agricultural Research and Training Center (GAPUTAEM), with Xerosols (Calcic Xerosols) and sown on November 20,
