<p class="p">The total grain production resulting from growing five genotypes in “testing environments” (
 <italic class="italic">TiiGP</italic>) was calculated as the sum grain production of each of the five genotypes in 2 ha (corresponding to five genotypes in 10 ha). The grain production of the 
 <italic class="italic">i</italic>th genotype was calculated by multiplying GY of the 
 <italic class="italic">i</italic>th genotype (
 <italic class="italic">iGY</italic>) in gm
 <sup class="sup">-2</sup> to total production in tonnes in 2 ha by multiplying by 0.02 (20,000 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and divided by 1,000,000 g) and summing grain production for the five genotypes, as indicated in the equation below.
