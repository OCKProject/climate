<p class="p">To determine the effects of temperature at one of the most sensitive stages to abiotic stresses (around heading), the average mean (TA), maximum (TM), and minimum daily temperature (Tm) were calculated 20 days before (TA20BH, TM20BH, and Tm20BH) and after heading (TA20AH, TM20AH, and Tm20AH) for each genotype. Given the stress sensitivity of booting stage, the effect of temperature and rainfall at this developmental stage has a considerable impact on final GY. Moreover, booting stage and meiosis occur at different points in time for wheat genotypes differing in phenology, and the exact moment of that stage is difficult to assess in the field, particularly when several hundred wheat genotypes need to be evaluated. To predict approximate temperature during this sensitive period, average temperatures during the 20-day period before and after heading were calculated for each genotype in each location and year. To calculate the amount of rainfall before and after heading instead of the 20-day period, the entire vegetative (between sowing and heading,

 <sub class="sub">GF</sub>) stages were used (as shown in 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Araus et al., 2002</xref>). This calculation was related to the erratic patterns of rain in all locations and years where rain following just before or after the 20-day period is still available to the crop, but would not be included if calculated based on this short period. The total amount of rainfall (from sowing to maturity, 
 <italic class="italic">Rt</italic>) was also calculated.
