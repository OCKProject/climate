<p class="p">Analysis of variance was conducted for each year and combined years using an alpha lattice design, where genotype was considered as a fixed effect and the effect of block nested within replicate was considered as a random effect, with the PROC GLM of SAS statistical package (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sas Institute Inc., 2009</xref>). Broad-sense heritability (
 <italic class="italic">H</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) was estimated for each trait individually to determine their reproducibility across years and within each field trial (by removing the year variance component) as:

 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = number of replications, 
 <italic class="italic">e</italic> = number of locations/years, 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic> = error variance, 
 <italic class="italic">Vg</italic> = genotypic variance, and 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>ge = genotype by locations/years interaction variance. To better understand the dependence and tradeoffs among agronomic traits and their mechanisms of operation in different wheat populations, Pearson correlation coefficients on the estimated means and associated probabilities were determined with the PROC CORR from SAS (
