<p class="p">Grain yield was determined by manually harvesting the middle row of each plot in 2012–2013 and by mechanically harvesting the entire plot in 2013–2014, 2014–2015, and 2015–2016. For the manual harvest, each middle row containing straw and grain was weighed and threshed. Days to heading (DH) were determined as the number of days from the sowing date until the point when more than 50% of plants were displaying heads (Zadoks Stage 59,
