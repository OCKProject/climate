 <sub class="sub">GF</sub> across genotypes were not correlated with PH, although PH had an effect on GY as shown by positive correlations in several field trials. This indicated that mechanisms through which PH affected GY in these environments were not driven by the differences observed in temperature and rainfall at a specific developmental stage across genotypes. However, the correlation of PH with GY across genotypes was a function of total rainfall in each year and location, with correlations trending negative to null with high rainfall and correlation trending positive with low rainfall. This result is in accordance with 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lopes et al. (2014)</xref> where the success of taller wheat genotypes was associated with low yielding low rainfall environments. Other studies have explained the success of taller wheat varieties in dry environments through longer coleoptiles and larger roots systems compared with the semi-dwarfs, where deep sowing ensures contact with available soil moisture (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mathews et al. (2006)</xref> analyzed 81 trials around the world and concluded that tall and semi-dwarf lines had similar adaptation to stressed environments and showed the highest GY. It is also worth noting that tall varieties may be desirable for reasons other than high yield, including high biomass and longer straw lengths (can be used as animal feed).
