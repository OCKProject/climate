<p class="p">In the field trials conducted here, even if the total amount of rainfall from sowing to maturity received by each genotype was similar, the distribution of this rainfall changed across genotypes at a specific growth stage. Non-significant “genotype” effects showed this for 
 <italic class="italic">Rt</italic> (total rainfall from sowing to maturity) in the analysis of variance across locations and years and significant “genotype” effects for 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">V EG</sub> (total rainfall during the vegetative stage for each genotype) and 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">GF</sub> (total rainfall during the grain filling stage for each genotype) across locations and years. Moreover, 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">V EG</sub> and 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">GF</sub> correlated positively and negatively with DH (
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3" class="xref">3</xref>
 </bold>), respectively (
 <italic class="italic">Rt</italic> did not show “genotype” effects and was not included for correlation analysis). On average across locations and years, the effect of delaying heading by 1 day resulted in an increase of 0.94 mm in 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">V EG</sub> (as shown by the regression line in 
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1C</xref>
 </bold>) and a decrease of 1.12 mm in 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">GF</sub>. This shows that on average across the type of locations and years tested, late genotypes were exposed to more rainfall during the vegetative stage, but were also exposed to less rainfall at the grain filling stage compared to earlier genotypes, and as demonstrated by the regression lines of both periods (
 <bold class="bold">Figures 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1C,D</xref>
 </bold>). In conclusion, increased temperature at around heading and less rainfall during the grain filling period explain the lower success of late winter wheat genotypes in the type of locations and years tested.
