<p class="p">Water shortage (drought) and extremes in temperature (cold and heat) are common abiotic stresses worldwide (e.g., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zampieri et al., 2017</xref>). Although the wheat breeding and research community focuses on developing high yielding varieties with improved adaptation to drought and heat, annual genetic gains during the last three decades have been poor in low yielding environments (around 0.5% year, see, e.g., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lopes et al., 2012</xref> and more recently quantified in heat stressed environments in 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Crespo-Herrera et al., 2017</xref>). The small amount of progress achieved to improve heat and drought adaptation and resistance is at least partially related to methodological obstacles such as: (i) the confounding effects caused by phenology (or crop stage at which the crop experiences the stress) when evaluating a diverse set of wheat genotypes and (ii) the erratic nature of weather (rainfall and temperature vary importantly from year to year). One good example of the first obstacle is that cereal genotypes of short duration will yield more than long-duration genotypes when grown under terminal drought conditions (also known as drought escape mechanism;

 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zadoks et al., 1974</xref>) and escape of exposure to drought and heat at this stage is crucial for survival and grain set. Additionally, early flowering is an evolutionary mechanism for adaptation to warm and drought environments (

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Blum (2009)</xref> citing 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mitchell et al. (1996)</xref> explained that short-term growth duration dictates moderate water-use and the escape of terminal drought stress, whereas long-duration genotypes generally have greater water use and larger deep root systems that allow deep soil moisture extraction â€“ if indeed deep soil moisture is available. Therefore, exposure of genotypes with long and short duration to drought or heat conditions at the same developmental stage would likely reveal different effects on grain yield (GY). While the literature indicates several explanations for the better performance of short duration genotypes, exposure of these genotypes to weather variables in comparison to late duration genotypes has not been determined.
