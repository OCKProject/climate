<p class="p">With the objective of finding the DH and PH that maximize GY across locations and years, all genotypes were classified according to seven DH and PH categories (as described in Section “Materials and Methods”). After categorization, random genotypes were selected from each category and used to plot with GY as shown in 
 <bold class="bold">Figures 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>, 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>
 </bold>. Each line in 
 <bold class="bold">Figures 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2A</xref>, 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3A</xref>
 </bold> corresponds to average GY of 10 genotypes randomly selected and falling within seven DH and PH categories. This exercise was repeated 20 times corresponding to 20 lines in 
 <bold class="bold">Figures 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2A</xref>, 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3A</xref>
 </bold> (each time using different genotypes from the entire population consisting of 250 winter wheat breeding lines and varieties). The quadratic function shown in 
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2B</xref>
 </bold> and representing the relationship DH with GY revealed that maximum yields were obtained at 194.9 DH. The maximum of the function in each location was also calculated for DH and is shown in 
 <bold class="bold">Supplementary Table 
  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3" class="xref">S2</xref>
 </bold>. For PH, the quadratic function shown in 
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>
 </bold> revealed that maximum yields were obtained at 76.0 cm average height across all locations and years (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3B</xref>
 </bold>). Moreover, the maximum of the quadratic function was also calculated for PH, in each location and is shown in 
 <bold class="bold">Supplementary Table 
  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3" class="xref">S2</xref>
 </bold>. Finally, one modern wheat breeding line with optima DH and PH was selected for each location which can be used in testing blocks for calibration during selection procedures (
 <bold class="bold">Supplementary Table 
  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4" class="xref">S3</xref>
 </bold>). Moreover, major functional genes are shown for the selected genotypes (
 <bold class="bold">Supplementary Table 
  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4" class="xref">S3</xref>
 </bold>). Since optima DH and PH were different in each location (
 <bold class="bold">Supplementary Tables 
  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3" class="xref">S2</xref>, 
  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4" class="xref">S3</xref>
 </bold>), the differences in GY obtained by selecting for specific adaptation to each location or by selecting for adaptation to all locations together were calculated (
 <bold class="bold">Supplementary Table 
  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5" class="xref">S4</xref>
 </bold>). These calculations have shown, that by selecting wheat breeding lines with optima DH and PH in each location provided on average an increase of 18.6% GY compared to selection based on all locations and years (average of %CHANGE_GY in 
 <bold class="bold">Supplementary Table 
  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5" class="xref">S4</xref>
 </bold>).
