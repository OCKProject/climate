<p class="p">Since one of the main objectives of this study is to determine optimal DH and PH to maximize GY, correlations between these two traits were calculated per trial (
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </bold>). Significant negative correlations between DH and GY were reported in Diyarbakir 2013, Konya 2013, Maragheh 2014, Diyarbakir 2015, and Maragheh 2016 (
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </bold>). Correlations (linear associations) between GY and DH in other trials were not significant (
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </bold>). PH correlated positively with GY (and statistically significant) in Konya 2013, Maragheh 2013, Konya 2014, Maragheh 2014, and Konya 2015, being those also the environments with lower rainfall (
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </bold>). Correlations between GY and PH in other trials were not significant (
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </bold>). Using the means of each genotype across locations and years, DH and PH correlated negatively with GY (
