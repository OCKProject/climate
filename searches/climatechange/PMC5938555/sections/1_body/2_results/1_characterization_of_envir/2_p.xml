 <bold class="bold">Supplementary Figures 
  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">S1A–H</xref>
 </bold> show the window of variation for heading date and maturity in each location and year tested for this study together with daily rainfall and temperature. Overall, these environments are characterized by cold winters, progressively higher temperatures, and a decrease in rainfall at around heading time continuing to maturity (
 <bold class="bold">Supplementary Figures 
  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">S1A–H</xref>
