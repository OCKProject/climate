<p class="p">After the overall analysis revealed that genotypes with variable phenology were exposed to different temperatures and rainfall at specific stages of development, simple correlations were calculated (
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3" class="xref">3</xref>
 </bold>). In the type of environments and wheat genotypes tested herein, GY correlated negatively with DH (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = –0.40) and DM (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = –0.29) and positively with grain filling duration (GFD, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.31; 
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3" class="xref">3</xref>
 </bold>). Moreover, DH and DM correlated positively with temperature 20 days before and after heading (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> &gt; 0.90 and 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> &gt; 0.80, respectively). The amount of rainfall at the vegetative stage (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">V EG</sub>) correlated positively with DH and DM (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.93 and 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.79, respectively), whereas 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">GF</sub> correlated negatively with DH and DM (

 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = -0.78, respectively; 
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3" class="xref">3</xref>

 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">V EG</sub> correlated negatively with GY (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> &gt; -0.36 and 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = -0.37); however, 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">GF</sub> correlated positively with GY (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.36; 
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3" class="xref">3</xref>
 </bold>). Correlations between temperature and GY were not consistent when each environment was taken individually (
 <bold class="bold">Supplementary Table 
  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2" class="xref">S1</xref>
 </bold>). Sometimes temperature had a positive effect (e.g., Diyarbakir 2013 and Maragheh 2013); however, in Maragheh 2014, Diyarbakir 2015, and Maragheh 2016, temperature had a negative effect on GY. Correlations per locations and years of 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">V EG</sub> and 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">GF</sub> with GY when significant were consistently negative and positive, respectively (
