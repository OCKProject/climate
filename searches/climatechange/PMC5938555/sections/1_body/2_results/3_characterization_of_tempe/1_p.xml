<p class="p">Average, maximum, and minimum temperatures during the 20-day period before and after heading (TA20BH, TA20AH, TM20BH, TM20AH, Tm20BH, and Tm20AH, respectively) were calculated in each trial and across all trials (
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2" class="xref">2</xref>
 </bold>). Different genotypes (varying in DH for more than 10 days, see maximum and minimum across locations and years in 
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2" class="xref">2</xref>
 </bold>) were consistently exposed to different temperatures in the time period of 20 days before and after heading (
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2" class="xref">2</xref>
 </bold>) as shown by significant “genotype” effects and medium to high heritability (0.65–0.82) across trials for TA20BH, TA20AH, TM20BH, TM20AH, Tm20BH, and Tm20AH. Moreover, for total rainfall at the vegetative and grain filling stages (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">V EG</sub> and 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">GF</sub>), significant “genotype” effects were observed across locations and years and heritability of 0.67–0.70 showing that different genotypes are exposed to different amount of rainfall in a consistent manner across locations and years. Moreover, the “genotype” effect for total rainfall (

  <sub class="sub">t</sub>
 </italic>, corresponding to the sum of 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">V EG</sub> + 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">GF</sub>) across locations and years was not significant with 0.00 reproducibility (
