<p class="p">Three sets of germplasm and data were used to test if several wheat varieties grown together would buffer the effects of erratic weather patterns: (i) wheat population used herein (grown in eight environments); (ii) 23rd ESWYT (grown in 64 environments most of them irrigated and high yielding); and (iii) 21st SAWYT (grown in 66 semi-arid environments with little or no irrigation and low yielding). One of the objectives of this exercise was to identify the selection methodology that will permit the identification of the best possible genotype(s) for a specific type of environment. Therefore, genotypes for (i)–(iii) were selected based on GY performance in “training environments” and then the selected genotypes were evaluated in a set of “testing environments,” which correspond to the GY shown in

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">C</xref>
 </bold>. This scenario would simulate what generally happens when breeders make a selection of new promising wheat lines based on their best performance (highest GY) in international trials, and farmers adopt those selected lines. Second, this exercise aimed to test whether instead of using one single wheat genotype, five genotypes would boost resilience and total grain production across environments and years. The results revealed that the best genotype in monoculture always demonstrated higher production than a group of the five best genotypes provided that the number of environments was sufficient enough to find the genotype showing the highest yield (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4A</xref>
 </bold>). However, the best selected genotype in “six training environments” showed similar grain production to five genotypes. Given the fact that the number of trials conducted for this population was relatively low, the same hypothesis was tested in spring wheat where data from international nurseries are available at CIMMYT. In the two sets of data for the 23rd ESWYT and 21st SAWYT, always the selection of the best unique genotypes gave the highest GY and the group of five genotypes showed no benefit comparatively. In the 23rd ESWYT (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4B</xref>
 </bold>), the best-selected genotype in 32 training environments had lower GY than the best-selected unique genotype across all 64 environments. However, in the 21st SAWYT (

 </bold>), the best-selected unique wheat genotype in 33 training environments had similar GY to the best-selected genotype in all 66 field trials.
