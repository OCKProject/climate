 <caption class="caption">
  <p class="p">Grain yield (GY) of genotypes selected based on optima days to heading (DH) and plant height (PH) in each location (Diyarbakir-DIY SEL for two seasons, Konya-KON SEL with for three seasons, and Maragheh-MAR SEL for three seasons) and across all locations and years (ALL). As a reference, the highest yielding genotype in each location is shown (HGY_ENV). Changes in GY between the two types of selection (selected in each location versus selected across all locations and years) are also shown in absolute values and in percentage (CHANGE_GY and % GY CHANGE, respectively).</p>
