<p class="p">A further issue best illustrated by Participant #4 is that of the individual statements that comprise each narrative. Arguably the best way of determining participant worldviews is having them read through the options and make an intuitive choice, but because of the large volumes of information, this did not seem entirely possible. Instead, participants virtually analysed each worldview based on the individual statements, rather than choosing it based on an overall impression. This reflects a possible problem for participants to keep all the components of the narrative of their own identity under consideration at the intuitive level. As Lehrer (
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1973</xref>:121) almost poetically states: ‘The shifting sands of subjectivity shape and reshape the foothill paths of evidence that guide us to conclusions in the mountainous terrain of inquiry’. This inquiry can be into our own worldview, and the ‘evidence statements’ that we choose or discard when determining our own views often change (Lehrer 
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1973</xref>:121). Without the discussion of the different worldviews, and by default the different statements, the valuable qualitative input necessary for a study of this nature would not have been attained.
