<p class="p">Christianity and Islam are both what is referred to as Abrahamic religions, alongside Judaism. Within these religions, the significance of nature is not merely instrumental; nature forms part of God’s creation, and humankind’s relationship with it is a pragmatic one (Cooper &amp; Palmer 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1998</xref>:31). Christian doctrine, when describing humankind and nature, relies on two key concepts according to Davies (
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1994</xref>:31): relationship and responsibility. To Christians, the term 
 <italic class="italic">relationship</italic> entails a direct connection with nature, where ‘distinctions between nature and culture are inappropriate’ (Davies 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1994</xref>:31). The second, 
 <italic class="italic">responsibility</italic>, ‘involves moral issues’ (Davies 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1994</xref>:31) and includes the stewardship over nature that God gives humankind. This stewardship, however, can be interpreted in two very different ways. On the one hand, it implies humankind’s dominion over nature, using it for their own gain without giving much thought to the consequences (Edwards 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Hulme 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). On the other hand is the interpretation of caretaker, where humans are appointed as nature’s guardians and are appointed to take care of Earth’s resources (Russell 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1994</xref>:147). The distinction between these two interpretations underpins the link between religious beliefs and climate. Hence, two diverging views on adaptation may arise from these two interpretations of the Christian stewardship of nature.
