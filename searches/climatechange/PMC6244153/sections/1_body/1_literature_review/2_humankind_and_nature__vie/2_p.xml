<p class="p">Although it shares many similarities with Christianity, Islam has a slightly different view on nature. Islam’s main concern is obedience to God and the penalties for disobedience (Forward &amp; Alam 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1994</xref>:79). This extends to the relationship between humans and nature, as the religion ‘warns of the consequences of disobedience in human plunder and exploitation of the planet earth’ (Forward &amp; Alam 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1994</xref>:79). An important distinguishing aspect, however, is the view that creation will be destroyed once God takes his faithful servants to Paradise; the function of our world is merely to provide an arena for God’s interaction with humans (Forward &amp; Alam 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1994</xref>:79). To them the world that they inhabit is perishable, and there is no reason to safeguard or protect it (Forward &amp; Alam 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1994</xref>:98). This particular view does not bode well for the possibility of adapting to climate change.
