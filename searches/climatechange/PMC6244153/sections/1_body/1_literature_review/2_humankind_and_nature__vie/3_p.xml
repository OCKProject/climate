<p class="p">As emphasised, humanity and religion are interwoven, implying that natural phenomena, and indeed nature in itself, inextricably form part of traditional African religious beliefs (Mbiti 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1977</xref>:48). Traditional African religions are based on the philosophical foundation of what Turaki (
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>:97–98) refers to as the ‘Law of Harmony’ – within this foundation, ‘man stands face to face with the “physical”, the “material” and the “spiritual” dimensions of his world’ (Mbiti 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1977</xref>; Turaki 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>). This illustrates the anthropocentric nature of African ontology, where the dictating view is that humankind is placed at the centre of the created universe (Mbiti 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1977</xref>:48). Here nature is placed within the realm of the spirit beings and the impersonal powers that govern the world which, although seen as a holistic part of creation, is created by the Supreme Being (God) (Turaki 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>:98). This interplay between the spirit and the physical worlds is described by Mbiti (
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1977</xref>:57): ‘The invisible world is symbolised or manifested by these visible and concrete phenomena and objects of nature’. Furthermore, the relationship with nature is defined in terms of communality – community represents an important part of the traditional African religious philosophy and entails humankind’s relationship with nature as well as humanity. In fact, ‘man (sic) is not independent, but dependant’ (Turaki 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>:101).
