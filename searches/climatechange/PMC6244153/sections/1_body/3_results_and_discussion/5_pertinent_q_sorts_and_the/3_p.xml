<p class="p">Although being seemingly more positive towards nature and climate, Factor 2 may be interpreted as being more deterministic or fatalistic towards the effects of climate change. This is mostly because of the high scoring of statement 1 – in fact, statement 1 scored higher in Factor 2 than in any other factor. This factor basically says, ‘climate change is a natural occurrence, therefore we cannot and will not do anything about it’ – adaptation seems to be regarded as futile. It is also noteworthy that Factor 2 denies human’s involvement in climate change, reinforcing the belief that the climate is controlled by God and is therefore impervious to human influence.</p>
