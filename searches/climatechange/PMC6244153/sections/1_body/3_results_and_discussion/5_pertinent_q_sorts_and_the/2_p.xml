<p class="p">Consensus between factors 2 and 3 on the theme of religious beliefs reaches only to statement 9, where Factor 2 agrees with statements 1, 6 and 7 and Factor 3 disagrees with these statements. Factor 3 disregards the ‘natural’ element of climate, whereas Factor 2 draws the link between God and nature previously discussed. This ‘naturalness’ of the climate and climate change stands opposite the view that climate change is a sign that the world is ending; if an occurrence is considered natural, it cannot simultaneously be considered an indication of the end of all things.</p>
