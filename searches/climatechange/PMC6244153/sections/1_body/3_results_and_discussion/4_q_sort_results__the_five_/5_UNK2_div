 <p class="p" xmlns="">‘Maybe if I have to preach a little bit: you remember, in the Bible, when God was destroying Sodom and Gomorrah – this is one story – two: the other one, Noah and the Ark.

The only part of it, the link to it is this so-called war – there will be war, there will be lawlessness, children will bring children forth and so on. Violent society, corruption, selfishness …’ (Participant #4; male)</p>
