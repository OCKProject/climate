 <p class="p" xmlns="">‘How I believe, for me my perspective cannot change what already God has decided. I don’t know, maybe you help me in that, because you studied this, I didn’t study it, but how I think is how God is created things and it should be like that. My culture cannot change the way God has created.’ (02-BJ-Ventersdorp-16:02)</p>
