<p class="p">The use of rituals to bring about desired changes in the climate was mentioned by some participants, whether it was only to illustrate some of their culture’s traditions or to state their own beliefs in their power. For instance, these rituals include women in a community who have lost children, coming together to ‘wash off the blood of their children’, after which this water is poured out all across the community. This is believed to bring rain (01-SS-Ventersdorp-20.00).</p>
