 <p class="p">‘I just have to accept only God knows because I think he is the one doing this, and I think we can blame it on the kids for not listening perhaps God is punishing us because we can’t always blame the change in weather. God put us here on earth we just have to accept the way things are, the way they are going whether he’s punishing us because of our kids’ engagements, we don’t know. Sometimes he just scares us and we just have to accept.’ (04-GP-Ventersdorp-6:16)</p>
