 <p class="p">‘The Bible said nè, you can’t blame me, you can’t blame me because if you don’t know my picture of me, because of – you don’t know me, why you blame me, maar you can’t blame your next neighbour. You see, at least you must like your neighbour before you can like me. So it’s just that we can … no one have …. I have seen the Lord. We dream of ancestors, we dream of all people that died. We see that. So He uses ancestors.’ (02-AB-Jouberton-16:56)</p>
