<p class="p">The words ‘social practices’ in the definition above point to a vital component of what can be considered African traditional religions: the inextricable nature of African communities and their religion (Mbiti 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1977</xref>:2). According to Mbiti (
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1977</xref>:15), for African people, religion is ‘an ontological phenomenon’ that ‘pertains to the question of existence and being’. Traditional African religions view nature not as a separate, impersonal object or phenomenon, but rather as being ‘filled with religious significance’ (Mbiti 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1977</xref>:56). Many rituals, rites, ancestral beliefs and more in traditional African religions relate directly to nature (Olupona 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>:264). Consequently, it is not much of a leap to expect that these religious beliefs will influence a person’s adaptation to climate change.
