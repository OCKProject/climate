<p class="p">Data collection during Phase One consisted of semi-structured individual interviews. Two questions were asked: (1) ‘
 <italic class="italic">what</italic> do you think about the climate?’ and (2) ‘
 <italic class="italic">do</italic> you think it would be possible to change your beliefs about the climate?’ Probing questions were asked throughout to ensure that detailed answers were provided for the collection of rich data. Interview transcripts (translated from Tswana and Afrikaans to English where applicable by mother tongue speakers) were analysed and 40 significant statements (referred to as Q-sorts) regarding the climate and beliefs were identified.
