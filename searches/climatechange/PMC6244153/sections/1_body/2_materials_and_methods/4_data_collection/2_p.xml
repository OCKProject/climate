<p class="p">During Phase Two, participants were instructed to rank all 40 statements on a Likert-type scale based on the extent to which they agreed or disagreed. This was done using specially prepared whiteboards and magnetic statement cards. The Likert scale ranges are: strongly agree (+3), agree (+2), slightly agree (+1), neutral (0), slightly disagree (-1), disagree (-2) and strongly disagree (-3). A seven-point scale was utilised in order to allow for a greater variety of options and nuances in terms of the differences between beliefs in the presented statements. Instructions were limited, and participants were free to rank statements at their own discretion, creating a free distribution of data along seven different rankings.</p>
