<p class="p">As this study involved people’s personal experiences regarding climate change adaptation and religious beliefs, as well as determining specific worldviews, the qualiquantological approach of Q-methodology (Stenner &amp; Rogers 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>) was deemed the most appropriate research design. This methodology was used to determine the communities’ experiences and understandings of climate change adaptation while producing statistical data to confirm, as based on literature (e.g. Bergmann

Q-methodology is especially suited to investigate the influence of religious beliefs on people’s willingness or ability to adapt to climate change, as it enables the researcher to quantify and illustrate abstract concepts such as beliefs and find correlations between different subjects, in this case religious beliefs and climate change. Previte, Pini and Haslam-McKenzie (
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>:141) maintain that Q-methodology allows for a ‘focus on the subjective experiences of participants’ and an ‘emphasis on context’, making it a well-suited option for this study as it investigated specifically individual and communal participant views and beliefs. In turn, it was hypothesised that these beliefs would influence climate change adaptation, further strengthening the case for using Q-methodology for this study.
