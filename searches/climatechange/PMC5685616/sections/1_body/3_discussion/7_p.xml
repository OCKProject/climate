<p class="p">There were differences between the A2 and B2 scenarios in species gains, losses, and turnover for different future times. Mean species gains under the A2 scenario assuming unlimited dispersal increased more than under the B2 scenario, but the gains declined from 2020 to 2050 and then increased again between 2050 and 2080 for both scenarios. The A2 scenario also had more species losses than the B2 scenario (

 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] also suggested that the A2 scenario in some cases might result in higher species richness than the B2 scenario. Similarly, there was greater species turnover in the A2 than the B2 scenario; under both scenarios there was a decline in species turnover between 2020 and 2050, and then an increase again from 2050 to 2080. In general the species losses, gains, and turnover were predicted to happen along the Mediterranean coast, both sides of the Suez Gulf, the Red Sea coast, Qattara Depression, Siwa Oasis, some patches around greater Cairo and Sinai.
