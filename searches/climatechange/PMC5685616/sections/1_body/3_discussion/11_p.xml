<p class="p">However, there are many locations outside PAs that have high species richness, and hence this needs more effort and management to provide suitable habitat to avoid losing particular species in the future. This is particularly true of areas along the Red Sea coast, some locations around the Suez Gulf, and areas around the Qattara Depression. This result concurs with other studies conducted on other Egyptian taxonomic groups [

 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] found that the present-day species richness of butterflies and mammals was higher inside than outside PAs, while in the future this difference will not be stable, as was found for other taxonomic groups in other regions [
