<p class="p">Other studies from different continents are relevant here. Under the effects of climate change, 2–40% of woody plants in Yunnan Province (China) were predicted to become seriously endangered or disappear by 2080 under the two assumptions of dispersal [

 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] predicted that more than 50% of 1350 European plants would be under threat by 2080. Golicher et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>] suggested that predicted increases in temperature of 3°C and decreases in precipitation by about 20% would cause a decline of about 15% in the species richness of the tropical forests of Mesoamerica. Thus most studies have predicted much more change, and more serious losses, than we do for Egypt.
