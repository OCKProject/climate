<p class="p">Why did the A2 scenario result in higher species richness, even though this is the scenario with maximum climate change? According to the special report on emission scenarios [
 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>], under the A2 scenario there is more climate change related to CO

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0187714.s014" class="xref">S2</xref> Tables). All these gases increase gradually in both scenarios until 2100, and then some decline afterwards, but mostly they remain steady. Under the A2 scenario more of these gases are released than under the B2 scenario. The main SDM predictors in our results are temperature and to a lesser extent precipitation. All environmental variables related to temperature (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0187714.s016" class="xref">S4 Table</xref>) increased gradually with time under both scenarios, but by 2050 A2 predicted wetter conditions than B2. This may be the reason for the predictions for the A2 scenario.
