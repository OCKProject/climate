<p class="p">Species richness is just one of the criteria to assess PAs in conservation planning [

 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref084" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>] combined biotic diversity, species uniqueness, and the degree of endangerment, while [
 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref085" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>] focussed on specific threats such as land acquisition and invasive species. There are many other factors that impact on species richness distribution and species losses inside and outside PAs, for instance, increasing human land use [

 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] suggested that the interaction between climate change and resource use by humans could have undesirable effects on biodiversity, greater than each of them alone. Therefore it is important for the Egyptian government to take quick steps to allow for all the possibilities of habitat loss in the future. Genetic erosion may happen in some species, and we must pre-empt the possibility of future extinctions by collecting and preserving seeds.
