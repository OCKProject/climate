<p class="p">Protected areas are important strategic elements of conservation planning. Compared with other countries, the proportion of Egyptâ€™s land surface represented by PAs (about 15%) is higher, but as elsewhere, there was no consideration of the potential effects of climate change when these PAs were selected [
 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref081" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. With the first being established in 1983, Egyptian PAs are all relatively new, but they were chosen under scientific supervision and using expert knowledge about Egyptian biodiversity [
 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. The likely future species richness of medicinal plants inside PAs was significantly higher than outside for all combinations of assumptions. These results suggest that Egyptian PAs are placed appropriately for medicinal plants, because they provide suitable environments for them to flourish under climate change, and also effectively represent the diversity of the country. We would argue that Egypt's medicinal plants (which include many shrubs and woody perennials) are representative of plants in general and the lack of suitably validated data for most other plants precluded their use here.
