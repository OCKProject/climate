<p class="p">The predicted patterns of species richness of Egyptian medicinal plants under climate change and a variety of assumptions showed obvious shifts towards the north and north-east of Egypt, along the Mediterranean coast, Sinai Peninsula, Red Sea coast, and both sides of the Suez Gulf. The most important predictors of these shifts were the temperature-related variables. There are many studies elsewhere demonstrating that species tend to shift poleward in latitude and upwards in elevation [e.g. 3, 8], and the most important drivers for these changes are temperature and rainfall [

For example, meta-analysis shows that terrestrial species distributions have shifted about 11 m per decade to higher altitudes, and about 17 km per decade towards higher latitudes, depending on the ability of species to track suitable climate change [
