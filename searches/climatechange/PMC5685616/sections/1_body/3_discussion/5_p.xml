<p class="p">Notably, Egypt has a hyper-arid environment and enormous desert spaces in the western, eastern and southern regions. Visually there is agreement between plots of the actual records and predictions of species richness under current conditions. Despite now being accessible to modern vehicles, there are very few records found in either desert or southern areas of Egypt, and hence greater species richness northward, and in Sinai and the Red Sea coast. The main reasons behind this low species richness in much of Egypt must lie in the extreme climatic and environmental conditions which are not suitable for most plants (although lack of sampling clearly contributes, especially in the militarily inaccessible Gebel Elba region that is known to be rich in plant and animal species).</p>
