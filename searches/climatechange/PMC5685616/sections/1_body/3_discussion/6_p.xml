<p class="p">There is no previous map, atlas or study about Egyptian plant distributions under climate change with which to compare, but our results are similar to other studies recently conducted for Egyptian mammals, butterflies and reptiles [
 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref076" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. These all used a similar approach with species distribution modelling, finding that the pattern of species richness increased towards the north and east, with the highest species richness along the Red Sea coast down to Gebel Elba, Sinai, and from the Delta stretching along the Mediterranean coast. Butterflies are good indicators of general biodiversity [
 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref076" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>], since they depend on plants throughout their life cycle. The pattern of our results is certainly in agreement with their findings. For mammals [
 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref077" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>], there is an even greater concentration of species in these places. All these studies taken together indicate that there will be increases in habitat suitability in the northern and eastern coastal areas of Egypt under climate change, while declines occur in the deserts and southern areas of Egypt.
