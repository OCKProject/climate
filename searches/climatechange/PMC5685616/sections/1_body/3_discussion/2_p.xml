 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>], but the habitat and NDVI predictors that should reflect it here did not add useful information for the model performance (see

 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. There are limitations to the use such satellite-derived predictors for species distribution modelling (see [

 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]), but critically we have no models of future scenarios for the habitat and NDVI predictors for Egypt, and thus were unable to include changes in land cover in our modelling. Given Egypt’s rapidly increasing human population, this is the next step to improving predictions of future climate-change effects on biodiversity.
