<p class="p">The predicted species richness gradually increased over time under different scenarios compared with the present day when unlimited dispersal was assumed, because species can then track their habitat under climate change and find suitable environments. Temperatures at the Mediterranean coast, Sinai, the Red Sea coast, and both sides of the Suez Gulf are lower, and rainfall is higher, than in the Western and Eastern deserts and the southern parts of Egypt; these factors create suitable habitat. However, when no-dispersal was assumed, habitat suitability generally declined for future times and climate scenarios compared with current conditions, because species were then not able to track the changing environment. The pattern of species richness appeared to increase more under the A2 scenario than the B2 scenario, as [
