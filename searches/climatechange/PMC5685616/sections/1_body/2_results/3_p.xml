<p class="p">By 2050 species richness is predicted to increase generally, eliminating the previous declines. By 2080 the increases are predicted to be more marked in the same areas. Assuming no-dispersal, the predicted pattern under the A2 scenario (

By 2050, these predicted declines are less except for areas around greater Cairo. By 2080, predicted species richness declines are only marked on both sides of the Suez Gulf, the Red Sea coast, and in central Sinai and greater Cairo. Under the B2 scenario, the predicted pattern of decline is similar but the magnitudes are greater except for 2080 (
