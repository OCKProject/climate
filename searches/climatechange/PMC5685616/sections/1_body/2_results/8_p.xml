By 2050, they were predicted to be along the Red Sea coast and areas around greater Cairo, and by 2080, along the Mediterranean coast, north and south Sinai, some scattered areas on both sides of the Suez Gulf, and along the Red Sea coast. Under the B2 scenario, predicted losses were higher but similar in pattern (
