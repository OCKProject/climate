 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187714.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>) species richness was predicted to increase for all future times (2020, 2050, and 2080) and both scenarios (A2 and B2). Using binary distributions, the pattern of species richness was predicted under both dispersal assumptions. For unlimited dispersal, by 2020 under the A2 scenario (

These predicted increases become more obvious by 2050 and very marked by 2080. Decreases in species richness are predicted to occur in small scattered areas, similar in all future time periods. There were clear differences under the B2 scenario (
