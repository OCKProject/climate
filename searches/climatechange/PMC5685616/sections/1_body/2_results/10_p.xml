<p class="p">For unlimited dispersal, under the A2 scenario by 2020 the highest turnover (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187714.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>) was predicted to occur along the Red Sea coast, in Sinai, along the Mediterranean coast, and along both sides of the Suez Gulf. By 2050 the pattern is similar but the magnitude is lower. By 2080, the highest predicted species turnover was along the Mediterranean coast, greater Cairo southwards, scattered areas both sides of the Suez Gulf, and some scattered areas along the Red Sea coast. Under the B2 scenario, the pattern of turnover was very similar (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187714.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>), with some differences in magnitude. Under the no-dispersal assumption, turnover for both scenarios and all times were also similar to the pattern of losses under the no-dispersal assumption (see
