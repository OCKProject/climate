<p class="p">With unlimited dispersal, under the A2 scenario the maximum species gain by 2020 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0187714.s008" class="xref">S8 Fig</xref>) was predicted to be at the Mediterranean coast, along both sides of the Suez Gulf, along the Red Sea coast further to the south, and some scattered patches in Sinai. By 2050, the highest predicted gains appeared along the Mediterranean coast and the Qattara Depression, scattered places on both sides of the Suez Gulf and the Red Sea coast. By 2080, the highest species gains were predicted to be along the Mediterranean coast, the Qattara Depression to Wadi El-Natrun, small areas around greater Cairo, and scattered areas along the Red Sea coast. There were no big differences in predicted gains under the B2 scenario (
