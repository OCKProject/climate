<p class="p">To estimate how much each species loses or gains in habitat suitability, the number of pixels gained and lost for each species was calculated (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0187714.s001" class="xref">S1 Fig</xref> for an example), and the gain maps (future times × scenarios emissions) were summed together across species to produce a “gain in suitability” map to demonstrate which locations are projected to gain more species in the future; sites can only gain species under the assumption of unlimited dispersal, and such sites may constitute potential new PAs in the future. A loss map shows locations predicted to lose suitability for species in the future (assuming either unlimited and no-dispersal).
