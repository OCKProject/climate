<p class="p">The A2 and B2 scenarios [
 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] are regularly used in climate-change assessments [
 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Both scenarios have different assumptions about the levels of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions. The A2 scenario expects this level to increase without barriers because of high growth rate in human population, not much technological development, expanded land-use change, and less environmental awareness. The B2 scenario expects the level not to change much because human population growth will be slower, with fewer changes in land-use, people are more environmentally conscious, and there is increasing technological invention [
 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. In this study, we do not take into account any phenological and/or evolutionary reactions to climate change, and hence we assume that species will attempt to find their climatically suitable habitat dependent on their dispersal capability. We are forced to make the assumption that some predictors (e.g. habitat, NDVI) do not change because there is no information or scenarios on how they might change; others (e.g. altitude) will clearly not change.
