Locations with small turnover are predicted to remain suitable in the future, whereas locations with higher turnover indicate less stable habitat suitability with time. Species turnover for unlimited dispersal was calculated (following [

 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]) as SG + SL, where SG is the number of species gained, and SL is the number of species lost (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0187714.s001" class="xref">S1 Fig</xref> for details). The equation normally expresses turnover as a proportion of the species richness of each pixel, but this was unsuitable in the case of Egyptian plants because of the very low richness in areas of the Western desert, which made some of the proportional turnover values unreasonably large. Species turnover for no-dispersal is just equal to species losses because there can be no gains.
