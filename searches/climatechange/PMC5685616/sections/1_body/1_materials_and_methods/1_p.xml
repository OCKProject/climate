 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Botanists have judged 121 of them as known to be ‘medicinal, but these are not representative of all Egypt’s plants, with certain families (e.g. Chenopodiaceae, Labiatae, Zygophyllaceae) greatly over-represented, and some (e.g. Graminae, Leguminosae-Papilionoideae) greatly under-represented. The data were collated by the BioMAP project in Cairo between 2004–2008, funded by Italian Debt Swap [

There are virtually no available validated records of these species from surrounding countries, so we were unable to model the entire range of non-endemic species; this will often be the case for developing countries. All the data were examined in detail by a panel of expert field botanists during the BioMAP project, filtering out all records that were dubious on a variety of grounds (mainly identification and distribution). Much of the data derive from recent (since 1990) expeditions of academic botanists using GPS recorders, particularly to the wadis of Sinai, where plots were surveyed at approximately regular distances apart. Earlier records were carefully checked for the accuracy of the locations, and records with vague data removed. We removed species with fewer than ten spatially separate records, and those where the records were spatially very close together and with mean AUC of the models less than 0.5 (all to avoid overfitting [
