 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0187714.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data for seven years (2004 to 2010) were downloaded from the SPOT Vegetation website (

These data are made available as maps synthesized over 10-day periods at resolution of 1 km. 252 maps represent data from 2004–2010, which were then clipped to Egypt's boundaries and used to create two predictors—maximum (Max_NDVI, indicating the maximum amount of vegetation there is per pixel) and the difference between the Minimum and Maximum (NDVI_differences, indicating the variability in vegetation per pixel). The maps were then rescaled to 2.5 arc minutes [
 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. The predictor layer of ‘habitat’ was created by BioMAP [
 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], dividing Egypt into eleven classes (sea, littoral coast, cultivation, sand dune, wadi, metamorphic rock, igneous rock, gravels, serir sand sheets, sabkhas and sedimentary rocks). Altitude data were downloaded and rescaled to a pixel size of 2.5 arc-minutes [
