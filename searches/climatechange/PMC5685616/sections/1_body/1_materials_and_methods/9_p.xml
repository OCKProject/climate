<p class="p">We then compared the species richness inside and outside PAs to see to what extent they protect Egyptian plants now, and in the future, using the oldest and largest 25 PAs, excluding just the most recent and smallest. We chose 2000 pixels at random, and then created a 50-km buffer around each PA. We chose 50 km as the tradeoff between a small value (to try to ensure the habitat outside is as similar as possible) and a figure large enough to ensure enough of the random pixels lay within it. The mean species richness was then calculated for the random pixels lying within each PA, and lying outside but within the appropriate buffer zone, creating paired values inside and outside of each PA. In the case of very small PAs which are smaller than one pixel (whose side is 4.64 km), species richness was taken to be the value for the pixel containing the PA. The paired difference inside-outside was calculated for each PA, and the mean difference tested in a one-sample t-test against the null hypothesis that the mean equals zero.</p>
