<p class="p">Maps for the distribution of species richness for current and future times were produced by summing all predicted consensus distribution maps for the individual species together (assuming either unlimited or no-dispersal in the future). Thus, maps were produced for species richness for future times (2020, 2050, and 2080) under both scenarios (A2 and B2) for both unlimited and no-dispersal assumptions, a total of 12 species-richness maps. Change maps were produced to aid interpretation by subtracting one map from another.</p>
