<p class="p">MaxEnt does not automatically produce a consensus binary (presence/ absence) map from the 10 replicate runs, and hence this was made manually using the Raster Calculator and Reclassify tools in ArcGIS 10.2.2 (ESRI, USA). For unlimited dispersal, the consensus map allotted a ‘presence’ to a pixel that had presence values in more than 50% of the model runs (i.e. &gt;5 replicates). Under the no-dispersal assumption, the consensus maps for the two time periods (e.g. ‘current’ and ‘2020’) were compared so as to allocate a pixel to be a ‘presence’ in the event that it was a ‘presence’ in both maps.</p>
