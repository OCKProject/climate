<p class="p">SDMs create a model of the relationship between species distribution and environmental predictors (such as climate, land cover/use, and habitat), which can then be projected under different climate scenarios [

 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. SDM methodology has developed very quickly so that currently there are many algorithms, platforms and software available. In our case study of the data-sparse country of Egypt, we have tried to keep the modelling as simple as possible, and hence we use just one SDM method (MaxEnt) with proven abilities in this field [

 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], especially in its ability to produce reasonable models with sparse data [
