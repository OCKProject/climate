<p class="p">We focussed on medicinal plants because (a) a validated dataset exists, unlike for all plants; and (b) they are subjected to unregulated harvesting within Egypt by pharmaceutical companies, and hence there is more concern about them than other plants. Thus we evaluated the pattern of species richness for 114 Egyptian medicinal plants projected into the future to ask what the predicted patterns of diversity, gains, losses and turnover are under the various climate-change and dispersal scenarios. Then we ask whether Egypt’s PAs provide and will provide suitable plant habitat compared with outside the PAs. There are about 30 PAs in Egypt covering approximately 15% of Egypt’s land area [

 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. In all this work, “species richness” is understood to mean a quantitative estimate of the collective habitat suitability of all the 114 species combined, since that is what the raw MaxEnt output actually means.
