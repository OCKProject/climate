<p class="p">SDMs are also used to assess the likely future value of PAs, important fundamental units in conservation which cover 14.8% of the entire land area of the world [
 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. There is a big effort to enlarge the coverage of PAs to 17% by 2020 [
 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. The important question is to what extent these PAs can preserve species under climate change, recognising that many species will shift their distributions. Current PAs might still achieve significant roles if they provide suitable areas for species to disperse into new districts [
 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. The best strategy to preserve biodiversity is to recognise and protect the best locations [
 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]—but are PAs in the “best” locations? There are several studies that measure current species richness inside and outside PAs; some found that species richness is higher inside [
 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>], while others found the opposite [
 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0187714.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. In this case study, we use species richness as our criterion to show the effectiveness of Egypt's network of PAs, given that the preservation of 'biodiversity' is their objective in nearly all cases.
