<p class="p">In this section, we econometrically estimate the short-run effects of information on respondents’ beliefs about climate change and their willingness to contribute toward preventing the onset of climate change. 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0151469.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref> shows the treatment effect of information on our various measures of beliefs, conditional on extensive respondent controls, including age, age squared, and indicators for gender, race, employment status, education, income, and political ideology. All specifications also include an indicator for soft information treatment. All subsequent specifications include these controls, unless otherwise specified. Excluding the soft information indicator or doing the analysis using the treated and control groups only does not substantively change the results. All specifications cluster standard errors at the state level. The unconditional mean of each dependent variable is shown in the row “Dep. var. mean”.
