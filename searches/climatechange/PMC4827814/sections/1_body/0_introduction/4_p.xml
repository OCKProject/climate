<p class="p">Research has shown that providing objective information alters behavior in contexts other than climate change [

 <xref rid="pone.0151469.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Although some experimental studies on the factors affecting beliefs about climate change exist [

 <xref rid="pone.0151469.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], ours is one of the first to test the effects of providing objective information about the scientific consensus, to assess the public’s perception of the credibility of such information, and to gauge the persistence of the effects over time. An exception is a recent information experiment conducted around the same time as this study [

 <xref rid="pone.0151469.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Researchers have argued that familiarity with the scientific consensus is a necessary prerequisite for the public to make informed decisions [

 <xref rid="pone.0151469.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. However, whether or not information provision would actually affect beliefs is unclear if there is substantial mistrust toward information about climate change in general [
