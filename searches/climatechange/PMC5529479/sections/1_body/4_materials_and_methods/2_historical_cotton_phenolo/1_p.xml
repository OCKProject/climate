<p id="Par22" class="p">Cotton phenological data from 1981 to 2012 were obtained from 13 agro-meteorological experimental stations maintained by the China Meteorological Administration. The Julian dates (day of year; DOY) of six phenological stages (sowing, emergence, squaring, flowering, boll opening, and harvest) were recorded at each station. A standardized observation method was used to collect the phenological data. On alternate days, observations were recorded by well-trained agricultural technicians. Each phenological event was clearly defined. For example, the squaring date was recorded when 50% of the cotton was budding, and the boll opening date was recorded when 50% of the bolls on the cotton plants were open
