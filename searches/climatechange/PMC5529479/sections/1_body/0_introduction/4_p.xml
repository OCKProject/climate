<p id="Par5" class="p">The North China Plain is one of the most important cotton production regions in China, encompassing 19,788 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and accounting for 38.66% of the area sown with cotton in China from 2005 to 2015
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>
 </sup>. The average surface temperature of this region has increased at a rate of 0.25 °C per decade over the past 50 years
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>
 </sup>. These large increases in temperature affect cotton growth and threaten the stability of cotton production in China. Therefore, investigations examining the effects of climate change on cotton phenology on the North China Plain are urgently needed. Furthermore, to understand the processes and mechanisms controlling the response of cotton to ongoing climate change, changes in cotton phenology that have occurred during the past several decades on the North China Plain in response to climate change must be investigated.
