 </sup> studied the impact of climate change on cotton yields in China, and the results showed that climate change decreased cotton yields. However, beneficial effects were found in the cotton-growing regions of Northwest China from 1961 to 2010. Therefore, the potential impact of climate change on the development and productivity of field crops is of great concern and has been evaluated extensively through simulation models, statistical analyses, and field experiments
