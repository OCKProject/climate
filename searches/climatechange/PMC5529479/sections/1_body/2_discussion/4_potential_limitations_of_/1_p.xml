<p id="Par19" class="p">This study investigated the spatiotemporal changes in cotton phenology and the relationships between cotton phenology and climate change. However, the impact of climate change on cotton phenology was not quantified. Changes in cotton phenology were found to occur in response to the combined effects of temperature, rainfall, agronomic management practices, and cultivars. Therefore, the conclusions that can be drawn from this study are limited. Addressing these limitations will require further structured experimental approaches, such as factorial experiments or model simulations. Additionally, the effect of climate change on cotton yields was not considered in this study and is a topic that we will address in the future.</p>
