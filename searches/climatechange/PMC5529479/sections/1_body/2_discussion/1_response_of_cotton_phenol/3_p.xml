 </sup>. However, few studies have investigated the impact of changes in rainfall on cotton phenology. In the present study, increasing trends in rainfall were noted at 11 (84.6%), 10 (76.9%), and 10 (76.9%) stations for the squaring-flowering and boll opening-harvest periods and the whole growing period, respectively. Furthermore, the lengths of the squaring-flowering and boll opening-harvest periods and the whole growing period were positively correlated with rainfall. Therefore, changes in rainfall would prolong the lengths of the squaring-flowering and boll opening-harvest periods and the whole growing period. However, the whole growing period of cotton in the southern part of the North China Plain decreased, which may be due to the impact of the change in Tmean on cotton phenology.
