 </sup>. In the present study, warming trends occurred during different growing periods. In addition, the lengths of the sowing-emergence, emergence-squaring, squaring-flowering, and the flowering-boll opening periods were negatively correlated with Tmean. The results were generally consistent with previous research on other crops

 </sup>. However, the lengths of the boll opening-harvest and whole growing periods were positively correlated with Tmean; climate warming lengthened the boll opening-harvest period by 5.58 day per °C on average. Thus, except for the delayed harvest date, all other cotton phenological dates were advanced, which indicated that cotton growth was accelerated by warming. However, the harvest date was delayed because of the indeterminate growth habit of cotton

 </sup>, generally resulting in shorter growing periods before flowering but longer growing periods after flowering. Ultimately, the whole growing period was generally shorter in the southern part but longer in the northern part of the North China Plain.
