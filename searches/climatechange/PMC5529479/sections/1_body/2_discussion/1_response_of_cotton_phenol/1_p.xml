 </sup>. However, most studies have focused on major food crops, and only a few have addressed trends of cotton phenology in the context of climate change

 </sup>. The present study assessed trends in cotton phenology, Tmean and rainfall on the North China Plain with respect to different cotton growing periods from 1981 to 2012. Furthermore, the relationships of the length of cotton growing periods with Tmean and rainfall were investigated. The results showed that the sowing, emergence, squaring, flowering, and boll opening dates of cotton were advanced by 0.24, 1.29, 0.91, 2.71 and 0.82 days per decade on average, respectively, but the cotton harvest date was delayed by 0.28 days on average per decade. Furthermore, while the lengths of sowing-emergence, emergence-squaring, and squaring-flowering periods decreased, those of the flowering-boll opening and boll opening-harvest periods increased by 1.28 and 2.20 days per decade on average, respectively.
