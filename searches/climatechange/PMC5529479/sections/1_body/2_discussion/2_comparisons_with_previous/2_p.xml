<p id="Par17" class="p">Previous studies about other crops conducted in Europe and on the U.S. Great Plains have shown strong negative links between temperature and phenology, and the agricultural phases of many crops have been advanced due to increased temperatures

 </sup>. These findings are similar to our results. However, the lengths of the boll opening-harvest period and the whole growing period were positively correlated with Tmean in the present study, possibly because of the indeterminate growth habit of cotton. The indeterminate growth habit of cotton means that as long as the environment is suitable for cotton, it could continue to grow
