<p id="Par18" class="p">Considering the increasing trend of temperature in relation to the cotton sowing time and the indeterminate growth habit of cotton, adjusting the sowing date would be beneficial for rational utilization of the heat resource to extend the period of cotton growth and to develop and improve the cotton yield potential. Moreover, farmers could make full use of the higher temperature during cotton sowing by adopting deep planting and other supporting technology to avoid the use of plastic film mulching during sowing and reduce “White Pollution”. Furthermore, this study indicated that flowering occurred earlier as a result of climate change. The risk of heat damage could increase by a combination of warming, the change in the date of flowering, and the particular sensitivity of cotton to extreme heat during flowering. Therefore, heat-resistant varieties and appropriate cultivation practices are required to reduce the impact of excessive heat. In addition, this study indicated that a warming trend in recent decades has delayed the cotton harvest date in the northern part of the North China Plain; therefore, adopting cultivars with a longer growing period would benefit future cotton production in the northern part of the North China Plain. Nevertheless, the temperature is higher after boll opening, and changes in farming practices, such as adjusting the sowing date and the use of newer cultivars, will therefore be necessary to adapt to climate warming.</p>
