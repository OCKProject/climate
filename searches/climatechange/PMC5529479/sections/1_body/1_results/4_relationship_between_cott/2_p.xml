<p id="Par12" class="p">The correlation coefficients between rainfall and the lengths of the sowing-emergence were generally negative, at 0.05 on average, while the correlation coefficients between rainfall and the length of the flowering-boll opening periods and the whole growing period were generally positive, at 0.23 and 0.10 on average, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1d</xref>). The length of the sowing-emergence period was negatively correlated with rainfall at 9 (69.2%) stations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>). Furthermore, the correlation coefficient between rainfall and the length of the flowering-boll opening and the whole growing periods was positive at 11 (84.6%) and 9 (69.2%) stations, respectively.
