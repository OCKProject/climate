 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The Tmean values during the sowing-emergence, emergence-squaring, squaring-flowering, flowering-boll opening, and boll opening-harvest periods and the whole growing period increased 0.29, 0.31, 0.43, 0.05, 0.36, and 0.24 °C per decade on average, respectively. From 1981 to 2012, the Tmean values during the sowing-emergence, emergence-squaring, squaring-flowering, flowering-boll opening, and boll opening-harvest periods and the whole growing period increased at 10 (77.0%), 12 (92.3%), 13 (100.0%), 11 (84.6%),12 (92.3%) and 12 (92.3%) stations, respectively, and this increase was significant at 1 (7.7%), 6 (46.2%), 8 (61.5%), 0 (0%), 9 (69.2%) and 10 (77.0%) stations, respectively, although decreases were also observed at several stations.
