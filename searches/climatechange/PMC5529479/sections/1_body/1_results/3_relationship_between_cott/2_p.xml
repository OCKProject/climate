<p id="Par10" class="p">The correlation coefficients between Tmean and the lengths of the sowing-emergence, emergence-squaring, squaring-flowering and flowering-boll opening periods were generally negative, at −0.20, −0.17, −0.29, −0.35 on average, respectively, while the correlation coefficients between Tmean and the boll opening-harvest and whole growing periods were generally positive, at 0.20 and 0.11 on average, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>). A negative correlation was found at 11 (84.6%), 9 (69.2%), 12 (92.3%), and 12 (92.3%) stations, and this correlation was significant at 4 (30.8%), 5 (38.5%), 6 (46.2%), and 6 (46.2%) stations, respectively (

In contrast, the correlation coefficients between Tmean and the lengths of the boll opening-harvest period and the whole growing period were positive at 11 (84.6%) and 10 (77.0%) stations, respectively. These correlations were significant at 1 (7.7%) and 2 (15.4%) stations, respectively (
