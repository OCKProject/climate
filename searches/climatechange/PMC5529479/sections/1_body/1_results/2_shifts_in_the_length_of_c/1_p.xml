<p id="Par8" class="p">In general, the sowing-emergence, emergence-squaring, and squaring-flowering periods and the whole growing period of cotton were shorter by 1.50, 1.94, and 1.96 days per decade on average, respectively, while the flowering-boll opening and boll opening-harvest periods were longer by 1.28 and 2.20 days per decade on average, respectively, (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). The lengths of the sowing-emergence, emergence-squaring, and squaring-flowering periods and the whole growing period decreased at 12 (92.3%), 8 (61.5%), 12 (92.3%) and 8 (61.5%) stations, respectively, and this decrease was significant at 9 (69.2%), 5 (38.5%), 6 (46.2%), and 5 (38.5%) of these stations, respectively, among the 13 North China Plain stations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). In contrast, the lengths of both the flowering-boll opening and boll opening-harvest periods increased at 10 (77.0%) stations, with 1 (7.7%) and 3 (23.1%) of the 13 North China Plain stations showing significant increases during these respective periods. Furthermore, while the length of the whole growing period increased at the northern North China Plain stations, it decreased at most of the stations.
