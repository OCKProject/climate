<p id="Par20" class="p">This study investigated the spatiotemporal changes in cotton phenology and the length of different cotton growing phases and explored the relationship between the lengths of different cotton growing phases and climate change on the North China Plain from 1981 to 2012. The results showed that the sowing, emergence, squaring, flowering, and boll opening dates generally advanced, but harvest was delayed in the northern part and advanced in the southern part of the North China Plain. The sowing-emergence, emergence-squaring, and squaring-flowering periods of cotton were shortened by 1.50, 1.94, and 1.96 days per decade on average, respectively, but the flowering-boll opening and boll opening-harvest periods were prolonged on average by 1.28 and 2.20 days per decade, respectively. The lengths of the sowing-emergence, emergence-squaring, squaring-flowering, and flowering-boll opening periods were negatively correlated with Tmean, whereas the lengths of the boll opening-harvest period and the whole growing period were positively correlated with Tmean. The results indicated that the phenology of cotton on the North China Plain has been significantly impacted by climate change and that such changes in cotton phenology affect the development and yield of cotton. Therefore, adjusting the sowing date, using heat-resistant varieties, and adopting appropriate cultivation practices will be necessary to combat climate change in the future. These results support the exploration of appropriate agricultural strategies and policies to adapt to global climate change on the North China Plain and in other areas with a similar ecology.</p>
