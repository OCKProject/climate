<p id="Par15" class="p">The area of Qinghai Lake had shrunk slowly in the period of 1987 to 2005. In the downward trend of lake area from 1987–2005, precipitation increased slightly, along with lower snow line and quite higher evaporation. Then, a rapid increase of lake area was observed from 2005–2016. Within this period, it also had increasing precipitation, but with elevated snow line and reduced evaporation. In addition, there is a certain fluctuation of lake area from 2014 to 2016, which is consistent with the precipitation changes (also with evident fluctuation) in Gangcha station (the nearest meteorological station to Qinghai Lake). Therefore, the change of the lake area on the plateau should be attributed to combined climatic variables. As an important response area of global climate change, the temperature was rising in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, especially in recent years, which has also been revealed in the previous studies

 </sup>. Moreover, although temperature has no significantly direct influence on the area of Qinghai Lake, it drives the changes of snow line, thereby affecting the lake area. Furthermore, evaporation usually contributes to outflow of lakes, but it has the low magnitude on the plateau. It is also possible that the vegetation and wind, in addition to water bodies, could influence evaporation. Therefore, evaporation has limited effect on the area of Qinghai Lake based on our results.
