 </sup>, which reconstructed the fluctuation of lake level in the last 600 years and the results showed that there was a tight relationship between lake level and precipitation. Rivers, whose runoff due to glaciers and precipitation, plays important roles in the supply of natural water of Qinghai Lake. Although surface runoff accounts for 46.59% of the water in Qinghai Lake, D-O water isotope experiments had demonstrated that the primary source of runoff was precipitation, not glacial meltwater

 </sup>. Therefore, although evaporation, snow line, and temperature have certain influences on Qinghai Lake area, the primary driver of the change in Qinghai Lake area is the increase of precipitation. Meanwhile, all the available data of remote sensing images and meteorological information related to the research were collected and analyzed. More available data, including both remote sensing and climatic data, would promote our further understanding of the global climate changes on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.
