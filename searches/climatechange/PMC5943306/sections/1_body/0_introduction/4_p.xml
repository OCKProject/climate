<p id="Par5" class="p">The aim of this study is to investigate the correlations among climate change, average altitude of snow line, and the area of Qinghai Lake based on spatial analysis of remotely sensed imagery and meteorological data. The remote sensing images of Qinghai Lake during 1987–2016 were collected to calculate its area. Meanwhile, the meteorological data of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau during 1970–2016 was collected and analyzed.</p>
