 </sup>. The model was constructed by IBM SPSS AMOS 21 software. The model of this study was established by the potential relationships between theÂ five possible variables, i.e., area of Qinghai Lake, temperature, precipitation, evaporation, and snow line. The data of precipitation, evaporation, and temperature were collected from Gangcha meteorological station, which is the nearest meteorological station to Qinghai Lake. The snow line data was collected from Gangshika peak. Then, the stochastic relationship between variables was tested by model reasonableness test.
