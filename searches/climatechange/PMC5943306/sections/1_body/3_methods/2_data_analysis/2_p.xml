<p id="Par20" class="p">Bands 5, 4, and 3 (for R, G and B respectively) of Landsat TM/ETM+ were selected for false color composites (bands 6, 4, and 3 for Landsat8 OLI), so that snow and glaciers could be differentiated. More than 20 points were selected along the snow line of Lenglong mountain range, with equal points distributed on the south and north slope. In addition, distances between the two adjacent points on the mountain range were relatively equal. Altitudes of the points were extracted from ASTER GDEM V2 with the resolution of 30 m.</p>
