 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. Snow line of Gangshika peak was analyzed by GIS images during July-August, when Qinghai has the highest temperature. Two Gaofen-1 WFV4 images were selected due to the lack of appropriate images of the lake (year 2013 and 2016), which can be gained from RS Cloud Mart (http://www.rscloudmart.com/en). Additionally, remote sensing images of all months were selected to study the changes of Qinghai Lake for reference and calibration.
