 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>. Annual mean temperature and annual precipitation data were collected from 1970 to 2015 (all the available data). In addition, evaporation data from 1970 to 2016 were also analyzed. From 1970 to 2003, annual pan evaporation was provided. After 2003, only daily evaporation was available and different evaporator were applied. Thus, average daily evaporation from June to August after 2003 was selected to match the following GIS data.
