<p id="Par11" class="p">The rationality test of SEM includes coefficient rationality, significance test, and goodness of fit test. The overall fitness of the model is expressed by normed fit index (NFI), Goodness of fit index (GFI), Comparative fit index (CFI), Incremental fit index (IFI), and Root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). Fitting results of the model are given directly by AMOS software (TableÂ
