<p id="Par12" class="p">The maximum likelihood method was applied to evaluate the model. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>, the lake area is affected by precipitation, snow line, evaporation, and temperature. It confirmed a strong positive correlation between the precipitation and lake area (coefficient =0.76, P = 0.025). Snow line and lake area are also positively related (coefficient = 0.23, P = 0.036), while both evaporation and temperature have evidently negative correlation with lake area (coefficient = −0.17, P = 0.049; coefficient = −0.03, P = 0.065).
