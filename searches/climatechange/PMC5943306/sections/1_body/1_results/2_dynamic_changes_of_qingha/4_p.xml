<p id="Par13" class="p">Temperature has a certain impact on precipitation, snow line, and evaporation (coefficient = 0.10, P = 0.043; coefficient = 0.16, P = 0.010; coefficient = −0.06, P = 0.020). Moreover, effect of precipitation on the snowline around Qinghai Leke is notable (coefficient = −0.12, P = 0.012), only second to temperature. Furthermore, there is a weakly negative correlation between the evaporation and snow line (coefficient = −0.07, P = 0.030).</p>
