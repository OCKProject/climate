<p id="Par9" class="p">During the period of 1970–2015, the average value of annual mean temperature in the seven meteorological stations increased 0.319 °C per decade. Furthermore, the temperatures of all stations increased to different extents. The annual mean temperature changes of Dachaidan, Dulan, Gangcha, Golmud, Xining, Yushu, and Lhasa were 0.542, 0.305, 0.371, 0.489, 0.014, 0.358 and 0.514 °C per decade respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). Xining station shows the lowest increase of temperature in the past 50 years, probably due to that it is on the edge of the plateau.
