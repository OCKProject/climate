<p id="Par6" class="p">Between 1970 and 2015, annual precipitation for the seven meteorological stations in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau increased by 10.7 mm per decade. Compared with temperature, precipitation variation on Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau had evidently spatial heterogeneity. Annual precipitation variedamong the seven stations, e.g., the annual precipitation changes of Dachaidan, Dulan, Gangcha, Golmud, Xining, Yushu and Lhasa were 3.295, 15.38, 15.603, 1.452, 1.754, −1.269 and 19.271 mm per decade respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Lhasa and Gangcha had the largest increase of annual precipitations among all the meteorological stations. From 2005 to 2016, annual precipitations of Dachaidan, Dulan, Gangcha, Golmud, Xining, Yushu and Lhasa had the changes of −17.063, −52.598, 81.262, −0.521, −44.395, 13.199 and 70.927 mm/10 y respectively. The precipitation in Gangcha meteorological station hence had the largest value. Moreover, average annual precipitation in Gangcha during 2005–2016 was 313.53 mm, with an elevation of 26.26 mm than that during 1970–2004.
