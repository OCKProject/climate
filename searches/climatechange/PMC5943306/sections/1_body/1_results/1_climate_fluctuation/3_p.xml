 </sup>. Annual pan evaporation of Dachaidan, Dulan, Gangcha, Golmud, and Xining has decreased by 6.255, 11.059, 1.343, 16.21 and 19.433 mm/y respectively during the period of 1970–2003 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). However, annual pan evaporation of Yushu and Lhasa increased by 9.089 and 1.634 mm/y. The average value of annual pan evaporation of all stations was −6.34 mm/y. During the period of 2004–2016, average daily evaporation from June to August of the seven locations decreased by 0.5–0.9 mm/10 y, including Yushu and Lhasa (the measuring methods were different due to the change of evaporator) (Fig.
