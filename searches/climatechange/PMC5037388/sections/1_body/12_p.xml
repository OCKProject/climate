<p class="p">I develop a systematic method for integrating data at appropriate scales, optimizing the calculation of vulnerability and constructing a typology of adaptations. I contribute to the literature on integration, optimization and typology of vulnerability and adaptation using the case of Australian crop-drought vulnerability. Specially, our novelties are (1) a six-level analysis framework for transforming typology to integration, (2) a detailed seven-fold typology of vulnerability and adaptive strategies for Australian crops, (3) and a dynamic transition method for transformations between integration and typology.</p>
