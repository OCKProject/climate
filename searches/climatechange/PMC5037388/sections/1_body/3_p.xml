<p class="p">In order to reflect heterogeneity on different dimensions, constructing a typology involves a series of questions. It is important to identify the special conditions of local climates at different scales
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref>, the regional limits of adaptive capacity
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref> and to consider the interests of stakeholders
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" class="xref">25</xref>. The monthly growing response of vegetation to drought in some regions is selected to provide some useful information concerning the operations of the time scales
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" class="xref">26</xref>. Under the framework of “Loss-response”, the time dimension includes before, during and after disaster periods, the spatial dimension contains community, town, country and province, while there are also economic, institutional, social, and environmental attributes
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref>. A typology comprised of six content themes: 
 <italic class="italic">study region, climate hazards, relevant sector, impacts of concern, potential adaptation options, decision processes and tools for adaptation</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>. The assessment of vulnerability should answer the “4W2H” questions: 
 <italic class="italic">What are the goals? How is the assessment of vulnerability framed? What are the technical methods? Who participates in the assessment? How will it be used to facilitate change?</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" class="xref">28</xref> Thereby a typology can identify different types of temporal and spatial scales, attribution, research objectives, adaptations, methods of measurement and policy tools. Nevertheless, few researchers to date have systematically described the process of decision-making in climate change adaptation and none has clarified the relationships between typology and integration or emphasized the match and optimization of indicators.
