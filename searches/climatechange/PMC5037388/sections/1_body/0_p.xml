<p class="p">Climate change can have a huge impact on socioeconomic and ecological systems
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>. Through recent decades, interdisciplinary research has contributed to improving our knowledge of empirical methodologies related to assessing climate change vulnerability

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>. In recent years, integrated indicators combining climatic and non-climatic elements at different scales have been developed for quantifying vulnerability
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref>. These aim to develop robust and credible measures incorporating diverse methods such as principal components analysis (PCA)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" class="xref">6</xref> and draw on research into adaptive mechanisms
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>. For example, vulnerability is considered to be a function of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capability
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref> or it can be calculated by different formulations in different contexts
