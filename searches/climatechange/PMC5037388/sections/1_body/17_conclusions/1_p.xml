<p class="p">Who (some people) are concerned about how to adapt to the vulnerability of what to what in some place (where) at some time (when)? It means the adaptation pathway should transit and transform integration into typology among environmental types (i.e., types of time, space, who) and vulnerability types (i.e., exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity). I illustrated the hypothesis that the process of assessing vulnerability and selecting adaptations can be enhanced by using a combination of integration, optimization and typology based on heterogeneities in space, time, social factors, exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity, using the case of Australia’s wheat sheep zones over the period 1981–1999. Our analysis framework of integration and typology of vulnerability can be of benefit to policy makers in determining appropriate adaptive strategies, and for crop–climate researchers to integrate socioeconomic factors into crop models. Although there are many advantages to the so called “six types” framework, the complexity due to the many types and factors and their interaction represents one of its disadvantages. This provides an opportunity for further research. In the case of Australia in particular, further work would be useful to select more socioeconomic indicators, such as human capital and develop more sub-classifications, such as regions of good harvest in drought and crop failure regions without drought, which I leave for further work.</p>
