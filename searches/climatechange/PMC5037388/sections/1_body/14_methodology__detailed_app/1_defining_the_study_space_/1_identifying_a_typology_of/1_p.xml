<p class="p">Australia is the world’s sixth largest exporter of aggregated food production and thus contributes significantly to world food supply. Among many broad acre agricultural production systems in Australia, wheat sheep zones are found to account for 90–95% of Australia’s crop outputs, but often suffer from long-term droughts

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" class="xref">32</xref>. Therefore, I select 12 wheat sheep zones as our study areas, after continually shrinking the spatial scales from country to regions, then to the main crop production regions of Australia. The wheat sheep zones cover the north and east Wheat Belt (522), the central and south wheat belt (521) in Western Australia, the Eyre Peninsula (421), the Murray Lands and Yorke Peninsula (422) in South Australia, the Mallee (221), the Willera (222), the Central North (223) in Victoria, the Riverina (123), the Central West (122), the North west Slopes and Plains (121) in New South Wales, the Eastern Darling Downs (321) and the Darling Downs and Central Highlands in Queensland (the number in the parentheses represents the region code).
