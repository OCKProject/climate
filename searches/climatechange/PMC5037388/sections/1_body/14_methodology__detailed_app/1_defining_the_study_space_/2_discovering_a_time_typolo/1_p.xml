<p class="p">I select an annual scale rather than a monthly or seasonal one because I can then use the annual socioeconomic indicators and the crops grow to harvest once a year. I select 1978â€“1999 as our observed period because recent literature has analyzed the vulnerability of crops to drought during recent decades but before 2000 there had been little attempt to integrate socioeconomic indicators into climate change research in Australia
