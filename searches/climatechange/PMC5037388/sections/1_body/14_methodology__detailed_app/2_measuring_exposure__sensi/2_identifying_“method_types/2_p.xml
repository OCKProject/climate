<p class="p">According to the method types, the selected indicators of drought include rainfall, temperature and soil-moisture, etc. Due to its direct link with the planting of crops, I used soil-moisture to estimate the severity of drought. Then, I compared the results using different calculation methods of the drought index using soil-moisture data. Many agrohydrologists have researched the conceptual and practical issues of scales and scaling, for instance, why scaling problems arise, the defineand types of scales and the key questions with regard to upscaling and downscaling were discussed
