<p class="p">Drought is a major problem in Australia
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45" class="xref">45</xref>; the Millennium droughts for example reduced aggregate agricultural production and exports which resulted in global fluctuations in food prices
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" class="xref">46</xref>. Recent droughts, especially in 2007, also caused significant destruction
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" class="xref">47</xref>. Exposure is the magnitude and frequency of extreme climate events
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48" class="xref">48</xref>, so I selected drought as an obvious exposure element of climate change according to the focus types.
