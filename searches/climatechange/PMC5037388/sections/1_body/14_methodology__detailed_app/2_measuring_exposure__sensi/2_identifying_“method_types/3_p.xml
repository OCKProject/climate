<p class="p">Comparing many different ways of performing the calculation of drought index, I selected six ways to express the drought index (DI) following the relevant literature that use at least three different calculation methods
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53" class="xref">53</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54" class="xref">54</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55" class="xref">55</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56" class="xref">56</xref>. Firstly, the Soil Moisture Deciles-based Drought Index (SMDDI) of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and sciences Regions (ABARER) was used as the drought index. This is abbreviated to SNR from SMDDI in the Natural Resource Management Regions (NRMR)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" class="xref">29</xref>. Map grids divide the Earthâ€™s surface into a uniform array and since there are different planted areas in each grid, I weighted the SMDDI in each geographical grid by the percentage of its planting area in the whole research area to produce a weighted SNR, WSNR. Here, following previous literature
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" class="xref">29</xref>, I defined vulnerable cases to be those with a SNR or WSNR greater than 0.03. Secondly, I indirectly measured droughts using SNRM or WSNRM, which are defined as the ratio of the SNR or WSNR to its own mean. I ignored SNRM or WSNRM when it was zerobecause this simply indicates there was no drought. MSNR or MWSNR is the reciprocal of the SNRM or WSNRM, respectively and was used as a wetness index. Finally, I ascertained the appropriate research duration through comparing the correlations between these six types of drought indexand annual yield as well as failure for three crops in the same and offset (lagged by one) year. All calculation methods are defined in equation (2):
