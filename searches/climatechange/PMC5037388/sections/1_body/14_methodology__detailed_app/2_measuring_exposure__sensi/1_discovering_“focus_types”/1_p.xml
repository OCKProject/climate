<p class="p">The focuses types result from the process of selecting the sensitivity of something from everything according to particular conditions. Sensitivity reflects the response of a given system to climatic variation, may be influenced by socioeconomic and ecological conditions
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" class="xref">35</xref>. Practically everything is affected by the climate in the research fields, I am considering so that I hardly need to list and select which is their first priority. In Australian wheat sheep zones during 1978â€“1999, crop yields were directly affected and different crops respond differently to climatic variations
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" class="xref">36</xref>. Therefore, I applied the crop yield anomaly of wheat, oats and barley as a proxy for crop sensitivity to drought.
