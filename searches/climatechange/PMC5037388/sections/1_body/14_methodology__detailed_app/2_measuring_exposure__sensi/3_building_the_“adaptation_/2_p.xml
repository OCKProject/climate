<p class="p">First is to classify resilient and sensitive cases according to the ranks of CFI and DI. The relationships between sensitivity and exposure determine that the method types should compare and integrate the CFI and DI into vulnerability at appropriate space and time scales. I classified the resilient and sensitive cases and the financial typology of vulnerability. After ranking the CFI and DI, I considered “resilient” cases if the CFI was below the median while the DI was above the median. “Sensitive” cases were defined to be those where the CFI was above the median and the DI was below the median.</p>
