<p class="p">Second is to integrate and optimize vulnerability. Although exposure and sensitivity are integrated into vulnerability through various calculations by different researchers, to simplify the question, I defined the crop-drought vulnerability index (VI) as sensitivity divided by exposure and then used the divergence of yield from its own mean (DY) as the baseline of vulnerability. Since DY reflects the variance of the actual yield loss relative to the average, different levels of VI representthe variance of relative crop yield loss to the variance of relative drought, thereby I selected the optimal crop-drought vulnerability index as the smallest
