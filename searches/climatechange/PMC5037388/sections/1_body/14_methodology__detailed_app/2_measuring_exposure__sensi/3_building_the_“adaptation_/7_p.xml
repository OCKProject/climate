<p class="p">Selecting and integrating adaptive capacity is the third step. Adaptive capacity reflects the ability of a system to adjust to changing climate in a way that reduces potential damage and takes advantage of any associated opportunities
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60" class="xref">60</xref>. The socioeconomic attribution of adaptive capacity determines various method types; the key operational measurements of adaptive capacity is about how to identify which indicators from all possible socioeconomic indicators using first-classifying-then-integrating methods. I investigated what parameters indicate a statistically significant difference between resilient and sensitive cases using 146 socio-economic indicators from the AAGIS. Then, I took the indicators from the 1
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> principal component (PC1) from a PCA of the selected indicators. I identified significant indicators through a Spearmanâ€™s correlation test among the indicators included in 
 <italic class="italic">PC1</italic> and levels of vulnerability for resilient and sensitive cases, respectively. Finally, I characterized regional adaptive capacity using the parameters of capital, cost, debt, receipts, farm equity, family farm, farm performance and other assets.
