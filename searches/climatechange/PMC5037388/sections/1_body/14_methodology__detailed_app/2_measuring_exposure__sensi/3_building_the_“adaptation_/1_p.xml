<p class="p">Sensitivity as “the degree to which a system is affected, either adversely or beneficially, by climate-related stimuli”
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57" class="xref">57</xref>, while resilience refers to the magnitude of disturbance that can be absorbed before a system changes to a radically different state as well as the capacity to self-organize and the capacity for adaptation to emerging circumstances
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58" class="xref">58</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59" class="xref">59</xref>. Thus, sensitivity and resilience have common elements of interest: the shocks and stresses experienced by the social-ecological system, the response of the system, and the capacity for adaptive action
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>. Given certain exposure, sensitivity maybe negative with resilience. Here, I only classify resilient and sensitive cases, which means the resilience equals to less sensitivity so that I can identify some vulnerable cases.
