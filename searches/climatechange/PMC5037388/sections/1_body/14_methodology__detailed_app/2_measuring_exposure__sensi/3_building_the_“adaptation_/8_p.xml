<p class="p">Providing typologies of vulnerability and adaptations based on regional financial constraints is the fourth step. The setting up of reasonable criteria is a critical step in defining the adaptation and vulnerability types. In systems affected by climate change, social heterogeneity for different stakeholders at particular locations and times are relevant for such criteria. Farmers in Australian wheat sheep zones, in the period 1978â€“1999, focus on their financial costs and benefits from climate change. To find financial constraints for every region, I summed all the significant indicators for each category. Total opening capital and debt presents one category; total receipts, farm performance, family performance and assets are the sum of their indicators respectively. Total cost equals the sum of all cost indicators except expenditures on fodder, fertilizer and crop &amp; pasture chemicals. Lack of capital, low receipts and assets, family farm and farm performance, as well as higher costs and debt are the regional constraints to adaption to climate change.</p>
