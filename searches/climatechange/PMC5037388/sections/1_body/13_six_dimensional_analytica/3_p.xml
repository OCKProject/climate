<p class="p">The next three steps include identifying what I call “focus types” to measure the sensitivity “of what”, selecting the types of method to assess the level of exposure to climate shocks and finding types of adaptation to reduce the vulnerability at practical dimensions. Within a defined system, many kinds of climatic stocks, such as droughts, floods, freezing conditions and hail storms, etc. may happen simultaneously and affect various kinds of activity. The focus type shows paths for exploration to select “of what to what” to answer “
 <italic class="italic">which kinds of climate change occur?</italic>”and “
 <italic class="italic">which systems are affected by climate change?</italic>” This may consider the vulnerability of crops to drought, the vulnerability of rural livelihoods to water scarcity etc. The “method typology” provides the processes needed to measure vulnerability, such as conceptualizing and calculating crop-drought vulnerability. The question of “
 <italic class="italic">how will people assess and adapt to climate change?</italic>” involves assessing vulnerability and selecting effective adaptations. The “adaptation typology” can provide a useful tool to assess local adaptive capacity and to select local adaptations according to regional system constraints.
