<p class="p">The first three steps of systematically defining environments are: ascertaining the types of purposes which are significant for stakeholders, identifying location types to define the study areas at appropriate spatial scales and selecting the time scale of the research. Careful selection of areas to investigate according to spatial heterogeneity in socioeconomic and ecological systems can answer the question “
 <italic class="italic">Where does climate change occur?</italic>” A typology of locations meansthat the researcher can locate an appropriate spatial scale to assess vulnerability at global, national, regional and community levels through scientific methods. Climate change has different characteristics and influences during different time-periods, therefore it is important to answer the question “
 <italic class="italic">when are the people affected by climate change?</italic>” A time typology implies that the researcher should find the effective temporal scale from millennia, centuries, decades and years, according to the frequency and severity of climate shocks. Due to the heterogeneity of regions, different groups of people have dissimilar responses to climate change

 <italic class="italic">who is concerned about climate change?</italic>” based on their different experiences of it. In general, climate change at different spatial and temporal scales affects people in diverse ways, so I need to select appropriate typologies to define all relevant systems.
