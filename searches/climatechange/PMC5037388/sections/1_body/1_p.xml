<p class="p">However, the current generation of integrated methods and diverse calculation techniques can lead to confusion in selecting scales, indicators and calculation methods. Existing integrated indicator methods such as integrated assessment (IA) and ‘Drivers-Pressure-State-Impact-Response’ (DPSIR)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref> are not well suited for combining multiple spatial, temporal scales and socioeconomic-ecological dimensions in a locality due to limited knowledge of several factors, such as the availability of a farm’s perceived adaptations. This has led some scholars to question what indicators can accomplish in the domain of climate change vulnerability
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref> because some indicators represent neither what researchers want to measure nor allow for the effect of feed-back
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref>. These integrated indices also ignore the interactional effects of complementarities and substitution between indicators in PCA, which can misinform stakeholders such as farmers
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref> and result in a science-policy gap
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" class="xref">16</xref>. Uncertainties combine with different methodologies and diverse place and time scales, due to the different contexts. Local socioeconomic conditions and wider ecological environments vary widely. Much of the relevant measurement and methodology for understanding vulnerability and adaptation to climate change can therefore only be appreciated in a particular context.
