<p class="p">The “six typologies” framework emphasizes six heterogeneities. The environmental heterogeneity of the observed regions has shown that regional climatic variation and climate change, soil conditions and crop management are different at different dimensions and levels
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61" class="xref">61</xref>. In addition, socioeconomic heterogeneity is worthy of more attention by “5W1H”. Seven financial categories affect all resilient and sensitive cases for the three crops, which determine the financial heterogeneity of the vulnerabilities for barley, wheat and oats in Australia. I confirmed that (i) the level of capital and receipts reduce the vulnerability for wheat; farm performance decreases the vulnerability for oats, while family farm is negatively related to vulnerability for oats. Commonly, agricultural capital investments and higher crop receipts improve the returns of farming and reduce vulnerability
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62" class="xref">62</xref>. Here, just wheat, barley and oats are affected by differential financial capital arrangements that show the heterogeneity of crops. Droughts can cause family farms to lose income diversity and increase their debt
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63" class="xref">63</xref>, potentially leading to a “cycle of poverty”
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64" class="xref">64</xref> which can affect the inter-generational succession of family farms
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65" class="xref">65</xref>. (ii) Cost and debt add to the vulnerability for wheat and barley. Drought imposes substantial costs for entities, public ventures, commercial organizations and governments
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66" class="xref">66</xref>. Farmers may bear increased costs due to water scarcity or the necessity of irrigation during long-term severe droughts
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67" class="xref">67</xref>. Benmelech and Dvir
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68" class="xref">68</xref> demonstrated that short-term debt increases vulnerability. Our results support the idea that regional heterogeneity arises from environmental factors (e.g., local crops and climate change) and social factors (e.g., financial constraints), so creating a typology is useful for finding differences in each defined system. In total, the framework of “six typologies” reflects the heterogeneity of space, time, human factors, exposure, sensitivity and vulnerability.
