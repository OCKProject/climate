<p class="p">Seven generic types of adaptations are valuable for making policy. I also construct seven generic types corresponding to adaptive strategies for each type of vulnerability in Australian wheat sheep zones. For Type 1 vulnerability, making additions to plant &amp; equipment would upgrade agricultural technology. Planting more drought-tolerant varieties of crop would make more effective use of capital to help buffer harvests against drought. Alternatively, accumulating and utilizing farm equity to augment capital investment on the farm and using farm related liquid assets more efficiency may reduce Type 2 vulnerability. The methods of reducing Type 3 vulnerability may include measures to keep agricultural prices stable and protecting agricultural receipts to avoid the huge transition from farm to off-farm industrial activities. Increasing farm cash income and profit through the market mechanism or government allowance can reduce Type 4 vulnerability

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71" class="xref">71</xref>. Deploying technological investments and improving special management skills may also be key strategies to reduce this vulnerability that could also involve reducing costs in agricultural processes such as planting, fodder, spraying, and fertilizer, which would be a good way to reduce Type 6 vulnerability
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72" class="xref">72</xref>. One way to reduce debt-induced vulnerability is to supervise the risk of debt through developing financial tools and reducing land purchasing
