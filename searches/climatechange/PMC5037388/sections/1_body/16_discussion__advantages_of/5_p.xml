<p class="p">Such a primary understanding is essential for a range of applications. First, the typology of adaptation provides a device that can help inform stakeholders as to what type of vulnerability they face and to adjust their adaptive strategies accordingly. Second, the typology puts forward a way that human factors can be better incorporated into cropâ€“climate models, improving our appreciation of how underlying socioeconomic processes affect crop yields and showing where they are vulnerable to these changes. Third, the typology is still useful for those regions listed in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, such as Eyre Peninsula where there is no match between limited regions and identified regions. If the resilient or sensitive regions have not been constrained by any of the listed categories in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>, I should consider more socioeconomic indicators beyond our list, such as human capital and crop prices, which give the policy-maker new guidelines and lead us to potential further work. If the regions exclude the resilient or sensitive cases where I know their socioeconomic features, there are at least two categories: the good crop harvest regions in drought conditions and the crop failure regions without drought, which require us to further rebuild the typology of the vulnerability and adaptation.
