 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>) through demonstrating the methodology of the Australian case. First, define the research systems through selecting and matching the most appropriate space, time scales, people and purposes. For example, I select farmers concerns about climate change in Australian wheat sheep zones in 1978–1999. Then conceptualizing, comparing and matching “vulnerability of what to what” is the key to managing vulnerability, among which exposure and sensitivity are used to select appropriate indicators and explore various calculation methods to optimize the measurement of vulnerability. For example, I explored crop-drought vulnerability through matching two kinds of CFI with six kinds of DI. The third is to assess vulnerability through classifying the cases according to their constraints and thresholds at appropriate spatial and temporal scales. Classifications of resilient and sensitive cases in the context of local limitations were also developed in the study. Finally, a typology of adaptations was derived according to the typology of vulnerability. This match, expressed in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, helps us to clearly identify local adaptations according to local heterogeneity.
