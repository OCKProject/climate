<p class="p">There are dynamic transitions and transformations between integration and typology. I construct and apply a plane grid that comprises six dimensions and six levels (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>) to express integration and typology. This scheme is intended to assist with the common need for robust decision making within the process of assessing vulnerability and applying appropriate adaptation measures. I develop and test the new “adaptation pathways” through providing a linear sequence, and for instance, identify farmers’ options for actions for reducing farm losses due to adverse climatic events, from more general to more specific using decomposition methods. Meanwhile, I define and match what the farms are concerned about such as, which crops, which climate elements, how to assess and respond to shocks, etc. in the vertical direction using inductive methods. The combinations of the inductive and deductive methods here means I have to match and optimize the integration and typologies in these six dimensions and levels when answering the questions of “5W1H”
