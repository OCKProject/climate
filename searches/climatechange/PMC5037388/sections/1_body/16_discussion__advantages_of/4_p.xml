<p class="p">This typology of adaptations is intended to match the identified regions that are constrained by financial conditions with the resilient or sensitive regions for different crops. For example, Murray Lands and Yorke Peninsula (422) is a resilient region for wheat, while also being a capital and farm asset-constrained region. The match of both means capital and farm assets constrains the adaptive capacity for wheat there. Additionally, the resilient barley in Darling Downs and Central Highlands (322) is limited by cost because of the match of resilient typology of barley and the constraints of heterogeneous costs. This match is useful for creating and selecting the typology of vulnerability and adaptations.</p>
