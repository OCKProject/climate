<p class="p">The two differences of scale-selections and lagged effects between the current study and its predecessors
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" class="xref">26</xref> further can show the usefulness of our methodology. It focused on the activity and process at monthly scale without considering human adaptation, and acknowledged that such lag effects existed but usually become short demonstrated by the response of vegetation activity, forest growth, and the ANPP to short drought
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" class="xref">26</xref>. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>, six dimensions and six levels mean that we can select different time scales with the same crop in different spatial scales. The integration, matching and optimization as well as typology should be affected by the type of scientific question, the availability of data and the matches of different spatial and temporal scales in the assessments of vulnerability. Here I selected vulnerability of annual crop yield to drought in wheat sheep zones because I have no access to the available climatic data and the monthly livelihood capital. In contrast, I focus on the methodology of the research design to answer the questions “Who (some people) are concerned about how to adapt to the vulnerability of what to what in some place (where) at some time (when)?” I also emphasized on the socioeconomic adaptation that may cause the long-term lagged effects. For example, heterogeneous regions constraints determined different adaptive strategies, which means the next-year yield are affected by the decision of production according to today’s response. Such decision processes include the lag-influence in crop planting. Therefore, I considered the lagged effect of the drought on annual crop yield.
