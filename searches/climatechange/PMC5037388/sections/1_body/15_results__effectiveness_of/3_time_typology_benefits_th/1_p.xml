<p class="p">The time typology involves not only the selection of appropriate time scales, but also in finding an effective offset where appropriate. In 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, SNR and WSNR have a negative effect on crop yields and a positive effect on crop failure. All drought indices have significantly larger coefficients with actual crop yields and crop failures when lagged by one year compared to the same year. Therefore, I selected the drought index lagged by one year (1980–1998) as the dependent variable to investigate crop-drought vulnerability from 1981–1999.
