<p class="p">Once I take into consideration financial constraints, the Australian main crop and the lagged-one-year effect of the drought on the crops, not only farmers, but also the policy-makers and agricultural scientists come to a better understanding of the impact of climate change on the crops. Scientists have better opportunities to assess crop-drought vulnerability and to make useful suggestions to the government and farmers, who consequently may gain more financial support from the local economy. When policy-makers are aware of the practical issues of farmers and the scientific assessments of researchers, they are in a better position to find solutions to mitigate and adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change on farmers and crops. I can see that cooperation and coordination between farmers, scientists and policy-makers is mutually advantageous. Farmers provide survey data to scientists who can analyze this to obtain useful recommendations, which in turn helps officials design and implement effective policies to reduce the farmsâ€™ loss due to climate change.</p>
