<p class="p">Further, the methodology type also clearly shows the distributions in spatial typologies of vulnerability. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>, the box plots illustrate the distribution of sensitive and resilient regions for wheat, barley and oats in the wheat sheep zones. The longer boxes indicate a higher sensitivity while the shorter boxes indicate more resilience. For instance, wheat is resilient to drought in the North and East Wheat Belt (522), whereas it is sensitive in the Central West area (122). North West Slopes and Plains (121) is one of the most resilient regions while Central West (223) is one of the most sensitive areas for barley. Similarly, the regions of high resilience for oats include North West Slopes and Plains (121), while sensitive regions for oats include Male (221), Central North (223), and Eyre Peninsula (421).
