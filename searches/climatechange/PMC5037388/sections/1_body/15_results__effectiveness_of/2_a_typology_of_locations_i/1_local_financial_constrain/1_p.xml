 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> shows how each region is limited by financial factors, which effectively reflect the suitable criterion to express local heterogeneity. For instance, Mallee (221) is a capital-constrained region, which is also limited by having fewer assets. North West Slopes and Plains (321) are limited by greater agricultural costs while lower farm receipts have a negative influence in Central West (122). Central North (223) is restricted by farm performance and family farm, while greater total debts occur in Central and South Wheat Belt (521).
