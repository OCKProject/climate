<p class="p">In the light of the financial constraints, I can conceptualize seven generic types of crop-drought vulnerability (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Type 1 is constrained by capital in Murray Lands and Yorke Peninsula (422) for resilient wheat, in Mallee (221) and Central North (223) for three sensitive crops. Type 2, the farm asset-constrained vulnerability occurs in similar cases to the capital-constrained vulnerability. Type 3 is the vulnerability for three sensitive crops limited by total receipts in the Central West and Central North (121). The vulnerability limited by farm performance is Type 4 and it occurs for resilient oats in Eastern Darling Downs (321) and for three sensitive crops in Central West (122), Central North (223), and Eastern Darling Downs (321). For Type 5, the distributions of vulnerability constrained by family farm are similar to those of Type 4. The cost-induced vulnerability that is Type 6 occurs for resilient barley and oats in North West Slopes and Plains (121). Debt-induced vulnerability is represented in three resilient crops in some regions such as Darling Downs and Central Highlands in Queensland (322), where debt and interest payments become too onerous to be sustained by agricultural income. These typologies obtained from matching adaptive capacity and vulnerability effectively integrate space, time, crops, farmersâ€™ financial activities and climate change together, which imply the function of adaptive capacity.
