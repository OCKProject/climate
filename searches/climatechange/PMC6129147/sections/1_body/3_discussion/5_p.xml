<p class="p">Defining the bioclimatic space in which a species can persist, and regions of continued suitability within this space, may enhance persistence through periods of climatic stress. Correlative, or mechanistic, niche modeling supports the identification of suitable sites. Many previous studies have focused on the direct effects of climate change on particular species. However, the indirect effects within biological communities and alterations to fundamental natural resources may have substantial, complex and even exponential impact on affected species. Thus, it may be the case that current research has not yet mastered the complexity of interactions between invasive species, hosts and the impact of climate change. Further, an ever increasing human population will itself be subjected to the increasing effects of climate change, and the likelihood that human adaptation responses will impact negatively on biodiversity (
