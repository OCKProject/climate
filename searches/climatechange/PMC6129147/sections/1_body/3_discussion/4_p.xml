<p class="p">Our findings indicated that northern Oman is currently at greater risk of Dubas bug infestation and will remain so for 2050 and 2070. Integrating non-climatic pest management methods might complement climatic parameters in monitoring infestation levels in providing information to develop effective strategies to manage Dubas bug infestations in Oman, thus maintaining yield levels and market competitiveness of dates from Oman. However, strategies for adaptation to climate change require creating a link between a stated expectation on how global warming could affect species, habitats or even people and clear objectives and actions that would best address these projected climate changes (

Conservation effectiveness requires the prioritizing of actions to ensure the continuation of particular species and habitat areas. It is impossible to make conservation interventions for all species and priority decisions should focus on which species to protect. Due to levels of uncertainty and complexity in modeling, altering the prioritizing of certain species before others requires caution (
