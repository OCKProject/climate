<p class="p">Generally, successful pest control, particularly major infestations, depends on the support of agricultural extension services. Extension officers, who should themselves be well-trained, have a responsibility to train farmers, particularly in the dangers of continuous use of chemical insecticides, rather than the safer and more efficient alternative agents of control. Further measures could include teams of plant protection officers, with a principal duty to inspect and assess Dubas bug infestations, as well as forwarding unidentified arthropod pests to identification centers and laboratories for the analysis of fungi.</p>
