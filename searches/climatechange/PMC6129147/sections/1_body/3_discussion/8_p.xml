<p class="p">We should emphasize that assessments of impacts from anthropogenic climate alteration depend on projections from climate models. Uncertainties in those have often been a limiting issue (
 <xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Knutti &amp; Sedláček, 2013</xref>); additionally they have stated that the previous models on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC AR5) are similar to that from those used in IPCC AR4 after accounting for the different underlying scenarios. However, there differences between models and scenarios are obvious and the uncertainties should not stop decisions being made. In our case, we selected four different GCMs under four different RCPs for three different time periods (current, 2050 and 2070) and our results demonstrated that northern Oman is currently at great risk of Dubas bug infestations (highly suitable climatically) and the potential infestation levels will remain high in 2050 and 2070. We note that we also employed all four available RCPs (2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5) at a global scale and the results again confirm that northern Oman, the areas under extensive date palm cultivation, will remain at great risk of this pest (see the supplementary file). Thus other non-climatic integrated pest management methods may be of greater value than climatic parameters for monitoring infestation levels. Additionally, the adaptation of both species (host and pest) with climate change is a possible and valid point but impossible to cover.
