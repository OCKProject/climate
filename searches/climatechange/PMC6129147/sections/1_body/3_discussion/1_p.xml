<p class="p">The historical data analysis showed a significant spatial relation between the infestation occurrence and a few climate factors. However, the results indicated a low correlation coefficient for the relationship, assumed to be due to the use of binary data (presence and absence) in the correlation, which is less powerful than using scale value data (infestation levels). Further, the climate data was estimated using the nearest weather station to the locations, rather than the real climate of the location whereas the tree canopies and variation in intercropping and cultural practices affect the microclimate in each location (

In addition, the author confirmed that temperature variations were associated with variations of infestation and percentage of egg hatching in different locations, seasons and years. A very recent study confirmed the relationship of solar radiation and infestation levels of the Dubas bug (
