<p class="p">Date palm regions such as Iran and specially Oman suffer regular Dubas bug infestations, resulting in substantial losses (

 <xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Blumberg, 2008</xref>). Over the last four decades, the species has become rated as the major date palm pest of Oman, in terms of area and severity of infestation and consequent losses (
 <xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mamoon, Wright &amp; Dobson, 2016</xref>). Direct damage is caused by adults and nymphs feeding on the plant sap and covering the surfaces of leaves with honeydew (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>), leading to indirect damage through the progression of a sooty mold (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>) and a resultant reduction in yield and date quality (
 <xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Howard et al., 2001</xref>). Research shows that direct damage occurs through the sucking of sap from leaflets and rachis during spring and autumn (
 <xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kinaway &amp; Al-Siyabi, 2012</xref>). Indirect damage is exemplified in the deterioration of date palm fruits, including the fruit of trees planted beneath infested palms, due to dust, dry leaflets and rot fungi attracted by the honey dew. Indirect damage is exacerbated by females depositing eggs beneath the surface of the biaxial frond, restricting photosynthesis. 
 <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gassouma (2004)</xref> has documented that a heavy Dubas bug infestation can reduce yield by as much as 50%. A heavy infestation implies thousands of the bugs per frond (
 <xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dowson, 1936</xref>), and generally occurs on mature date palms, probably due to the greater protection afforded by larger trees (
 <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Klein &amp; Venezian, 1985</xref>). Higher humidity levels, denser plant spacing and greater shading promote Dubas population growth, which can persist through dust-storms and lengthy hot, dry periods (
 <xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Howard et al., 2001</xref>). The Dubas population endured mild Mediterranean winters but perished in the severe Israeli winter nights with the freezing temperatures of 1982/1983.
