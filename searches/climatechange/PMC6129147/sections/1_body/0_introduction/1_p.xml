Adult females measure between five and six mm in length, vary from yellowish brown to greenish in color and exhibit pairs of black dots on the base of the frons and pronotum, as well as frequently on the top of the head and the seventh and eighth segments of the abdomen. The wings are clear, with visible blood vessels concentrated at the apex, a distinctive characteristic of the family. Males are slightly smaller than females, with increased proportion of wingspan to body length, a narrower abdomen and absence of abdominal dots (
