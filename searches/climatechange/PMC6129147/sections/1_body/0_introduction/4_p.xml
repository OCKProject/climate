<p class="p">Species distribution models (SDMs) allow the incorporation of climate change scenarios into modeling, thus providing information on potential future species distributions. Such analyses can highlight specific new areas that may in the future be at risk of invasion, as well as identifying the important regions of biodiversity that may be affected. Mapping potential future distributions can inform the strategic planning of biosecurity agencies, prioritizing areas that should be targeted for eradication and determining those areas’ containment tactics would be more cost-effective. Such models are alternatively described as bioclimatic or ecological niche models (
 <xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fitzpatrick et al., 2007</xref>). On this matter, a range of computer-based systems have been developed, designed for the modeling of current or future distributions of the species. Examples of the most common of these systems are CLIMEX (a mechanistic model), HABITAT, maximum entropy (MaxEnt), boosted regression trees (BRT), random forests, generalized linear model (GLM) and BIOCLIM (correlative models). The key component of the ecological niche modeling approaches is estimation or characterization of species’ distributions in ecological space, which can then be useful in understanding their potential distributions in geographic space (
