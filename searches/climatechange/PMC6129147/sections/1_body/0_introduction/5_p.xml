<p class="p">Despite the potential devastation of the Dubas bug, this appears to be the first published study that focuses on projecting the risk levels of colonization. Estimating future distributions of the species under a variety of climate scenarios is of interest for regions cultivating date palm, including Oman. Our study employed four global circulation models (GCMs), (a) HadGEM2, (b) CCSM4, (c) MIROC5 and (d) HadGEM2-AO, under four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) of 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5, for two time periods of 2050 and 2070 using GLM, MaxEnt, BRT. It should be noted that there are 19 (GCMs) in WorldClim database and in this study, we have selected four of them randomly. We believe that climate change may influence the potential future distribution of the Dubas bug and our analysis makes a positive contribution to the optimization of date palm production, management and control of the Dubas bug.</p>
