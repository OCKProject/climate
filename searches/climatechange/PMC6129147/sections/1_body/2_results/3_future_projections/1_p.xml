<p class="p">The future projections obtained from four GCMs, under four RCPs, indicated that northern Oman will remain highly suitable for Dubas bug occurrence and is thus at greater risk. However, all GCMs under all RCPs projected a slight reduction in areas of high suitability class by 2070, compared to 2050. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref> shows the ensemble model outputs (climatic suitability) for the Dubas bug using HadGEM2, CCSM4, MIROC5 and HadGEM2-AO, under RCP of 2.6 for of the years 2050 and 2070; refer to supplementary file for the results of RCP of 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5 under different GCMs.
