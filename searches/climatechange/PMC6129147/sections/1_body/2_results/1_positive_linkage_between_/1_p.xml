<p class="p">Considering all examined climatic variables with the historical pest occurrence records, our result showed that wind speed, minimum temperature and dew points were the three factors that showed significant correlations in OLS model. The GWR determined correlation coefficients were 0.05, 0.10, 0.12, 0.13, 0.11 and 0.05 for the year 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2015 and 2016, respectively (

 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> values are quite low, indicating that even though there is a spatial relationship the strength of this is quite low. Given the large errors that may be associated with various variables used in such analysis it would be prudent to verify these results with other measures of correlation.
