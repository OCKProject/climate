 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). Our analysis revealed an increased percentage of high risk areas between 2007 and 2009, which decreased between 2010 and 2011. These increased again in 2015 and 2016. The results also revealed that hotspots in north-western Oman by 2010 and 2011 were smaller in size than in the rest of the years analyzed, which could be due to unsuitability of climatic and/or non-climatic factors such as removal offshoots, pesticides and fertilization.
