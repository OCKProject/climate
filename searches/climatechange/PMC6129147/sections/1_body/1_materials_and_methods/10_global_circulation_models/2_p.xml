<p class="p">The community climate system model (CCSM) is a coupled climate model used to simulate the climate system of earth. Four individual models are coupled to simulate simultaneously the planet’s atmosphere, oceans, land surfaces and sea-ice, using a single coupling component. The CCSM enables fundamental research into Earth’s past, present and future climate states of CESM1. The code base of CCSM4 has been frozen and future updates will use the code base of CESM1, of which CCSM4 is a subset. Although CESM1 supersedes CCSM4, all CCSM4 experiments may be run using the CESM1 code base (
