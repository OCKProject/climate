<p class="p">In GLM, the iterative weighted linear regression technique was used to arrive at the estimated maximum likelihood of the parameters, with observations distributed in terms of an exponential family and systematic effects made linear by suitable transformation. For GLM, parametric functions were employed to link the variable of response to a combination of linear and quadratic explanatory variables. The GLMs were fitted with a standard polynomial approach together with an automatic stepwise model selection based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC).</p>
