<p class="p">The MaxEnt algorithm compares the interaction of variables on presence and background data to establish the probability distribution approximating uniformity, subject to the limitations of the spatial distributions observed and related environmental factors. This method of minimizing relative entropy between presence and background data optimizes the probability distribution representing MaxEnt (
