<p class="p">Baseline climate was represented by the WorldClim current climate dataset of BIOCLIM variables (
 <uri xlink:href="http://www.worldclim.org" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.worldclim.org</uri>). Here, we used WorldClim data of Version 1.4 with 2.5 min resolution grids. WorldClim is a high-resolution climate average for the period 1961–1990, with global coverage and spanning the time period over which the majority of occurrence records were collected. Possible future climates at global scale incorporate four IPCC5 greenhouse gas concentration (GHC) trajectories, which differ in terms of GHC emission peaks. The main objective of this study was to utilize RCP of 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5 for incorporation into the future climate scenarios in the model projections. Our data has 2.5 min spatial resolutions. To eliminate model complexity and screening explanatory variables, we used the jackknife analysis method and calculated the pairwise Pearson correlation matrix of the variables to select the more important variables showing low correlation (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic> &lt; 0.7). We also checked the importance of variables through the correlation coefficient from Pearson correlation technique and the results were the same as jackknife outputs. Thus, bio7 (temperature annual range (°C)), bio8 (mean temperature of wettest quarter (°C)), bio9 (mean temperature of driest quarter (°C)), bio10 (mean temperature of warmest quarter (°C)), bio11 (mean temperature of coldest quarter (°C)), bio15 (precipitation seasonality) and bio16 (precipitation of wettest quarter (mm)) were selected. We note that in this study, clamping was not used and to address the likelihood that the background data would contain fewer records from localities of more recent colonization and those poorly sampled, we denoted greater importance to records with less geographic proximity. We took into account that without records measuring time expended and survey effort, it is impossible to distinguish between unsuitable and under-sampled areas and that the above-mentioned adjustments would unavoidably combine these two geographical categories. For calculation of the weighting surface, we divided the total of weighted records for each cell of the study area by the weighted number of terrestrial cells of the specific area, using the Gaussian kernel method with standard deviations of ArcGIS default values to eliminate the coastal edge effect. Thereafter, we adjusted the resulting grid to maximum 20 and minimum 1, to exclude extreme values. This weighting method, as advocated by 
 <xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Elith, Kearney &amp; Phillips (2010)</xref>, minimizes the bias toward records from highly sampled areas over those from less sampled areas. Background training data was generated using the kernel density layer and Hawths Tools extension (v3.27) (
