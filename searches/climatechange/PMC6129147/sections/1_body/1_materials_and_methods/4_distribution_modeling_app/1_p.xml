 <xref rid="ref-64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Thuiller et al., 2009</xref>). We used three methods, MaxEnt, GLM and BRT, to form an integrated prediction of the pest preferred habitat with thirty replicates. The main motivation that led to use three different mechanistic models was that each of the models relies to some degree on parameterization against observational data, so they do not entirely avoid the novelty challenge and their predictions are not necessarily superior to empirical models (
