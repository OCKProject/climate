<p class="p">In this research calibration of the models was based on 75% of the occurrence dataset (training data) from 56°30′00″ to 59°00′00″, with the remaining 25% from 56°00′00″ to 56°30′00″ and 59°00′00″ to 59°30′00″ reserved for evaluating the performance of the models. We purposefully selected testing points in those regions (western and eastern Oman) that had geographic outliers. We believe that this gives a better basis for validation of the model compared to selecting test points from regions of high occurrence data.</p>
