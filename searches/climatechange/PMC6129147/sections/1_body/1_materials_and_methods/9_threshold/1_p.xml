<p class="p">There are many methods of thresholds selection, including setting 0.5 as the threshold (default), which is widely used in ecology (
 <xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pearson et al., 2002</xref>), setting a specific level of sensitivity or specificity (e.g., 95%) as desired or deemed acceptable (
 <xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cantor et al., 1999</xref>) and setting thresholds to maximize the correlation between known and projected distributions. A further method identifies a value that maximizes points correctly classified; sensitivity plus specificity values; or Kappa, which incorporates both sensitivity and specificity (
 <xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Guisan, Theurillat &amp; Kienast, 1998</xref>). We chose the commonly used threshold of maximum sensitivity + specificity classifying outputs.
