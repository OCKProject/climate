<p class="p">The data collection area covered 69 villages (300 locations) isolated from each other in the northern governorates of Oman where date palm is cultivated. The total area of Oman is about 310,000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>; however, the data collection area was limited to the northern part of Oman (North 26°00′N, 56°00′E and Far East 22°00′N, 59°00′E) where date palm is cultivated as the main agricultural crop. Distribution data (1,708 occurrences) for the years 2007–2011 and 2015, was obtained from the Ministry of Agriculture of Oman. Our database was extended through field trips in 2016, illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>. Using the annual distribution data and linear Kriging interpolation method, we identified historical changes of hotspots (directions between sample points that reflect annual variations in the surface). A total of 20% of the records were reserved for model validation. The data collection between 2007 and 2011 was carried out by local experts who were working at Ministry of Agriculture of Oman, and then this project was stopped between 2011 and 2015 and then started again. It should be mentioned that the last field trip was undertaken by our group in 2015 and the data is included in this study. We should also highlight that there are some data available for the 2012–2014 period, but their accuracy is questionable and thus we excluded them from our analysis.
