<p class="p">Possible study limitations were the unavailability of data on irrigation methods, plantation spacing, pruning and removal or retention of suckers, insecticides and fertilizers, density of trees and the removal of unproductive palms, making it impossible to assess the impact of non-climatic factors on levels of infestation. The modeling undertaken here uses current presence data and future climate projections to project likely future distributions. However, there are many other factors that affect species distributions. The species may also spread to novel climates or adapt in novel climates; something that is not possible to project using current modeling techniques. This is a limitation of the modeling approach used in this research.</p>
