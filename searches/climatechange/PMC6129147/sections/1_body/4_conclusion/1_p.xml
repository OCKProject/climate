<p class="p">This research has predicted areas conducive to the Dubas bug under future climate scenarios, as well as the impact on northern Oman of the Dubas bug under projected climate changes. The distribution maps based on the modeling provide a valuable tool for the planning of appropriate agricultural production methods of the future. Relevant information on areas projected as suitable for the pest can be obtained from these maps (
