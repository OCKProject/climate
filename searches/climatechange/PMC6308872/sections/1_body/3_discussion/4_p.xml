<p class="p">The limited data on maximum cold‐induced metabolic capacity (M
 <sub class="sub">sum</sub>) provide additional support for a metabolic constraint. We estimate that thermoregulation at the cold range boundary requires a substantial proportion (&gt;50%) of the potential metabolic capacity for thermogenesis of the species. This supports the existence of a metabolic constraint on range boundaries and suggests that species use a substantial portion of their maximum metabolic capacity to thermoregulate. The right skewed distribution (and instances where MR
 <sub class="sub">CRB</sub>/M
 <sub class="sub">sum</sub> &gt; 1) suggests that some species use torpor or hibernation or evade the coldest temperatures through habitat and microclimate selection (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34537-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Because M
 <sub class="sub">sum</sub> is a flexible trait correlated with environmental conditions (Rezende et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>; Swanson, 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>), ratios approaching or exceeding one may also result from M
 <sub class="sub">sum</sub> measurement occurring for populations in warmer climates than those at the cold range boundary. Correlations between M
 <sub class="sub">sum</sub> and environmental temperatures have been previously documented for rodents (Bozinovic et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Rezende et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>) and birds (Stager et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Swanson, 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>).
