<p class="p">We forecast potential range shifts by examining how metabolic constraints will shift through climate change. For example, North American rodent species differ in their metabolic constraints, the extents of their current distribution, and the projected range expansion as a result of climate change (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34537-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> for projections using the HadGEM2‐AO model; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34537-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4</xref> for CCSM4 model projections). The quality of the range projections varies across species (Figures 
 <xref rid="ece34537-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S5–S8</xref>). We predict that most mammals and birds will shift their cold range boundaries poleward through climate changes (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34537-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). We project a similar magnitude of cold range boundary shifts for mammals (mean = 3.77°, median = 2.58°) and birds (mean = 4.20°, median = 3.63°). Numerous species are projected to shift their cold range boundary poleward by 6° latitude (75% quantile), and some species are predicted to shift by as much as 22° (Figure
