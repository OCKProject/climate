<p class="p">Fundamental physiological constraints on metabolic systems, including to the mobilization, transport and use of oxygen and substrates, limit maximum metabolic rate and the factor by which endotherms can elevate their metabolism (Humphries, Umbanhowar, &amp; McCann,

 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1988</xref>) suggested that the cold range boundaries of passerine birds in North America coincided with winter metabolic rates at the cold range boundary being elevated by a factor of 2.5 over basal metabolic rates (BMR), but subsequent analyses (Canterbury,

 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1991</xref>) have questioned the generality of metabolic constraints due to the limited biological, distributional, and environmental data available or poor fit between range boundaries and temperature isotherms.
