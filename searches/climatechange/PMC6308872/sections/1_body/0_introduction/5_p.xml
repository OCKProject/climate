<p class="p">Here we leverage extensive metabolic, distribution, and phylogenetic datasets (Fristoe et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Khaliq, Hof, Prinzinger, Böhning‐Gaese, &amp; Pfenninger, 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) to test the viability of using metabolic constraints to project bird and mammal distributions. Specifically, we estimate the factor by which metabolism is elevated at the cold range boundaries (metabolic expansibility, ME
 <sub class="sub">CRB</sub>). We expect the distribution of ME
 <sub class="sub">CRB </sub>to be normal and strongly peaked if the cold range edges of birds and mammals are limited by the capacity of their metabolic systems to maintain approximate temperature homeostasis. A peaked distribution would indicate similar limits to ME
 <sub class="sub">CRB </sub>across birds and mammals that differ substantially in geographic distribution, habitat, traits, and life history. However, skew in the distribution could reflect either species that are metabolically adapted to or able to evade cold conditions (positive skew) or species that are particularly sensitive to cold (negative skew). Species may evade extreme temperatures by adjusting activity times (e.g., diurnality) or the maintenance of body temperatures (e.g., use of hibernation or torpor) or by selecting favorable microclimates or using behavioral thermoregulation (e.g., communal roosting). Because mammals use strategies to evade full exposure to winter cold (e.g., hibernation, use of subnivean space) to a much greater degree than birds (Ruf &amp; Geiser, 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Swanson, 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Williams, Henry, &amp; Sinclair, 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), we expect that mammals will exhibit more cases with high ME
 <sub class="sub">CRB</sub> values and estimated range boundary metabolic rates approaching or exceeding M
 <sub class="sub">sum</sub> than birds.
