<p class="p">In our full dataset for mammal ME
 <sub class="sub">CRB</sub>, the following proportions of species with data met our BMR quality control criteria: 93.9% [58.6% including NA (not available) values as not meeting quality criteria] were measured during the resting phase, 70.0% (42.9% including NA values) were postabsorptive, and 81.2% were wild‐caught (70.0% including NA values) (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34537-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). Of the quality criteria, only whether the mammal species was live‐trapped or captive was a significant predictor of ME
 <sub class="sub">CRB</sub> (resting phase: 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">[1,82]</sub> = 1.53, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.22; postabsorptive: 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">[1,82]</sub> = 0.04 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.84; wild caught: 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">[1,82]</sub> = 5.15, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). However, restricting the dataset to wild‐caught species does not substantially alter the peak value of metabolic expansibility (peak = 3.27, mean = 4.72, median = 3.75). The trait predictors of ME
 <sub class="sub">CRB</sub> remain similar when considering only wild‐caught individuals (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34537-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>).
