<p class="p">We used the Scholander‐Irving model of homeothermic endothermy to estimate the factor by which metabolism is elevated at the cold range boundaries (as in Root, 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1988</xref>). We recognize that most species deviate from the idealized model, particularly due to widespread and frequent heterothermy and phenotypic plasticity (Fuller et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). However, we hold that the model is the most tractable and general approach to test for metabolic constraints among numerous taxonomically and physiologically diverse species. Further, we test for deviations from the idealized model due to factors such as heterothermy as discussed below. We feel that (in disagreement with some reviewers) the Scholander‐Irving model and the best tractably available data for parameterization are adequate as an initial step toward assessing the occurrence of metabolic constraints. Violations of assumptions of the Scholander‐Irving model should obscure evidence for metabolic constraints, making our test conservative.
