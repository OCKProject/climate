 </sup> found that without compromising the role of reservoirs for flood control and irrigation, hydropower generation can be increased by climate change. Apart from these, the contribution of glaciers to streamflow can play a major role in the projected changes in hydropower of Nathpa Jhakri and Bhakra Nangal reservoirs. Present contribution of glaciers in mean annual streamflow for these reservoirs is relatively lower (~5%)

 </sup>. However, an explicit representation of glaciers and other processes mentioned above with better calibration of the VIC model can improve our understanding of the projected changes in streamflow and hydropower for these two reservoirs. Notwithstanding these limitations, our results provide important insights on the impacts of observed climate variability and projected future climate change on streamflow and hydropower production in India, which can assist planners and policy-makers. However, for future planning, careful consideration of uncertainties in precipitation projections along with robust and comprehensive adaptation strategies are required
