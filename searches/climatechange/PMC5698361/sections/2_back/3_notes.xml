  <title class="title">Ethical Standards</title>
  <p id="Par73" class="p">Ethical approval was obtained from the University of Reading Research Ethics Committee. Local necessary permissions were sought and obtained before the relevant research phases commenced. Informed consent was required of all participants. An accessible project factsheet was produced in Russian and explained as part of the process of negotiating informed consent. Participants’ right to withdraw at any time was emphasised. Ground rules about confidentiality within the group were established with participants. The datasets was fully anonymised. Written outputs and the dissemination strategy ensure participants’ anonymity. Capacity building of all research assistants took place to ensure that they are aware of ethical issues and protocols to be followed.</p>
