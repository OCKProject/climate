<p id="Par36" class="p">The primary water source for Koram’s irrigation system is the Great Almaty Canal [
 <italic class="italic">Bol’shoi Almatinskii Kanal</italic>] (BAK) (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) a large capacity concrete canal that was built in the late-Soviet period to increase irrigated agriculture in the area. The canal is fed from the Bartogai reservoir and is managed by a filial of a state enterprise tasked with agricultural water management under the Ministry of Agriculture, KazVodKhoz. Water from the BAK is distributed via feeder canal to a large earthen primary canal, the MK [
 <italic class="italic">magistral’nyi kanal</italic>] Kuram, under the administration of the local WUA. Dug by hand in the 1940s, the MK Kuram has suffered from decades of non-maintenance (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). A series of sluices connects this to an earthen on-farm channel [“

 <italic class="italic">kanal</italic>
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn4" class="xref">4</xref>], in effect little more than a ditch, and associated network of ditches [
 <italic class="italic">aryki</italic>] by which channels water onto the fields. Primitive water gauges are installed at the sluices connecting the MK Kuram to the on-farm canal (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), and water is distributed to particular fields by opening and blocking ditches with sandbags and boulders. On-farm water distribution is the responsibility of farmers, although it is in practice negotiated in conjunction with the head of the WUA. Disagreements have occasionally arisen and individual farmers have been known to take matters into their own hands to obtain their share of water. A second water supply comes from the Terekti, a mountain stream that irrigates a patch of pastureland west of the village centre and is channeled along a similar system of ditches. Farmers who rely on this water source report no problems with irrigation.
