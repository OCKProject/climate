<p id="Par40" class="p">Water from mountain rivers and the BAK is channelled through a system of earthen primary canals administered by the semi-private production cooperative [
 <italic class="italic">proizvodstvenii kooperativ</italic>] PK “Ili,” and collected into a network of collector ponds (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Water is distributed from these ponds via sluices into a network of earthen on-farm channels and thence to ditches to particular fields (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). As in Koram, these on-farm channels and ditches are the responsibility of local farmers.
