<p id="Par39" class="p">In Karaoi, water for agricultural production is obtained from several sources (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). The Kaskalen and the Ulken Almatinka rivers account for four fifths of water supply. The BAK represents another source. A municipal wastewater treatment plant in Almaty provides water for the production of feed crops and is distributed along a separate 18 km canal. Groundwater is also obtained from (mostly Soviet-era) wells and used for livestock production on non-irrigated farms.
