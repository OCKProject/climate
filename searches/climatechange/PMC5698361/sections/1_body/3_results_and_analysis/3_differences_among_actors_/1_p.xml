<p id="Par49" class="p">In both Koram and Karaoi small and large landholders concurred on some challenges but diverged on others, which revealed their distinct experiences. Further, in both study sites there was a substantial overlap of challenges identified by farmers and state structures. In Koram, small and large landholders and state structures substantially agreed on the three challenges listed above, but placed different emphasis on 
 <italic class="italic">unclear supply rules</italic> (smallholders and state structures), 
 <italic class="italic">untimely supply and high prices</italic> (small and large landholders), 
 <italic class="italic">poor infrastructure and maintenance</italic> (large landholders and state structures), and 
 <italic class="italic">lack of consumption measurement</italic> (state structures) (

 <italic class="italic">inadequate supply</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">poor infrastructure and maintenance</italic>, but differed in emphasising 
 <italic class="italic">supply rules</italic> (smallholders), and 
 <italic class="italic">lack of technology</italic> (large landholders), while state structures also strongly highlighted 
 <italic class="italic">poor infrastructure and maintenance</italic> (
