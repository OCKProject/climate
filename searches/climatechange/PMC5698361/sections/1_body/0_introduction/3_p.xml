<p id="Par4" class="p">Our understanding of the capacity of crop agriculture to adapt to climate change in the southern regions of Kazakhstan is limited by important gaps that result from geographical and methodological biases in the literature. First, with exceptions mostly concerning pastoralism (e.g., Kerven

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2011</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2016</xref>), these areas have been largely neglected in post-Soviet research, resulting in poor understanding of how local biophysical systems are responding to a changing climate. There is insufficient understanding of how farming is socially constructed, what institutions regulate agricultural activities, and how these may be changing concurrently or responding to climate change. Second, research tends to be based on top-down climate, crop-climate, or climate-economic modelling, engaging little with communities on the ground and making limited use of social scientific theories to examine adaptation practices, or lack thereof, in specific places (Lioubimtseva and Henebry

 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2016</xref>). Research has focussed on technological or managerial adaptation measures (drought resistant crop varieties, insurance schemes) (e.g., Heidelbach

 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">2014</xref>) at the expense of cultural or social adaptation practices, which are not only more difficult to model, but also call for critical analysis of the socio-political context, usually a given external factor in climate and economic models (Feola
