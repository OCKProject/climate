   <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">ES</styled-content>) provisioning. Flow indicators are shown in the top row and are (a) timber production vs. harvest level, (b) carbon cycling vs. net ecosystem productivity, and (c) site protection vs. water runoff (please note the inverted 
   <italic class="italic">y</italic>‚Äêaxis), while stock indicators are given in the bottom row and are (d) timber production vs. standing timber volume, (e) carbon cycling vs. total ecosystem carbon stock, and (f) site protection vs. leaf area index. Black lines indicate a regression line, dashed lines are prediction intervals. Colors indicate the mean spruce share of each run, emerging from the dynamic simulations of alternative managements under different climate scenarios. The three distinct clusters shown in panel c are the result of the three climate scenarios studied.
