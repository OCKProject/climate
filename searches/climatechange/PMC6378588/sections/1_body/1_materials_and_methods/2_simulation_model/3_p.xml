<p class="p">Process‐based disturbance modules for wind and bark beetles (specifically 
 <italic class="italic">Ips typographus</italic> L., Coleoptera: Curculionidae), the two most important disturbance agents in Austria (Thom et al. 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), were used to represent the natural disturbance regime in the simulations (Seidl et al. 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014a</xref>, Seidl and Rammer 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Disturbances were simulated dynamically and spatially explicitly, taking into account agent‐specific susceptibilities (such as forest structure and edge effects for wind, and host tree availability and defense for bark beetles) as well as climate conditions (peak wind speeds, temperatures influencing beetle development). Bark beetle population dynamics and spread were simulated explicitly in space and time.
