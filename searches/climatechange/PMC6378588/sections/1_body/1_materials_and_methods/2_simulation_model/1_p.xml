<p class="p">We applied the individual‐based forest landscape and disturbance model iLand (Seidl et al. 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012a</xref>) to investigate the effect of different management strategies and climate change scenarios on the provisioning of ecosystem services. iLand simulates processes across multiple, dynamically interacting hierarchical levels (i.e., individual tree, stand, landscape), capturing interactions between forest vegetation, environmental drivers, disturbances, and forest management. A detailed description of iLand can be found in Seidl et al. (
