<p class="p">Tree growth is modeled based on generalized physiological principles, simulating primary production by means of a light use efficiency approach (Landsberg and Waring 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>). C allocation to tree compartments is based on allometric ratios and dynamically adapts to the abiotic and biotic environment of an individual tree. Compartment‐specific turnover rates are used to calculate the C input into four detrital pools, for which a decomposition module calculates C storage and release from the ecosystem (Seidl et al.
