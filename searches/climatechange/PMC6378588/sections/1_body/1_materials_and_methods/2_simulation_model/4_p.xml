<p class="p">To study management effects on ecosystem services provisioning and stability, we used the agent‐based forest management model ABE (Rammer and Seidl 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), which is fully integrated into the iLand simulation framework. Based on pre‐defined targets (e.g., sustainable harvest levels), constraints for management (e.g., maximum cut‐block sizes), and information about silvicultural systems (e.g., tending and thinning regimes) ABE autonomously schedules and implements forest management operations for each stand of the simulated landscape. Furthermore, ABE dynamically tracks changes in the environment, such as disturbances or changes in tree growth, and adapts forest management accordingly (e.g., by reducing regular harvest rates to buffer the impact of disturbances), in order to ensure that an overall sustainable harvest level is met.
