<p class="p">We focused our analysis on three ecosystem services, which are of high relevance both locally and at the global scale, namely timber production, carbon cycling, and site protection. For each ES, we investigated stock and flow indicators in order to comprehensively assess the level and stability of ES provisioning under changing climate and disturbance regimes. Timber production is currently the main objective of the Austrian Federal Forests in managing the landscape. It is expected to remain highly relevant also in the future, in order to provide society with locally sourced, renewable resources. We chose standing timber volume (m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>/ha) and annual harvest level (m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>·ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>·yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, including both planned harvest and salvage harvest after disturbances) as stock and flow indicators, respectively.
