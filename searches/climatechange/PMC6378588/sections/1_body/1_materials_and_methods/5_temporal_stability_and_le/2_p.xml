<p class="p">The role of forest ecosystems in carbon cycling and the mitigation of climate change through carbon sequestration and storage has received increasing attention in recent years (Fahey et al. 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>, Thom et al. 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017b</xref>). We therefore chose two indicators quantifying forest carbon cycling, Total Ecosystem Carbon (TEC, i.e., the sum of all ecosystem carbon pools simulated in the model, including carbon in stems, branches, foliage, coarse and fine roots, regeneration, snags, downed woody debris, as well as in litter and soil organic matter, in Mg C/ha) and net ecosystem productivity (NEP, i.e., the annual C uptake or release of the forest landscape, in Mg C·ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>·yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). Positive NEP denotes a net uptake of carbon from the atmosphere, and thus a mitigating effect on climate change.
