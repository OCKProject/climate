<p class="p">Site protection against soil erosion from heavy rain events and gravitational forces is of particular importance in our study landscape, given its steep mountainous terrain and shallow soils (Reger et al. 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). As site protection is closely related to the presence of a dense forest cover (Borrelli et al. 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), we chose Leaf Area Index (LAI, in m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) as the state indicator for site protection. Furthermore, since water is a main driver of erosion we used annual water runoff (i.e., the excess water that cannot be stored in the soil or taken up by plants during the year, in mm/yr) as flow indicators of site protection against erosion. A high level of site protection is indicated by high water retention of the ecosystem and thus low runoff values. All indicators were derived directly from the dynamic simulations with iLand.
