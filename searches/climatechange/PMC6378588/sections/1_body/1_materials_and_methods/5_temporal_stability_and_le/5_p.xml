<p class="p">To test for the relationship between ES stability and level of provisioning, a linear regression was calculated across all simulation runs (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 480) individually for each ES indicator. If a significant trade‐off between stability and level of ES provisioning was present, we expected the slope of the regression to be significantly different from zero. The strength of the relationship was assessed using the coefficient of determination (

 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>) of the tree species in the landscape based on basal area shares. This index represents the effective number of tree species present on the landscape and accounts for both species richness and evenness. Subsequently, the Pearson correlation coefficient was used to analyze the relationship between diversity and ES stability. The R Project for Statistical Computing (R Core Team
