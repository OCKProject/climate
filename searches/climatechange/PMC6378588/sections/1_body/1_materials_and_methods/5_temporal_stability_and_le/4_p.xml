<p class="p">To address our first hypothesis of a negative relationship between temporal stability and long‐term level of ES provisioning, these two dimensions were calculated for each indicator and each individual simulation run. Here, it is important to note that both the level of ES provisioning and its temporal stability are emergent properties of our process‐based simulations at the level of individual trees, reflecting the complex interplay between climate (change), soil, management, and natural disturbance. Level of ES provisioning was expressed as the median value over the 200‐yr simulation period. Temporal stability was calculated as one divided by the 5th to 95th percentile range of annual ES estimates over the entire simulation period (Fig.
