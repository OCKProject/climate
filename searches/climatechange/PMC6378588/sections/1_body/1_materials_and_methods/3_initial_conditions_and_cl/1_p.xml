<p class="p">We used current management plans as well as forest inventory data and airborne laser scanning (≤1 m horizontal resolution) to determine stand (e.g., growing stock, species shares, horizontal structure) and tree characteristics (e.g., diameter at breast height, tree height) of the current vegetation. Soil and climate data were considered at 100 × 100 m horizontal resolution in the simulation. Soil‐related input for the simulation (effective soil depth, sand, silt, and clay content, plant‐available nitrogen, and initial soil carbon stock) were derived from the site classification system of the Austrian Federal Forests (Weinfurter
