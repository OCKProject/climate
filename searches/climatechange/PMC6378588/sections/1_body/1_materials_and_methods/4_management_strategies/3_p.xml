<p class="p">All strategies were implemented in the simulations at the level of stands (average stand size 3.4 ha, with a total of 1,678 stands on the landscape) using stand treatment programs (stp), which prescribe target species shares and silvicultural treatments taking into account site conditions and the elevation of each stand (see Appendix

 <xref rid="eap1785-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1.4</xref> for details). This resulted in a considerable within‐landscape variation in management even within a management strategy (cf. Fig. S26). The scheduling of treatments in the simulation was dynamically done by ABE. In accordance with the Austrian forest act (Anonymous 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) disturbed areas were salvage harvested in all management strategies in order to mitigate the spread of bark beetles into neighboring stands. In total, 24 unique combinations of management strategies (four) and climate scenarios (six) were simulated, all starting from current forest conditions. In order to account for the stochasticity in the simulations (e.g., with regard to the initial location of outbreak spots of bark beetle disturbances), we simulated 20 replicates of each combination of climate scenario and management strategy (see Appendix

 <xref rid="eap1785-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4</xref> for an analysis of variance among replicates), resulting in a total of 480 model runs. Each simulation was run for 200 yr.
