<p class="p">We investigated four alternative management strategies covering a broad range of potential future silvicultural pathways (Table 
 <xref rid="eap1785-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Two strategies were derived from a stakeholder process involving both the current managers of the landscape (Austrian Federal Forests, BAU strategy) and the local forest authorities tasked with supervising forest management in the area (Forest Service Upper Austria, AM1 strategy). The BAU strategy represents current business as usual management, featuring a strong emphasis on the tree species Norway spruce and European larch (
 <italic class="italic">Larix decidua</italic> L.), with European beech as admixed species. Rotation periods were between 120 and 140 yr (increasing with elevation), and one to two thinning interventions were conducted in the first half of the rotation period. In contrast, the AM1 strategy also includes silver fir and Scots pine (
 <italic class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</italic> L.) as important target tree species. Rotation ages were reduced to 120 yr also in higher elevation stands, and two thinnings were conducted in all stands. The AM1 strategy thus reflects the frequent recommendation to shorten rotation periods and increase thinning frequency in order to adapt forest management to climate change (Seidl et al.
