<p class="p">In addition to these two strategies developed with stakeholders, two bracketing management strategies were designed (HIST and AM2), representing contrasting alternative management options. The HIST strategy is based on historical maximum yield management and has Norway spruce as its sole target tree species. While spruce was the only species that was actively planted and favored in thinnings, we also allowed other species to regenerate naturally under the HIST strategy. Rotation periods and thinning regimes were the same as for the BAU strategy. At the other end of the spectrum, the AM2 strategy represents an active adaptation of the tree species composition to future climatic conditions, based on the future potential natural vegetation. In order to obtain a quantitative estimate of the latter, we ran unmanaged iLand simulations from bare ground for 1,500 yr under the climate change conditions projected for the period 2080–2099. The thus derived target tree species composition of the AM2 strategy consisted of a diverse set of tree species, including species promoted in other strategies (spruce, fir, beech, pine), but also warm‐adapted native tree species such as oaks (
