<p class="p">The study landscape Weissenbachtal is located in the northern front range of the Austrian Alps (47.78° N, 13.59° E), covering an area of approximately 8,100 ha in total, 5,716 ha of which are forested. The range of elevation extends from 500 to 1400 m above sea level. Climate is strongly modulated by the topographic gradients within the landscape, with temperature decreasing with elevation (from 9.6° to 5.5°C across the elevational gradient with a landscape average of 7.5°C) and precipitation increasing with elevation (precipitation range 1,207–2,071 mm with a landscape average of 1,503 mm of annual precipitation). The substrate is calcareous with predominately shallow Chromic Cambisols and Rendzic Leptosols (Matthews et al. 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). The area is under the stewardship of the Austrian Federal Forests, who currently manage the landscape with a focus on timber production and site protection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="eap1785-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The potential natural vegetation consists of Norway spruce (

 <italic class="italic">Abies alba</italic> Mill.), with beech dominance decreasing and spruce dominance increasing with elevation (Kilian et al. 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1994</xref>). The current vegetation is characterized by a strong dominance of spruce (Fig. 
 <xref rid="eap1785-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), which is the result of past management focused on fuel wood production for a nearby salt mine.
