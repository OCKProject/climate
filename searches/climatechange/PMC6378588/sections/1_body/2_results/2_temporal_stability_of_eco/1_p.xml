<p class="p">Climate variation and disturbance legacies had a distinct influence on the temporal stability of ES provisioning of the landscape. Climate variation introduced high frequency temporal fluctuation and particularly affected flow variables. Both C uptake and water runoff strongly depended on the climate condition of a given year, and thus showed high interannual variation (Appendix

The legacies of past disturbances, on the other hand, mainly influenced stock variables, and introduced low frequency, multi‐decadal fluctuations into service provisioning trajectories. Here, particularly the uneven forest age distribution and stocking density of our landscape at the beginning of the study period are noteworthy (Appendix

The initial share of large areas of relatively young forests (which are legacies of recent disturbances by wind and bark beetles) resulted in peaks of timber and C stocks as well as LAI in the middle of the 200 yr simulation period, with LAI peaking before timber volume and C stocks (Appendix

 <xref rid="eap1785-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S25, S23, S24</xref>). Temporal stability of ES provisioning is thus a combined effect of fast (climate variability) and slow (stand development) drivers.
