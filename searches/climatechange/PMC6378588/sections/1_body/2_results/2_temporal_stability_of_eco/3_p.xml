<p class="p">For all ecosystem services, we found a negative relationship between temporal stability and long‐term level of ES provisioning across all studied management strategies and climate scenarios (Fig. 
 <xref rid="eap1785-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Generally, the relationships were more strongly negative for stock indicators than for flow indicators. However, the strength of the trade‐off varied strongly between ecosystem services and individual indicators. The observation period also influenced the strength of the relationship between stability and level of ES provisioning (Appendix

 <xref rid="eap1785-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S5</xref>). For timber production, both flow and stock indicators showed a clear negative relationship between the ES stability and ES level (

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) decreased the temporal stability of timber harvest by 10.2%. The effect was even stronger for timber stocks, where a 5% increase relative to the median corresponded to a reduction of 11.8% in stability. Overall, the spruce‐oriented HIST and BAU strategies had a higher level of provisioning but lower stability for both indicators of timber production, compared to the broadleaf‐oriented management strategies.
