<p class="p">Temporal stability of ES provisioning was distinctly affected by forest management. For timber production, the temporal variation of both indicators was lower in the tree‐species‐rich strategies AM1 and AM2 compared to spruce‐dominated strategies, indicating higher stability of the adaptive management strategies (Table 
 <xref rid="eap1785-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). The considerably lower disturbance susceptibility of these strategies (Appendix

 <xref rid="eap1785-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S18</xref>) is an important factor contributing to their higher temporal stability. Similarly, AM2 had the highest temporal stability in C uptake, and AM1 in C storage. With regard to site protection, BAU and AM1 were temporally most stable. Water runoff performed best under BAU management.
