<p class="p">For site protection, stability and level of ES provisioning were also negatively related, with stronger effects for the stock compared to the flow indicator. Water runoff (Fig.

The influence of the three climate scenarios with their diverging precipitation levels was pronounced, separating the simulation results into three distinct groups. The climate scenario with the highest variability in precipitation (ARPEGE, see Appendix
