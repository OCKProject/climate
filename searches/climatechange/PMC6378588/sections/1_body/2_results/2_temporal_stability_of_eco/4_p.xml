<p class="p">Temporal stability was also negatively related to long‐term provisioning for indicators of C cycling. Total ecosystem carbon stock (Fig. 
 <xref rid="eap1785-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>e) showed a strong negative relationship between ES provisioning and stability (

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.674), with a 5% increase in C stocks resulting in a 17.9% reduction in temporal stability. For C uptake, on the other hand, the relationship between temporal stability and ES provisioning was weak and not statistically significant (
