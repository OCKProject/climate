<p class="p">The level of ecosystem service provisioning varied substantially between management strategies. The spruce‐oriented HIST strategy produced the highest amount of timber. This finding was consistent for both the flow indicator (harvest level) as well as the stock indicator (standing timber volume) used to characterize timber production (Table 
 <xref rid="eap1785-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). The BAU strategy maintained similar timber stocks as HIST, but had lower harvest levels. The more broadleaf‐oriented strategies AM1 and AM2 had lower timber stocks and harvest levels over the 200 yr simulation period compared to the spruce‐oriented management strategies BAU and HIST. The broadleaf‐oriented strategies were, however, also considerably less affected by disturbances from wind and bark beetles (Appendix

 <xref rid="eap1785-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S19</xref>) was considerably lower in AM1 (11.4%) and AM2 (9.1%) compared to HIST and BAU (28.1% and 22.0%, respectively).
