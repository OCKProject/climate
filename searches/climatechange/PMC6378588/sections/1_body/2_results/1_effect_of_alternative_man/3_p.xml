<p class="p">The provisioning of site protection against soil erosion was particularly sensitive to the underlying climate scenario. Given that the absolute level of annual precipitation in our study region strongly exceeds the potential evapotranspiration of a fully stocked forest landscape, the amount of water runoff was mainly driven by scenario‐specific differences in precipitation level, with only small effects of management. Runoff was only slightly lower (i.e., indicating better performance regarding site protection) under the spruce‐dominated strategies BAU and HIST compared to the broadleaf‐oriented strategies AM1 and AM2. The second indicator investigated as a proxy for site protection, LAI, showed no functionally relevant differences between strategies (differences of between 0.17 and 0.02 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>). Considering both indicators, the level of site protection was not affected by management.
