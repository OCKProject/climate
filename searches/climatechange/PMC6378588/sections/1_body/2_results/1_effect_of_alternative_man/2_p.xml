<p class="p">The effects of management on carbon cycling were largely congruent with those found for timber production. HIST and BAU had the highest level of total ecosystem carbon (TEC) storage. Under the AM1 strategy, TEC was between 9.3 and 7.4 Mg C/ha lower than under HIST and BAU and 2.3 Mg C/ha lower than under AM2. C uptake (i.e., net ecosystem productivity) was highest under HIST. NEP under BAU management was considerably lower (−0.077 Mg C·ha
