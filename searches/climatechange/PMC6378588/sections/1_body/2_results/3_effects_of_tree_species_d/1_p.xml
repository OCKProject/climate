<p class="p">Tree species diversity was positively related to temporal stability for all investigated stock indicators (i.e., standing timber volume, total ecosystem C stock, and LAI). The positive effect of tree species diversity on stability was strongest for timber production, with the stability of both investigated indicators increasing with tree species diversity (Table 
 <xref rid="eap1785-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). Also, C stocks were positively related to tree species diversity, while no significant relationship was found for C uptake. For site protection, the diversity–stability relationship showed diverging results for the two indicators investigated: while the temporal stability of LAI increased with tree species diversity, runoff was negatively related to diversity. This is mainly an effect of the different life history traits of the species‐poor (evergreen‐dominated) and species‐rich (deciduous‐dominated) forest types addressed in our study, with the latter having shorter vegetation periods and providing a lower level of site protection during the months of leaf‐off.
