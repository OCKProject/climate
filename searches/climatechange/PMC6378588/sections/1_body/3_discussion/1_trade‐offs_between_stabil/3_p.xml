<p class="p">Any findings on ES stability are necessarily contingent on the definition of stability used (Grimm and Wissel 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>). Here, we focused on temporal stability and defined it as the inverse of temporal variability. The advantages of such an aggregate measure of stability are its ease of derivation and considerable information content, as shown in our analysis here. However, whether low stability is the result of short time periods with low ES provisioning, or whether larger‐scale trends in ES trajectories exist remains undetected in such an approach. Alternative approaches could thus consider minimally required thresholds for service provisioning for defining stability, an approach frequently used also when considering ES multifunctionality (Pasari et al. 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>, Ratcliffe et al. 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Furthermore, it is important to note that other types of stability besides temporal stability are relevant in the context of managing for ES. Scenario uncertainty (i.e., the variability of ES under different climate scenarios, e.g., Silva Pedro et al. 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) or the uncertainty with regard to societal preferences for ES (i.e., changes in societally demanded ES, e.g., Seidl and Lexer 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) are two examples for other types of stability that are also relevant in the context of ecosystem management.
