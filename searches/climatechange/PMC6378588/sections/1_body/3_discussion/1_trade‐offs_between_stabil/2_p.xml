<p class="p">Natural disturbances (here wind and bark beetle outbreaks) reduced both the level of ES provisioning as well as its temporal stability. This is in line with a wide range of studies reporting a negative impact of disturbances on ecosystem services (see Thom and Seidl 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). However, our analysis also revealed considerable complexity in the assessment of disturbance effects on ecosystem service provisioning. While disturbances reduce in situ C storage in the years following an event (Lindroth et al. 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>, Matthews et al. 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), they can, at the same time, foster C uptake over longer time frames through high growth rates in forests recovering from disturbance (Yue et al. 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0086" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). This underlines the importance of considering both stock and flow indicators and their dynamics over extended time frames in order to comprehensively capture changes in ecosystem services. Similarly, when assuming that disturbed timber is salvaged (as done here), the effect of disturbances on timber production is ambiguous, as they increase the volume of timber harvested, ostensibly increasing the level of ES provisioning. However, such an increase is not necessarily desired in the context of forest management, as salvaging disturbed timber is associated with high harvesting costs, reduced timber quality, and potentially detrimental effects on biodiversity (Prestemon and Holmes
