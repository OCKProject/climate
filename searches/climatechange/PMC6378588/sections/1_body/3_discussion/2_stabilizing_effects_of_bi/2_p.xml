<p class="p">A factor that complicates the analysis of diversity–stability relationships are the dynamic interactions and feedbacks inherent in forest ecosystems. Natural disturbances, for instance, are a threat to the temporal stability of ecosystem service provisioning, but at the same time foster diversity (Peltzer et al.

In our study system, for example, bark beetle disturbances are targeting a single host tree species, Norway spruce, and foster the establishment of a variety of other tree species through natural regeneration in the resulting gaps. A simulation run with high disturbance activity will thus have less stable provisioning of ecosystem services, while at the same time tree species diversity is higher than in a scenario with low disturbance activity. This paradox role of disturbances in negatively impacting ecosystem services while simultaneously exerting positive impacts on biodiversity has been reported previously (Thom and Seidl 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), and needs further attention in the strive toward an improved process‐understanding of the roles of biodiversity in ecosystem service provisioning (Isbell et al.
