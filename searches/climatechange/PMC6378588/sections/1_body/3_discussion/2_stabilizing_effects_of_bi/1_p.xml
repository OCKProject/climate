<p class="p">We hypothesized a stabilizing effect of high tree diversity on the temporal variation of ecosystem services. This hypothesis is in line with previous findings (Isbell et al.

 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>, Morin et al.

 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), and follows the “insurance hypothesis”, which states that a higher number of species will stabilize ecosystem functioning as a result of increased response diversity and functional redundancy (Yachi and Loreau 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0085" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>). We found general support for this hypothesis, but also showed that such a positive relationship is not universally valid for all ES. The stability of the six ES indicators showed a range of different behaviors in relation to tree species diversity (Table 
 <xref rid="eap1785-tbl-0004" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). The insurance hypothesis could be generally confirmed for timber production and carbon cycling (see also Silva Pedro et al. 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). With regard to site protection, we found both positive and negative relationships between diversity and ES stability, depending on the indicator analyzed. This underlines the importance of context when assessing the effects of biodiversity (Ratcliffe et al. 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>, Paquette et al. 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). It furthermore highlights that a coarse filter approach to increasing ES stability by fostering diversity might not always be successful, requiring more process‐oriented analyses focusing on the ES of local interest.
