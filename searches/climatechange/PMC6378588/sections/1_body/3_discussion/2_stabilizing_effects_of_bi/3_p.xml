<p class="p">A limitation of our analysis in the context of considering the effects of natural disturbances is the focus on two disturbance agents, wind and

 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), other agents could increase in importance as climate and tree species composition change in the future. Of particular concern in this context are invasive alien tree pests, which have the potential to strongly alter forest ecosystems and the services they provide (Liebhold et al.

 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018b</xref>). Future studies focusing on the temporal stability of ES provisioning in forests should thus not only focus on the effects of climate change and natural disturbance agents, but also consider the effects of invasive alien pests explicitly (Pautasso et al.
