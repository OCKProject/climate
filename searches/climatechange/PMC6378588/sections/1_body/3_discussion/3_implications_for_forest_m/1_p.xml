<p class="p">In the face of an increasingly uncertain future, forest management needs approaches that robustly provide ecosystem services under a wide range of possible climate and disturbance regimes (Millar et al. 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>, Daniel et al. 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Our results show that increasing stability may come at the expense of a reduced level of ES provisioning. In other words, achieving a temporally stable 
 <italic class="italic">and</italic> maximum ES supply will often not be simultaneously possible in ecosystem management. It is thus important that studies optimizing ES supply (Diaz‐Balteiro et al.

 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) increasingly account not only for the level of ES provisioning but also for its temporal stability (for example by introducing minimum levels of ES provisioning required, cf. Härtl et al. 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). In the context of our study landscape, we found that management strategies fostering a diverse, future‐adapted portfolio of tree species in combination with silvicultural measures reducing risks (such as shortening rotations periods and increasing thinning frequency) resulted in a more stable provisioning of the majority of the ecosystem services considered (see also Temperli et al. 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). However, considering both the stability and level of ES provisioning, we did not find a clear best practice management strategy, which could provide both a high level of service provisioning and a temporally stable trajectory of ES. In the context of operational decision making managers will thus have to identify a locally appropriate mix between level and stability of ES, based on the social‐ecological context and their personal level of risk aversion (Blennow et al.
