<p class="p">Our results indicate that a higher level of ES supply can be achieved by management strategies taking higher risks. Yet it is important to note that we did not explicitly consider the fact that stability is of varying importance in the management of different ES, and that hierarchical dependencies may exist. In the context of the services considered here, for instance, stability is more important for site protection than for carbon cycling or timber production. Already, a relatively short exposure to open canopy conditions can lead to a significant loss of soil (Morris and Moses

 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), which in turn would have strong negative effects on timber production and carbon cycling through reduced site productivity. In many cases, stability might thus be more important than the level of ES provisioning for maintaining the capacity of ecosystems over long time frames. Our finding of significant trade‐offs between stability and level of ES provisioning thus suggests that previous studies focusing solely on the latter might overestimate the ES supply that is realistically achievable from ecosystems. We thus suggest that considerations of stability should be included more explicitly in future assessments of ecosystem service supply.
