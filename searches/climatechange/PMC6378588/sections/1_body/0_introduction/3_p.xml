<p class="p">Forest management has a long tradition of dealing with uncertainty, which emanates from the extensive time horizons inherent in forestry (von Detten and Hanewinkel

Furthermore, a focus on maximizing a single ecosystem service (usually timber production) greatly simplified traditional forest management planning. Today, it is of increasing importance to take the uncertainties introduced by changes in climate and disturbance regimes into account in order to safeguard ES supply, as well as to consider a range of multiple ecosystem services simultaneously (Millar et al.
