<p class="p">Accounting for potential future changes in forest ecosystem services is challenging due to the multiple simultaneous effects that forests have on human wellbeing. One example is the question of how forests can best contribute to climate regulation and the mitigation of climate change. On the one hand, enhancing carbon (C) sequestration and storage in forests via increasing forest area and standing volume mitigates anthropogenic climate change (Canadell and Raupach

 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0082" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). On the other hand, increasing the use of renewable resources and substituting fossil resources has benefits for the climate system, but requires increased harvesting of forest biomass (Lundmark et al.

When assessing the effect of future forest development trajectories on ecosystem services, it is thus important to consider changes in both state variables (stocks) and exchange rates of the ecosystem with its surrounding (flows).
