<p class="p">Given the uncertainties regarding future environmental conditions, a key challenge for forest management is to foster forest development trajectories that ensure high levels of ES provisioning under a wide variety of future conditions. Planning considerations usually extend over one or several rotation periods (i.e., several decades to centuries) and thus address the long‐term provisioning of ES. However, for many ecosystem services, temporal continuity is equally important as the level of provisioning over an extensive planning period. For instance, the protection of soil from erosion has to be maintained constantly, as a single heavy rain event affecting temporally unstocked soil can result in substantial soil losses that can only be recovered over centuries to millennia (Shakesby et al.

Natural disturbances are a major concern in this regard, as they can distinctly change a forest's ability to provide ES within a short period of time (hours to a few years). Consequently, addressing disturbances is a key issue in ecosystem management for services where temporal stability is of high importance (Dorren et al.
