<p class="p">To further elucidate ES stability, we subsequently investigated the role of biodiversity in stabilizing ecosystem services provisioning. A strong focus of previous ES research has been on quantifying the influence of biodiversity on ES provisioning. This research has shown that biodiversity can contribute to ecological stability, and therefore to the stability of ES provisioning, for example, by buffering impacts of climate change and disturbance on ecosystem functioning (Tilman et al.

 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Consequently, we tested the hypothesis of a generally positive impact of biodiversity on temporal ES stability, and asked whether the effect of biodiversity on stability is similar for a range of ecosystem services.
