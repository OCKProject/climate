<p class="p">Here, we used landscape‐scale simulation modeling to investigate the relationship between temporal stability and level of ecosystem service provisioning over a wide range of possible future forest trajectories. Specifically, we studied ES stability‐level relationships for three ecosystem services (timber production, carbon cycling, and site protection) under four alternative management strategies and six future climate and disturbance scenarios over a time frame of 200 yr. Based on previous research, we expected management approaches that supply high levels of certain ecosystem services (e.g., high timber production in monocultures of productive conifers) to be less stable under future environmental conditions (Temperli et al.

 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). We thus hypothesized that a significant trade‐off between the stability and provisioning of ecosystem services exists, and that an increased level of ES provisioning simultaneously results in lower stability of ES provisioning. A key aim of this contribution was to test for and quantify this trade‐off for a wide range of different ES.
