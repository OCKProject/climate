<p class="p">The temporal stability of ES provisioning is therefore an important area of research. In the context of a comprehensive consideration of uncertainties in ecosystem service assessments (Runting et al. 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), it is of interest whether management strategies can be developed that simultaneously achieve high stability and a high level of ecosystem services provisioning. While many recent studies have investigated the role of forest management in providing multiple ecosystem services under climate change, as well as dealing with trade‐offs between individual services (Temperli et al. 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>, Creutzburg et al. 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>, Irauschek et al.

 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), the question of whether stability of ecosystem service provisioning comes at the expense of the level of service provisioning has, to our knowledge, not yet been investigated.
