<p class="p">Ongoing changes in climate and disturbance regimes raise concerns regarding the future ability of forests to provide ES to society. Many projections for the coming decades and centuries suggest negative impacts on the provisioning of ecosystem services (Breshears et al.

 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Consequently, these changes introduce considerable uncertainty into the management for ecosystem services (MEA 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). Forests, characterized by long‐lived trees with a large ecological amplitude, respond only slowly to transient changes in the climate system (Thom et al. 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017a</xref>), a fact that can contribute to the stability of forest ecosystem services provisioning in the short term. However, processes such as disturbance (i.e., large pulses of tree mortality from agents such as storms and insect outbreaks) can also rapidly change forest ecosystems (Lucier et al. 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>), with immediate and severe consequences for ecosystem services (Breshears et al. 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Forest disturbances are expected to increase under climate change (Schelhaas et al. 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>, Seidl et al. 
 <xref rid="eap1785-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), and have predominately negative impacts on the provisioning of ecosystem services (Thom and Seidl
