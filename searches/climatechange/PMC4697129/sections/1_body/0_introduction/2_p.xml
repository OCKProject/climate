 </xref> Further, the COP acknowledged that because the development challenges for LDCs are magnified by climate change, adaptation planning should move from primarily focusing on current climate variability and recent climate change to focusing more broadly on increasing resilience within the context of sustainable development planning. The COP established the NAP process to facilitate effective and efficient adaptation planning in developing countries. The UNFCCC Least Developed Country Expert Group (LEG) was mandated to develop technical guidelines to support the NAP process.
