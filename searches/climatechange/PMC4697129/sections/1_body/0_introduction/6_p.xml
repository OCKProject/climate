<p class="p">The health component of a NAP (H-NAP) follows the principles stated in the NAP guidance:
 <list list-type="simple" class="list">
  <list-item id="u0040" class="list-item">
   <label class="label">•</label>
   <p class="p">Ensure that the NAP is a country-driven process owned by the respective countries.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="u0045" class="list-item">
   <label class="label">•</label>
   <p class="p">Ensure that health adaptation planning is based on the best available evidence. Any adaptation plan should aim to strengthen the development and availability of evidence, build the data and reduce knowledge gaps, and inform relevant policies.</p>

  <list-item id="u0050" class="list-item">
   <label class="label">•</label>
   <p class="p">Build on existing national efforts on health adaptation to climate change, including assessments, and development and implementation of policies and programs at local to national levels.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="u0055" class="list-item">
   <label class="label">•</label>
   <p class="p">Integrate health adaptation to climate change into national health planning strategies, processes, and monitoring systems.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="u0060" class="list-item">
   <label class="label">•</label>
   <p class="p">Provide for a flexible and context-specific approach to health adaptation to climate change. National circumstances and available information and experience on health and climate variability and change will determine the scope, institutional arrangements, and resources required for proper implementation of the health component of the NAP.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="u0065" class="list-item">
   <label class="label">•</label>
   <p class="p">Maximize synergies across sectors, mainly across those that determine health, such as the food, water, energy, and housing sectors. This calls for developing relevant health indicators within the adaptation monitoring systems in these sectors, ensuring that health considerations are integrated into adaptation planning to avoid maladaptation.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="u0070" class="list-item">
   <label class="label">•</label>
   <p class="p">Ensure that the health adaption plan feeds into and coordinates with the overall national adaptation process.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="u0075" class="list-item">
   <label class="label">•</label>
   <p class="p">Pilot approaches that promote an iterative process for health adaptation to climate variability and change, producing plans over specified time horizons.</p>

  <list-item id="u0080" class="list-item">
   <label class="label">•</label>
   <p class="p">Promote intercountry collaboration across agencies and stakeholders and harmonize adaptation approaches at subregional levels.</p>
