<p class="p">Adaptation has been a critical component of the international negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) from the beginning. When signing the convention, all countries agreed to produce regular national communications covering their emissions inventory, current impacts and projected risks of climate change, adaptation options to prepare for and reduce those risks, and mitigation options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a green economy. The least developed countries (LDCs) also developed National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) to identify their urgent and immediate adaptation needs. Building on the experience gained through the NAPA process, including implementation of adaptation options to address urgent national needs, National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) are under development by LDCs and other developing countries to identify and address medium and long-term adaptation needs.</p>
