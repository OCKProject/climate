<p class="p">There also are key research gaps that need to be filled, particularly in low-income countries.

  <sup class="sup">4</sup>
 </xref> National governments and international research funders can help fill those gaps, supporting analysis of existing data sets, including projecting how health risks could change under different possible futures, and supporting the collection of additional longitudinal data where gaps exist. This research should include an explicit focus on upstream drivers of climate-sensitive health risks. This critical research's limited funding constrains the design and implementation of effective and efficient adaptation options. More methods and tools are coming online, such as early warning systems that can effectively increase resilience to some negative health outcomes. Additional efforts are required to increase their uptake and effective use.
