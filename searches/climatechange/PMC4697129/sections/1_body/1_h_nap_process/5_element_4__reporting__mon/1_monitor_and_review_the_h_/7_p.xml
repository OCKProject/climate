<p class="p">WHO is developing summary climate change and health country profiles to provide a baseline for monitoring future progress. The profiles will include information on current weather and climate hazards and health impacts; current burdens of climate-sensitive health outcomes; future exposures and health risks under different climate change scenarios; opportunities for health gains through climate change mitigation and adaptation; and policy information related to health and climate change.</p>
