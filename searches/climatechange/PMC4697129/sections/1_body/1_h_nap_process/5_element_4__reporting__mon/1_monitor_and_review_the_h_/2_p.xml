<p class="p">Indicators for monitoring, evaluation, and learning can include the following:
 <list list-type="simple" class="list">
  <list-item id="u0140" class="list-item">
   <label class="label">•</label>
   <p class="p">The number and geographic distribution of cases and deaths (and trends over time) in climate-sensitive health outcomes. Health outcome data should be at least disaggregated by age and gender to identify high-risk population subgroups and to facilitate design of tailored interventions. Other variables to consider when developing indicators depend on the health outcome of interest; for example, socioeconomic variables where income distribution is important or the prevalence of chronic diseases.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="u0145" class="list-item">
   <label class="label">•</label>
   <p class="p">Trends in factors that increase or decrease vulnerability and exposure to the hazards associated with changing weather patterns and sea level rise, such as urbanization, access to improved water sources, and social capital.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="u0150" class="list-item">
   <label class="label">•</label>
   <p class="p">Weather and climate variables, such as average and extreme temperature and precipitation, trends in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather and climate events, and sea level rise. Other environmental variables also may be useful, such as measures of soil moisture or stream flow.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="u0155" class="list-item">
   <label class="label">•</label>
   <p class="p">The effectiveness of adaptation policies and programs, such as whether a particular option decreased the number of people at risk during a flood or increased the capacity of health care professionals to use weather and climate variables to forecast health risks.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="u0160" class="list-item">
   <label class="label">•</label>
   <p class="p">The process of adaptation, including tracking the progress on identifying and scaling out lessons learned and best practices.</p>
