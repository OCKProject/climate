<p class="p">As a part of the international CALM program (Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring described in Brown et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2000</xref>), summer thaw depth of the active layer in moist acidic tundra at Toolik was measured using steel probes at 96 individual sites within a 200 × 900 m grid. At each site, three measurements were averaged, and a grand average of all sites was calculated for each of two dates in summers from 1990 to 2011. Additional information on thawing the soil came for measures of alkalinity in Toolik Lake. Alkalinity was determined by potentiometric titration (Kling et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">1992</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">2000</xref>) and was averaged across depth and season to provide an annual estimate. Keller et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2010</xref>) measured strontium isotope ratios (
 <sup class="sup">87</sup>Sr/
 <sup class="sup">86</sup>Sr), which decrease with depth in soils at the Arctic LTER, to estimate the increasing depth of water flow within the soil.
