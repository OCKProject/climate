<p class="p">Guay et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2014</xref>) analyzed satellite data to determine annual dynamics of normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI), a measure of plant productivity, which is also highly correlated with aboveground biomass in arctic systems (Boelman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2003</xref>; Raynolds et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2012</xref>). The NDVI data were derived from the GIMMS-AVHRR times series, version 3 g (Pinzón and Tucker 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">2014</xref>), with a 0.07
 <sup class="sup">o</sup> (8 km) spatial resolution. We analyzed the GIMMS-3 g dataset across the years 1982–2014 for a 40-km (20 km radius) area surrounding the Toolik Field Station. Seasonal periods of NDVI trends through time were consistent with the seasonal periods used to assess trends in air temperature (see legend for Fig.
