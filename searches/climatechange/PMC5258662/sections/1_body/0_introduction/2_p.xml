<p class="p">One solution to the variability problem is to carry out long-term studies. These studies are expensive to carry out in the Arctic with the result that many detailed studies have been relatively short-term (e.g., the IBP Arctic projects in the U.S. and Canada), or have been long-term projects limited in scope (e.g., the Sub-Arctic Stordalen project in Abisko, Sweden; Jonasson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">2012</xref>). Currently, there are but two projects underway that are both long-term and broad in scope: Toolik in the Low Arctic of northern Alaska and Zackenberg in the High Arctic of northeast Greenland (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Here we use data from these sites to ask which types of measures actually yield statistically significant trends of effects of climate warming? Further, are there common characteristics of these useful measures that reduce variability?
