<p class="p">Climate warming in the Arctic, substantial over recent decades and well-documented in IPCC reports (IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2001</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">2013</xref>), is reflected in changes in a wide range of environmental and ecological measures. These illustrate convincingly that the Arctic is undergoing a system-wide response (ACIA 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2005</xref>; Hinzman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2005</xref>). The changing measures range from physical state variables, such as air temperature, permafrost temperature (Romanovsky et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">2010</xref>), or the depth of seasonal thaw (Goulden et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">1998</xref>), to changes in ecological processes, such as plant growth, which can result in changes in the state of ecosystem components such as plant biomass or changes in ecosystem structure (Chapin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2000</xref>; Sturm et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">2001</xref>; Epstein et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2004</xref>). In spite of the large number of environmental and ecological measurements made over recent decades, it has proven difficult to discover statistically significant trends in these measurements. This difficulty is caused by the high annual and seasonal variability of warming in the air temperature and the complexity of biological interactions.
