<p class="p">Both sites are underlain by hundreds of meters of continuous permafrost and have similar average annual temperatures of ~ −8 °C. Summers, however, are shorter and cooler at Zackenberg (4.5 °C) than at Toolik (9 °C). The short and cool summers of the Zackenberg valley restrict the number of vascular plant species in the dominant moist heath tundra so this High Arctic site has a relatively low biodiversity (Callaghan

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">2012</xref>). In contrast, the rolling uplands at the Low Arctic Toolik site are dominated by dwarf-shrub heath-tussock tundra and have many more plant species. Bliss (
