<p class="p">From 1996 to 2010, studies were made of trends and temporal variations across the whole aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem. In the terrestrial ecosystem, 6 plant species, 6 taxa of arthropods, 4 species of birds, and 3 species of mammals were measured (Mortensen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">2014</xref>). Plants were sampled weekly for such factors as abundance, flowering dates, and emergence, arthropods were sampled in traps, and mammals by census. Of the biotic variables, 39% exhibited significant linear trends; of the significant trends in the abundance of terrestrial biota, 12 had a positive slope and 22 had a negative slope. The Zackenberg data also revealed (Høye et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2013</xref>) that warmer summer temperatures led to a shortening of the season of plant flowering and likely to a decline in the abundance of the insects that visit these plant flowers for basking, nectar and pollen feeding, mating, and ovipositioning. For the aquatic ecosystems, both the species and abundance of phytoplankton and zooplankton responded strongly to water temperatures that varied from 4 to 11 °C from one summer to the next. One lake was dominated by chrysophytes in a warm summer (95% of abundance) and by dinophytes (96% of abundance) in a cold summer.
