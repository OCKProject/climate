<p class="p">A number of observers (Sturm et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">2001</xref>; Hinzman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2005</xref>; Myers-Smith et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2011</xref>; Elmendorf et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2012</xref>) have noted that shrubs in tundra in northern Alaska and in the Arctic as a whole are becoming more abundant. This change is attributed to climate warming as there are no other changes, such as nitrogen deposition, that have occurred in recent times. Toolik point-frame measurements (ITEX) were used for the two decades of measurement (Gould and Mercado-Díaz in Shaver et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">2014</xref>). Over this period, the relative abundance of vascular vegetation increased by 19% (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>), graminoids increased by 25.5%, herbaceous dicots by 24%, and shrubs by 13%: all increases were significant (p &lt; 0.05). Both canopy height and the horizontal extent of an upper canopy, which overshadows ground layer vegetation, increased. An increase in multiple canopy layers from 60 to 80% represents greater structural complexity of the vegetation and is primarily due to growth in the shrub

 <italic class="italic">Eriophorum vaginatum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Carex bigelowii</italic>. In contrast, the relative abundance of the nonvascular vegetation decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.05): lichens by 9.3%, non-
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> mosses by 20%, and 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> by 28%. This positive response of plant growth to warming is similar to that found throughout the Low Arctic (Elmendorf et al.
