<p class="p">The ITEX protocol was also used twice at Zackenberg to measure changes in the eight dominant plant communities from 1997 to 2008 (Schmidt et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">2012</xref>). Each community had four replicate sampling plots. In contrast to the Toolik results, there were significant reductions of up to 55% in the cover of grasses and lichens across all plant communities. Yet, some species and groups, including the willow (
 <italic class="italic">Salix arctica</italic>), exhibited only minor changes during this period. The interpretations suggested for Zackenberg by Schmidt et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">2012</xref>) for point-frame analysis and Campioli et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2013</xref>) for heating experiments are that some of the reductions may be due to the lower sensitivity of High Arctic plant communities to warming than those in the Low Arctic or High Arctic communities could even be resistant to climate change. However, a complicating factor was reduced availability of water during the summers caused by deepening of the active layer. In addition, there was little sign of the marked expansion of shrubs found in most of the Low Arctic (Walker et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">2006</xref>) but musk oxen grazing (Forchhammer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">2005</xref>) and the relatively short period of observations might make it difficult to measure any expansion.
