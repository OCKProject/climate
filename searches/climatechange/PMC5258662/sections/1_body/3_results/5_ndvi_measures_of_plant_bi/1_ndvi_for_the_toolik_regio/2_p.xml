<p class="p">The NDVI for the Toolik region has also been analyzed at much finer scales by Raynolds et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">2013</xref>) who used six scenes from Landsat 4 or more-recent sensors (1985–2007) showing the annual peak NDVI as measured at a 30-m pixel resolution over an 823 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> area. They analyzed changes in 14 types of vegetation and found that nearly all the patches showed either no increase or a small increase in NDVI; in fact, sizeable increases in NDVI were found only in tussock tundra, non-tussock-sedge tundra, and acidic dwarf-shrub tundra, the latter making up only 5% of the pixels. Thus, the increase in NDVI evident at a coarser scale (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>) was also present at the finer scale but was heterogeneously distributed. Further comparisons between the AVHRR (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>) and the Landsat values (Raynolds et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">2013</xref>) are difficult because NDVI values measured with different sensors and at different levels of resolution and types of rectification may be quite different (Goetz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">1997</xref>).
