<p class="p">The changes in NDVI (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>) indicate a regional increase in vegetation photosynthetic activity and aboveground plant biomass. The plot measurements of plant and leaf biomass at the Toolik site (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>) indicate that this biomass increase is largely the result of increased growth by deciduous shrubs (e.g., dwarf birch, willows, and alder) in response to multi-year warming, but this response is shared with graminoids and forbs. Several researchers attribute the slow increase in biomass to a slow increase in the availability of N to plants (Shaver et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">1992</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">2014</xref>; Pearce et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">2015</xref>; Jiang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2015</xref>). It is well known through warming and fertilization experiments that the N supply strongly limits plant growth in northern Alaska and that warming increases the microbial mineralization of organic nitrogen in the soil, the major source of N to plants in the tundra.
