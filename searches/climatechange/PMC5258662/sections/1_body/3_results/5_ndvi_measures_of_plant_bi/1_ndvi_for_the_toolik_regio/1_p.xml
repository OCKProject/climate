<p class="p">The NDVI of the Toolik region (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>) measures a region of tussock-sedge, dwarf-shrub, and moss tundra on the Circum-Arctic Vegetation Map (Walker et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">2005</xref>). Between 1982 and 2014, the peak season NDVI (±1 SD) significantly increased by 29%, from 0.56 to 0.72 (±0.055) (p &lt; 0.001). For the same period as the point-frame measures of biomass (1989–2008), the NDVI increased by 17%, which is close to the point-frame values of a 19% increase in total vascular vegetation and a 13% increase in shrub abundance (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>). The fastest increase in NDVI is in the summer but there is also a significant increase in the fall period, from 0.46 to 0.52 (±0.055) (p &lt; 0.01). Spring NDVI actually declined somewhat over the 33-year period although the trend was not statistically significant. Previous satellite assessments (e.g., Jia et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2003</xref>; Verbyla 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">2008</xref>; Beck and Goetz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2011</xref>), which covered larger areas of northern Alaska but over shorter time periods, also showed a systematic increase in the NDVI in recent decades. Bieniek et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2015</xref>) report NDVI data for the Alaskan coastal zone west of Barrow that are very similar (1982–2013) to the Toolik values (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>); they also measured a decrease in the spring.
