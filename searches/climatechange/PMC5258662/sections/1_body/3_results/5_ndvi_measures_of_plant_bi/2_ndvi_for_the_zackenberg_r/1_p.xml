<p class="p">At Zackenberg (Tagesson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">2012</xref>), the annual maximum NDVI increased from 0.35 to 0.61 between 1992 and 2004, an increase of 74%, before dipping to 0.49 in 2005 and returning to 0.57 in 2007 and 2008. The authors suggest that this dip in the NDVI could have been caused by a one-year change in the satellite sensor. In any case, the increase in NDVI at Zackenberg is consistent with other studies of NDVI trends in the Arctic, including the Toolik data (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>), that interpret the trend as an increase in both greening and plant photosynthesis (see also Jia et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2003</xref>; Verbyla 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">2008</xref>). However, the rates of change of the Zackenberg NDVI are much higher (0.02/year) than rates in other studies (0.003–0.006/year). Tagesson et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">2012</xref>) suggested the high rates may be due to the almost complete plant cover in the 1.4 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> study area as compared with other arctic study areas that typically include a large fraction of gravel, rock, and water.
