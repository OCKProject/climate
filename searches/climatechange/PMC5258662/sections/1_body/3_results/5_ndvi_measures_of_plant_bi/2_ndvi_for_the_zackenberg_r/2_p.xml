<p class="p">As with the permafrost temperatures at 20Â m, vegetation responses to temperature are integrated over several years and thereby damp out the hourly, daily, and seasonal variation in the noisy air temperature signal. Plants accumulate and retain biomass and nutrients from year-to-year and decade-to-decade. Thus, the effects of an unusually cold or warm summer are damped out but the long-term trend in temperature is preserved in long-lived tissues such as rhizomes, woody stems, and branches. Results of small but persistent changes, like the warming signal, accumulate over decades and become detectable because these long-lived tissues integrate effects over many years and are not reset to a base level each year.</p>
