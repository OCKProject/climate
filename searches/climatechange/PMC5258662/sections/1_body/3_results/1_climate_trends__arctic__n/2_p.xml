<p class="p">In contrast to the Arctic and North Slope trends, a linear trend analysis of the Toolik datasets revealed no significant trend (p &gt; 0.05) in the ~25-year record of SAT from 1989 to 2010 (Cherry et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">2014</xref>) or in SAT from 1989 to 2014 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). This inability to detect a significant trend (p &gt; 0.05) for these dates also occurred for the Barrow record for the same short period (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The lack of significant warming is also apparent in a closer analysis of the Toolik record for winter, spring, summer, and fall (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>).
