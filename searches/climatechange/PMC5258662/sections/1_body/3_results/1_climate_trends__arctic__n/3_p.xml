 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) show a significant (p &lt; 0.01) warming. Schmidt et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">2012</xref>) report that over the 1997–2008 period, the measured average summer temperature increased dramatically resulting in an increase of between 1.8 and 2.7 °C per decade (p &lt; 0.01), while precipitation data show no significant trends for annual averages or for summer months. To extend the Zackenberg climate database, Hansen et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2008</xref>) used data from a nearby meteorological station (established in 1958) and from elsewhere in Greenland to create a dataset and calculate a long-term increase in average annual temperature for the period 1901–2005 of 1.39 °C (p &lt; 0.01) and for 1991–2005 of 2.25 °C (p &lt; 0.01); they mention that these trends are similar to trends from other studies along the east coast of Greenland.
