<p class="p">The variability of SAT from year to year makes it difficult to discern small changes over less than one or two decades. However, as Lachenbruch and Marshall (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">1986</xref>) noted, as the temperature signal moves deeper into the soil the annual variability is filtered out so that temperatures at a depth of 20 m do show a regular trend (Smith et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">2010</xref>). At Galbraith Lake 20 km south of Toolik Lake, permafrost temperatures at 20 m have increased by about 0.8 °C over the past 20 years (Smith et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">2010</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). However, Stieglitz et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">2003</xref>) show that on the North Slope some permafrost warming, perhaps as much as 50%, could be contributed by an increase in snow depth, which insulates the soil from cold winter temperatures.
