<p class="p">There is at Toolik, however, additional evidence for an increase in the thickness of the active layer in at least some portion of the catchment. A doubling in the alkalinity has occurred in lake and stream waters (Fig.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2005</xref>; Kling et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2014</xref>). This doubling of alkalinity is balanced primarily by changes in dissolved calcium and magnesium (Hobbie et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2003</xref>). The most likely cause of the doubling is an increase in the weathering of previously frozen mineral soils as water flows at the bottom of the active layer or through new subsurface water-flow pathways. An extreme example of this process did occur in a small stream in the Toolik Lake watershed (Hobbie et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">1999</xref>). This stream passes through a site where several meters of gravel deposited some 10,000 years ago at the edge of a glacier were removed for road construction in the 1970s. The newly exposed surface, previously frozen in permafrost, soon developed an active layer and weathering took place; as a result in 1992–1997, the stream supplied 35% of the phosphate (weathered from Ca
