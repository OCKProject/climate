<p class="p">At Zackenberg (Christiansen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2008</xref>), twenty lakes showed no change in chemical conductivity when monitored twice (1997 and 2003). Two of these lakes also showed no changes when monitored every year from 1997 to 2003. It is not known if weathering of the previously frozen soil would show alkalinity and isotopic changes in the Zackenberg stream and lake watersheds in the same way as soils at Toolik.
