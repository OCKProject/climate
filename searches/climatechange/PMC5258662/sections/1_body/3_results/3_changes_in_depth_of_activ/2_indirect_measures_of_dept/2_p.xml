<p class="p">Additional evidence for an increasing depth of thaw at Toolik comes from geochemical tracers (Kling et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2014</xref>). In soils, the ratio of strontium isotopes (
 <sup class="sup">87</sup>Sr/
 <sup class="sup">86</sup>Sr) decreases with depth (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>); thus as the depth of thaw of the soils increases, the rainwater moves through soil layers with progressively lower
 <sup class="sup">87</sup>Sr/
 <sup class="sup">86</sup>Sr ratios. This type of decrease in the isotope ratio was observed in the stream entering Toolik Lake over a ten-year period (Keller et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">2007</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2010</xref>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>). Although the isotope method is sensitive enough to detect very small changes in thaw depth over large areas of the watershed, it is uncertain exactly how much of the thaw occurred uniformly throughout the watershed and how much under new water-flow pathways.
