<p class="p">The weathering and water movement in the soil that led to both the increase in alkalinity and the decrease in strontium isotope ratios also integrate the chemical signal over several years. This integration occurs because some of the alkalinity that is produced in one year remains in the soil water at the end of the summer and is not released until the thaw of the active layer the next summer. For example, Everett et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">1996</xref>) measured the Ca
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> in soil water for 22 days in August and found an average of 31.4 µEq L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in overland flow (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 3), 79.8 at 20 cm depth (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 21), and 112 µEq L
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> at 40 cm (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 21). Rainfall each fall ensured that the active layer was saturated at the beginning of each winter (Hinzman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">1996</xref>). The next spring, most of the runoff from the watershed occurred from snowmelt in the spring as surficial runoff when the active layer was still frozen (Woo and Steer 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">1983</xref>). The ions that are a part of the soil water are not released until the thaw depth deepens later in the summer (Cornwell 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">1992</xref>).
