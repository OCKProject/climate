<p class="p">The summer depth of thaw of the active layer of the soil is primarily influenced by the surface temperature and the length of the thaw season (Hinzman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2005</xref>), snow cover (Stieglitz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">2003</xref>), the topographic position, soil moisture, thickness of the organic and litter layers, and the structure of the vegetation canopy (Shaver et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">2014</xref>). The mean maximum thickness of the active layer at the Toolik transect in August varies from 28 to 52 cm, and there is no statistically significant trend in thickness or in maximum thaw depth over the 22 years of record (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Shiklomanov et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">2010</xref>) examined a continuous time series of soil thaw measures at Barrow (1994–2009) and also found no apparent trend.
