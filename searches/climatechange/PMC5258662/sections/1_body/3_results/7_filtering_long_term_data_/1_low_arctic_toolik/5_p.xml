<p class="p">A part of understanding the concept of environmental and ecological filters is the notion that some measurements are not useful as indicators of change because they are reset to the same level every year. For example, the depth of thaw of the soil at Toolik is measured at its summer peak (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>) but is reset to zero centimeters each winter when the entire active layer is frozen. Similarly, summer temperatures in lakes, chlorophyll content of lake plankton, or temperature of the Kuparuk River are all reset at the start of each year.
