<p class="p">A large number of multi-year measurements are being collected at the Toolik site (e.g., Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>) but only permafrost temperatures, plant biomass, and chemical measures of soil weathering (strontium ratios and lake alkalinity) revealed changes attributable to climate warming (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). Why were these three measures useful indicators of change while others were not? One way to think about this problem is in terms of a filtration effect. In these useful measures, there is something that occurs during the generation of the signal or in the analysis that filters or reduces the noise around the signal so that trends can be detected over a reasonable period of time. For the Toolik dataset, which is only 25 years long, the best type of filter is a “medium-pass” filter that accumulates the effects of the changing climate over several years to reveal trends due to decadal changes. In contrast, a “high-pass” filter responds strongly to variation in climate on short-time scales (&lt;few years) and a “low-pass” filter responds so slowly to climate change that the change is undetectable on a decadal time scale.
