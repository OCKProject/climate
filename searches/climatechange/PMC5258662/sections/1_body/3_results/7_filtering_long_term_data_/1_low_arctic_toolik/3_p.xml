<p class="p">The permafrost record of temperature at 20 m depth in the soil (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>) is an excellent example of naturally occurring moving average or running mean, and no manipulation of the data is needed. As Lachenbruch and Marshall (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">1986</xref>) point out, as the temperature signal moves deeper into the soil, the high-frequency noise is progressively filtered out. However, as previously noted, some of the change in snow depth will also affect soil temperatures so that permafrost temperature change reflects the temperature of the upper layers of the soil and not just the air temperature during climate change (Stieglitz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">2003</xref>).
