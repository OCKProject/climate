<p class="p">Another way that the natural environmental measures act as filters to reduce the variability from year to year is by accumulation of the effects. That is, some of the environmental effects of one year are stored and affect the data for the next year or years. The plants that are most useful for tracing warming (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>) have large amounts of biomass in their stems, branches, and roots; these tissues persist from year to year such that small warming-induced increments in biomass accumulate over time. The plants also translocate and store nutrients and carbohydrates over winter for use in leaf production the next spring, so that resources for growth that are acquired in one-year affect subsequent year’s growth. In much the same way, the alkalinity that is added to soil water as a product of weathering is not completely flushed out at the end of the summer and may persist in the soil for years before it is transported to lakes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>).
