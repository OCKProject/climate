<p class="p">An example of the use of a filter is the moving average (Chatfield 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2004</xref>) commonly used for long-term air temperature analysis. This method was used with a 10-, 20-, and 30-year filter to analyze the mean summer air temperatures for the Italian Central Alps (1610–2008; Coppola et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2013</xref>). For northern Alaska, a 5- and 10-year moving average produced smoothed curves with significant

 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref>). Unfortunately, the Toolik data cover only 25 years and have missing data points and a high variability; therefore, the air temperature trend is not significant (p &gt; 0.01) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) and the moving average cannot be used.
