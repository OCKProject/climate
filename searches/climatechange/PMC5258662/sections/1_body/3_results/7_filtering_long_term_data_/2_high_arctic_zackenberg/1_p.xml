<p class="p">These insights about environmental filters developed from the Low Arctic site at Toolik do not really agree with the results of long-term environmental studies at the High Arctic site at Zackenberg. Out of all the ecological changes that occurred at this High Arctic site only one, the change in canopy reflectance or NDVI, appeared to be the result of integration of a climate change effect from one year to another. This integration, which occurs because plants retain biomass, nutrients, and carbohydrates from one year to another, decreases signal noise and acts as a medium pass filter.</p>
