<p class="p">A possible reason for the difference between these sites is the consistent and high rate of warming occurring during the period of research at Zackenberg when the summer average temperatures increased between 1.8 and 2.7 °C/decade (p &lt; 0.01) (Schmidt et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">2012</xref>). At Toolik, there was no significant trend of summer and of annual average temperatures and at least summer temperatures were more variable (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). However, at Zackenberg, the dramatic rise in the summer temperatures has increased the thickness of the active layer, increased the overall plant biomass or productivity as measured by NDVI, and increased numbers or biomass of some of the biota while decreasing the numbers or biomass of others. For example, at Zackenberg, there was a large reduction of the biomass of grasses and lichens but no increase in shrubs. Evidently some plants and plant communities are sensitive to change while others have a high degree of resistance.
