<p class="p">The concept of the medium pass filter, developed from the Low Arctic Toolik dataset, has only limited application for analyzing results from the High Arctic at Zackenberg in northern Greenland. At this site, the summer temperatures are increasing at an unusually high rate. Some results of the environmental measurements, such as the thickness of the active layer and abundance of some plants, increase in parallel with the warming temperatures. Others, such as biomass of grasses and lichens, have dramatically decreased. The NDVI measure does increase in a similar manner in the High Arctic and Low Arctic sites, and it is likely that there is a medium pass filter at work in which some integration is achieved because of year-to-year carryover and reuse of plant biomass, nutrients, and carbohydrates. It would be interesting to see results of temperature measures at 20Â m depth where the soil acts to filter out the year-to-year variability. </p>
