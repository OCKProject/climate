<p class="p">An overall warming trend does occur in northern Alaska where air temperatures at Barrow, the only permanent town, have warmed ~3.1 °C in the last 65 years. However, at the Toolik site, the 25-year record of annual mean air temperatures revealed no significant trend due to the high variability from year to year and the relatively short period of record. In spite of the temperature variability and the absence of a warming trend, three of the Toolik measurements did produce evidence of change: a warming of permafrost temperatures at a depth of 20 m, an increase of plant biomass as measured on the ground and by means of satellite NDVI, and a change in surface water chemistry indicating an increase in weathering of previously frozen soil. These indicators have the common feature of integrating effects of the climate signal on multi-year to decadal time scales. They act as a medium pass filter that reduces the signal variability yet allows the effects of long-term warming to emerge within the 20- to 30-year dataset. Based on the indicators that have passed through the medium pass filter, we conclude that there has been a measureable response of the Toolik ecosystem to arctic warming, even though there has been no statistically significant warming trend in the annual air temperature.</p>
