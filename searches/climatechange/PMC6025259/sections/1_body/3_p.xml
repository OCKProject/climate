Previously, health was not a major consideration for informing policy on climate change mitigation, but perspective shifted in the Paris Agreement with the realisation that many strategies to reduce carbon emissions, such as improvements in air quality and the switch to more active modes of transport, will also have substantial health co-benefits [

Furthermore, health should also be a key consideration in assessments of the differential societal impacts of limiting warming to 1.5 °C as opposed to 2 °C. Given the many additional challenges in achieving the more stringent target, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will produce a special report, due in September 2018, which will document the additional gains to be made from the 1.5 °C limit. This will include assessments of the range of health impacts associated with climate change.
