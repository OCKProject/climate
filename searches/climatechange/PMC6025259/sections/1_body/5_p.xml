<p class="p">As with the Lee et al. paper, new health risk assessments of climate change would be instructive if they include an explicit comparison of the differential health impacts at the 1.5 °C and 2 °C targets. However, studies which assume that warming remains within 1.5 °C, as opposed to the more likely scenario of breaching this limit before the widespread development of negative emissions technologies can lower temperatures again, will likely underestimate true health burdens. Future risk assessments should also highlight geographical variations in risk as well as consider a wider range of health impacts associated with climate change, including the more indirect processes for which less evidence exists. Articles such as that by Schleussner et al. from 2015, which models the different climate impacts expected at the 1.5 °C and 2 °C targets, provide a good framework upon which comprehensive health risk assessments can be based [

That paper reports that the additional 0.5 °C warming would bring about a new climate regime, particularly in tropical regions, which, in turn, would have major impacts on heat-related mortality and morbidity. Reductions in water availability for the Mediterranean is projected to nearly double from 9% to 17%, and the length of regional dry spells would increase from 7% to 11%. Most parts of the world would face substantially lower crop yields at 2 °C, with major implications for global nutritional health; sea-level rise would be reduced by 30% in a 1.5 °C scenario compared to 2 °C.
