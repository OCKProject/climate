<p class="p">Given the importance of climate change on human health, healthcare professionals have a crucial role in communicating these impacts to policymakers and to the general public, advocating for strong action on climate change mitigation and adaptation. The health professions have been slow to join the calls for action on climate change, but it appears that this is changing, with many professional organisations having developed policies calling for strengthened action on climate change. Climate change has become one of the top priorities under the World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General, Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus, with the appointment of Dr. Joy St John as Assistant Director-General on Climate Change and Other Determinants of Health. At the recent 71st World Health Assembly, WHO, alongside the World Meteorological Organization, UN Environment, and the Convention on Biological Diversity, held a technical briefing on health, environment, and climate change, underscoring the importance of intersectoral collaboration on these issues.</p>
