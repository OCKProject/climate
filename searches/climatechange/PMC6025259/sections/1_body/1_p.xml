<p class="p">Whilst recognition of anthropogenic climate change has existed for over half a century, global agreement on what is an acceptable limit to an increase in global average temperature has only been achieved in relatively recent years [

The first political acknowledgement of setting a limit to global warming was in 1996, when the European Council of environment ministers stated that “global average temperatures should not exceed 2 degrees above pre-industrial level” [
 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-15-01123" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Specific mention of a commitment to this limit, however, did not reach the global stage until the 16th Conference of the Parties (COP16) in Cancun in 2010 [
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-15-01123" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. At the same time, Small Island Developing States and Least Developed Countries declared that a 2 °C global increase from pre-industrial temperature was already too much. In the lead-up to COP15 in Copenhagen, 101 countries called for a commitment to a 1.5 °C limit [
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-15-01123" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. When negotiations failed to reach an agreement in Copenhagen, the most vulnerable countries renewed their efforts, calling for a 1.5 °C commitment at COP21 in Paris [
