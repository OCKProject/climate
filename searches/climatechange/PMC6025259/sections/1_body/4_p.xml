<p class="p">The special issue on climate change and human health which details the health impacts of warming of 1.5 °C and 2 °C in the 
 <italic class="italic">International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</italic> brings together papers highlighting the impacts of climate variability and climate change on population health and health systems. The research examines selected pathways through which climate impacts human health, notably the dangers associated with exposure to hot weather [

Using these SSPs in combination with climate projections, Lee et al. report that achieving a 1.5 °C warming target as opposed to 2 °C would decrease future heat-related mortality in South Korea by about 12%; however, this reduction is likely to be much greater if future demographic changes are also considered [
