  <result pre="and health determinants [ 70, 71] and links it with" exact="climate" post="change aspects. Where the influence of social, environmental, and"/>
  <result pre="health is acknowledged, this framework helps link these influences to" exact="climate" post="change adaptation. Justice can therefore be promoted through reduced"/>
  <result pre="inequities with society overall, not only if linked directly to" exact="climate" post="change adaptation. Climate justice has developed into an important"/>
  <result pre="to Public Health [ 72]. Major requests posed by the" exact="climate" post="justice community, such as increase participation of diverse population"/>
  <result pre="adverse effects [ 45], and procedural rights in the political" exact="climate" post="change arena [ 72], are chances to remain healthy"/>
  <result pre="for instance. As the roles of gender and diversity in" exact="climate" post="adaptation have not yet been sufficiently explored, particularly in"/>
  <result pre="particularly in higher-income contexts [ 59, 62], their contribution to" exact="climate" post="justice through adaptation could be considered. Gender equality is"/>
