<p class="p">To illustrate possible use of the framework, we tested selected guiding questions on the Austrian Climate Change Adaptation Action Plan document [
 <xref rid="B69-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>] as the Austrian strategy has been identified as a good contribution to health protection from climate change [
 <xref rid="B46-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Only one question for each domain was asked here to keep the case study brief for information purposes. In a “real world” case study, the example questions listed here would be adapted to specific contexts and evaluation aims. In addition, as stated above, not all questions can be adequately answered using a document analysis approach. Further tests in actual adaptation projects and the use of expert information are needed.
