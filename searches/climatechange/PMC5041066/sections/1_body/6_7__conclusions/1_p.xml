<p class="p">This article showed that the problem of adaptation evaluation is linked to challenges in establishing causality and to inadequate definitions of adaptationâ€™s effectiveness in protecting human health. The theoretical framework puts forward the idea of using a set of proxy indicators, measuring effects of adaptation on determinants of health in seven domains. As such, the framework allows for measures to reduce health-related inequities and to advance climate justice to become part of the adaptation evaluation standard.</p>
