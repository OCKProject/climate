<p class="p">Reducing inequities and risk factors for health disparities does not eliminate the need to further develop epidemiological methods to measure health outcomes after adaptation. Instead, this framework expands the notion of effectiveness to allow for an assessment at an early stage in adaptation implementation: changes to determinants of health are likely detected earlier than effects on specific health outcomesâ€”particularly since the pathways between climate change adaptation and health effects are multi-faceted and long-term.</p>
