<p class="p">Current Maxent models suggest coral snake distributions are restricted to the southeastern United States, with only very limited areas of high habitat suitability; the majority of high to moderate habitat suitability areas are restricted to Florida. These results align well with the current known distribution of coral snakes (

Also, all four current climate models show relatively consistent geographic predictions. The largest region of difference between the models is in the southernmost tip of Florida which is shown as low habitat suitability by the Full model but more moderate suitability by the Low Correlation models; the other two models were intermediate between the Full and Low Correlation models.
