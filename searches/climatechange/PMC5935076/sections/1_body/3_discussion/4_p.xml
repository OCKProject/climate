<p class="p">While climate change is often assumed to be a future issue, in reality it is likely already mediating range shifts and other potentially adverse species responses (

This work suggests that studies using Maxent to make conservation decisions should strongly consider using future climate models in addition to models of the current climate conditions. This is particularly important for predicting the poleward range limits for ectothermic species that may already be undergoing significant range shifts, as these limits are often dependent on abiotic factors (
 <xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cunningham et al., 2016</xref>). Temperature and precipitation are the most common variables included in Maxent models, and most of the 19 bioclimatic variables have been used in more than 1,000 published models to date (reviewed by

Thus, we encourage future studies to include future climate projections as these predicted climate layers may improve model performance over using only current climate data.
