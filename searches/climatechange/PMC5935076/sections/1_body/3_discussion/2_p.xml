<p class="p">Future climate models show a slight increase in habitat suitability throughout areas identified as moderate habitat suitability by the current climate models, and a slight expansion of suitable habitat along coastal regions. Both the GISS-E2-R (NINT) and MIROC-ESM models show similar geographic patterns. The Full models for both future climate change scenarios show more extensive range expansion than Reduced models. For the Full models, MIROC-ESM showed slightly greater range expansion than the equivalent GISS-E2_R (NINT) models; the extent of range expansion was more similar between MIROC-ESM and GISS-E2_R (NINT) for the Reduced models (

As ectotherms are highly reliant on temperature, climate change is predicted to increase the potential distribution of many temperate reptile species in the Northern Hemisphere (
