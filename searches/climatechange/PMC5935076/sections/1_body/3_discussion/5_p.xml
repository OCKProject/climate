<p class="p">Although the impact of climate change on shifts in species distributions has now been well documented, the impacts of climate change on the distribution of reptiles, and particularly snakes, remain understudied (but see 
 <xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Araújo, Thuiller &amp; Pearson, 2006</xref>). Given that climate conditions from 2050 already better predict the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">M. fulvius</italic> than ‘current’ climate conditions, systematic surveys at northern range edges for 
 <italic class="italic">M. fulvius</italic> and other snake species will likely yield valuable information on the rate of range shifts in response to climate change.
