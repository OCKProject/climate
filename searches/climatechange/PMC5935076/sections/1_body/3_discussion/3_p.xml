<p class="p">These results also, however, indicate that much of the Southeast may be well outside the range of current climate conditions, suggesting the presence of no-analog or novel environments within the Southeast in the future. Although habitats across the Southeast will warm, the extent of warming in the future will likely exceed recent maximum temperature conditions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). Thus, these results must be interpreted with caution. These results are especially relevant as many reptile species are often not capable of optimal performance at the high end of their thermal tolerance and perform best at a lower temperature known as the “thermal optimum” (
 <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Clusellas-Trullas, Blackburn &amp; Chown, 2011</xref>). It is unlikely that the upper limit will be reached, but it is possible that the thermal optimum may be exceeded which may have significant impacts on the behavior of reptile species. Although thermal data are lacking on wild individuals of 
 <italic class="italic">M. fulvius</italic>, their fossorial tendencies and diel activity patterns (early morning and late evening) suggest that their thermal optimum could likely be exceeded by future warming in several areas of their range. Better physiological data that would allow an integration of mechanistic models with these correlative models (e.g.,
