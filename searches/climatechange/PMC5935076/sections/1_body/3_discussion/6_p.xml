<p class="p">This work has important conservation implications for 
 <italic class="italic">M. fulvius. M. fulvius</italic> is already infrequently encountered throughout its range and is extremely rare along its northern range limit. In North and South Carolina, where 
 <italic class="italic">M. fulvius</italic> is currently at the range limit, habitat is expected to increase in suitability. Yet, high habitat fragmentation across the southeastern United States may limit the ability of this species to recover in these states where it is of conservation concern. The growing market for wood pellets in Europe could threaten US longleaf pine forests (

 <italic class="italic">M. fulvius.</italic> In addition, an increasing demand for pine straw within the United States has left much of the longleaf pine forest that remains devoid of the leaf litter layer on which many fossorial reptiles, such as 
 <italic class="italic">M. fulvius</italic>, depend. Thus, dispersal ability will be critical in driving whether or not any species will be capable of occupying newly suitable habitat (
