<p class="p">Range expansion in 
 <italic class="italic">M. fulvius</italic> (the venomous ‘model’) may also have important evolutionary consequences for two species of putative Batesian mimic: the scarlet kingsnake (
 <italic class="italic">Lampropeltis elapsoides</italic>) and the scarlet snake (
 <italic class="italic">Cemophora coccinea</italic>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). Both mimic species occur well beyond the current range of 
 <italic class="italic">M. fulvius</italic>. In allopatry, both mimic species have more red and less black on their dorsum than 
 <italic class="italic">M. fulvius</italic> (
 <xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Harper &amp; Pfennig, 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Akcali &amp; Pfennig, 2017</xref>), making them poor mimics. However, this breakdown of mimicry in allopatry is favored by predator-mediated selection: clay replicas of snakes that had similar amounts of red and black as 
 <italic class="italic">M. fulvius</italic> were attacked more often in allopatry than the local phenotype with more red (
 <xref rid="ref-68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pfennig et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, mimics that co-occur with 
 <italic class="italic">M. fulvius</italic> at the edge of its range (e.g., in North Carolina) resemble it more precisely; in edge sympatry, there were fewer attacks on this phenotype than the redder allopatric one (
 <xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Harper &amp; Pfennig, 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kikuchi &amp; Pfennig, 2010</xref>). Thus, the migration of 
 <italic class="italic">M. fulvius</italic> into previously uninhabited regions should facilitate the evolution of precise mimicry among local mimics. How rapidly precise mimicry evolves will depend on such factors as the generation times of predators and mimics, the standing variation in color pattern among mimics, the extent of gene flow between mimics from historical sympatry and mimics from ‘novel’ sympatry, and the strength of selection for precise mimics.
