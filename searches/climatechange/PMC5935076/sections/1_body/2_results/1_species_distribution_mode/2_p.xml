<p class="p">TSS values for all four model types fell between 0.5 and 0.65 (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), which is considered a good fit model (
 <xref rid="ref-57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Landis &amp; Koch, 1977</xref>). The Full model had the strongest TSS score (0.6314), both Reduced and Moderate Correlation models had similar values (0.5831 and 0.5733), and the Low Correlation model had the smallest TSS value. The performance of the Low Correlation model is likely due to the limited number of variables included (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 4 of 20) as well as a lack of highly influential variables that were included in the Reduced model, which also had few variables (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 5) but a higher TSS score.
