<p class="p">All models predicted a range similar to that proposed by the IUCN (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). The area of highest suitability was northcentral Florida. Using SDMtoolbox, we found high similarity in suitability predictions for all model types (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> &lt; 0.9); however, the Reduced model identified a slightly greater extent of habitat suitability than the Full model. This is likely because the Reduced model was based off a small subset of the available environmental data (i.e., five out of the 20 variables because of our strict contribution requirements). Therefore, these models were the least constrained. As expected, the northern and central areas of Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia were largely unsuitable aside from a small pocket of low suitability in central Alabama and south-central South Carolina. This small region in central Alabama is also highlighted by the IUCN range map. This is an area where 
 <italic class="italic">M. fulvius</italic> has been known to occur historically, yet likely appears as only moderate to low suitability habitat in the models because we were only able to obtain two locality points from this region. Recent vouchered records of 
 <italic class="italic">M. fulvius</italic> do not exist from this region in any of the databases we searched. Although this lack of recent records may stem, in part, from the fact that central Alabama remains one of the most herpetologically under surveyed regions in the southeastern United States, 
 <italic class="italic">M. fulvius</italic> is known to be rare in this area (
 <xref rid="ref-61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mount, 1975</xref>).
