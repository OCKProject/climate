<p class="p">Under the GISS-E2-R (NINT) scenario, all model conditions gave similar results. Here, we show the results of the Full and Reduced models as those were the top two performing models. Both model types showed an increase in the logistic value of suitable habitat and a northward expansion of suitable habitat conditions (

The southern to central portions of Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina displayed moderate to high suitability in the Full model but not the Reduced model. Both models showed areas of unsuitability in central Mississippi, parts of west-central Alabama, northern Georgia, and western and central North Carolina.
