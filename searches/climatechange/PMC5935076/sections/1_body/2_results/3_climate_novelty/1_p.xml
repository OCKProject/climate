<p class="p">MESS analysis identified multiple areas where no-analog or novel climates were present, which varied among models, years, and model types (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). MIROC-ESM 2050 predicted a high degree of climate similarity in two of the four models (Low and Reduced); the Full and Moderate models, however, displayed almost no climate similarity. This would indicate that one or more of the future climate layers used in only these models may fall outside of the ranges seen in current times (1950â€“2000). The results from MIROC-ESM are similar to those obtained with GISS-E2-R (NINT) models (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>), where the Reduced and Low Correlation models show a higher degree of climate similarity than the Full and Moderate models.
