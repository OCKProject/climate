<p class="p">Based on the differential results in identifying central peninsular Florida as suitable as well as the jack-knifing results, we predict that Temperature Seasonality, Mean Temperature of Coldest Quarter, Precipitation of Driest Month, Precipitation of Warmest Quarter, or some combination therein is highly influential for determining habitat suitability. Soil type also had a significant influence on the output of the models. Because
