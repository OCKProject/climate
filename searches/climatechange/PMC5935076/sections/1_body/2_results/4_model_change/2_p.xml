<p class="p">As mentioned above, the Full model had the highest TSS score while the AUC scores were nearly identical across all four models. However, based on the effects of clamping and the MESS analysis, the Reduced model type is less biased by no-analog climate. The difference between the results of these two model types leads to slightly different predictions: the Reduced model predicts less range expansion than the Full model and is therefore more conservative.</p>
