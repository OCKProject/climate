<p class="p">To quantify model change, results were first converted from continuous to binary prediction. This step required the use of a threshold cutoff that defined areas with a suitability greater than the threshold as “good” habitat and areas with a suitability less than the threshold as “poor” habitat. For this study, the maximum training sum of sensitivity and specificity (Max SSS) threshold was chosen as it has been found to be a strong method for selecting thresholds with presence-only data (

This threshold aims to maximize the summation of both sensitivity (true predicted presence) and specificity (true predicted absence). It is considered a strong choice when modeling for conservation purposes because the costs of omission (false negative) are greater than those of commission (false positive) (

The resulting raster displays a score of either 0, 1, or −1: 0 indicates habitat suitability stability, 1 indicates habitat suitability improvement, and −1 indicates worsening habitat suitability for only those areas with conditions previously considered “good”.
