<p class="p">Global Climate Models, or GCMs, represent the diversity of pathways that the future climate may follow in coming years. Each GCM comes from a different parent agency and represents a different scenario based on the chosen Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) and model inputs. RCP is an emissions scenario that quantifies a potential climate future by projecting greenhouse gas trajectories (
 <xref rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">IPCC, 2014</xref>). Smaller RCPs such as 2.6 have drastically lower projected greenhouse gas concentrations than larger RCPs such as 8.5. We selected an RCP of 4.5, which represents a moderate greenhouse gas mitigation scenario (
 <xref rid="ref-56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kopp et al., 2014</xref>). Under this scenario, the global mean surface temperature is likely to increase between 1.1 °C to 2.6 °C relative to the 1986–2005 period by the end of the century (
 <xref rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">IPCC, 2014</xref>). This RCP assumes moderate global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. If these reductions in emissions do not occur, this RCP may underestimate future climate warming (
