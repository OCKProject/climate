<p class="p">Both CMIP5 configurations have different coupling compilations that result in different equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) and transient climate response (TCR) values: 4.7 ECS and 2.2 TCR for MIROC-ESM (
 <xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Andrews et al., 2012</xref>) and 2.1 ECS and 1.5 TCR for GISS-E2-R (NINT) (
 <xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Flato et al., 2013</xref>). Equilibrium climate sensitivity is a measure of the change in equilibrium global mean surface temperature after a doubling of atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration, while transient climate response is a measure of expected warming at a given time (
 <xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Collins et al., 2013</xref>). Most models agree on a range for these values between 1.5 and 4.5 for ECS, and between 1 and 2.5 for TCR (
 <xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Collins et al., 2013</xref>). Because MIROC-ESM is above this range, it projects a dramatic change in mean surface temperature and is therefore considered more pessimistic than GISS-E2-R (NINT).
