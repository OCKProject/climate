<p class="p">Data for future climate predictions were taken from the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) research program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS). These raster grids were downloaded at an identical resolution to the current data (2.5 arc-minutes). Soil type data are assumed to remain stable through time even under the influence of climate change; because of this, soil type data used for current models (taken from the FAO/IIASA Harmonized World Soil Database) were used along with the projected future climate variables to comprise a full suite of variables.</p>
