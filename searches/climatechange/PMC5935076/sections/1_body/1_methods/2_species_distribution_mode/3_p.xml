<p class="p">Each Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) model configuration is the product of a unique group of variables and therefore has its own benefits. Best practice is to utilize multiple models because: (1) they allow a range of possible outcomes to be evaluated and (2) similar outcomes from different models increase confidence (

Therefore, two CMIP5 configurations were selected: MIROC-ESM, a cooperative effort by the University of Tokyoâ€™s Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute, National Institute for Environmental Studies, and Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, and GISS-E2-R (NINT) from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Both models used the same RCP as mentioned above.
