MESS analysis compares the environmental similarity of variables and identifies areas where one or more environmental variables are outside of the training range and were implemented with the Maxent Java Applet. Negative values indicate a novel climate, and the magnitude indicates the degree to which a point is out of range from its predictors. Positive values indicate climate similarity and are scored out of 100, with a score of 100 indicating that a value is entirely non-novel (
