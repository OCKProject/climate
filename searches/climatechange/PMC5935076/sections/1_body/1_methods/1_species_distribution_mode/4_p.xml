<p class="p">For environmental data, we used 19 continuous bioclimatic variables downloaded from WorldClim 1.4; these climate layers were generated using weather station data compiled between 1950 and 2000 (

These data are commonly used in Maxent modeling (as noted above), and provide temperature and precipitation metrics that are important abiotic factors in driving the distribution of ecotherms. Additionally, as coral snakes have been shown to have a preference for specific soil types (
 <xref rid="ref-77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Steen et al., 2015</xref>) we used categorical soil type data from the Harmonized World Soil Database created by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) (

We included the same soil layer in both current and future climate models as soils can be expected to remain stable over these short time frames. Raster grids for the bioclimatic variables were at a spatial resolution of 2.5 arc-minutes (less than a 5 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> resolution), and soil type data were scaled to match. This resolution was chosen because it is close to the accuracy of the occurrence locality data that were used, thereby maximizing the likelihood that conditions at the point of collection are correctly portrayed while also maintaining the high resolution of the data (
