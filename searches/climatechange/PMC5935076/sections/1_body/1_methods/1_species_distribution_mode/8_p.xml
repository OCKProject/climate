<p class="p">Two primary methods were used to assess model fit: area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve plots and true skill statistic (TSS). Area under the curve (AUC) is one of the most common statistics used for model evaluation. Although this metric has been criticized (

The Kappa statistic is used in presence/absence models to calculate model accuracy normalized by the accuracy predicted by random chance (
