<p class="p">The extent of the study area can also heavily influence model output (
 <xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Elith, Kearney &amp; Phillips, 2010</xref>). Large study regions can often lead to overfitting (
 <xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Anderson &amp; Raza, 2010</xref>), which lowers model transferability across time (
 <xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Araújo &amp; Rahbek, 2006</xref>). This is because Maxent uses ‘pseudoabsence’ points drawn randomly from throughout the study area and evaluates the model by comparing the environment at points where the species is known to be present with these pseudoabsence points (
 <xref rid="ref-69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Phillips, Anderson &amp; Schapire, 2006</xref>). Restricting the study extent to areas where the species being modeled could potentially occur, as opposed to areas far outside the range, restricts pseudoabsence points to areas where they are informative (
 <xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Barbet-Massin et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, all 20 environmental variables were trimmed using ArcGIS 10.3 to include only those areas that overlap with the historical range of 
 <italic class="italic">M. fulvius</italic> (
 <xref rid="ref-62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">NatureServe, International Union for Conservation of Nature, 2007</xref>), with a buffer of 200 km around the known range. This buffer accomplishes two goals. First, the buffered region includes all the current habitat where 
 <italic class="italic">M. fulvius</italic> have been observed (including seven known localities that occurred as far as 45 km outside of the range identified by the IUCN). This ensured that all suitable habitat during the 1950–2000 time frame was used in the model. Second, including an additional buffer beyond the known range captures all the potential area of future suitable habitat (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). This method of background selection produces more realistic predictions than large study regions because it removes areas where species are unable to disperse (
