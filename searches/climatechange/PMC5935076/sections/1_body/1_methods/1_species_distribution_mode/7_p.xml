<p class="p">Maxent’s logistic output settings return a raster grid where each cell is assigned a value between 0 and 1, with a value of 0 representing a low probability of species occurrence and therefore low habitat suitability and a value of 1 representing a high probability of species occurrence and therefore high habitat suitability (
 <xref rid="ref-70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Phillips &amp; Dudík, 2008</xref>). The logistic output was used in Maxent because it is easier to interpret than raw and cumulative output formats (

The regularization multiplier was set to 1.0, maximum iterations 500, and all models were replicated using 10-fold cross-validation. In cross-validation, species locality data is divided randomly into a number of partitions of equal size (k); models are then trained iteratively using k-1 partitions, while the final partition is retained for model evaluation (
