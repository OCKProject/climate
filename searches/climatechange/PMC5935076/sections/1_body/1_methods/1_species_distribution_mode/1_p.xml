<p class="p">The ecological niche program Maxent version 3.3.3k (
 <xref rid="ref-71" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Phillips, Dud√≠k &amp; Schapire, 2004</xref>) was used to create a correlative species distribution model, executed through the Java Applet. Maxent uses environmental data from locations where the species of interest has been observed to create a map of habitat suitability across the area of interest. Maxent was chosen over competing modeling approaches because it has been well validated for use with presence-only data and is capable of dealing with complex interactions between response and predictor variables (
 <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Elith et al., 2006</xref>) while remaining robust to small sample sizes (
 <xref rid="ref-82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wisz et al., 2008</xref>). Presence-only methods, which do not require costly and difficult-to-collect absence data (
 <xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gu &amp; Swihart, 2004</xref>), can be used to model the same environmental relationships as presence-absence methods provided that biases are accounted for (
 <xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Elith et al., 2011</xref>). This is especially useful for 
 <italic class="italic">M. fulvius</italic> because, as is the case for most snake species, they are difficult to detect due to their limited active periods and cryptic behavior (
 <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Christoffel &amp; Lepcyzk, 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Guimaraes et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, snake species are often patchily distributed and have low population sizes (
 <xref rid="ref-75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Segura et al., 2007</xref>) making it difficult to obtain robust absence data.
