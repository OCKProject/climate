<p class="p">Locality information was provided by herpetology collections from museums throughout the United States. These data were retrieved from multiple sources: the HerpNet2Portal (

The search term “
 <italic class="italic">Micrurus fulvius</italic>”, was used with no other qualifiers. Duplicate points were removed as were localities found west of the Mississippi River (as those specimens are now recognized as 
 <italic class="italic">Micrurus tener</italic>), leaving a total of 1,074 unique records collected from 35 different institutions (see the specific museum collections listed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4" class="xref">Appendix S1</xref>). All points were georeferenced and the precision of the locality data was estimated according to best practices proposed by 
 <xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chapman &amp; Wieczorek (2006)</xref>. Records outside the timeframe of the climate data (between 1950–2000) were removed (leaving 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 747). Only points with an uncertainty less than or equal to 5 km were retained for the model, which reduced the number of records to 242. This reduced number of records provided substantial geographic coverage of the entire range, with the exception of a small gap in both central and western Florida. Because there were a high number of records from within the 1950–2000 timeframe, despite many of them not meeting our stringent requirements for spatial accuracy, we included seven additional localities from these regions to provide complete coverage of the range, leaving a total of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 249 records. Preliminary models showed using occurrence data with lower uncertainty (i.e., less than 3 km) greatly reduced the number of locality points without improving model performance. Previous studies have also shown that model performance is only minimally impacted at uncertainty thresholds below 5 km (
