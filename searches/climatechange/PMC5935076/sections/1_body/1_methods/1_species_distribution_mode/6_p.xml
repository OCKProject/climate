<p class="p">Because the choice of environmental variables can influence model output, several independent models were run with different compositions of environmental variables (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Four strategies were used to select variables for each model. The first model was comprised of the full suite of variables, both bioclimatic and soil type (the Full model). However, many of the variables included in the Full model may have minimal influence and cause model overfitting (
 <xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Baldwin, 2009</xref>). Therefore, the results of the first model were used to identify variables with a significant (&gt;5%) contribution; these variables were used in the second model (the Reduced model). Finally, because of the potential for highly correlated variables, subsets of bioclimatic variables within 2 different correlation thresholds— 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> &lt; 0.7 (Moderate Correlation model) and 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> &lt; 0.5 (Low Correlation model)—were identified using SDMtoolbox. The correlation threshold of 0.7 is commonly used in niche modeling and has been well validated (
