<p class="p">Prediction success, or the percentage of occurrence points that the model correctly identifies as positive, was determined by the use of 20 additional occurrence points collected between 2001 and 2015 from museum records or directly from curators. These points were not used in the model constructions and thus provided an independent test of model results for data collected in between the two model timeframes (current and future). These points were displayed on a binary map of habitat suitability. Points that lay within the range of “suitable” habitat were predicted as true presences, while those that fell outside of the range were considered false negatives. Prediction success was then calculated by the equation

 <italic class="italic">s</italic>. = 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>∕(
 <italic class="italic">a</italic> + 
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>) where 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic> = true positives and 
 <italic class="italic">c</italic> = false negatives. Additionally, we compared the logistic output at each site under both current and future climate models using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
