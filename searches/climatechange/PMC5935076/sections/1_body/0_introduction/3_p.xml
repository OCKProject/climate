<p class="p">Despite the importance of environmental conditions on physiological performance in reptiles, relatively few studies have assessed the impact of climate change on reptile species. For example, two major reviews on distributional shifts (

 <xref rid="ref-65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Parmesan, 2006</xref>) included only two reptile species, both lizards. An additional meta-analysis (

Thus, snakes provide a unique opportunity to examine the generality of patterns in range shifts for ectotherms.
