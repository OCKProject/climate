 <italic class="italic">M. fulvius</italic> by: (1) identifying the current range and suitable environments of 
 <italic class="italic">M. fulvius</italic> in the Southeastern United States, (2) predicting future shifts in the range of 
 <italic class="italic">M. fulvius</italic> under different climate change scenarios, and (3) comparing the effectiveness of both current and future models in evaluating recent coral snake occurrences in the years between 2001â€“2015.
