<p class="p">The ranges of ectothermic taxa may be especially sensitive to the effects of climate change. In ectotherms, body temperature is either closely linked to environmental conditions, i.e.,Â poikilothemy, or is regulated behaviorally (

Because of this strong reliance on temperature and the reduced energy costs for thermoregulation predicted to occur as a result of climate change in many temperate areas, it has been hypothesized that many reptile species will show an increase in range size (
