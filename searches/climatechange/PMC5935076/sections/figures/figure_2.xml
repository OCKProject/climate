  <p class="p">Blue represents range of the eastern coral snake according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, while gray indicates the full area of study used in this research when accounting for a 200-km dispersal buffer. Points shown are occurrence records (
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 142) used to create all models. Note that ten points did not overlap with bioclim data and therefore were not used in models.
