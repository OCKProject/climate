<p class="p">For studying the change in the numbers of occupied squares species‐specifically, we used a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). In this model, species occurrence (present/absent) was studied using binomial distribution with logit function. Period (1974–1989 and 2006–2010) was regarded as a fixed effect and squares as a random effect. This analysis was carried out for 232 species.</p>
