<p class="p">In studying location of a species range in the two time periods, we used median square both latitudinally and longitudinally and calculated the possible range shift (in km) between 1974–1989 and 2006–2010. This analysis shows the median location of area of occupancy between the two periods. Only species having occupied at least five squares in both the periods were included in this analysis (
