<p class="p">Furthermore, we studied what factors explain changes in species range size. In this analysis, we used range size of species in each atlas period as a response variable, which was explained by period (1974–1989 or 2006–2010), migration strategy (resident, partial migrant, short‐distance migrant, and long‐distance migrant; see Table 
 <xref rid="ece33328-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>), and habitat preference (farmland and urban areas, forest and scrubland, wetland and lakes, Arctic mountain habitats, and archipelago, Table 
 <xref rid="ece33328-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). The interaction between period and migration strategy and period and habitat preference would test whether the range change between periods was dependent on these species traits. Species was a random factor in the model. As closely related species may have similar species traits due to common ancestor, we took phylogeny into account using phylogenic trees from 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.birdtrees.org" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.birdtrees.org</ext-link> (Jetz, Thomas, Joy, Hartmann, &amp; Mooers, 
 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). The web‐site provides alternative trees (default 100 trees) for given species, and we selected the first ten of 100 trees for our analyses. The phylogeny was included in the model so that the closely related species had less weight in the analyses (inverse of tree). We used R‐package MCMCglmm, which conducts Bayesian generalized linear mixed models with Markov chain Monte Carlo methods (Hadfield, Nutall, Osorio, &amp; Owens, 
 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>), to run the analyses (priors: list(R = list(V = 1, nu = 0.00), G = list(G1 = list(V = 1, nu = 0.02)))). We ran the full model using ten different trees and then ranked the model based on DIC‐value (similar to AIC; Burnham &amp; Anderson, 
 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). All the models were clearly within 2 ∆DIC (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33328-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>), which suggest that variation in the phylogenic tree does not make much difference. We thus selected the top ranked model (TREE9) for further analyses.
