<p class="p">We used general linear models and generalized linear mixed models in our analyses. General linear models were used in analysing changes in species richness within squares. In this analysis, fixed effects were period (1974–1989 and 2006–2010) and region (southern and northern Finland, uniform grid 710 at south‐north axis as the border line, see Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece33328-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) including the interaction term, and the dependent variable being species numbers in a square. The analysis was carried out both by including all squares with the same survey grade between the periods and by including thoroughly surveyed squares (research grade 5) only.
