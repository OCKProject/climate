<p class="p">To control for the potential impacts of variation in survey efficiency, we only included squares with at least fair surveys (2–5) in both periods (1974–1989 and 2006–2010) and with exactly the same category of survey efficiency between the two periods. Originally, there were 3,813 grid squares covering the entire country, of which 1,622 squares (42.5%) fulfilled these survey effort requirements for the comparison. Because species numbers observed affects the survey activity measured, we took into account both squares with at least fair surveys (survey grade 2–5) and squares with thoroughly surveyed squares (survey grade 5) only in our analyses.</p>
