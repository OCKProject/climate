<p class="p">However, atlas data sets often show high levels of spatial autocorrelation among grid squares situated geographically closely to each other (e.g., Dormann, 
 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Legendre, 
 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1993</xref>) thus causing pseudoreplication in sampling. To avoid this, we excluded the closest, attached squares horizontally and vertically. This would for example reduce the overlap of 1‐km buffer zone of each square with other squares by about 93%, if all squares would be considered. Due to exclusion of adjacent squares, 848 of the 1,622 squares of similar survey grade were included in the sampling procedure in the analyses, which was 22.2% of all the squares (848/3,813; see Fig.
