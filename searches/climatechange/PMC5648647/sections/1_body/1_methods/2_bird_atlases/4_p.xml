<p class="p">The breeding status of bird species recorded in each of the grid squares was assessed using four classes: 0 = not found, 1 = breeding possible (e.g., singing or displaying male observed once in a typical nesting habitat), 2 = breeding probable (e.g., singing or displaying male with a persistent territory observed, or female or pair present on more than one day in the same place, or bird observed building a nest), and 3 = confirmed breeding (Väisänen,
