<p class="p">The atlas surveys graded the survey activity in each square according to six categories: 0 = no observations, 1 = occasional observations, 2 = fair surveys, 3 = satisfactory survey of the square, 4 = well‐surveyed, and 5 = thoroughly surveyed squares (Väisänen,

 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>). This grading was developed during the second atlas (1986–1989) where observers (together with regional atlas organizer) evaluated their survey grade according to this classification, and the resulting sum of breeding status of species in each category was used as a basis to evaluate the survey grade in all the other atlases by taking into account the location (latitude) and land area (e.g., coastal areas) of each square (for details of the calculation, see Väisänen (
