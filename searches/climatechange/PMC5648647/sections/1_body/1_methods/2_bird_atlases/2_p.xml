<p class="p">We used data from three bird atlas studies carried out in Finland: Field work was carried out in 1974–1979, 1986–1989, and in 2006–2010 (Brommer et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Hyytiä, Kellomäki, &amp; Koistinen, 
 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1983</xref>; Väisänen, Lammi, &amp; Koskimies, 
 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>; Valkama, Vepsäläinen, &amp; Lehikoinen, 
 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). We pooled the information of the first two bird atlas surveys carried out in 1974–1979 and in 1986–1989 (Väisänen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>). This was performed because the third atlas in 2006–2010 was much more thorough (for categories of survey activity, see Väisänen (
 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1989</xref>)) than the first two (Valkama et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>), and atlas studies are susceptible to variations in survey effort (see Kujala et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). The second atlas was also partly concentrated on poorly studied regions of the first atlas (Väisänen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>), for which reason the first and second atlases were not comparable to the thorough third atlas. Surveys for the Finnish atlases were carried out using a uniform grid system of 10 × 10 km and the level of breeding status of bird species (recorded by bird observers), and survey activity (calculated based on number of species observations with varying breeding status included; Väisänen (
 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>); Väisänen et al. (
 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>)) in each square was recorded.
