<p class="p">Pooling the first two atlases may cause problems in observing species with high year‐to‐year variation, such as bird species of prey depending on fluctuating vole populations. The probability for a population peak year for a bird species is thus higher in the first period with more study years than in the second period. However, the second period (2006–2010) coincided with an exceptionally high vole peak in 2008–2009 with high numbers of breeding vole‐eating birds of prey over large areas in Finland (Björklund, Honkala, &amp; Saurola,
