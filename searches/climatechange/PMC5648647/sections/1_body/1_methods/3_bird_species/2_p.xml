<p class="p">We took into account in the analyses all bird species observed in at least eight squares throughout the atlases (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 235). We excluded only one species, the Arctic redpoll 
 <italic class="italic">Carduelis hornemanni</italic>, because new knowledge of the identification of the Arctic redpoll emerged between the atlases so that bird observers could identify the species more reliably (Valkama et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). However, based on genetic analyses, the species status of the Arctic redpoll is not clear (Marthinsen, Wennerberg, &amp; Lifjeld,
