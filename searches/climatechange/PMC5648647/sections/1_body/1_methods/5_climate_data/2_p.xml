<p class="p">We compared variation and trends of four climate variables known to be among the main climatic drivers affecting bird species distributions (e.g. Heikkinen, Luoto, &amp; Virkkala,

 <sub class="sub">AMJ</sub>), annual temperature sum above 5°C (growing degree days, GDD5), and annual precipitation (mm). These data for these climate variables are based on 10 × 10 km gridded data in Finland obtained from the Finnish Meteorological Institute (Tietäväinen, Tuomenvirta, &amp; Venäläinen, 
 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). We included the values of the climate variables in the study years and a year preceding each atlas study: 1973–1979, 1985–1989, and 2005–2010 (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33328-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). Both mean annual temperature and mean April–June temperature rose over 1°C during the study period. In 1984/1985 and 1986/1987, there were exceptionally cold winters in the whole of central and northern Europe which is reflected in the low mean annual temperature in 1985–1989. Number of GDD5 has increased considerably, about 18% since the 1970s, as has annual precipitation (Table
