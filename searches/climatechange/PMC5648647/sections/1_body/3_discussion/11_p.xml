 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) studied changes in functional diversity of bird species groups by 2080 at the scale of whole of Europe based on bioclimatic envelope modeling. They observed that in northern Fennoscandia (including Finland), there was a decrease in functional diversity in the avian biota which was parallel to the predicted high regional turnover of individual species resulting in substantial changes in trophic relationships. It seems that observed patterns of high bird species turnover in northern Europe give support to the prediction of possible changes in functional diversity in avian biota which would have considerable effects on ecosystem services as a whole. Moreover, high bird species turnover affects between‐species relations and may ultimately have cascading effects on the bird communities (Auer &amp; Martin,
