<p class="p">Although we did not find any change in species richness, and tried to standardize the possible differences in survey effort between the atlases and reduce the effects of spatial autocorrelation, there still is the possibility that species richness is overestimated in the last atlas compared with the earlier atlases, because the third atlas in 2006–2010 was more thorough than the pooled 1974–1989 atlases. For example, Tingley and Beissinger (
 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) observed that avian richness declined in montane areas in western USA over a period of over 100 years but only after careful incorporation of changes in species detectability. Our interpretation in the present work is that species richness has not increased, but it remains possible that richness might have declined but, however, the present method used could not detect such changes.
