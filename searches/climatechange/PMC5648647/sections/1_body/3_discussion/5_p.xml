<p class="p">Numbers of species gaining or losing range do not greatly differ between habitats when phylogeny is taken into account. This means that the high bird species turnover occurs across various habitat types. There is a slightly negative pattern in range size in the birds of Arctic mountains which include northern species and a positive pattern in the birds of archipelago. Several species, many of which are southern and large in size, have increased considerably and expanded in the archipelago including mute swan
