<p class="p">On the other hand, the decline of also many southern species suggests that many species may not track climate change due to lack of suitable habitat out (north) of their present range. For example, the skylark and many other species of agricultural areas cannot move northwards because these species breed almost exclusively on fields, and there are no suitable agricultural areas for the species in the northernmost Finland. Dispersal barriers and lack of suitable habitat in the otherwise climatically suitable new areas may considerably restrict species range shifts. For range shifts of northern‐boreal and arctic species Arctic Ocean forms, almost an impenetrable dispersal barrier probably causing the local extinction of many of these species in northern continental Europe in the 21st century (Virkkala, Heikkinen, Leikola, &amp; Luoto,

 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) may negatively affect species occurring in these habitats and thus reducing the potential species richness. Thus, climate change is not the only driver affecting range and density shifts of species but intensive land use may cause degradation of habitats restricting species shifts (see also Lehikoinen &amp; Virkkala,
