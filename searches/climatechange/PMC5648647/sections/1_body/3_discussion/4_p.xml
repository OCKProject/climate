<p class="p">In our work, we observed that species turnover is high, which also means that structure of bird communities is changing and totally new community composition may evolve. Interestingly, records from Glacial period in Northern England (55–40 kyr before present, Stewart &amp; Jacobi, 
 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) showed that there were both northern (such as willow ptarmigan/red grouse

 <italic class="italic">Grus virgo</italic> and long‐legged buzzard 
 <italic class="italic">Buteo rufinus</italic>) at the same site. Currently, these species do not have overlapping ranges, thus these ancient bird communities were nonanalogous to any present bird communities. Also in the future, novel climatic conditions will probably cause no‐analog bird communities to emerge (Stralberg et al.,
