 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) predicted the distribution of 409 European bird species based on bioclimatic modeling and observed that the range of 71% of all species would decrease by 2050. However, species richness was predicted to increase to a large extent only in northern Finland and Sweden and in northern Russia (in addition smaller areas in Iceland, in parts of Great Britain, northwestern Iberia, northern Turkey, and the Alps). Also, Huntley et al. (
 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) predicted, based on their bioclimatic model, that bird species richness would increase considerably in Finland by 2070–2099 and the richness in Finland and in the neighboring areas (parts of Sweden and northwestern Russia) being the very highest in Europe at that time. However, it may well be that the predicted increase in species richness in the northern latitudes will not be as high as forecasted, and thus, the overall decline of bird species in Europe may be even higher than that modeled by Barbet‐Massin et al.
