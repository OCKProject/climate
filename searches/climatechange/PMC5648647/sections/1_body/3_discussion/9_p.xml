 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Therefore, one would expect that species richness would already have increased in Finland between 1974–1989 and 2006–2010. One reason for the discrepancy might be that there is a time lag in the effects of climate change on species (Devictor et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). In Finland, the temperature moved on average 186 km north north‐east between 1970–1989 and 2000–2012, but mean weighted density of 128 land bird species moved only 37 km north north‐east, on average, with high between‐species variation in the direction of density shifts (Lehikoinen &amp; Virkkala,
