<p class="p">The significance of climate change affecting species distributions and population changes has been increasingly emphasized during the past decades (Bellard et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Pereira et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Sala et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>; Scheffers et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). The present data are consistent with range shifts caused by climate warming in northern Europe, but there is no increase in bird species richness, at least not at the scale of 10 × 10 km. In contrast, species turnover seems to be very high with considerable range shifts of species, and numbers of species gaining range, and species losing range being about equal. Thus, the prediction of increasing species richness with climate warming in the northern latitudes seems not to have occurred so far, and it seems that ranges of many northern species retreat as southern species expand (Brommer et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Interestingly, ranges of almost all species have changed, and range shifts occurred in different directions both latitudinally and longitudinally (see also Gillings, Balmer, &amp; Fuller, 
 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), which was also observed in shifts of mean weighted population densities (Lehikoinen &amp; Virkkala, 
 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>).
