<p class="p">Bird species numbers per square (mean ± 
 <italic class="italic">SE</italic>) was 94.71 ± 1.03 in 1974–1989 and 96.38 ± 1.08 in 2006–2010. Species numbers did not differ significantly between the two periods (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33328-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>), and the pattern was similar both in southern and northern Finland, because the interaction term between the periods and geographical regions was not significant. Apparently, species numbers in northern Finland were clearly lower than in southern Finland (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .001). If only thoroughly surveyed squares were compared, species numbers per square were 114.02 ± 1.06 in 1974–1989 and 116.64 ± 1.11 in 2006–2010 (difference non‐significant, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = .069). Four hundred and forty‐eight of 848 squares were thoroughly surveyed but most of them (343) were in southern Finland.
