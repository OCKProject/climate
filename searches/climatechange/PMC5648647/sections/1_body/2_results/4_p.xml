<p class="p">The median range of over half of the species (52.7%) shifted at least 5 km northwards, while in the longitudinal gradient 38.5% of species moved eastwards and 31.4% westwards (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece33328-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Patterns of both latitudinal and longitudinal shifts in median ranges between species having lost ranges, gained ranges, and species with no change in occupied squares differed significantly (latitudinal χ

Median ranges of species with gained ranges moved the most, on average 23.88 km northwards and 8.88 km eastwards (20°), whereas those of species having lost ranges moved on average 13.56 km northwards and 3.25 km westwards (347°), and median ranges of species with no change in numbers of occupied squares moved 8.94 km northwards and 2.2 km westwards (346°).
