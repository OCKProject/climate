<p class="p">Both migration strategy and habitat preference explained part of the variation in the species‐specific range size between the two atlas periods when phylogeny was taken into account (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33328-tbl-0003" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">3</xref>). Significant interaction between long‐distance migrants and period suggested that long‐distance migrants showed reduced range size compared to residents, but other migratory groups did not show a similar pattern (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33328-tbl-0003" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">3</xref>). In addition, significant interactions suggested that archipelago birds have increased their range size compared to farmland birds, and there was a tendency that range size of mountain birds was reduced compared to farmland species. Range sizes of species preferring other habitats (forest and wetland species) did not show any difference compared to farmland species (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33328-tbl-0003" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">3</xref>).
