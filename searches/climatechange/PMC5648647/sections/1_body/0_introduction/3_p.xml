<p class="p">Climate change is most probably the primary driver of the observed density changes and range shifts of species, but land use changes and other factors caused by humans are also highly important (see Clavero, Villero, &amp; Brotons,

 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Climate change may rapidly affect the composition of bird communities by changing species’ relative abundances (Lindström, Green, Paulson, Smith, &amp; Devictor, 
 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Population sizes of northern species are typically observed to be declining with ranges contracting while southern species are increasing in a given geographic region in northern latitudes (Virkkala &amp; Rajasärkkä, 
 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>), and species ranges appear to be moving polewards (Brommer, Lehikoinen, &amp; Valkama,
