<p class="p">Furthermore, it is important to understand what species’ traits are important in explaining the variation in species‐specific responses and thus explain the general patterns. For example, among land birds, direction and speed of the density shifts have been influenced by migration strategy and habitat preference of species (Lehikoinen &amp; Virkkala,

In addition, long‐distance migrants have in general been declining in Europe compared to other migratory groups presumably due to changes in breeding areas, in wintering areas and in migration routes (e.g. Laaksonen &amp; Lehikoinen,
