<p class="p">We studied changes in bird species richness within an area of over 300,000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, within spatial square units sampled with similar research intensity between 1974 and 2010. Variation in observation effort may seriously jeopardize the results and conclusions of atlas studies, and therefore, it is highly important to take the research intensity into account (see Kujala, Vepsäläinen, Zuckerberg, &amp; Brommer, 
 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). We studied all bird species observed as breeders to look (1) at possible changes in species richness and composition in order to evaluate whether species richness has already increased in the northern latitudes as predicted by the bioclimatic modeling (Barbet‐Massin et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Huntley et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Virkkala, Pöyry, Heikkinen, Lehikoinen, and Valkama (
 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) showed that ranges of northern bird species had already changed in the same direction as the predictions of species‐climate change models. Another essential question is (2) how many species have shifted their ranges by gaining or losing range and how these may differ between different orders, and how direction of shift differs between species gaining or losing range. (3) Moreover, we studied, whether there are any consistent patterns in the changes in species composition in relation to migratory status and habitat preference. Have resident versus migratory bird species gained or lost ranges and are there any patterns between different habitats with certain habitat including more species with expanding ranges and another including more species with contracting ranges?
