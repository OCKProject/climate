<p class="p">Here, we examined the observed changes in bird species’ distributions and numbers of squares occupied between two bird atlas (with 10 km squares) recording periods, the 1970s–1980s and 2006–2010 in Finland, covering 1,100 km in a south–north direction across the boreal zone in northern Europe. The study time span coincides with considerable warming of climate (see Table 
 <xref rid="ece33328-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>) which is also predicted to be much stronger in northern than in central and southern Europe in the 21st century. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the projected annual warming estimated by the A1B ensemble mean scenario for the end of 21st century is 5°C in the Arctic (including boreal areas), compared to 3.2–3.5°C in Europe in general (Christensen et al.,

 <xref rid="ece33328-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>) showed that climate residence time (i.e., the expected time for current climate to cross a given area) was among the lowest in protected areas of the boreal biome.
