<p class="p">The population of Bangladesh increased from around 69.84 million in 1974 to about 153.41 million in 2011 (World Bank 
 <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) and will reach 201.64 million by 2061 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>) (medium variant projection) (UNDESA 
 <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). This growth of population was largely accompanied by the high rate of total fertility (total number of children per woman) in the past few decades. The total fertility rate (TFR) was 6.8 children per woman in 1975 and decreased to 2.2 children per woman in 2014 (World Bank 
 <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). According to the United Nations (medium variant projection), TFR of Bangladesh will further decline to 1.95 children per woman by 2020 (UNDESA 
 <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). This decline in fertility was attributed to increased use of modern contraception methods, which increased from 7.7% in 1975 (Ministry of Health and Population Control [MOHPC] 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1978</xref>) to 62.4% in 2014 (National Institute of Population Research and Training [NIPORT], Mitra and Associates &amp; ICF International 
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). In 2014, unmet need for family planning (those who wanted to postpone their next child or stop childbearing but not currently practicing contraception) was 12% (NIPORT, Mitra and Associates &amp; ICF International 
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>), which was a decline from 21.6% in 1993â€“94 (NIPORT, Mitra and Associates &amp; ICF International 
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1994</xref>). In addition, infant mortality rate decreased from 74 per 1000 live births in 1970 to 38 per 1000 live births in 2010 (NIPORT, Mitra and Associates &amp; ICF International 
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>).
