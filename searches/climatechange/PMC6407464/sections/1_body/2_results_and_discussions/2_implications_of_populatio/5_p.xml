<p class="p">The human health risk is one of the potential emerging risks from climate change of the country (Kabir et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). The working-age population (15–59 years) of the country is projected (medium variant projection) to be around 65.46% by 2030 with 11.5% ageing population (60+ years) (UNDESA 
 <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Changes in the demographic structure must pose a serious disease burden on the country, such as, extreme temperatures could contribute to deaths from cardiovascular or respiratory diseases, frequent cyclones may lead to water-borne diseases and displacement of population, and so on. Climate change will also increase the risk of communicable diseases. If public health systems are inadequate or if new pathogens or vectors arise that are resistant to the country’s current methods of disease control, it may lead to declining life expectancies and diminishing economic productivity (Rahman
