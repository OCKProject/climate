<p class="p">Urban population in Bangladesh reached 55.2 million in 2015 (34.3% of total population) (World Bank 
 <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) and is likely to reach 83.2 million (45% of total population) in 2030 and 112.4 million (56% of total population) in 2050 (UNDESA 
 <xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). This rapid growth of urban population will add further strains on urban basic services such as water supply, sanitation, drainage management and even on transportation services. Urban areas of the country are already facing the challenges of accommodating the burgeoning population. As a result, most of the urban dwellers live in slums or informal settlements. The slum dwellers increased from around 18.4 million (87.3% of the total urban population) in 1990 to 29.4 million (55.1% of the total urban population) in 2014 (World Bank 
 <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). All the health outcomes for slum dwellers are poor as they live in poor housing; lack access to health facilities, pure drinking water, and sanitation; as well as poor environmental conditions. Therefore, the growth of urban poverty is now a serious development concern for the country. Climate change further multiplies the challenges associated with the rapid growth of urban population by increasing vulnerabilities of the urban dwellers, particularly for those cities located in low-lying coastal zones that are prone to sea-level rise (AFIDEP &amp; PAI 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). On the contrary, slum dwellers are highly susceptible to climate-related abnormalities such as flooding. Around 8% of urban land areas have an elevation of less than 5 million where 1.8% of countryâ€™s total population was living in 2010 (World Bank 
 <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). An increase in urban population is also associated with the horizontal expansion of urban area and encroachment of productive farmlands. The environmental stress of urban population is multiplied by the luxurious consumption patterns and use of technology (Solaiman &amp; Belal 
 <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>). Population stabilisation in both rural and urban areas is, therefore, a crucial issue for social, economic and environmental sustainability of the country.
