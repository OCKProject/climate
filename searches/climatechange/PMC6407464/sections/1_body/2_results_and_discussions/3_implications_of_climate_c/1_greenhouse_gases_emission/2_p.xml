<p class="p">It is quite evident that the largest share of GHGs emission in the atmosphere (historical and current global emission of GHGs) has been contributed by the developed countries. In 2013, United States and Bangladesh shared 4.4% and 2.2% of global population and contributed 14.5% and 0.19% of global CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions, respectively (World Bank 
 <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). In the United States, average emission of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> per person per year was over 16.4 metric tons in 2013 (World Bank 
 <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Whereas, per capita emissions of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> for a Bangladeshi was 0.44 metric tons per year in the same year (World Bank 
 <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>), which was around 1/37 the amount of an average American. Furthermore, on a global scale, the per capita emission of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> for the same year was 4.99 metric tons (World Bank 
 <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). These statistics clearly depict the geographical disparities of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emission. In contrast, the emitted CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is rapidly and evenly distributed around the globe. Methane is another GHG, which has been increasing as a result of human activities like agriculture (rice production, animal husbandry), solid waste disposal, fossil fuelâ€“related leakage associated with gas pipelines and coal mining, landfills and biomass burning. Bangladesh makes a contribution (albeit a minor one) to the yearly emission of methane because of its extensive areas of seasonally or perennially flooded land and wetland paddy cultivation, as well as its animal husbandry (Warrick et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1993</xref>). Thus, increasing concentration of GHGs should result in global warming and future climate change. In summary, the average contribution of GHGs emission from Bangladeshis is far less from Americans or even the global average. In a nutshell, increasing concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere should cause the world to warm. However, there is an uncertainty of the rate of warming. Whatever the contribution of GHGs emission and concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere of Bangladesh, climate change (because of global emission and other anthropogenic interventions) must pose a serious threat to its environmental, social and economic systems. The vicious impacts of climate change for Bangladesh would be increased flood damage to infrastructure, livelihoods and settlements; increased heat-related human mortality; and increased drought related to water and food shortage.
