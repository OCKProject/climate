 <bold class="bold">Implication on employment generation and providing livelihoods:</bold> Although the share of agriculture to GDP decreased from 59.6% in 1972 to 15.5% in 2015 (World Bank 
 <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>), still 47.5% labour force (World Bank 
 <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) of the country are engaged in this sector. Between 1990 and 2013, the arable lands of the country decreased by 19% (from 9.46 million ha in 1990 to 7.68 million hectares in 2013) and per capita arable lands decreased by 45% (from 0.089 ha/person in 1990 to 0.049 ha/person in 2013) (World Bank 
 <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Nearly 65% (105.8 million) of the population of Bangladesh was living in rural areas in 2016 and more than half of them, directly and indirectly, depend on agriculture (World Bank 
 <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Rural people mostly depend on climate-sensitive primary economic activities. Around 20% coastal land of the country will be submerged, if sea levels increas by 1 million and this situation may displace 25–30 million coastal populations (Agrawala &amp; Berg

 <xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>). The Sundarbans mangrove forest ecosystem is also extremely vulnerable to climate-induced disasters in many ways. Changes in bio-physiography of coastal regions may have an adverse impact on Sundarbans, and lives and livelihoods of millions of frontier populations (Mondal 
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). This, inundation of coastal zone (including Sundarbans) might have at least three serious negative impacts: displacement of people, shrinking precious agricultural land and above all withdrawal of people from agriculture and other nature-dependent livelihoods. Such changes may leave the poor people in poverty and ultimately the target of ‘End Poverty’ (SDG 1) and ‘End Hunger’ (SDG 2) will be diminished (UN 
 <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>). Hence, the outcome of climate change for Bangladesh is challenging because it could have negative effects on its agriculture on which the country’s economy largely depends.
