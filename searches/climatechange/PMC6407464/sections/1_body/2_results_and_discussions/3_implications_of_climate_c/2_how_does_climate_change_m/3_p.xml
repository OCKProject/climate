 <bold class="bold">GHGs emission:</bold> Agriculture is extremely influenced by climate (factors), which in turn is affected by agricultural activities through emitting GHGs. Increased concentration of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in the atmosphere could increase photosynthesis rate and efficiency of water use by plants, which may increase the growth and yield of plants (Warrick et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1993</xref>). Rice, wheat, jute and pulses would benefit by increased CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. However, increased level of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, temperature and precipitation could favour insect, pests and plants diseases. Furthermore, crop production will further decline by reduced intensity of light, increased frequency of floods and cyclones and salinity ingression by surges in the coastal zone (Warrick et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1993</xref>). With a moderate climate change scenario, the estimated crop loss because of salinity ingression in the coastal zone may be around 0.2 MT (Habibullah, Ahmed &amp; Karim
