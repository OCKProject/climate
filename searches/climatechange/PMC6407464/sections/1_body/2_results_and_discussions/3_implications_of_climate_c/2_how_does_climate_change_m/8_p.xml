<p class="p">Poverty and food insecurity are interrelated to each other in many ways. The crop production of the country will be adversely affected by climate change (Timsina et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>). Climate change may supress the target of achieving food security in Bangladesh, which further hampers the goals of 2030 global agenda through worsening achievement of ‘end poverty’ and zero hunger (UN 
 <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>). In Bangladesh, food security is synonymous with the term ‘food self-sufficiency’ (Faisal &amp; Parveen 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>). The country has achieved self-sufficiency in rice production in the recent years (Chen &amp; Lu

 <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>). The estimated food requirement by 2030 and present food production (2015–2016) of different crops have been indicated in 
 <xref rid="T0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. It is quite evident that the gap between these two periods for all crops will be enormously wide as per the projected requirement (National Agricultural Technology Project [NATP] 
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). This gap will further increase under climate change. For example, the flood of 2017 in northwestern and northeastern parts of the country has enormous implications on the impact of climate-induced disasters, which destroyed MT of rice resulting in price hike and imports of foods. Rice import in this fiscal year (2017–2018) is higher compared with the imports in the last three decades. The import of rice during the last two quarters of this fiscal year (July 2017 – December 2017) stood at 2.29 MT in contrast to 0.13 MT in the fiscal year 2016–2017 (Food Planning and Monitoring Unit [FPMU]
