 <bold class="bold">Extreme temperature:</bold> The projected temperature increases in Bangladesh for the three periods are: 0.9 °C – 1.9°C, 1.6 °C – 2.5 °C and 2.9 °C – 4.2 °C by 2030, 2050 and 2080, respectively (Ahmed &amp; Suphachalasai 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Such increase in temperature would have both positive and negative outcomes in terms of early arrival and delayed departure of monsoon season or increase in average daily rainfall receives. Moreover, higher temperatures would increase evaporation, which may lead to drought in dry season (winter season). This could increase greater dependence on groundwater extraction. In addition, increased temperatures because of global warming could adversely affect dry season crop production through shortening the winter season. In reality, higher temperatures are beneficial for

 <italic class="italic">Aman</italic> rice (rain-fed rice) and jute (monsoon crops), whereas, the yield of 
 <italic class="italic">Boro</italic> rice (irrigated rice), wheat, potato and pulses (winter or dry season crops) will be reduced because of increased winter temperatures. An increase in 4 °C temperature could decline around 28% of rice production and 68% of wheat production (Ahmed &amp; Suphachalasai 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Moreover, 
 <italic class="italic">Boro</italic> rice yield may be declined by 1.5% by 2020, 2.5% by 2030, 4.4% by 2040 and 5.4% by 2050 under projected climate change scenario (IPCC 
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). Therefore, the relation between climatic variability and agriculture is very crucial for the country because climatic factors strongly interact with crop yield.
