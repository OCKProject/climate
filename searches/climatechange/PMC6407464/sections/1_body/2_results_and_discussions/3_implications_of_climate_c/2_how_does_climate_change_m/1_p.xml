<p class="p">The shock of climate change on the globe is unevenly distributed. The awful impacts will face by developing countries because of their geography; poor coping capacities; and vulnerable social, institutional and physical infrastructures (Banuri &amp; Opschoor 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). Bangladesh, as a developing country, has undergone from conventional risk to new systematic risk like climatic change. This risk transition is very crucial for Bangladesh because climate change will increase the risk of extreme climatic events like floods, droughts and tropical cyclones. This risk transition in the form of climate change is very crucial for Bangladesh, as its economy is still pillared on climate-sensitive primary economic activities like agriculture. Food production is expected to be severely disrupted by frequent flooding in the rainy season and by drought in dry season as a result of the scarcity of water. The widespread flood in 1987, 1988, 1998 and 2004 resulted in 3927 deaths (Emergency Events Database [EM-DAT] 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>); drought of 1989 affected around 47% of land and 53% of population; and super cyclone of 1991, 2007 (Sidr) and 2009 (Aila) resulted in 143 338 deaths (EM-DAT 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) are the very recent reminder of the degree to which people of Bangladesh are susceptible to the changes in climatic variability. The 1987 flood alone caused 2055 deaths (EM-DAT 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>), inundated over 50 000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and caused damage approximating $1.0 billion (Ahmed &amp; Suphachalasai 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). The estimated damage by cyclone Sidr and cyclone Aila was around $1.7 billion and $270 million, respectively (World Bank 
 <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Drought is a slow-onset climatological event for Bangladesh (Tanner et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). Very severe droughts hit the country in 1951, 1957, 1958, 1961, 1972, 1975, 1979, 1981, 1982, 1984 and 1989 (Ahmed &amp; Suphachalasai 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). For example, the drought of 1978 and 1979 affected around 42% of the cultivable land with a decrease of around 2 million tons (MT) rice production (Brammer 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1987</xref>). Climate change will also influence basic human rights, including the rights to life, housing, food, water, health, adequate standard of living, and culture, education, and self-determination (Lofts et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). Therefore, the socio-economic and environmental cost of cyclone, drought and flood would be higher because of increased population in its floodplains. In this section, the implications of climate change on sustainable development are conceptualised (
