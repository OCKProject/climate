<p class="p">During the 20-year period between 1992 and 2013, the population of Bangladesh grew by a factor of 1.42, GDP per capita increased 3.34 fold and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emission per capita increased 2.74 fold (
 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Here, one may easily conclude population growth contributed more CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emission than GDP growth. But there continues to be a debate about whether population growth or increasing consumption levels have contributed relatively more to GHGs emission (Dietz, Rosa &amp; York 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Jiang &amp; Hardee 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>; Meyerson 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1998</xref>; Parikh &amp; Painuly 
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1994</xref>). The economy of the country is running through a process of transition (Solaiman &amp; Belal 
 <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>). In reality, GHG emissions per person depend on income, technology, demographic factors, institutional and economic factors, and a host of behavioural factors (Cohen 
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). In this regard, the result of Pearson correlation analysis on time series data (from 1972 to 2012) of population growth, GDP growth and GHGs emission was different. Results obtained from the Pearson correlation analysis (
 <xref rid="T0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>) presented three bivariate relationships. In all cases, positive correlations observed were statistically significant (i.e. population size and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions were positively correlated; population size and GDP were positively correlated; and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions and GDP were positively correlated), meaning that those variables tend to increase together (i.e. increasing GDP associated with increasing CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emission). Although the three bivariate Pearson correlation (1) population size and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.928; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01), (2) population size and GDP (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.907; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01), and (3) GDP and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.987; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01) showed very strong and positive correlations, the correlation coefficient values were not the same. The correlation coefficient between CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions and GDP was very strong compared with the other two bivariate models. This analysis identified that increase in GDP growth depends positively on the emission of GHGs. Therefore, the relationship between the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emission and economic growth has a significant implication for the environment and economy (Deviren &amp; Deviren
