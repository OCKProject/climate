<p class="p">Bangladeshâ€™s population is growing rapidly and will pass 200 million by 2045 (medium variant projection) (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division [UNDESA] 
 <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). The population of Bangladesh has almost doubled over the last 35 years, to about 160.99 million people in 2015 from 81.36 million in 1980 (World Bank 
 <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Population growth results in an increase in the absolute number of the population and an increase in the standard of living. These two determinants are associated with extraction and consumption of natural resources. The emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) is a function of total population because every mouth has to be fed. The growing population is putting stress on agricultural production systems that aim to secure food production (Vetter et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). On the contrary, food production contributes a substantial amount of GHGs, including carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), methane (CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>) and nitrous oxide to the atmosphere (Cohen

 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; Smith &amp; Martino 
 <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Steinfeld et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>; Vetter et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>; Wolf et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). Agriculture has a noteworthy contribution to ensure national food security, especially for developing countries like Bangladesh. Methane generated from agricultural practices is the second major source of GHGs emission in the world (United States Environmental Protection Agency [USEPA] 
 <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018a</xref>). Furthermore, industrialisation and development interventions contribute enormous GHGs emissions (He 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). GHGs are the most important driver of observed climate change on Earth since the mid-20th century (USEPA 
 <xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018b</xref>). In sober fact, the more population on Earth indicates more consumption and more emissions, which intensifies climate change.
