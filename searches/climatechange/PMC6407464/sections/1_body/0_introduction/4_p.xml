 <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>) proposed a sustainable development process framework of the country which sets four interrelated issues: stabilisation of population, food security, optimum uses of natural resources and growth of economy and industry. Mahtab and Karim (
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1992</xref>) set forth an analysis of agricultural carrying capacity with the projected population growth and land-use changes. All these studies, however, focused on either population or climate change. Thus, this study was an effort to investigate the implications of population growth and climate change of Bangladesh from a sustainability lens.
