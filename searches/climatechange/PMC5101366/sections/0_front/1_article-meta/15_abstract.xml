  <italic class="italic"> culicidae</italic> from different areas. Malaria is the disease with the widest distribution in the globe. Millions of people are infected every year in Africa, India, South-East Asia, Middle East, and Central and South America, with more than 41% of the global population under the risk of infestation with malaria.

In the situation presented, the establishment of the level of risk concerning the reemergence of malaria in Romania becomes a priority.
