<p class="p">In Romania, there is not a common, centralised database, where all diagnosed malaria cases are reported and also, there is no record being kept; therefore, in many cases there is the risk of having a relapse. Studies regarding the “import” of malaria in Romania have been carried out by researchers such as Neghina et al. in 2008 and 2011, the result being the same: difficulty in diagnosing the disease and in managing the important cases. The annual epidemiological report 2014, emerging and vector-borne diseases, keeps the countries which are part of the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA) updated on the situation concerning malaria, which seems to have remained stable, occurring in around one case in every 100.000 inhabitants, registering a slight decrease in 2012, in comparison with 2011 and 2010. 99% of the cases (in the case of which the origin of the disease is specified) are “imported”; these cases occurred in countries belonging to the EU and EEA (European Economic Area), which have strong traditional connections with endemic areas. In Greece, there were some autochthonous cases recorded in 2012 but less than those recorded in 2011. The autochthonous transmission of the disease in the EU remains a possibility and therefore the emphasis is placed on the necessity of having medical supervision for the important cases, training medical staff, educating the population, and improving the access to health care services for migrants. In 2012, there have been 5161 confirmed malaria cases in 25 countries from the EU and in one from Continental Europe. 85% of the cases have been reported by the following five countries: France, Great Britain, Germany, Spain, and Belgium. Most of the confirmed cases have been reported by the United Kingdom, Belgium, Ireland, and Luxembourg.</p>
