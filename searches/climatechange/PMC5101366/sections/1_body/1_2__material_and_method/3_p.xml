<p class="p">Having in mind the purpose of monitoring the influence of the environmental factors on the life cycle of the mosquito vector and on the development of the malaria pathogen inside the vector, we did an analysis of the temperatures recorded between 1961 and 2014, at five weather stations in the country (from Iaşi, Cluj-Napoca, Arad, Bucharest, and Constanţa), all information being granted by the National Weather Administration. There was also a weather forecast made for the year 2030, in order to anticipate the possibility of the malaria reemergence risk in Romania, thus associating with this one the other two essential factors: the mosquito vector and the existence of the malaria pathogen in nature.</p>
