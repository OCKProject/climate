<p class="p">Doing an extrapolation of the evolution of temperatures in 2030 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>), we can see a slight increase of temperatures by an average of 24°C in 2030, which may ensure a favourable climate for the development of Culicidae, the optimal temperatures for development being between 23 and 25°C.
