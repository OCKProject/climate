<p class="p">It is a worldwide spread disease, millions of people being affected by it every year in Africa, India, South-East Asia, the Middle East, and Central and South America, which means that almost 50% of the world's population is at risk of being infected with malaria [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Every year, millions of sick people or people carrying the disease travel to malaria-free countries, reintroducing the reemergence risk of this disease. In 2010, Snow and colleagues presented a new cartographic technique that would produce a real image of the spread of malaria worldwide. Only the health reports of 7 out of the 87 endemic countries may be considered rigorous and therefore may be used for the information they provide. There has been a quantification of the anthropic impact on the distribution of malaria in the XXth century, using the geographic information systems and historical maps for the areas with continuous transmission of the disease; this overall estimate shows that malaria prevalence is 50% bigger than that reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) and 200% bigger in the case of the areas outside Africa [

In 2006 it was proved that an increase of temperatures by 0.5°C in the mountainous areas of Africa would lead to a 100% increase of the mosquito population, which would result in a rapid spread of the disease in this area with sporadic cases as well [
