Despite the detrimental health effects of climate change, the extent to which they are actively taught and communicated to the public remains unclear. As there is limited understanding of the evidence of the teaching forms applied in climate change and health, the proposed review will address this gap, enabling the opportunity to apply them in using digital technology to encourage sustainable action.
