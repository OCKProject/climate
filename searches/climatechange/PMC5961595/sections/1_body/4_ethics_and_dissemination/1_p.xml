<p class="p">Following successful completion of the review, educational approaches applied over the last 12 years in the teaching of the health effects of climate change will be determined. The study findings will enable the understanding of improved and effective educational approaches, materials, tools and content on climate change and health that may enhance civic engagement through empowerment of the public with the required skills and tools to overcome this global challenge. In addition to developing recommendations that align the needs of learners and educators, approaches for vulnerable populations, which remain to be targeted, will be considered and disseminated. The results will be used by the EIT Health-Knowledge and Innovation Communities to assist in the development of a forthcoming MOOC on the health effects of climate change.</p>
