<p class="p">Systematic scoping reviews aim to rapidly synthesise evidence on crucial concepts associated with broad research topics in addition to identifying the central sources and forms of evidence available. Despite methodological frameworks developed by Arksey and Oâ€™Malley

 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref> Systematic scoping reviews are beneficial in areas with emerging evidence, where evidence paucity prevents execution of systematic reviews.

The flexibility of this review method will allow the authors to broadly explore the literature on the learning methods used to educate learners on the relationship between climate change and health between 2005 and 2017, while structuring findings in a repeatable manner.
