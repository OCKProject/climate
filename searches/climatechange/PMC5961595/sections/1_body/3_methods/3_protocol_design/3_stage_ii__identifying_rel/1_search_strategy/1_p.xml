<p class="p">The following electronic databases will be systematically searched: MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Education Resource Information Centre, Web of Science, Global Health, Health Management Information Consortium, Georef, Ebsco and PROSPERO. Following the development of MeSH terms, subject headings and keywords used to index articles, the search strategy will be reviewed by an Imperial College medical librarian. Search terms will include MeSH and keywords related to (1) teaching, (2) learning, (3) education, (4) climate change and (5) health. Publication status, publication date and language will be subjected to limits. Hence, searches will be restricted to papers published in English between 2005 and 2017. As minimal attention was attributed to the public health implications of climate change before 2005,

Following the MEDLINE/PubMed search, the search strategy will be converted and applied to the remaining databases. Details pertaining to the review’s searching strategy for MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase and Scopus may be found in online

Additional search strategies may be requested at a later stage (once completed) from the review’s first author. Results of the database searches will be subsequently imported to EndNote, a bibliographic software. Bibliographic citations of included studies will be searched to identify any additional relevant studies.
