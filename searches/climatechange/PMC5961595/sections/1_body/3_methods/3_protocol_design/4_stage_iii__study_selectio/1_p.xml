 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> outlines the study’s inclusion criteria. Based on the review’s predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria, titles and abstracts of papers will then be independently screened by two reviewers, to ensure no bias occurs.
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref> Ineligible papers will be eliminated. Titles and abstracts that appear to meet the review’s eligibility criteria will be subjected to full-text reading. A third reviewer will assist in the selection process if the two primary reviewers cannot reach a consensus on study eligibility. A PRISMA flow diagram will be used to demonstrate the review’s selection process and exclusion reasons, demonstrating replicability and transparency. This stage will represent an iterative process, incorporating search of the literature, refinement of search strategies and selection of articles.
