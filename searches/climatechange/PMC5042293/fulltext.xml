Reduction in emissions is a key issue for limiting global warming to no more than 2&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, and preferably to 1.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. The way to reach this goal involves many players and actions. It is obvious that industrial biotechnology can provide important tools in the ambitions to reduce global warming. Several of the areas industrial biotechnology is addressing today will be important technologies:<list list-type="simple"><list-item id="lsti0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Biofuels</p></list-item><list-item id="lsti0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Biochemicals and materials from renewable resources</p></list-item><list-item id="lsti0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Water treatment &#x02212; both for consumption and wastewater</p></list-item><list-item id="lsti0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Agriculture</p></list-item><list-item id="lsti0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Solid waste handling</p></list-item><list-item id="lsti0030"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Environmental biotechnology for pollution reduction</p></list-item></list></p><p>All of these issues are a global concern, and it is therefore important that information on progress in key technologies becomes rapidly and efficiently available to all scientists. This is of critical importance for scientists in countries that either lack or have a poorly developed infrastructure for research. Many of these countries are in the tropical belt, where biomass is frequently abundant. To utilize emerging information in handling these resources efficiently, thereby mitigating release of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from decomposing biomass would be doubly beneficial.</p><p>Besides the biomass produced as waste material in agriculture, there are enormous amounts of biomass in municipal solid waste as well in industrial waste.</p><p>Efficient use of biomass will contribute to a cleaner environment by producing value added compounds to replace substances of fossil fuel origin. This in turn helps to reduce release of GHG.</p><p><italic>Biotechnology Reports</italic> covers all of these areas of importance for future technological developments. The fact that <italic>Biotechnology Reports</italic> is an open access journal makes it possible for anyone who has access to the internet to download valuable papers on technologies to safeguard our future climate. We welcome papers in all areas of biotechnology, but we particularly welcome papers dealing with the topics listed above.
