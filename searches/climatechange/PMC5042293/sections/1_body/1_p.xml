<p class="p">All of these issues are a global concern, and it is therefore important that information on progress in key technologies becomes rapidly and efficiently available to all scientists. This is of critical importance for scientists in countries that either lack or have a poorly developed infrastructure for research. Many of these countries are in the tropical belt, where biomass is frequently abundant. To utilize emerging information in handling these resources efficiently, thereby mitigating release of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from decomposing biomass would be doubly beneficial.</p>
