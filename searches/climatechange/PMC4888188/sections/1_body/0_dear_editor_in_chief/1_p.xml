Direct impact of climate change on agricultural production and the food system as a whole is in turn expected to translate into increasing prevalence of malnutrition. Thus, climate change has an indirect impact on nutrition insecurity and a more direct impact on food availability and access depending on the type of livelihood system people are relying on (
