<p class="p">The scale of municipality was chosen because this is the smallest political-administrative unit in Brazil. Likewise, most of the data used in the study is available only on this scale of analysis. Focusing on municipality as a unit helps to identify local weaknesses and potentialities, as well as to compare vulnerabilities observed in each componentâ€“exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity and climate. For decision makers or state managers this is of particular relevance because these are the spheres from which financial resources are distributed to municipalities. Vulnerability mapping, therefore, allows the state to understand by which aspects the regions and their municipalities are most vulnerable, and thus allocate the resources as needed.</p>
