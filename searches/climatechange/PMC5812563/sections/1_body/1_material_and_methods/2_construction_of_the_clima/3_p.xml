<p class="p">Extreme climate indicators were constructed considering the absolute difference between the climatic parameters generated by Eta-HadGem-ES for the future climate slice (2041–2070) and the current slice (1961–1990). These indicators were generated with the assistance of the FClimDex program, and were the following: total annual rainfall for rainy days (i.e., days when rainfall is greater than or equal to 1 mm; PRCPTOT); total annual rainfall on days when rainfall is greater than that of the 95th percentile of the rainy days (R95p); monthly maximum consecutive 5-day precipitation (Rx5day); maximum number of consecutive dry days for the year, (i.e., days on which rainfall is less than 1 mm; CDD) and annual mean maximum (TMAXmean) and minimum (TMINmean) temperatures, in degrees Celsius.</p>
