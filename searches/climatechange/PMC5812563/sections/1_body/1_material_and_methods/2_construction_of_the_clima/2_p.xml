<p class="p">Regarding the emission scenarios, Representative Concentration Pathways coming from the last IPCC assessment report—AR5 were used (IPCC 2013). The RCP refers to the number of radiative forcing measured in watts per square meter per year by 2100. The scenarios generated by IPCC are named according to their radiative forcing as follows: RPC2.6 (2.6 Wm-2), RCP4.5 (4.5 Wm-2), RCP6.0 (6.0 Wm-2) and RCP8.5 (8.5 Wm-2). The RCP8.5 combines, among other factors, high population growth, high energy demand, and high GHG emissions in the absence of climate change policies, corresponding to the RCP with the highest greenhouse gas emissions. This scenario includes radiative forcing beyond 8.5 W/m

Considering the RCP8.5 as a pessimistic scenario and that shorter time periods are more appropriate for proposing and articulating public policies, the outputs of the Eta-HadGem-ES model considering the RCP8.5 were used for the period of 2041–2070.
