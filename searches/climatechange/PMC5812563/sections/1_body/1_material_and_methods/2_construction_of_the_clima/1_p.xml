<p class="p">Climatic data were made available by the INPE (National Institute of Space Research) and corresponded to the outputs of the climate model Eta-HadGem2-ES, which produces simulations of the current (1961–1990) and the future climate (2011–2040, 2041–2070, 2071–2100) considering the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) from the IPCC’s Fifth Report. The model Eta-HadGem2-ES corresponds to the regionalized model (Eta) nested within the global model HadGem-ES and presents a horizontal regular grid of 20km throughout South America. The regionalized model Eta exhibited strong agreement with the observational data of precipitation for South America and thus can be used for studies on climate change in Brazil [
