<p class="p">In vulnerability studies, exposure and sensitivity are considered to have the potential to increase the vulnerability of a system, while adaptive capacity the potential to decrease it. This logic was adopted in the present study. However, in view of the need to make information comprehensible to managers and decision makers, it was decided that the assignment of scores to variables would follow the same rationale for all indicators of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. In such a manner, having to interpret the indices of adaptive capacity in an inverse way was avoided, thereby simplifying the understanding of this component by decision makers and managers. Thus, for all indicators, scores were assigned considering whether the assessed characteristic increased or decreased vulnerability of the population. Therefore, in the adaptive capacity indices shown in

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190808.s008" class="xref">S2</xref> Tables, the highest values represented the most vulnerable (least adapted) municipalities, while the lowest values represented the least vulnerable (most adapted) municipalities.
