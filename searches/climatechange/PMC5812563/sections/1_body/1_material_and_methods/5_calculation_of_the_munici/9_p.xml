<p class="p">This measure has the primary role of allowing the comparison among municipalities over time and space, since it allows both the observation of changes in current vulnerability according to future climate change, as well as the disaggregation of the main indices to explore which conditions most influenced their vulnerability. The method also enables the ranking of the municipalities according to their observed vulnerabilities, thereby providing a consistent and transparent methodology for the comparative assessment of the vulnerability of human populations to regional environmental changes. At the end, the indices developed (MVI, VInd and CSI) resulted in a relative measure of municipal vulnerability ranging between 0 and 1. For all indices, the intervals between 0 and 1 corresponded to: 0 to 0.2 (low); 0.201 to 0.400 (medium-low); 0.401 to 0.6 (medium); 0.601 to 0.8 (medium-high) and 0.801 to 1 (high).</p>
