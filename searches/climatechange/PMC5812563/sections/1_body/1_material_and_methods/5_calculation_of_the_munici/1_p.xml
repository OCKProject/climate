<p class="p">A synthetic indices approach was used to measure vulnerability, which is based on the selection of some indices from a potential set of variables, that are then systematically combined to generate levels of vulnerability [
 <xref rid="pone.0190808.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. This approach was chosen over evaluation modeling because 1) the results achieved are quite similar, and 2) for many developing countries, such as Brazil, the technical requirements, the availability of data and the financial resources needed to perform evaluation modeling are scarce or nonexistent [
 <xref rid="pone.0190808.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. For calculation of vulnerability, all the indicators were assumed to have equal importance, thus they have not received a priori weights [
 <xref rid="pone.0190808.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The scale of analysis was that of the municipality.
