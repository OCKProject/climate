<p class="p">Calculation of MVI involved three distinct steps: 1) attribution of gradual scores to the variables presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0190808.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>; 2) aggregation of the scores using arithmetic mean and subsequent standardization to form the indices shown in the orange boxes of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190808.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref> and in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0190808.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>; and 3) combination of the indices using the same procedures used for arithmetic mean and standardization. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190808.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref> shows the steps of calculating all indicators and indices used in the present work, as well as the successive aggregation of these indices to generate the MVI.
