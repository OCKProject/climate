<p class="p">The present study constructed a Municipal Vulnerability Index (MVI) for the municipalities of the state of Amazonas, Brazil, from the successive aggregations of indices and sub-indices related to exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity and climate conditions of the territories. MVI represents, synthetically, the relationship between the current vulnerability, represented by the Vulnerability Index (VInd), and the future climate change, represented by the Climate Scenario Index (CSI), in a gradient between 0 and 1. Thus, 0 represents the lowest and 1 the highest vulnerability observed among the evaluated municipalities for all the indices.
