<p class="p">The first step was to attribute gradual scores, which represent vulnerability to the indicators shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0190808.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. Municipal variables were divided into groups for assigning scores so that the municipalities could receive a range of vulnerability scores. Each variable was analyzed individually and divided into percentilesâ€”p5, p25, p75, p95 were used in most cases, but specificities as to the percentiles used can be seen in the 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190808.s013" class="xref">S7 Table</xref>. For each interval a score ranging from 0 to 4 was assigned, where 0 was attributed to the least vulnerable group and 4 was attributed to most vulnerable group of municipalities, according to the rationale explained in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0190808.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The division into classes for assignment of scores is done to allow the aggregation of variables that are in different units of measure. After the assignment of scores, all variables possess the same scale unit. For qualitative variables (present in some adaptive capacity indicators) values were arbitrarily applied as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190808.s014" class="xref">S8 Table</xref>. Scoring was done considering the values for each variable in all 62 municipalities.
