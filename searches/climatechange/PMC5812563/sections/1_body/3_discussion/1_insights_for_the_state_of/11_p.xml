<p class="p">Ultimately, the MVI demonstrated the northern, northeastern, and south-southwestern regions of the state to be the most vulnerable to future climate change, considering current socio-environmental conditions. However, the spatial distribution of vulnerability was quite different between MVI and CSI, suggesting that the areas most impacted by climate are not, necessarily, more vulnerable from the socio-environmental perspective. These findings are corroborated by other studies about vulnerability to climate in Brazil [

The microregions of Purus and Boca do Acre, in the south-southwestern region, had similar values for vulnerability and climate indices, whereas other regions, such as Rio Preto da Eva, Itacoatiara, and Manaus (northeastern), showed the climate index to be more important for the definition of MVI. Regarding Manaus, Torres et al. [
