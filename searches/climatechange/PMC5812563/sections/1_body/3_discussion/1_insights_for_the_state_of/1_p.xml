<p class="p">The results of the present study demonstrate that current vulnerability, represented by the VInd, was quite heterogeneous, with the lowest values concentrated in the central region, and increasing vulnerability radiating outward towards the southern extreme, and eastern and northern regions. Some of the microregions identified as the most vulnerable by the VInd (i.e., Purus and Boca do Acre) were similar to those indicated by the Amazon Social Progress Index study [

Although the Amazon Social Progress Index did not consider a monetary dimension in its construction, as was the case with VInd, the overlap of microregions from the both studies is indicative of social and poverty issues as preponderant factors in determining the current vulnerability of the population of Amazonas.
