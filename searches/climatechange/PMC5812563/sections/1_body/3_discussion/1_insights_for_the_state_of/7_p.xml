A recent study on the vulnerability of Brazilian municipalities to the increase in flood and landslide events showed that the western portion of Amazonas can anticipate increased flood-related vulnerability ranging from 4% to more than 30%, considering the HADGEM-ES climatic model in a pessimistic emission scenario (RCP8.5) [

As for landslides, starting from the same scenario and climatic model, the study showed that the entire state of Amazonas, except for small extensions in the extreme north and east, could experience increased vulnerability until the end of the century of between 3% and more of 30%.
