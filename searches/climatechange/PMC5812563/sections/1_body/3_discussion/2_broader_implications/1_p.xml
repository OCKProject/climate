<p class="p">Although the conditions that affect people's vulnerability profiles are determined by local interactions, which is reflected in dramatically different responses throughout the world to the same climate stimulus, some conditions are considered “generic” determinants of vulnerability and are closely related to developmental issues (e.g., poverty, governance, health) [
 <xref rid="pone.0190808.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Interestingly, findings from the present study show that some generic issues, namely poverty (sensitivity index) and sociopolitical organization (adaptive capacity index), as well as the climate scenario, were the main aspects influencing vulnerability of the municipalities of Amazonas (MVI). These generic aspects demonstrate that, although vulnerability assessments are often based on intricate methods of analysis, due in part to the complexity of interactions, short-term actions to reduce vulnerability in developing countries should focus on improving quality of life and coping skills of the population, along with tackling problems with risk on a local-basis. This aspect is reviewed by Brooks et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0190808.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], who state that addressing issues of health, education and governance would improve adaptation, specific measures and technologies should also be promoted among specific localities or population groups.
