<p class="p">Regarding climate, the results presented here highlight that the incorporation of CSI substantially rose the vulnerability scores from the VInd to the MVI, showing that the climatic issue needs to be specifically addressed and is of crucial importance in differentiating the relative vulnerability to climate change presented by the municipalities. Oâ€™brien et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0190808.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] have shown that the districts with greater sensitivity to climate in India were not those considered more vulnerable, mainly due to varying levels of adaptive capacity. Using the Socio-climatic Vulnerability Index, Torres et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0190808.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] reported similar findings for some metropolitan areas in Brazil. These authors showed that high population densities were an important factor in making cities with moderate expected climate change highly vulnerable to future climate changes.
