<p class="p">Thus, it is possible that MVI can be used simultaneously as a diagnostic and planning tool, in the same way that Cannon et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0190808.ref097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">97</xref>] demonstrated for CVA. As a diagnostic tool, the indices created can help to (i) understand the problems and underlying the causes of vulnerability, and to (ii) highlight priority areas for reducing vulnerability, as well as what actions should be taken (e.g. reducing deforestation, improving social indicators). As a planning tool, the MVI methodology may, in addition to helping prioritize actions, allow the dynamic monitoring of proposed future adaptation actions, since the constructed indices can be systematically updated.
