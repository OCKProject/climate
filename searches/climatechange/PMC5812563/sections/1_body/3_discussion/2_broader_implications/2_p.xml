<p class="p">The aspects of governance and institutional capacity, for example, are considered a challenge in vulnerability assessments and for the implementation of effective strategies for adaptation at the local level. On the one hand, governance and social capital are difficult to measure because they are highly variable factors among populations, and present structural dimensions that are still barely visible or poorly understood [

In Brazil, there is evidence of positive impacts from the participation of civil society in municipal councils and the cooperation between local governments through consortia for provisioning basic services to the population [

On a local-basis, these agencies represent possible channels of communication between the population and the public power, established by the law, which may assist in voice and accountability issues. This shows the key role of those institutions in meeting popular demands and better allocating public resources. Moreover, these findings reiterate that the existence of these institutions is a viable step towards articulating the best policy of the population to the local government. However, there is no doubt that the present method does not allow a thorough evaluation of the quality of the institutional articulation promoted between these bodies and the population, which calls for new ways of thinking about the evaluation of aspects of governance as capable of increasing the adaptive capacity in local contexts.
