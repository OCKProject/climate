<p class="p">As demonstrated by Engle &amp; Lemos [
 <xref rid="pone.0190808.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], from a policy perspective, decision makers are interested in identifying specific characteristics of the system on which they can work. Thus, the analysis of the vulnerability indicators proposed herein, and in other studies, lead to policy recommendations that depend directly on the local perspective [

These relativizations are important to ensuring that decision makers can use the information produced in a relevant and practical way. In the present work, the disaggregation of the indices allows for a detailed analysis to identify specific actions and priority areas for intervention, mainly through the mapping of the results, since stakeholders and decision makers can systematically identify and evaluate the spatial distribution of the likely vulnerabilities. The disaggregation of the indices allows for a detailed analysis to identify specific actions and priority areas for intervention. For example, the results for the microregion of Boca do Acre showed that it possessed the highest current vulnerability status due to poor performance in adaptive capacity, particularly due to low socio-political organization (

On the other hand, the microregion of Tef√© presented the lowest value for the present vulnerability, but with a worse or similar performance in the components of the sensitivity index when compared to the microregion of Boca do Acre, especially regarding the diseases associated with climate index. This possibility of disaggregating the indices and analyzing them individually, either by microregion or by municipality, makes the MVI a useful tool for planning actions in the medium and long term that are adapted to the local reality. In addition, the use of systematic information allows constantly feeding the database and to evaluate the modification of the conditions of vulnerability and/or actions implemented over time.
