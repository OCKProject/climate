<p class="p">The state of Amazonas, Brazil, exhibits the same social and environmental patterns observed in other regions of the Amazon. The state is, for the most part, covered by forest and faces important issues related to: 1) land use policies associated with farming and the construction of roads and hydroelectric dams; 2) health, due to high incidence rates of infectious diseases and the need to adapt infrastructure to peculiar socio-spatial conditions—mobility is primarily fluvial; and 3) the social vulnerability of the traditional population prevalent in the State and dependent on extractivism and family farming [

 <xref rid="pone.0190808.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. These conditions give rise to a peculiar sociodemographic situation in the state, mainly related to the influence of its large rivers and extensive forests. The construction of urban environments amid the world’s largest tropical rainforest exhibits nuances that extrapolate demography and are conditioned by the flood regime of the main rivers, such as the Solimões and Amazonas [

 <xref rid="pone.0190808.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. These aspects of the climate, coupled with the dependence of the population of Amazonas on ecosystem services, constitute a scenario of threat to human well-being, which can be aggravated by the poor social indicators of the region.
