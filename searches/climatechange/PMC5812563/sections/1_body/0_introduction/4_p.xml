<p class="p">The Amazon Region has been facing challenges inherent to the development projects taking place in the countries that comprise it, such as combining the need to promote social and economic progress with environmental conservation, which includes climatic issues. On the one hand, ecosystems of the Amazon are important strongholds of biodiversity and natural resources and play an active role in biosphere-atmosphere exchange on both regional and global scales, and thus serve an essential function in climatic balance [

On the other hand, the socioeconomic conditions of human populations in the Amazon are at a great disparity with national averages of their respective countries, which is even more severe when analyzed from the perspective of traditional populations, whose estimated contingent is 1.6 million people [

Overcoming this condition finds obstacles in the current anthropic pressures placed upon the Amazon due to the expansion of agriculture and “economic development”—both have profoundly reduced biodiversity, cultural assets and ecosystem services. The effects of the combination of these elements with global climate change are apparent in the region. In the case of the Brazilian Amazon, the last 10 years have experienced the most severe events of the century related to droughts (2005 and 2010) and floods (2009 and 2012) due to changes in rainfall in the Amazon Basin [
