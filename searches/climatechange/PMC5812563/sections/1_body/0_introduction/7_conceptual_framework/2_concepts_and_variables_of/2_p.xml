<p class="p">The variables chosen to compose the methodological scheme possessed the following criteria: 1) should be mainly of free access; and 2) should be systematically updated.

 <xref rid="pone.0190808.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0190808.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0190808.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0190808.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. All variables passed through validation by a panel of experts comprising managers, decision makers, non-governmental organizations and researchers from various parts of the country who had expertise in the thematic areas studiedâ€“disasters, social indicators, adaptation, climatology and health, among others. After this first evaluation, successive meetings were held in the state of Amazonas, as well as in the other states that were part of the national project, to discuss the reliability and adequacy of the indicators relative to local reality.
