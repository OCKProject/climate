<p class="p">For sensitivity (the degree to which a system is affected, either adversely or beneficially, by climate-related stimuli [
 <xref rid="pone.0190808.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]), some conditions intrinsic to the municipalities that may make them more susceptible to climate impacts were considered. The focus was on the susceptibility of the population, hence the variables to be chosen to compose the sensitivity index should reflect inequities in the process of socioeconomic development, since this engenders conditions of social marginalization and generates some social groups that are more vulnerable to climate and its impacts than others. The factors considered were those related to climate-sensitive diseases, which may be affected by expected changes in temperature and precipitation; those related to human poverty, in their monetary and non-monetary dimensions; and, finally, those related to the sociodemographic characteristics of the population. All of the indicators selected to comprise sensitivity have been associated with increased vulnerability and have been related with the indirect effects of climate resulting from possible damage that may occur to specific groups of populations (e.g elderly, people with disabilities, women lacking education).
