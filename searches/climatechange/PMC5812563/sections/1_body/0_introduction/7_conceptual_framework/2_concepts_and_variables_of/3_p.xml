 <xref rid="pone.0190808.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>] (the nature and degree to which a system experiences environmental or socio-political stress systems), two factors were considered in the present evaluation. The first, essentially environmental, considers the relevance of the Amazonian ecosystem to the resident population (ecosystem services) and to the regional dynamics of the terrestrial-atmosphere energy flux, using as proxy the extension of vegetation cover and the area of deforestation in recent years. The assumption here is that the maintenance of the natural environment makes the municipality less exposed to the effects of climate change due to the conservation of associated ecosystem services (e.g. temperature control, air quality, clean water, among others). Stress or destruction of ecosystems can increase the physical vulnerability of human settlements as well as reduce the possibilities for traditional populations (e.g. riverine) to adequately exploit livelihoods, including alternative food sources. The second important factor evaluated was exposure to risk of hydrometeorological disasters, a phenomenon provided by both social and environmental conditions and related to climate variability. This exposure was assessed through the susceptibility to disasters and also by historical records of occurrence of such events. Exposure indicators were positively related to vulnerability.
