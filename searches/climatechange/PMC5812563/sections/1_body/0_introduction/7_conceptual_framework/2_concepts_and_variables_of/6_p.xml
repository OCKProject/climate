<p class="p">A future climate component was associated with the other basic elements of vulnerability to represent the extent to which the municipalities could be impacted by the predicted climate change in the state of Amazonas. Thus, the present study evaluated possible future climate change (2041–2070) in relation to the present (1961–1990), as projected by the model ETA-HadGem-ES considering climatic parameters related to temperature and precipitation. These data were municipalized for the entire state of Amazonas (see “Construction of the Climate Scenario” section) to serve as a predictor of the occurrence of climatic extremes in the near future. The assumption was that areas with the greatest predicted changes in temperature and precipitation would be those most exposed to climatic hazards.
