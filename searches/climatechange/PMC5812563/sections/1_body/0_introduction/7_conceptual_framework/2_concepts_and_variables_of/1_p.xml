<p class="p">The present work comprises the unfolding of a national-scale project whose objective was to construct indicators of vulnerability for some Brazilian municipalities, in the context of climate change, in order to support future adaptive actions. Financed by public resources (Ministry of Environment), a Municipal Vulnerability Indicator was built for six Brazilian states and their municipalities, including the state of Amazonas. The methodology was designed to be easily-executed by local managers, and so that the constructed indices could be promptly interpreted and updated, thus allowing the monitoring of the vulnerability profile of the municipalities of Amazonas over time. In the end, the focus of the study was to estimate how climate change may influence the vulnerability of the state of Amazonas considering its current socio-environmental conditions.</p>
