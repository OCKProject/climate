<p class="p">It was assumed that the human populations at each location are subjected to multiple and specific tensions that combine with each other to determine climate impacts on a regional scale, with feedback between human and natural systems. Considering that the division between these systems is only arbitrary, since anthropic actions and social structure are not dissociated from the natural environment, the present study considered the “municipality” as the unit of analysis since it represents an integrated system in which impacts will occur [

In this sense, the present work has developed a conceptual framework for the municipalities of the state of Amazonas, which considers systems that possess some peculiar characteristics that shape their vulnerability profile and that may be exacerbated by future climate change (
