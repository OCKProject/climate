 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190808.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>, the circle represents a system, such as a municipality, in which various physical, natural, economic, social, political and structural conditions shape the vulnerability profile of a municipality. This profile is, somehow, determined by exposure and sensitivity, since these components contribute to determining the magnitude of the potential impacts of future climate change. The magnitude of impacts may depend on the capacity of a population and of its municipality to cope with the adverse effects of climate. The adaptive capacity is strictly linked to the sensitivity of the system, since this component includes certain characteristics intrinsic to a population that determine its ability to recover from impacts. Thus, the vulnerability profile constructed may be altered by the influence of climate change, here represented by gradual alterations in temperature and precipitation over time (from the present to the period of 2041â€“2070).
