<p class="p">Multiple processes emerge from the varied socio-environmental and economic developmental conditions, as well as particular climate threats of each locality. Thus, this study encompassed these processes and factors in three basic components of vulnerabilityâ€“exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. Exposure concerns the nature and intensity of environmental and socio-political stress experienced by a system, encompassing both long-term changes in climatic conditions and the variability represented by extreme events [

 <xref rid="pone.0190808.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. In this work, exposure was considered in two temporal spaces, the present and future. Present exposure was represented by biophysical conditions related to the environment and hydrometeorological disasters. Future exposure was represented by climatic projections of the regional model ETA-HADGEM-ES (long-term changes). According to McCarthy [
 <xref rid="pone.0190808.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>], sensitivity is the degree to which a system can be affected by climate change, whether directly or indirectly, and is related to the intrinsic characteristics of the impacted system. The present study worked with the indirect effects of climate resulting from the possible damage that can occur, more specifically on specific population groups, due to either their social or financial condition. Adaptive capacity is related to the ability of populations to adjust to possible damage and respond to the consequence of climate impacts [
