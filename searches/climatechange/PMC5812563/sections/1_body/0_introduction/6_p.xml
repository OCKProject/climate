<p class="p">Understanding the weaknesses and capabilities of the municipalities of the state of Amazonas to respond to climate change, considering the Brazilian context, is the first step towards enhancing and preparing populations to cope with climate hazards. Therefore, aiming to support future adaptation policies for local populations, this study presents a method to map human vulnerability to climate change in the state of Amazonas, Brazil. To do so, the Municipal Vulnerability Index was constructed, which combines regionalized climate scenarios with socioeconomic, demographic, environmental and health conditions of populations in order to better understand and compare vulnerability profiles of the 62 municipalities of the state of Amazonas. These results are expected to provide a better understanding of the weaknesses and potentialities of municipalities to deal with climate impacts, given that some characteristics, such as climatic conditions and health infrastructure, are distributed in a very heterogeneous way even among municipalities of the same state.</p>
