<p class="p">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines vulnerability as “the propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected” [
 <xref rid="pone.0190808.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>], which encompasses the basic components of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. These three components are capable of influencing vulnerability and may increase or decrease it according to characteristics inherent to the human or natural system of interest. In recent years, vulnerability analysis has followed a multifactorial approach that incorporates distinct social, political, economic and environmental conditions, including future climate change scenarios [

Among the advantages that understanding the geography of vulnerability to climate change provides are enhanced disaster risk management; reduced exposure of human and ecological assets; and identification of particularly vulnerable populations [
