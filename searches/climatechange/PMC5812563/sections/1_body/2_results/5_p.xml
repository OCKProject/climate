<p class="p">The temperature and precipitation indices for the emission scenario RCP 8.5 were used to develop the CSI, and its average value was considered medium-high (0.630). By disaggregating the components of CSI, both temperature and precipitation anomalies could be seen to have contributed similarly to the final value of the index. However, the value of the precipitation index (0.590) was slightly greater than that of the temperature index (0.581). In general, the climate change projections related to both parameters were not uniform for the state (

There was more homogeneity for the anomalies of minimum temperature, although the increases tended to be less pronounced, with the northeastern region again having the highest average increases for minimum temperature (

The state capital, Manaus, and its metropolitan region, located in the northeastern portion of Amazonas, as well as the northern and southwestern regions, were among the most vulnerable regarding climate (
