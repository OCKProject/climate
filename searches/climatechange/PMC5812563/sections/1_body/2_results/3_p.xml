 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190808.g007" class="xref">Fig 7B</xref> illustrates the performance of the municipalities, in average values, in the indices that compose exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. The SOI was one of the components where the municipalities had the poorest results, followed by the PoI. The lowest mean values were observed in the Vegetation Cover Index (VCI), where the state showed a reduced vulnerability for almost all the municipalities.
