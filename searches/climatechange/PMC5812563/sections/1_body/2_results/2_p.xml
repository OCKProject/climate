<p class="p">The distribution of the exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity indices for each microregion are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190808.g006" class="xref">Fig 6</xref>. The exposure index was the main factor influencing current vulnerability (VInd) in the microregions of Rio Preto da Eva, Itacoatiara, Madeira, and Manaus, when compared to the sensitivity and adaptive capacity indices. In the Rio Preto da Eva, Madeira and Manaus microregions, this finding may be attributed to the greater occurrence and susceptibility to natural disasters, while in the Itacoatiara microregion, the vegetation cover and deforestation index had greater influence (

The sensitivity had the greatest role in increasing the current vulnerability of the microregions of Juruá, Tefé, and Purus, due to the high indices observed for poverty conditions (PoI). Finally, the microregions where adaptive capacity were most important were Alto Solimões, Boca do Acre, Coari, Japurá, Parintins, and Rio Negro, all of which had high vulnerability values for the Sociopolitical Organization Index (SOI) and Socioecomic Structures Index (SEI).
