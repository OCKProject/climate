<p class="p">The results presented here are a pioneering attempt to evaluate the social-environmental and health vulnerability of the population of the state of Amazonas to the impacts of climate change. The major contributions of this study are the development of a set of indicators adapted to the reality of Brazil and the mapping of the vulnerabilities of the municipalities of the state of Amazonas using a climatic perspective. The results have shown that a first step towards making the population of Amazonas better prepared to cope with climate impacts would be the improvement of their life and health conditions, as poverty was one of the factors that most influenced the current vulnerability of the municipalities.</p>
