  <title class="title">Conceptual framework showing the relationships among vulnerability components.</title>
  <p class="p">The circle represents a municipality in which the conditions of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity determine the vulnerability profile of the population. The boxes exemplify some of the conditions considered critical for each vulnerability component; the green box is related to exposure, the yellow box to sensitivity and the orange box to adaptive capacity. Climate risk is represented by future climate change. (Adapted from Allen Consulting Group, 2005).</p>
