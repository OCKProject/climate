It follows the achievements and socioeconomic challenges of Brazil through the prism of municipal competence on a regular basis since 2008, and makes it possible to determine, with precision, whether the relative improvement experienced by a given municipality is the result of the adoption of specific policies. The FMDI varies between 0 and 1, where 0 represents the least developed and 1 the most developed municipality. This reasoning is opposite to that applied to vulnerability logic. Thus, for the construction of the Socioeconomic Structures Index (SEI), the reverse of FMDI was used, since the attributed scores followed the reasoning of vulnerability—if the city had high FMDI, it was considered more adapted and less vulnerable.
