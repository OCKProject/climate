 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. These studies develop either a process-based or empirical relationship between climate variables and population parameters. Projections of the climate factor from climate models are then used to force the population model into the future [
 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. In general, these studies show that climate change will continue to impact species and the ecosystem services they provide (e.g., fisheries, forage, [
 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]) for the foreseeable future (decades to centuries). For many regions, developing a mechanistic model for each species is not possible in the short-term because of the limited personnel and scientific resources, the lack of mechanistic models linking climate to population dynamics, and the large number of managed species. Global and regional species distribution models have been linked to climate projections to project changes in available habitat and resulting distribution shifts [
