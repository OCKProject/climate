<p class="p">Our objective was to conduct a climate vulnerability assessment for fish and invertebrate species in the Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem (hereafter Northeast U.S. Shelf) using the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Climate Vulnerability Assessment Methodology [
 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. We use climate projections between 2005–2055 to evaluate climate change and decadal variability in the 20–40 year time frame. Separating anthropogenic climate change from natural decadal variability is difficult [
 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] and although we use climate change throughout most of this paper, it is important to recognize that the signals of both change and variability are included in the projections. We define vulnerability as a change in a species’ productivity and or abundance associated with a changing climate, including both climate change and decadal climate variability. We also evaluate the potential for a change in distribution and estimate the directional effect (positive or negative) of a changing climate on species in the Northeast U.S. Shelf. This ecosystem supports valuable commercial ($1.6 billion from landings in 2013 [
 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]) and recreational ($14.8 billion in total angler expenditures [
 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]) fisheries. The region is also experiencing relatively rapid climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Numerous studies have linked recent climate change to changes in the region’s fish and invertebrate populations, including changes in productivity [
 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] and distribution [
 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Of the numerous fishery species in the region, climate variables have only been directly incorporated into scientific advice and management in a few cases [
 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Although this species-by-species approach is necessary, scientists and managers alike need a broad perspective within which to set research priorities and frame management decisions. Our purpose in conducting this vulnerability assessment is to provide such a system-wide perspective for the Northeast U.S. Shelf.
