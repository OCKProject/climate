<p class="p">There are many forms, but in general, trait-based vulnerability assessments identify: i) environmental variables expected to change that could impact species (termed exposure factors) and ii) sensitivity attributes that predict a species intrinsic resilience to change [

 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Some vulnerability assessments separate sensitivity into two components: adaptive capacity and sensitivity [
 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>], but we choose to combine adaptive capacity attributes with sensitivity attributes [
 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Specifically for climate vulnerability, exposure factors include climate variables that have the potential to affect productivity or distribution of a species (or population) in a specific region. For example, temperature is a climate factor that affects species via multiple mechanisms from enzyme reactions to feeding rate to seasonal distribution [
 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Species sensitivity attributes include biological or ecological variables that predict the vulnerability to climate change. For example, a species with an inherently low maximum per capita population growth rate is more sensitive to changes in climate compared to species with an inherently high maximum per capita population growth rate. The exposure factors and sensitivity attributes are scored for each species based on a pre-defined scoring system. These scores are combined across exposure factors and sensitivity attributes to derive a relative species-specific climate vulnerability score. While these methods have limitations, the framework allows a diverse set of species to be assessed in a relatively short period of time, and provides a foundation for further research and management responses [
