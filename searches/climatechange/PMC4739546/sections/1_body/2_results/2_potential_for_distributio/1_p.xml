<p class="p">Many species in the Northeast U.S. Shelf have life history attributes that suggest distribution may change in response to climate change (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146756.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). More than 50% of the species exhibit very high or high potential for a change in species distribution. In general, overall climate vulnerability (changes in population productivity) varies inversely to the potential for a change in species distribution: species highly vulnerable to a change in productivity have a lower potential to change distribution and vice versa (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146756.s010" class="xref">S8 Supporting Information</xref>). However, the certainty potential for distribution change score of almost half the species was &lt;66%; this lower value of certainty compared to overall climate vulnerability results from the lower number of attributes included in the potential for distribution change calculation.
