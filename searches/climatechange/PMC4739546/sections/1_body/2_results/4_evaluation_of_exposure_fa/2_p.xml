<p class="p">The importance of sensitivity attributes varied across species and there was no subset of dominant attributes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146756.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref>). All attributes were scored as very high or high sensitivity for at least one species. There were three attributes that had the strongest influence on climate vulnerability: Population Growth Rate, Adult Mobility, and Stock Status. Removal of the attributes in the sensitivity analysis changed the scores of 14, 10, and 9 species, respectively.
