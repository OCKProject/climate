<p class="p">Our objective here was to provide a broad examination of climate vulnerability for fish and invertebrates on the Northeast U.S. shelf. There are other approaches to estimating speciesâ€™ vulnerability to climate change. For example, thermal habitat modeling was completed to estimate available future thermal habitat on the Scotian Shelf [

 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">95</xref>]. While objectives were similar, the methodologies are different enough that the results provide answers to different questions (projected available habitat vs trait based vulnerabilities). Mechanistic climate-population models are another way of investigating climate vulnerability. Models have been developed for a few species (&lt;10 species) but to complete such detailed analyses for the 82 species included here will take several years at least [

 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref096" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>]. All of these approaches have value and can contribute to informing managers of the challenges and opportunities that result from climate change. Together, these studies indicate that climate change is going to impact fish and invertebrate species for the foreseeable future.
