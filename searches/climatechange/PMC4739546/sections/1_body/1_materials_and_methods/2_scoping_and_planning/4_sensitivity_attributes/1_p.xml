<p class="p">Sensitivity attributes represent biological traits that are indicative of an ability or inability of a species to respond to environmental change. All 12 attributes defined in the NMFS Climate Vulnerability Assessment Methodology [
 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] were used here (
 <xref rid="pone.0146756.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). As an example, the Adult Mobility of a clam is low and as a result, adults would be unable to move as climate changes making them more vulnerable to climate change. The definition for a few sensitivity attributes varies slightly from those presented in the NMFS Methodology [
 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146756.s003" class="xref">S1 Supporting Information</xref>) due to minor changes in the definitions in the methodology, which occurred after the implementation described here.
