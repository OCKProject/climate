<p class="p">The focus of the vulnerability assessment was on marine fish and invertebrate species that commonly occur in the Northeast U.S. Shelf, including exploited species (e.g., Atlantic Cod, Atlantic Sea Scallop), protected species (e.g., Atlantic Salmon), and ecologically important species (e.g., Sand Lances). The exploited species included federally and state managed species, as well as species that are not currently managed but are harvested in the region. Federal commercial and recreational landings were evaluated in developing the list of species. Protected fish species were also assessed including fish species listed under the Endangered Species Act [
 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>] and species considered as Species of Concern by NMFS [
 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Several ecologically important forage fish species were included based on species identified as forage by the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council [
 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Highly migratory species were generally excluded because much of their life cycle is completed outside the study area. In total, 82 species were included and divided into 6 functional groups: Coastal Fish (n = 14), Diadromous Fish (n = 10), Elasmobranchs (n = 12), Groundfish (n = 19), Benthic Invertebrates (n = 18), and Pelagic Fish and Cephalopods (n = 9) (
