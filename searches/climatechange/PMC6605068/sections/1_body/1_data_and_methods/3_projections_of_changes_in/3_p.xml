 <xref rid="S3" ref-type="sec" class="xref">section 2.1</xref> to estimate changes in FD and CD concentrations averaged across the U.S. Southwest domain by season, before calculating annual mean changes. We focus on 20-year averaged changes centered around 2030, 2050, 2070, and 2090 relative to 1986–2005. The six downscaled models show varying abilities in capturing the long-term mean of and interannual variability in seasonal mean SPEI02 values averaged over southwestern North America during the historical reference period (
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Figure S3</xref>). We find that the individual model means fall within ±0.15 of the observed mean, with the multimodel means being slightly biased toward drier conditions (~0.03–0.15 lower than the observed mean), depending on the season (SPEI drought scales are reported with increments of 0.5–1).
