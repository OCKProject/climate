<p id="P11" class="p">The CIRA “historical reference period” against which changes in projections are typically calculated is 1986–2005. However, given that the IMPROVE network began operating in 1988 and underwent rapid expansion between 2000 and 2002 and that the 
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Livneh et al. (2015)</xref> meteorological data are available for 1950–2013, we quantify dust-SPEI02 relationships between 2000 and 2013 in order to maximize the number of data points. We assume that the sensitivities derived from these years are also valid in the historical and future periods. We first apply EOF analysis to identify the most dominant mode of monthly mean FD interannual variability (“EOF1”) and the areas in which the principal time series of EOF1 (“PC1”) display the strongest sensitivities to SPEI02 for each season (December–February, March–May,June–August, and September–November). We then use simple linear regression to quantify the sensitivity of seasonal mean FD averaged over the U.S. Southwest to seasonal mean SPEI02 anomalies averaged over regions displaying the strongest correlations across southwestern North America (outlined by black boxes in the middle row panels of
