<p id="P23" class="p">For morbidity endpoints, we use cost-of-illness estimates for each endpoint type available in BenMAP-CE. For all hospital admissions endpoints, BenMAP-CE uses estimates of hospital charges and lengths of hospital stays based on discharge statistics provided by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s Healthcare Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample database (2007; 
 <xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">U.S. EPA, 2018b</xref>). Estimates were adjusted from 2007$ to 2015$ using BenMAP-CE’s default inflation index. For asthma-related ED visits, we use the mean estimate from 
 <xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Smith et al. (1997)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Stanford et al. (1999)</xref>, adjusted to 2015$. Estimates for nonfatal myocardial infarction rely on the mean estimate from 
 <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Russell et al. (1998)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="R86" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wittels et al. (1990)</xref> and include both the direct medical cost and the future income loss over 5 years associated with the incidence of myocardial infarction (see 
 <xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">U.S. EPA, 2018b</xref>, for further details). The future income loss associated with myocardial infarction is discounted back to the point of incidence using a 3% discount rate to develop a “lump-sum” unit value in the year of incidence. Note that our valuation estimates for all the short-term effects (hospital admissions and ED visits) are not themselves discounted and reflect the economic damages in the year of incidence.
