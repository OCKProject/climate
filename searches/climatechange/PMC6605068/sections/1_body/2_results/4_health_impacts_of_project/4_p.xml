<p id="P31" class="p">In all future eras, the projected dust-attributable mortality and morbidity are larger under RCP8.5 than RCP4.5, with the differences between the two RCP scenarios growing over time. The total excess dust-related mortality and morbidity burdens are ~20% higher (400 deaths per year and 540 hospital admissions and ED visits per year) in 2090 under RCP8.5 relative to RCP4.5. If the expected increases in population and baseline incidence rates are accounted for (i.e., comparing the excess burdens due to climate-driven changes in dust concentrations alone), this percentage difference becomes ~60%. Given that drought-driven increases in dust concentrations are projected to grow over the 21st century, we find that between 2050 and 2090 under RCP8.5, the excess burdens relative to the reference period of FD-attributable mortality and hospitalization grow by 90% (900 deaths per year) and 69% (880 admissions per year), respectively, and CD-attributable mortality and ED visits grow by 90% (460 deaths per year) and 83% (680 visits per year), respectively.</p>
