<p id="P6" class="p">Because climate change can affect air quality by influencing atmospheric ventilation rates, wet and dry deposition, chemical production and loss rates, natural emissions, and background concentrations, research efforts to understand the implications of human-caused climate change on regional air quality and health impacts have been intensifying over the past decade (

The 2017 CIRA report estimates that, irrespective of changes in anthropogenic emissions of ozone precursors, climate-driven increases in ground-level ozone concentrations may cause 920â€“2,500 premature deaths per year in the United States in 2090, costing $26 billion per year in terms of economic damages, under a high GHG concentration scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5, RCP8.5;

 <xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wehner et al., 2017</xref>), the implications for ambient dust levels have not been well quantified. This is partly due to the fact that existing 3-D dynamical dust emission models have trouble capturing the relevant dust mobilization and transport processes, including observed sensitivities to drought conditions (
