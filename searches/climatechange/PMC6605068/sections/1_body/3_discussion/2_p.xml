<p id="P34" class="p">We estimate that in the historical reference period (1986â€“2005), FD and CD exposures are associated with 1,300 premature deaths per year in the U.S. Southwest, which are associated with economic damages valued at $13 billion per year (2015$). Under RCP8.5, this burden could increase by 120% (1,500 deaths per year) in 2050 and by 220% (2,900 deaths per year) in 2090 due to projected changes in population, baseline incidence rates, and dust concentrations, resulting in additional economic damages of $22 billion per year in 2050 and $47 billion per year in 2090. Climate-driven increases in dust concentrations alone account for ~30% of these excess impacts in 2050 and for ~40% in 2090. A lower GHG concentration scenario (RCP4.5) could lead to 110 and 400 fewer premature deaths per year in 2050 and 2090, respectively, avoiding economic damages of $1.6 billion per year in 2050 and $6.4 billion per year in 2090. Children are particularly vulnerable to dust-related asthma exacerbation while the elderly are particularly vulnerable to dust-related premature mortality.</p>
