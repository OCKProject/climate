<p id="P35" class="p">An advantage of this study is that the results are directly comparable to other national- and regional-scale estimates of public health and economic damages from climate impacts calculated using the CIRA framework. The 2017 CIRA report estimates that in 2090 under RCP8.5, ozone-related mortality could grow by 110 deaths per year in the Southwest and by 1,700 deaths per year in the United States for all ages (note that the CIRA “Southwest” domain includes California and Nevada in addition to the four states considered in this study; 
 <xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">U.S. EPA, 2017a</xref>). Mortality attributable to extreme temperature exposure could grow by 2,000 deaths per year in the Southwest for all ages. Our estimated dust-related mortality burden in 2090 is 26 times larger than that for ozone in the Southwest, 1.7 times larger than that for ozone nationally, and 1.5 times larger than that for extreme temperature in the Southwest. In terms of additional economic damages (in undiscounted 2015$), our dust-attributable estimate is ~19 times larger than that for ozone and comparable to that for extreme temperature. Additionally, dust-related asthma ED visits could add another 1,500 visits per year to the national projection of 10,000 excess visits per year due to pollen exposure in 2090 estimated by

Compared to the annual economic damages of climate impacts projected for various U.S. sectors included in the 2017 CIRA report (Table 28.2) in 2090 under RCP8.5, our dust-related value of $47 billion per year for four states in the Southwest ranks fourth behind those due to extreme temperature mortality, labor productivity decline, and loss of coastal property at the national scale. (However, note that the CIRA extreme temperature mortality analysis only included 49 major cities, accounting for around one third of the U.S. population.)
