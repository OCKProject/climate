<p id="P36" class="p">This study is an application and extension of the methods presented in A2018 to quantify the impacts of climate-driven drought conditions on ambient dust levels in the U.S. Southwest. We briefly summarize the differences between the two studies. In A2018, the multimodel mean change in annual mean FD concentration is projected to be 0.35 ± 0.07 μg/m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> (34% increase) under RCP8.5 for 2076–2095 relative to 1996–2015. The projected change in annual mean FD concentration in this study is 0.41 ± 0.16 μg/m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> (57% increase) under RCP8.5 for 2080–2099 relative to 1986–2005. The small difference between these two studies, within the bounds of uncertainty, can be attributed to changes in the baseline period, the number of CMIP5 models considered, and the use of an updated downscaled meteorological projection. The biggest difference in the methodologies of the two studies lies in the health impacts assessment. Previously, A2018 performed the analysis at the regional level and used national-level projections of mortality incidence rates from the global integrated assessment model International Futures. Here, we improve upon this approach by conducting the assessment at a finer spatial scale (grid cell level) using BenMAP-CE, with county-level population and baseline incidence rate estimates. Considering the combined influence of changes in FD concentrations, population, and baseline incidence rates, A2018 estimated by 2095, all-cause mortality could grow by 750 deaths per year (130%) and hospital admissions related to cardiovascular (less myocardial infarctions) and respiratory illnesses could grow by 860 admissions per year (300%). In this study, the roughly equivalent end-of-century projections are 1,900 excess all-cause deaths per year (230%) and 950 excess admissions per year (360%). The absolute and percentage increases in excess all-cause mortality estimated here are larger than those in A2018 due to larger increases in both FD concentrations and total mortality incidence. The excess hospitalization estimates in the two studies are comparable. Unlike in A2018, in which future cardiovascular and respiratory morbidity rates were assumed to linearly scale with mortality incidence rates, here we assume no change in morbidity rates over time.
