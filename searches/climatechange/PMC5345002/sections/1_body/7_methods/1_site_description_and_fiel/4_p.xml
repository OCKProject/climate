<p class="p">Cyanobacteria, moss, and lichen cover was assessed in 40 cm × 40 cm gridded point-intercept frames (4 frames per plot surveying a total of 6400 cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) during the autumn of 2014. Proportional cover for cyanobacteria within each plot was calculated as the ratio of points intercepting cyanobacteria to total biocrust cover. Proportional cover and statistical comparisons of these three groups among treatments can be found in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Information Fig. S6</xref>. Soil surface texture was measured prior to characterization of albedo (February 2014) using the chain method
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56" class="xref">56</xref> to determine the soil surface roughness upslope and across slope within each plot in order to generate a roughness index. This method
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" class="xref">46</xref> fits a small-diameter, lightweight chain to the ground surface and compares the change in the linear distance of the fitted chain to the starting, fully-stretched chain length (i.e., a rougher surface results in a shorter distance, while a smoother surface results in a similar distance compared to the starting length). Plot soil moisture (volumetric water content or VWC) at a depth of 2 cm and 5 cm was measured with Campbell Scientific CS616 water content reflectometers and Decagon EC-5 volumetric water content probes. VWC values from both sensor types were reported as the hourly average of values recorded every five minutes ± 2 hours of solar noon on the same day as the assessment of plot albedo.
