<p class="p">The climate manipulation experiment located on the Colorado Plateau near Castle Valley, Utah, USA (38°38′4″N 109°24′38″W) contains twenty 5 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> plots distributed across four treatments (control, watering, warming, and watering + warming) installed in 2005 in a randomized, complete block design (n = 5 for each treatment). Warming is achieved via infrared lamps that heated the topsoil to +2 °C above ambient at a soil depth of 1–2 cm from 2005–2008. To better match updated climate predictions, the temperature was increased to +4 °C above ambient in June 2008 to present. All plots received ambient precipitation, while watering and watering + warming treatment plots received additions of twice weekly 1.2 mm simulated monsoon (summer) rainfall events. An average of 35 simulated rainfall events occurred throughout the summer months from 2006–2012, equal to roughly four times the average natural frequency
