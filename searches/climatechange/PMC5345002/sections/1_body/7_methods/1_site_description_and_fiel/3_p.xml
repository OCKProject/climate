<p class="p">Directional reflectance measurements were used to measure albedo rather than measuring albedo from hemispherical flux measurements to avoid contamination of albedo due to spatial heterogeneity that would affect the hemispherical field of view. Albedo estimates were made while surface soils were relatively dry and within ± 2 hours of solar noon. Albedo estimates were calculated from HDRF (hemispherical-directional reflectance factor) spectra by integration of the directional reflectance measurements (HCRF) across the hemisphere
