<p class="p">A rapid mortality of the dominant moss (
 <italic class="italic">Syntrichia caninervis</italic>), which constituted ~25% of the biocrust community cover in our plots, occurred over the first year of treatments in the watering and watering + warming treatments
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>, while significant moss decline in the warming-only treatment took more than 6 years to emerge
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref>. Thus, dramatic mortality of this common moss, which is one of the most abundant desert mosses in the world
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" class="xref">16</xref>, was observed with both increased temperature and altered precipitation treatments. Significant responses due to warming and watering + warming were also seen in reduced cover of the dominant lichens (

 <italic class="italic">Collema coccophorum</italic>)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref>. Over time, the decline in moss and lichen species in all treatments produced a shift to a heavily cyanobacteria-dominated biocrust community (i.e., a shift to an early successional state in this system;
