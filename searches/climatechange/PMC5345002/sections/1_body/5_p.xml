<p class="p">We assessed the effect that this change in community had on albedo by integrating hyperspectral solar-reflectance measurements over four view azimuth and five zenith angles (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Information Fig. S5</xref>) to account for reflected light scattering in all treatments during the autumn of 2014. Biocrust community composition was determined from point-intercept frames and was used to correlate plot-level albedo with biocrust community cover. We used soil surface roughness and soil moisture [determined via the chain method (see methods) and volumetric water content probes at 2 and 5â€‰cm soil depths, respectively] measured at the time of albedo measurements to investigate the relationships between albedo and climate treatment effects on surface micro-topography, moisture content, and biocrust community structure. Finally, albedo measurements across treatments and communities were combined with global irradiance and biocrust composition distribution data to provide a conceptual estimate of dryland energy balance effects. This novel approach allowed us to join high-resolution albedo measurements with careful assessments of biocrust community composition, micro-topography, and moisture in order to explore, for the first time, how climate-induced changes to biocrust community could affect dryland energy balance.
