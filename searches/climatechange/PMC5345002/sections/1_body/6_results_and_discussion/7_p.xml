<p class="p">The simulated warming greatly accelerated soil surface drying, in turn, decreasing the dark, late-successional biocrust speciesâ€™ cover
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref> and reducing soil surface micro-topography. While the warming prominently affects the soil surface roughness, watering tends to have stronger effects on the total biocrust community composition as seen by Reed

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref> (see also 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1b</xref>). In all, the climate manipulation treatments induced lighter and smoother soil surfaces and had a direct relationship with the increase in soil surface albedo as seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>. Thus, the treatments showed the potential for a significant dryland negative feedback to future climate via changes to albedo, which resulted from compound disturbances to soil surface biotic and abiotic conditions. The changes to soil surface communities and structure are also likely to affect water infiltration and erosion in ecosystems where productivity and nutrient availability are strongly linked to soil hydrology and stability

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" class="xref">20</xref>. Such feedbacks are currently absent from conceptual and numerical process modeling of future climate, and the present results suggest their inclusion could dramatically improve the scaling, quantifying, and forecasting of climate change.
