<p class="p">Because the absorptive and reflective properties of early and late successional communities are inherently different, it is logical that the community shift observed with warming and altered precipitation treatments greatly altered the soil spectral signatures, and that this change had a large effect on the albedo of this dryland surface. Indeed, with proportional cover of lightly pigmented cyanobacteria explaining over 50% of the variation in albedo across all plots (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2a</xref>), these data suggest a robust control by biocrust community composition in driving dryland soil surface energy balance.
