<p class="p">To explore this hypothesized causal framework, we constructed a structural equation model (SEM) linking these variables as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref> 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" class="xref">19</xref>. The SEM explained 71% of the variation in albedo (Full SEM 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.71) and fit the observed data well (χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.63, d.f. = 1, and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.43; a smaller χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and larger 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>-value indicate better SEM fit). The SEM also revealed that changes in albedo with climate treatments were primarily explained by a strong effect of community composition (i.e., as cyanobacterial cover increases, so does albedo), followed by negative direct effects of surface roughness and soil moisture (i.e., as roughness and moisture increase, albedo decreases) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). Notably, cyanobacteria cover also had a strong effect on surface roughness, whereby increases in cyanobacteria cover with the loss of other biocrust species led to a reduction in surface roughness (see also 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2b</xref>). As discussed above, warming treatments also directly affected surface roughness (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Information Table S1</xref>). The effect of surface roughness on soil moisture was also included in the SEM (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>, dotted line) to demonstrate that surface roughness does relate to changes in hydrology, but this relationship was not significant.
