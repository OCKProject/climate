<p class="p">Climate change manipulations increased surface albedo by 33% on average across warming, watering, and warming + watering treatments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>): a substantial effect measured in a relatively short amount of time (10 years). This change in albedo occurred in large part because climate change treatments drove the mortality of darkly pigmented late succession biocrust populations (i.e., mosses and lichens), which were supplanted by lightly pigmented, cyanobacteria expanding their cover as the biocrust community reverted to an early-successional state
