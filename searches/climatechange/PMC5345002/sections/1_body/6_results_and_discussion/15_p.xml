<p class="p">Strikingly, state transitions of biocrusts in response to climate change and physical disturbances, which lead to similar alternate community states
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref>, have the potential to generate a large negative feedback to warming from climate change. However, we stress that this negative feedback comes at the expense of substantial losses of soil stability and altered biogeochemical functions that negatively impact soil fertility and reduce CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> uptake from the atmosphere. Moreover, increased dust emissions following biocrust loss, and deposition to mountain and polar snow and ice, results in accelerated melting and reinforcement of the positive forcing from the snow-albedo feedback
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52" class="xref">52</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53" class="xref">53</xref>. Dust itself, however, can heat or cool the atmosphere depending on composition and grain size characteristics
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54" class="xref">54</xref>. Therefore, in addition to future efforts aimed at characterizing radiative forcing at larger scales across biologically-crusted systems, understanding to what extent biocrust degradation may already mask or contribute to rates of atmospheric warming through negative and positive feedback loops, respectively, remains a critical task.
