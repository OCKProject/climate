<p class="p">Importantly, biocrusts in some dryland ecosystems are naturally dominated by cyanobacteria, even in late-successional community states (i.e., not dominated by moss and lichens), and the magnitude of biocrust community change effects on albedo would in part depend upon specifics of a siteâ€™s community structure. Nevertheless, a recent study of cyanobacteria-dominated biocrusts indicates that as these communities develop, late-successional cyanobacteria species darken the soil surface due to pigmentation linked to the production of UV-absorbing sunscreen-like pigments. These darkly pigmented cyanobacteria species can significantly alter soil temperature (likely via reduced albedo) and affect the overall microbial community

Thus, similar to the degradation of the late successional moss and lichen biocrusts common to our study system, the degradation of dark-colored, late-successional cyanobacteria-dominated biocrusts could also lead to climate change effects on albedo as disturbances favor light-colored, early-successional cyanobacteria species
