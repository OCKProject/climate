 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" class="xref">32</xref>, have been found to alter regional and even global climate by changing surface energy fluxes (i.e., albedo and radiative forcing)

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" class="xref">33</xref>. Increases in surface albedo due to anthropogenic historical (past 150 years) land use changes, particularly in North America, have been found to effect global effective radiative forcing and may have a larger impact on current global climate change than previously thought
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" class="xref">33</xref>. Increasing albedo linked to increasing global dryland cover, primarily as a result of desertification processes, has also been linked to a negative forcing at Earth’s surface, estimated to be equivalent to roughly 20% of the global anthropogenic CO

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" class="xref">34</xref>. However, understanding how shifts in biotic community cover—like those identified in our study—relate to overall biophysical feedbacks to climate requires consideration of how biotic community state changes impact not only albedo, but C sequestration from the atmosphere as well. For example, forest cover and albedo in semiarid drylands act as a positive forcing that outpaces the negative forcing linked to forest tree C sequestration

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>, indicating potentially opposing effects on radiative forcings. Thus, the net effect of climate and land cover change will depend upon the relative magnitude of these different biophysical forcings and their interaction.
