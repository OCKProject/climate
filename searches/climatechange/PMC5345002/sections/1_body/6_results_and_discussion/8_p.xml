<p class="p">Community composition shifts that affect albedo in other ecosystems, such as exotic species invasions
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref> or grassland-to-woodland conversions
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" class="xref">22</xref>, are often ecosystem dependent, leading to difficulties in scaling these changes from local to regional/global levels
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref>. In contrast, the data that exist on biocrust community states suggest that their responses to various disturbances may be remarkably similar when viewed across large latitudinal and longitudinal gradients, even in cases where species identity and composition vary
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>. Thus, the shift in biocrust community composition in response to climate change and the associated impacts on surface albedo of our study system may be strongly indicative of larger transitions in ecosystems with similar biocrust structure, with the magnitude of the effect depending in part on the ecosystemâ€™s biocrust community. While more work is clearly warranted to elucidate this large potential effect, this study demonstrates that dryland surface albedo is highly dependent on biocrust community composition, where the loss of a few key species dramatically alters the energy balance.
