<p class="p">We stress that this comparison is not meant to be quantitative or predictive, but instead is provided to add insight into the potential for changes to biocrust cover to affect future climate via changes in radiative forcing on a global scale. The impact of climate change across all drylands may not be similar due to historical climatological and specific community differences. For example, cold deserts like the one studied here may be more or less sensitive to a changing climate than hot desert systems. To expand on this idea, we also calculated a change in radiative forcing for cold deserts, which comprise roughly 25.7% of the total desert global land surface area
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51" class="xref">51</xref>. This calculation suggests that the warming of cold deserts alone could produce an estimated radiative forcing of −0.33 W/m

Much more work is needed to quantify these effects and the variability in their magnitude across systems, and we hope these results will help drive this line of questioning. Given this caveat, the estimated potential forcing from climate change as evaluated by our treatments is similar in size (but opposite in sign) to the forcings of greenhouse gas emissions and total anthropogenic effects (industrial and vehicle CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emission, land-use change, cropland irrigation, etc.). The net negative radiative forcing from climate change disturbances on biocrusts may indeed be acting to cool the surface, by returning radiation to the atmosphere that historically would have been absorbed at the Earth surface by the darker-colored, late-successional biocrust communities.
