<p class="p">While increased cyanobacteria cover with the loss of higher energy absorbers, as in lichen and moss species, was the primary driver of increased albedo under climate treatments in our study system, climate treatments and their interactions with biocrust community composition also altered the soil surface micro-topography and soil hydrology (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">2a–c</xref>). A best-fit multiple regression model indicated that cyanobacterial cover, surface roughness, and soil moisture collectively explained a substantial amount of the variation in albedo, though cyanobacterial cover and surface roughness were collinear measures (

In turn, this change may alter soil moisture through surface to volume effects on water infiltration and evaporation, and together these concomitant changes may collectively help control dryland albedo. However, the way warming treatments affected soil roughness also suggests climate can directly affect albedo of biocrust surfaces via changes to micro-topography, likely via changes to freeze thaw cycles, specifically in cold desert regions where freeze-thaw cycles develop rougher soil surfaces with biocrusts
