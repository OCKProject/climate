<p class="p">Drylands encompass various MODIS/KÃ¶ppen classifications beyond deserts, such as semiarid steppe ecosystems where biocrusts also inhabit shrub interspaces
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48" class="xref">48</xref>. Here we used only the desert classification (with extremely arid regions, rock outcrops, and shifting sands eliminated from our calculations) and a desert biocrust cover correction factor (40%) to generate an estimate of change in global dryland radiative forcing due to a shift in biocrust community states [see
