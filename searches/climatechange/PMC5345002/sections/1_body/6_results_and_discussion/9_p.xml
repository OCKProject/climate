<p class="p">Because these data highlight the potential for important climate feedbacks in drylands, we conducted a mathematical exercise to explore the possible scaling implications of our findings. Arid and semiarid ecosystems, collectively termed “drylands”, cover &gt;40% of the Earth’s land surface
