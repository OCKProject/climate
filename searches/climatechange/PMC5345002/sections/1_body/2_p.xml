<p class="p">This effect is analogous (although opposite in sign) to climate-induced woody encroachment in high latitude ecosystems, which dramatically alters albedo via the transformation of white, snow-covered landscapes to dark vegetative cover

Despite a growing concern over how climate-driven disturbances will affect biogeophysical processes, little empirical evidence exists regarding how and at what magnitude climate change effects in drylands will create feedbacks to future climate via changes to energy balance.
