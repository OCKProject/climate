 <sup class="sup">2</sup> plots subjected to warming and altered precipitation patterns (supplemental watering). Treatments were applied over 10 years (2005–2014) in a full-factorial design (control, watering, warming, and watering + warming). The warming (+2 °C above ambient for the first three years, then +4 °C for the remaining years) and watering (increased frequency of 1.2 mm summer rainfall events) treatments were selected to meet climate model projections
