<p class="p">Recent studies utilizing climate manipulation treatments suggest that climate change may have dramatic effects on biocrust community composition by eliminating key species of mosses and lichens, which are large contributors to biogeochemical and hydrological functions in drylands

This climate-induced loss of mosses and lichens in favor of early successional cyanobacteria-dominated biocrusts also reduces the characteristically dark, textured soil surface, which in turn increases the abundance of lighter, smoother surface cover (
