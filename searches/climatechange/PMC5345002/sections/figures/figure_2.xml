  <title class="title">Linear models relating albedo to the proportional cover of cyanobacteria, soil surface roughness and soil moisture.</title>
  <p class="p">The (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) proportional cover of cyanobacteria within biocrust communities of experimental plots was collected in point-intercept frames in autumn 2014, and calculated as the ratio of points intercepting cyanobacteria relative to total biotic cover (sum total of cyanobacteria, moss, and lichen points). Soil surface roughness (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) was measured in spring 2014 to calculate a roughness index to characterize the soil surface roughness upslope and across slope within each plot. Soil moisture (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) at a depth of 5 cm was measured as the hourly average of values recorded every five minutes during the same time as the albedo measurements. 
   <italic class="italic">R</italic>
   <sup class="sup">2</sup> and 
   <italic class="italic">P</italic>-values are from simple linear regression. Climate treatments are denoted by symbol colors (green = control, red = warming, blue = watering, purple = warming + watering). Data from one watered plot was considered an outlier as described in the methods section and was removed from the models shown here (see 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Information</xref>
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Fig. S2</xref> for analyses including the outlier).
