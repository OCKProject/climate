  <title class="title">Biocrust cover and albedo by treatment.</title>
  <p class="p">The photographs (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>–
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>) illustrate representative effects of the treatments (control, watering, warming, watering + warming) on biocrust cover identified along the horizontal axis corresponding to box and whisker plots. Photographs were taken in areas of little to no vegetation or litter. In the box and whisker panel, boxes show medians for albedo (heavy central line) and 1st and 3rd quartiles; whiskers indicate 1.5 inter-quartile range. Climate manipulation treatments caused a significant increase in albedo of the warming (
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.01) and warming + watering (
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) treatments compared to untreated controls, but the watering only plots had more variable responses (
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.06).
