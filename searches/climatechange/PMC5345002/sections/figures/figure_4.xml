  <title class="title">Estimated global mean radiative forcing from anticipated changes in biocrust communities and IPCC AR5 from 1750 to 2011.</title>
  <p class="p">Global radiative forcing values resulting from changes in biocrust cover were calculated using equation (1) described in the methods. Uncertainties for treatment radiative forcing are represented by 95% confidence intervals (error bars). Effective radiative forcing (ERF) values were used for total anthropogenic, aerosol interactions, and well-mixed greenhouse gases. All other IPCC derived values are of radiative forcing (RF). Uncertainties for the IPCC AR5 RF and ERF values are represented by 5 to 95% confidence intervals. The blue, red, and purple bars show potential radiative forcing effects of climate-induced changes to biocrust communities in deserts. The maroon bar shows the positive radiative forcing resulting from increased greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, and the orange bar shows the effect of all anthropogenic sources combined (not including the albedo effects of biocrust community change).</p>
