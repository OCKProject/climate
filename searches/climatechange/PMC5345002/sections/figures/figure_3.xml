  <p class="p">The model (
   <italic class="italic">R</italic>
   <sup class="sup">
    <italic class="italic">2</italic>
   </sup> = 0.71) includes the direct effects of proportional cyanobacteria cover, soil moisture, and surface roughness on albedo with the indirect effects of cyanobacteria cover on surface roughness and surface roughness on soil moisture. The arrows represent the unidirectional causal relationships and are scaled to match their standardized effect size. The standardized path coefficients (r) are presented above each arrow. The dashed arrow indicates a clearly, non-significant interaction (P &gt; 0.1) with other arrows P values indicated as *
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.1, **
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05, and ***
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.01. Data from one watered plot was considered an outlier as described in the methods section and was removed from the model.
