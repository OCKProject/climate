<p class="p">Climate change projections of range change should be guided by ecological knowledge of the factors limiting species distributions, whether via physiological or demographic mechanisms or via habitat availability. These considerations can guide the selection of climate covariates, which should be projected under a range of plausible futures. For mid‐century projections, GCM uncertainty represents much of the climate uncertainty, but for late‐century projections, it is necessary to include multiple emissions trajectories as well (Snover et al.,

Our results indicate that the thresholding procedure should be carefully justified or multiple methods considered, while collinearity has a relatively small effect. For decisions where ecological knowledge provides little guidance, our results support the use of cross‐validation to select methods that may then be applied under novel conditions. Visualizing and communicating the uncertainty arising from divergent climate futures and from modeling methods provide managers and other end users with critical context for decision‐making; sensitivity analyses will remain critical because variation arising from modeling decisions can lead to large uncertainties regarding the relative vulnerability of different species (Figure
