<p class="p">Attention to methodological decisions has often focused on comparisons of statistical models (e.g., Heikkinen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33403-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>), a decision now often supplanted by the use of statistical model ensembles (Araujo, Whittaker, Ladle, &amp; Erhard, 
 <xref rid="ece33403-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). Some attention has been directed toward the selection of climate covariates (Gaston, 
 <xref rid="ece33403-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>; Pliscoff, Luebert, Hilger, &amp; Guisan, 
 <xref rid="ece33403-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Synes &amp; Osborne, 
 <xref rid="ece33403-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>), but many studies are nevertheless based on a small set of easily accessible and generic climate variables (e.g., bioclim variables from the Worldclim dataset; Hijmans, Cameron, Parra, Jones, &amp; Jarvis, 
 <xref rid="ece33403-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). Recent work has highlighted decisions regarding temporal scale and type of climate variable summaries (van de Pol et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33403-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), but there remains a broad need for comparison among classes of climate variables, including hydrological variables that integrate the effects of temperature and precipitation to assess the impacts of climate change on water availability (Austin, 
 <xref rid="ece33403-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Furthermore, when selecting variables, researchers must decide on the appropriate tolerance for collinearity. While a common practice is to limit collinearity and thus limit the potential for overfitting (Beaumont, Hughes, &amp; Poulsen, 
 <xref rid="ece33403-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>; Dormann et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33403-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), it has also been suggested that changes in future covariance structure and the potential for selecting a noncausal variable may favor retaining collinear covariates (Braunisch et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33403-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Assessing whether performance in cross‐validation is indicative of performance in extrapolation (i.e., in new times, places, or conditions) is a key step for guiding these choices, and has not been widely explored for these nor for additional decisions such as the method used to threshold continuous model predictions to create binary maps of species distributions. Comparing the magnitude of uncertainty deriving from methodological choices to the magnitude of uncertainty deriving from variability in projections of future climate can provide researchers with a guide for how to allocate modeling effort—that is whether greater consideration should be given to capturing the uncertainty in future climate or the uncertainty due to methodological choices.
