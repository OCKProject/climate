<p class="p">Extrapolation to drought conditions was variously improved or diminished by different modeling decisions (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="ece33403-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). Compared to the hydrological hypothesis, the temporal hypothesis generally had a positive impact on extrapolation ability, while the bioclimatic hypothesis generally had a negative impact. Higher collinearity benefited extrapolations. For locational accuracy and prevalence accuracy, five thresholding procedures improved and three diminished projections compared with the reference levels of Fmeasure and SeSpeql, respectively.
