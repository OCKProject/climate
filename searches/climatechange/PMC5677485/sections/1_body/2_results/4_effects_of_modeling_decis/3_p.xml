<p class="p">All correlation coefficients between predictions of extrapolation performance based on cross‐validation performance and actual extrapolation performance were positive indicating cross‐validation performance measures provide value for making modeling decisions for extrapolating under climate change. Although all positive, they varied in strength, with ρ = 0.93 for AUC, ρ = 0.91 for TSS, ρ = 0.86 for kappa, and ρ = 0.72 for prevalence match.</p>
