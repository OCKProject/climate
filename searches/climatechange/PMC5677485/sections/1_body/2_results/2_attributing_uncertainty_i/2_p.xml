<p class="p">Range change estimates were highly variable. Although median values were negative for all but one species, the majority of projections included both negative and positive range change—that is, inferences to the direction and amount of range change depended critically on model‐building decisions (Figures

 <xref rid="ece33403-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Note that this finding corresponds to the ensemble‐weighted projections; previous work has found similar divergence in projected effect for individual models (Araujo et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33403-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). GCM selection contributed the most uncertainty followed by the covariate hypothesis and thresholding procedure (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33403-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The degree of collinearity retained in the covariate set was a minor source of uncertainty. Vulnerability rankings based on range change estimates were highly variable for most species meaning that modeling decisions qualitatively affect which species are identified as most vulnerable (Figure
