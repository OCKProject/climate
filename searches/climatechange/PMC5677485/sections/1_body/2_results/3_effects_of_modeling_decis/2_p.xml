<p class="p">Modeling decisions were associated with consistently more or less range change. The GCM that predicted the least range change (median RCI = −0.16) projected the least warming and the largest precipitation increase (# 34, Figs.

The GCM that projected the greatest range change (median RCI = −0.55) had near‐zero change in precipitation and the largest temperature increase (# 1). The use of bioclimatic and temporal climate covariates resulted in moderately more projected range loss compared to hydrological covariates (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33403-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). Bioclimatic covariates projected 94%, and temporal covariates 98% more median range loss than hydrological covariates (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece33403-sup-0006" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4</xref> in Supporting Information). The difference projected between bioclimatic and temporal covariates was not statistically significant (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece33403-sup-0007" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S5</xref> in Supporting Information). The impact of varying collinearity was low with the highest degree of collinearity projecting 9% more median range loss relative to the lowest (Table

 <xref rid="ece33403-sup-0008" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S6</xref> in Supporting Information). The impact of using the fixed (0.5) threshold was very high compared with those that produced the least change (observed prevalence and averaged predicted probability) and resulted in projections of 94% more median range loss (Table

 <xref rid="ece33403-sup-0009" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S7</xref> in Supporting Information). Numerous other thresholds resulted in moderate or low impacts to the amount of projected range loss (Table
