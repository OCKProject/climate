<p class="p">We observed substantial variation in projected future distributions depending on which covariate hypothesis was being tested. The underlying climate data were the same for all climate datasets, eliminating data source as the explanation for this result. Thus, variation in range size arose from the hypothesized relationship between climate and species distribution, and the particular derivations of climatic variation that represented each hypothesis. Collectively, our work and others (Pliscoff etÂ al.,
