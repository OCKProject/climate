<p class="p">We filtered our covariate sets using three different degrees of collinearity and found relatively little variation in range change projections. While posited as a serious concern with conflicting recommendations for best practices when projecting species distributions (Beaumont et al.,

 <xref rid="ece33403-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), we found the impact of this decision to be relatively small. This may reflect our approach which started with a relatively large number of covariates (x̅ = 14) and ended in a moderate number (
