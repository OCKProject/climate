<p class="p">Methodological decisions in projecting impacts of climate change can lead to widely divergent projections but are often made without strong justification. We found that future climatic conditions (i.e., GCM) were the largest source of uncertainty, but considerable variation in projected changes in range size also arose from the climate covariate hypothesis and the thresholding procedure. Projections based on hydrological covariates suggested reduced vulnerability compared to bioclimatic or temporal covariates. For reliably projecting climate change impacts, the simplest climate covariates may be the best: temporal covariates outperformed bioclimatic covariates and, by a slimmer margin, hydrological covariates. Cross‐validation performance was correlated with extrapolation performance; thus, our results support using cross‐validation performance to guide modeling decisions in climate change impacts studies. However, we note that methodological decisions profoundly affected which species were identified as most vulnerable (Figure
