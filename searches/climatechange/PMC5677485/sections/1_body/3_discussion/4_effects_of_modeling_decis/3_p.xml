<p class="p">Because the temporal and bioclimatic hypotheses were likely more similar based on how they were computed—based on summaries and derivations of monthly precipitation and temperature data, versus an additional hydrological model—perhaps it is not surprising that they produced similar levels of range change. However, predictions of twice the range loss of the hydrological covariates are compelling. Schlaepfer, Lauenroth, &amp; Bradford, (2012) also found more hopeful outcomes in projections using hydrological covariates versus more basic climatic covariates for future plant distributions. One likely explanation for our result is that temperature increases can be tempered by corresponding precipitation increases for ecosystems and processes that are water limited as in our study system, and this effect would be captured by water balance formulas of a hydrological model.</p>
