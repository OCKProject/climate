<p class="p">Whereas including more covariates generally produces more restricted predictions of ranges (e.g., Beaumont et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33403-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>), the impacts of collinearity in projections of range change—where the measure is a difference in proportions of future and current ranges—have rarely been addressed. In our analysis, higher collinearity led to increases in range loss, consistent with the expectation that higher collinearity leads to overfit models that are not generalizable to new times or places (Heikkinen, Marmion, &amp; Luoto,
