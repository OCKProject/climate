<p class="p">The effects of thresholding methods on projected climate change vulnerability have received slim attention (Nenzen &amp; Araujo, 
 <xref rid="ece33403-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). We found the fixed threshold of 0.5 produced alarming projections of range loss, nearly twice that of observed prevalence and average predicted probability procedures, which produced the most moderate projections of range loss. The fixed 0.5 threshold is known to overestimate occurrences of common species and underestimate occurrences of rare species (Freeman &amp; Moisen, 
 <xref rid="ece33403-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Jimenez‚ÄêValverde &amp; Lobo, 
 <xref rid="ece33403-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>), and this bias may cause the fixed threshold to produce extreme estimates of range change for species that deviate from moderate levels of prevalence as ours do.
