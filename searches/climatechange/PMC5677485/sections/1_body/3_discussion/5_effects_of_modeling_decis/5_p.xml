<p class="p">Positive correlation values between model performance in cross‐validation and extrapolation for all performance metrics (AUC, kappa, prevalence match, and TSS) indicate that cross‐validation performance can be used to select best choices for bioclimatic species distribution modeling. However, the smaller value for prevalence match indicates lower reliability of this metric, or, alternatively, the challenge of extrapolating prevalence. Conversely, the relatively high correlation values for AUC and TSS indicate these metrics may be among the better for making modeling decisions.</p>
