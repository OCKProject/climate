<p class="p">Bioclimatic covariates have a strong theoretical link to niche modeling, are widely used for modeling climate change impacts, and are assumed to have numerous advantages (Austin,

 <xref rid="ece33403-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>); however, they underperformed in extrapolation relative to temporal covariates. The simpler summaries of temporal variation in temperature and precipitation could potentially represent more variability in climate if more months are represented in the ultimate set. The bioclimatic set had fewer covariates, but our result aligns with that of Peterson and Nakazawa (
 <xref rid="ece33403-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>), who also found that bioclimatic covariates underperformed relative to other climatic covariates. They suggested that the indirect methods used to estimate the bioclimatic covariates relative to more direct use of means and summaries of other climate covariates may put bioclimatic variables at a disadvantage. Bioclimatic covariates representing seasonal extremes such as the “wettest quarter” may lead to errors in projections if the seasonality of future climate changes for species such as migratory birds with limited abilities to shift their phenology.
