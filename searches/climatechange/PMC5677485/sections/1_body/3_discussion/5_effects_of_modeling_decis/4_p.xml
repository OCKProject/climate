<p class="p">Recommended thresholding procedures varied depending on whether locational accuracy or prevalence accuracy was desired, and our results for extrapolation generally corroborated previous work assessing performance of thresholds under a static climate. For locational accuracy, like Liu et al. (
 <xref rid="ece33403-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>), we found that sensitivity‐ and specificity‐based approaches (ROC, SeSpeql, TSS) as well as average probability and observed prevalence offered improved performance while the fixed threshold produced the poorest performance. For prevalence accuracy, like Freeman and Moisen (
 <xref rid="ece33403-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>), we found kappa and predicted prevalence equals observed prevalence improved this metric, and our results additionally recommend Fmeasure, midpoint probability, and overall prediction success.
