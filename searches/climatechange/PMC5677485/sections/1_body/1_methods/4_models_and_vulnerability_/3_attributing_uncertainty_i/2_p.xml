<p class="p">Using a factorial design to evaluate key sources of uncertainty in SDM development, we evaluated all possible combinations of uncertainty from 10 GCMs, three covariate hypotheses, three cut‐offs for collinearity, and 12 thresholding procedures (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33403-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The result was 1,080 sets of RCI projections per species. We applied a GLM with normal error distribution to log‐transformed RCI output for each species to evaluate the relative contribution to estimated range change arising from GCM selection, covariate hypothesis, degree of collinearity, and thresholding procedure. We alternately withheld each uncertainty source to assess the proportional reduction in model deviance attributable to its inclusion as a model covariate (Buisson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33403-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). For example, the proportion of deviance explained by GCM, for a given species, was calculated as the difference between the deviance remaining in the model without GCM and the deviance remaining in the model with all uncertainty sources. This difference was then divided by the null (intercept only) model deviance. We then summarized the distribution of deviance reduction values across species for each uncertainty source.
