<p class="p">We assessed the effects of decisions regarding the covariate hypothesis, degree of collinearity, and thresholding procedure on estimates of range change using generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33403-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). In these models, we treated species as a random effect and assumed RCI to be a log normally distributed response variable. GLMMs were created using the R package lme4 (Bates, Machler, Bolker, &amp; Walker,

To qualify the degree of change to RCI estimates produced by the alternate decisions compared to choosing the reference level, we describe “none,” “low,” “moderate,” “high,” or “very high” reflecting coefficient estimates of 0, &lt;0 to −0.2, &lt;−0.2 to −0.4, &lt;−0.4 to −0.6, and &lt;−0.6 to −0.8, respectively.
