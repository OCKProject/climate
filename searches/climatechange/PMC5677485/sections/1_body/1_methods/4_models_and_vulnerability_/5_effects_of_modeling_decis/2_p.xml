<p class="p">To create independent test data to serve as a proxy for future climate change, we partitioned drought years from the years representing wet and normal conditions (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33403-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). We defined seven drought years: 1988–1992 and 2004–2005. The years 1988–1992 cover a drought considered second in severity only to the dust bowl drought of the 1930's and resulted in a greatly reduced number of wetlands including the loss of some lakes (Niemuth, Wangler, &amp; Reynolds,

 <xref rid="ece33403-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>). During the 2004–2005 drought years, lakes remained largely unaffected but the number of temporary and seasonal wetlands were reduced to below half their maximum number, and sizes of semipermanent wetlands were reduced by ~50% (Niemuth et al.,

Extrapolation model performance was assessed using models trained with data from the 82% of the data that represented wet/normal years and projected to the 18% of the data that represented drought years. Cross‐validation model performance was assessed using 10 randomized splits of the wet/normal years’ data using the same proportions as for extrapolation (82:18). We assessed model performance using Cohen's kappa statistic (kappa), True Skill Statistic (TSS), Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and prevalence match (additional information in Appendix
