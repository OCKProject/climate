<p class="p">We modeled the effects of the climate covariate hypothesis, degree of collinearity, and thresholding procedure on model performance for each performance metric (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33403-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). We used GLMMs with species as a random effect (using lme4). For the climate covariate hypothesis and thresholding procedure, we selected reference levels for the GLMMs based on those that were intermediate in effect, thus allowing other levels to have a positive or negative effect on model performance relative to the reference. Using model coefficients, we qualified the relative impact to model performance in extrapolation owing to alternate decisions relative to the intermediate reference level. Therefore, we describe “positive,” “intermediate,” or “negative” performance impacts corresponding to coefficient estimates that were positive, nonsignificant, or negative, respectively.
