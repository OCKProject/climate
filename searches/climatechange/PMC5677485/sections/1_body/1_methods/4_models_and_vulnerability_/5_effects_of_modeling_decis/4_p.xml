<p class="p">To evaluate the ability of choices based on higher performance in cross‐validation tests to improve performance for extrapolation as well, we assessed the correlation between cross‐validation and extrapolation results for each performance metric. For each metric, we used GLMMs to predict the extrapolation performance value using a fixed effect of cross‐validation performance value and a random effect of species. We then assessed the correlation between the prediction and the actual extrapolation performance value using Spearman's rank‐based correlation (ρ).</p>
