<p class="p">We developed candidate covariate sets for each of the three climate hypotheses based on previous bird and PPR studies (See Appendix

 <xref rid="ece33403-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref> in Supporting Information). Candidate covariates for each of the three hypotheses were reduced in number based on their degree of collinearity as assessed by variance inflation factors (VIFs; Table 
 <xref rid="ece33403-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). The first VIF cutoff was set at the commonly recommended value of ten, and the second was set at two, using a more stringent recommendation for ecological studies (Kutner, Nachtsheim, &amp; Neter,
