<p class="p">We devised three classes of climate covariate which can be considered working hypotheses for how climate explains organismal distribution: temporal, bioclimatic, and hydrological. Temporal covariates are based on simple summaries of monthly precipitation and temperature data. We propose the temporal hypothesis as a general hypothesis that precipitation and temperature drive organismal distribution via multiple temporal scales and the variability therein and can include monthly, seasonal, annual, or longer term summaries and variability. The bioclimatic hypothesis proposes that organismal distribution is primarily described by monthly or quarterly extremes and seasonality of temperature and precipitation. The original set of bioclimatic covariates was developed to describe process‐based climatic relationships with plant growth (Booth, Nix, Busby, &amp; Hutchinson,

We propose the hydrological hypothesis as a hypothesis that organismal distribution is primarily limited by water availability. Because precipitation is not a reliable representation of water availability and many ecological processes are water limited, hydrological variables may more directly relate to ecological response (McEvoy et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33403-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Drought indices or soil moisture, for example, have been explored by some researchers (Barbet‐Massin &amp; Jetz,
