  <p class="p">Example comparison of differences in range change for one species (Mallard) under two sets of decisions. Red pixels show locations where species is predicted to occur; the total red area is the range of the species; and thus, range change is the change in red area (future minus current). Decision set A is modeled using: hydrological covariates, variance inflation factor of two to reduce collinearity, kappa threshold, and General Circulation Model “mri.” Decision set B is modeled using: bioclimatic covariates, all covariates, predprevobs threshold, and General Circulation Model “acc.” “Current” is based on General Circulation Model hindcasts rather than observed climate data</p>
