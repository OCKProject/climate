<p class="p">Comparison between the climate chamber and the outdoor group revealed a difference in the response to time in all 
 <italic class="italic">B. acetabulosa</italic> traits, except sugar concentration per flower (Table

 </bold>). The difference between the responses indicates an additional effect of temperature on plant traits in the climate chamber. Since the outdoor models indicated that temperature had no separate significant effect on nectar volume per flower, sugar content per flower and number of flowers per plant (Table 
 <xref rid="PLV111TB2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>), we can conclude that the difference observed between these trait responses is caused by the effect of elevated temperatures
