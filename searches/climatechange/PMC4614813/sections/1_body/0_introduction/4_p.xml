<p class="p">In this study, we explore the effect of temperature on the nectar production of two common phryganic species of Lamiaceae visited predominantly by bees, both honeybees and wild bees. In both a climate-controlled and natural setting, we study the patterns of flower and nectar production and their variation in response to a wide range of temperatures, including temperatures higher than current climatic means, thus allowing us to investigate the potential effects of climate change on nectar rewards available to pollinators in the future. Our hypothesis is that strongly elevated temperatures reduce flower and nectar production and affect the variation in nectar production patterns. Such results could indicate a possible threat to pollinators and to the persistence of both plant and pollinator populations in the Mediterranean systems. It may also affect negatively bee-keeping and honey production, which play an important role in the economy of this area.</p>
