These changes in temperature and precipitation regime can generate increasingly severe conditions for plant communities and consequently increase the vulnerability of mutualistic interaction networks in the Mediterranean region. In the water-limited phryganic communities (East-Mediterranean low scrub), the nectar production is generally low, with only a few species producing large quantities (i.e. &gt;0.5 µL) of nectar per flower (
