 <italic class="italic">B. acetabulosa</italic> to elevated temperatures, the effect of climate warming could be more pronounced on the pollinators of this species already during the next few decades under the effect of moderate warming. Although plantâ€“pollinator networks, especially generalist interactions, are expected to be rather robust to the effect of climate change (
