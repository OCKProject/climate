<p class="p">Moreover, experimental warming in the climate chamber accelerated plant flowering and thus reduced the length of flowering period under elevated temperatures. Under natural conditions, shorter flowering time in consequence of global warming could increase the probability of creating temporal mismatches with pollinators (

 <xref rid="PLV111C29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Petanidou 2007</xref>), the reduced nectar secretion and temporal mismatches with these species at strongly elevated temperatures could have a considerable impact on the phryganic pollinator fauna. In addition, it could also negatively affect apiculture in the Mediterranean region, which in the phryganic systems is strongly dependent on the abundance and nectar production of different Lamiaceae species (
