<p class="p">Our results demonstrate that in case of moderate warming, as predicted in the Mediterranean region for the next two decades, nectar sugar production and consequently the amount of resources available for pollinators could be moderately adversely affected in the case of some Mediterranean species (e.g. 
 <italic class="italic">B. acetabulosa</italic>) and might even be benefitted in others (e.g. 
 <italic class="italic">T. divaricatum</italic>). This difference in species responses suggests that at the community level species nectar production might be able to balance out, at least for the more generalized pollinators (
