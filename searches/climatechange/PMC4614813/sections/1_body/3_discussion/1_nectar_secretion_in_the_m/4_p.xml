<p class="p">In contrast to nectar and sugar production, trait variation (CV) within a plant was not related to temperature in most of the tested traits. Only CV of sugar concentration was positively related to temperature indoors (in both species) and positively unimodally related to temperature outdoors (in

Nevertheless, the stability of trait variation patterns in our experiment signifies that in these two species this aspect of plantâ€“pollinator interactions could be relatively unaffected by elevated temperatures and not cause additional alterations under climate warming.
