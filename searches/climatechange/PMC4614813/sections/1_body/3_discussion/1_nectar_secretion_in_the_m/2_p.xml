<p class="p">Strongly elevated temperatures, predicted to prevail in the Mediterranean region in the end of the century, would likely decrease nectar secretion and sugar production in both 
 <italic class="italic">B. acetabulosa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. divaricatum</italic>, which based on our results, currently grow in the wild at or close to their optimum temperature range for nectar secretion. This effect can be particularly strong in regions of the Mediterranean where the current average temperatures are higher. Strongly elevated temperatures in the climate chamber decreased sugar content per plant of both
