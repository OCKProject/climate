<p class="p">We studied the effect of a range of temperatures on two phryganic Lamiaceae species in Greece to evaluate the potential threat of climate change to floral nectar production and plant–pollinator interactions in the Mediterranean. The Mediterranean region is considered to be particularly threatened by global warming in the future due to strongly elevated temperatures and a heightened probability of drought during the summer (
