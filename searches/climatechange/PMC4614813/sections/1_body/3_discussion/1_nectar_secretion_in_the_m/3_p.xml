<p class="p">Moderate warming predicted for the next two decades, however, should have only a moderate effect on 
 <italic class="italic">B. acetabulosa</italic> nectar secretion, remaining close to this species’ optimum range, and even promote nectar production of 
 <italic class="italic">T. divaricatum</italic>, which demonstrated a relatively high optimal temperature for nectar volume per flower (30–35 °C; Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F2" class="xref">2</xref>A) and sugar content per flower (∼29 °C; Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F2" class="xref">2</xref>C). Similarly high temperature optimum (32.5 °C during the day, analogous to the optimal daily temperatures of 
 <italic class="italic">T. divaricatum</italic>) has also been found for the sugar content per flower of 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus capitatus</italic>, another phryganic species (
 <xref rid="PLV111C31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Petanidou and Smets 1996</xref>). In species with similarly high temperature optima, climate change can potentially increase nectar production, at least in the case of moderate warming. However, sugar content per plant of 
 <italic class="italic">T. divaricatum</italic> peaked at lower temperatures (optimum ∼26–27 °C; Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F2" class="xref">2</xref>D) than sugar content per flower, indicating that the nectar production per plant could still be negatively affected by even moderate warming, even if sugar content per flower can still increase under higher temperatures. The effect of moderate warming on the sugar content per plant of 
 <italic class="italic">T. divaricatum</italic>, as well as 
 <italic class="italic">B. acetabulosa</italic> sugar content per flower (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F1" class="xref">1</xref>C) and sugar content per plant (optimum ∼25–27 °C; Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F1" class="xref">1</xref>D), might in the near future be promoted in some regions of the Mediterranean with lower average temperatures, or be moderately decreased in regions with higher temperatures.
