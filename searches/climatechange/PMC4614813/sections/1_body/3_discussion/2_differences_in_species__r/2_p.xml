<p class="p">The differences in species' nectar production patterns could be caused by the plants' adaptations to the different phryganic microhabitats, which the two species inhabitâ€”
 <italic class="italic">B. acetabulosa</italic> prefers modified or somewhat protected microhabitats (understorey, partially shaded, neighbouring to different structures), while 
 <italic class="italic">T. divaricatum</italic> grows under full sun (

 <xref rid="PLV111C34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Petanidou 
  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 2000
 </xref>). As a plant of open natural areas, 
 <italic class="italic">T. divaricatum</italic> is adapted to particularly high temperatures and does not experience physiological stress at moderately higher than average temperatures, akin to other open phryganic species, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus capitatus</italic>, which has a similarly high optimal temperature range for nectar sugar production (
 <xref rid="PLV111C31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Petanidou and Smets 1996</xref>). At the same time, 
 <italic class="italic">B. acetabulosa</italic> as a plant of less exposed habitats could be less adapted to the heat and considerably more sensitive to temperature rise. This difference suggests a stronger effect of climate change on understorey plants in the phryganic systems, which are less adapted to high temperatures and the effect of drought. At the same time, species that are adapted to the harsh conditions of the open phrygana might be able to cope better with the forthcoming changes.
