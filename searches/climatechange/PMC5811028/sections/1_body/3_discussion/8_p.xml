<p class="p">Water quality, which has been recognized as one of the most important threats to the Do√±ana wetland complex [
 <xref rid="pone.0192702.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>], should also be accounted for in assessments on habitat quality for waterbirds, as it has being revealed as a clear determinant of their population trends [

 <xref rid="pone.0192702.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. Modelled associations with habitat features can also be combined with spatially-explicit information on relevant environmental predictors to derive spatially-explicit predictions on the extent and distribution of suitable habitats for waterbirds [
 <xref rid="pone.0192702.ref075" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. Such spatially-explicit predictions could be periodically updated by incorporating remote-sensing data on environmental conditions [

 <xref rid="pone.0192702.ref077" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>], serving as a formidable addition to the toolbox of ecologists, stakeholders and managers.
