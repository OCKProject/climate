<p class="p">Species and guild-specific traits exert marked morphological and ecological constraints to habitat use, thus resulting in the uneven distribution of waterbirds throughout habitat gradients [
 <xref rid="pone.0192702.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0192702.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0192702.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Small wading and fishing birds distributed themselves along the upper range of the water salinity gradient, thus indicating their preferences for coastal and tidal wetlands or saltpans, and demonstrating a tolerance for saline conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0192702.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. In contrast, most other species preferentially use low salinity waters. Salty water may be a handicap for these other waterbirds due to dehydration [
 <xref rid="pone.0192702.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>] or reduction of feather waterproofing [
 <xref rid="pone.0192702.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Water salinity can also create habitat gradients in wetlands by controlling the abundance and composition of primary producers, and hence food availability for herbivorous species like vegetation gleaners and dabbling ducks [
 <xref rid="pone.0192702.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0192702.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>,

 <xref rid="pone.0192702.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Moreover, rainfall and climatic factors largely dominate the hydrological regime in this area, particularly within the Doñana wetland complex [
 <xref rid="pone.0192702.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], with most waterbodies flooding annually due to winter rains and drying up in the summer [
 <xref rid="pone.0192702.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0192702.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0192702.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. As the drying period progresses, waterbodies will become saltier, but also shallower, and hence less suitable for diving birds [
