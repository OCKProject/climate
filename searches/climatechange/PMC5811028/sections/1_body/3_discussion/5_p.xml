<p class="p">Climatic impacts may also vary among waterbirds depending on their life-history strategies. In particular, local species (i.e., resident species and those breeding at our study site) will likely be more impacted than wintering waterbirds. These contrasting responses may be even exacerbated by seasonal differences in expected environmental changes, as climate projections predict relatively constant patterns for winter rainfall, but a drastic reduction in the fall, spring and summer precipitation (

Moreover, contrasting climate impacts on habitat suitability for wintering and local species will likely be exacerbated in the ‘worst’ of the climate scenarios (i.e., those indicating the highest impacts on water budgets), as most wintering species (ca. 60%) are small wading birds that use muddy areas and open water to forage and will likely benefit from increasing water salinities and reductions in aquatic vegetation.
