<p class="p">The European Union–EU–Birds Directive (79/409/ EEC) highlights the need for research and conservation of currently threatened species (see Article 10 and Annex V of the Birds Directive). However, predictive modelling and horizon-scanning exercises are also recognized as a priority to anticipate reliable management and policy decisions for waterbird conservation [
 <xref rid="pone.0192702.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. From a horizon-scanning perspective, it is worth noting that the conservation status of some species may change, and hence conservation requirements, according to predicted impacts of climate change on habitat suitability. In particular, we identified emerging issues that could have substantial impacts on the conservation of diving birds, vegetation gleaners, or large wading birds (but see above for the inconsistency between our predictions and current population trends for species in the large wading bird guild). Currently, 50% of these species are considered of less concern according to BirdLife International (

We therefore encourage early, policy-relevant and practical research on these guilds (see [
