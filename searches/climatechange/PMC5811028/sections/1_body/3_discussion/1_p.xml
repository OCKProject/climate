<p class="p">Prospective exercises aimed at horizon-scanning human and climate impacts on waterbirds require a thorough comprehension of the environmental drivers structuring their habitats [

 <xref rid="pone.0192702.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. By investigating waterbird distribution in a wetland network in southwestern Spain, we identified a comprehensive set of environmental predictors of habitat use. In particular, several water budget-related environmental traits such as salinity, water depth, water body isolation and hydroperiod, structured the community and were revealed as the most important habitat features predicting species presence. However, various species and guilds showed specific and contrasting responses to different environmental predictors. Accordingly, we should expect that the impact of human and climatic-driven changes in water budgets on waterbirds will be species and guild-specific.
