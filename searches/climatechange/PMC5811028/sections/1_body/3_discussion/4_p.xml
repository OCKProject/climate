<p class="p">Owing to the contrasting responses of individual waterbird species to habitat predictors, we should expect species-specific changes in habitat suitability as environmental conditions shift towards increasing wetland salinity and isolation, and decreasing depths and hydroperiods. In particular, diving birds, vegetation gleaners, and dabbling ducks will likely face the largest reduction in habitat suitability, whilst many species in the small wading bird guild will likely benefit from the new scenarios (

 <xref rid="pone.0192702.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] has been related to steep declines in several dabbling ducks preferentially selecting deep waters (e.g., common teal

 <xref rid="pone.0192702.ref062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. There has also been a decline in the common pochard (
 <italic class="italic">Aythya ferina</italic>), and in the red-crested pochard (
 <italic class="italic">Netta rufina</italic>), which were formerly the two most common diving ducks breeding in Doñana, and are currently uncommon breeders [
 <xref rid="pone.0192702.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. The crested coot (
 <italic class="italic">Fulica cristata</italic>) is another example of a vegetation gleaner showing a population decline, as has occurred with the white headed duck (

 <xref rid="pone.0192702.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. The few exceptions to this general agreement with our predictions mainly concern large wading birds, for which habitat suitability is expected to decrease, but whose current population trends are showing a steep increase in breeding numbers [
