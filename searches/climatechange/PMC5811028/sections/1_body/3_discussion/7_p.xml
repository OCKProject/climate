<p class="p">From the local to the global scale, management actions should consider prospective exercises aimed at disentangling population responses to changing environmental conditions. Here, we modelled waterbird presence as a proxy for habitat suitability through a single annual cycle. However, this parameter does not necessarily reflect all the requirements of different species and associations between environmental variables and waterbird presence could vary interannually. Future studies could extend our assessment of habitat use by focusing on habitat quality, for example by including measures of breeding success, survival rates, body size, and energy intake [

Uncertainty will always be a factor in research on waterbirds and their complex and dynamic systems. The challenge is to use the available data to produce scientifically sound approaches to identifying key issues of waterbird conservation. Such findings may be subsequently readdressed, reevaluated, and even refuted by incorporating additional information whenever available.
