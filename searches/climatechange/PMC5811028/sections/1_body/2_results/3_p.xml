<p class="p">Predicted changes in habitat suitability were on average similar for threatened vs. non-threatened species. In both cases, only 20% of the species may benefit from climate-driven changes in environmental conditions. However, resident species and those that breed in the wetland network (particularly those that are already threatened) will likely be more impacted than wintering species (one-way ANOVA, F

From a horizon-scanning perspective, 71% of currently non-endangered diving birds, 50% of vegetation gleaners and 33% of large wading birds will be negatively impacted within the predicted scenarios. In contrast, ca. 26% of currently threatened, small wading bird species will likely benefit from predicted environmental changes (
