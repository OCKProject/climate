<p class="p">Model predictions for habitat suitability agreed between modelling techniques, particularly in the ‘worst’ climatic scenario (Pearson’s r = 0.58, 0.78 and 0.79, for CC10, CC30 and CC50, respectively). Overall, habitat suitability was expected to be negatively impacted by climatic-driven environmental changes for an average of 62% of waterbird species (negative impacts predicted by both GAMs and BRTs), whereas ca. 23% of the species could benefit from future conditions (positive impacts predicted by both GAMs and BRTs,

Diving birds and vegetation gleaners showed the largest reductions in habitat suitability, while small wading birds and dabbling ducks made up the larger proportion of species that could benefit from climate-driven environmental change (
