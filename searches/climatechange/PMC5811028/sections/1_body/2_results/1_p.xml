<p class="p">The environmental features that best explain waterbird presence at the point-count were water salinity, water depth, waterbody isolation and hydroperiod duration (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0192702.t003" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). In turn, these variables were also those most likely to be affected by climate-driven changes in water budgets. However, the GAM estimated coefficients and the BRT relative importance for these key environmental predictors clearly differed among waterbird species and guilds (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0192702.s001" class="xref">S1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0192702.s002" class="xref">S2</xref> Tables). Overall, water salinity was highlighted as the main environmental predictor for the whole waterbird assemblage regardless of the statistical procedure considered (i.e., GAMs or BRTs; see

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0192702.s002" class="xref">S2</xref> Tables). Fishing birds and small wading birds were clearly associated with the highest salinities (tidal areas and salt pans). In contrast, vegetation gleaners and diving birds preferentially used permanent (longer hydroperiods) and deep waterbodies with the lowest salinities (fresh water). Large wading birds inhabit preferentially shallow and permanent waterbodies with a large range of salinities, whereas dabbling ducks mainly occurred in deep but ephemeral waterbodies with intermediate salinities. Finally, raptor distributions were mainly influenced by waterbody isolation. These results were consistent with those obtained from the independent dataset (see
