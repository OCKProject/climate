<p class="p">We used the final GAMs and BRTs for each species to make new predictions of probability of occurrence at the point-count in the three new scenarios. We assumed that the mean probability of occurrence for each waterbird species was a proxy for habitat suitability for that particular species. Climate-driven changes in habitat suitability were then calculated as
