<p class="p">Expected climate-driven changes for the Mediterranean basin will likely affect water budgets in wetlands through increasing temperatures (and hence evapotranspiration) and decreasing precipitation ([

 <xref rid="pone.0192702.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>] and, ultimately, changing the habitat available for waterbirds species. Averaged and smoothed regional projections of climate change in the study area predict a reduction in precipitation and an increase in temperature ranging from 10â€“50% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192702.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). Despite the lack of quantitative models linking climate change with environmental predictors for waterbirds, we considered changes in environmental variables of a similar magnitude to those predicted for climatic variables. Accordingly, we generated three different scenarios of 10%, 30%, and 50% of change in salinity, water depth, hydroperiod, and wetland isolation (hereafter, CC10, CC30 and CC50, respectively). We applied these changes to all waterbodies except to tidal and managed wetlands (e.g. saltpans) where water budgets and associate parameters are largely controlled by tidal processes and human activities, respectively.
