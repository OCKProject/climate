<p class="p">Some of the habitat features measured in-situ were highly correlated. To avoid issues related to collinearity in the models, a subset of uncorrelated variables was therefore selected based on their ecological relevance and susceptibility to climate-driven changes in water budgets (i.e., increasing evapotranspiration and decreasing precipitation regime). Among environmental predictors, we selected mean water depth, annual mean water salinity, hydroperiod duration, occurrence of muddy areas, aquatic vegetation (emergent, floating and submerged), the percentage of wetlands within a 10-km buffer (hereafter waterbody isolation) and the relative surface flooded (see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0192702.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref> for full description of predictor variables). Models also included the date (days from January 1
