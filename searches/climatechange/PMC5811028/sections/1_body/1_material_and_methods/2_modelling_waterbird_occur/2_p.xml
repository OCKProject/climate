<p class="p">We considered that species occurrence at a point-count is the result of two processes: waterbird presence and detectability (i.e., the species has to be present at the point but must also be detected). We were mainly interested in habitat features that determine waterbird presence but correcting for environmental factors that may influence their detectability at a specific time and location (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0192702.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Environmental factors influencing waterbird detectability were studied first by adjusting a number of GAMs with “species richness” (total number of species observed in each point-count) as the response variable. The rationale behind this criterion is that factors influencing waterbird detectability must also have an effect on species richness. As the meteorological variables that could affect waterbird detectability (i.e., sunny weather, presence of clouds, rain and fog, see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0192702.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) were highly correlated, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed to reduce the number of dimensions to two axes (PC1 and PC2 accounting for 91% of explained variance). PC1 (82%) mainly distinguished between cloudy (positive values) and sunny days (negative values), whereas PC2 (9%) differentiated between rainy (negative values) and partially cloudy days (positive values). These models indicated that the most relevant predictors of species richness and, therefore, waterbird detectability included observer identity, time of the day (accounting for daily patterns in waterbird activity) and the meteorological PC2 (henceforth called ‘detectability factors’). These parameters were forced in the subsequent species-specific models so that detectability effects were accounted for in the null model before establishing the species association with habitat features.
