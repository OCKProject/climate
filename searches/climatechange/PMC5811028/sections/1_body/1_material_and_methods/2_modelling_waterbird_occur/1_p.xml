<p class="p">Species-specific modelling of waterbird occurrence and associations with habitat features and environmental characteristics of wetlands were conducted using two types of statistical models: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and Boosted Regression Trees (BRTs). We selected these two methods because GAMs are better at modelling gradual non-linear responses to environmental predictors while BRTs are better at modelling non-gradual responses. Forecasts for each species may vary among modelling techniques, thus by using two very different statistical models (GAM and BRT) we expected to capitalize on their relative strengths [
