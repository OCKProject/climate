<p class="p">We built GAMs for each single species using the occurrence at a point-count as the response variable. Model fitting started from a null model that included, as explanatory variables, all detectability factors and added new variables following a forward-backward stepwise variable selection procedure based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) AIC is known to render large models, but we were interested in building final models that were as simple as possible to examine the environmental variables most clearly related to each species’ occurrence and to avoid the risk of overfitting. Thus, we performed a deviance analysis on the resulting models to retain only those habitat predictors with significant effects once detectability factors were corrected for. BRTs were fitted by including all identified detectability factors and habitat predictors that were found to be significant in GAM models (note that this technique is immune to overfitting). The same GAM procedure was applied to an independent, coarser, but longer time series based on 3614 monthly censuses at 109 different wetlands within the same study area and during four consecutive annual cycles (2004–2009, provided by the “Consejería de Medio Ambiente”; Andalusian government). In this way, we aimed to validate the general results and the robustness of model outputs on habitat associations obtained from our own point-counts (see
