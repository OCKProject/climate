This is because direct anthropogenic impacts, such as water extraction and pollution, may be exacerbated by a climate-driven reduction in the water budget (i.e., increasing evapotranspiration and decreasing precipitation regimes), as predicted for mid-latitude regions such as the Mediterranean basin [
