<p class="p">Waterbirds have become a ‘flagship community’ for leveraging management strategies for the conservation of wetlands, especially under the current context of rapid environmental change [

 <xref rid="pone.0192702.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. In part, this is because waterbird communities, which are composed of species with different ecological needs and conservation requirements, are extremely sensitive to changes in the availability of suitable and heterogeneous wetland habitats [
 <xref rid="pone.0192702.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>,

 <xref rid="pone.0192702.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. The net consequences of climate and human impacts for the waterbird community remain unclear, however, as responses to environmental perturbations are expected to be species-specific [
 <xref rid="pone.0192702.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>,

 <xref rid="pone.0192702.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] and even site-specific [

 <xref rid="pone.0192702.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Seasonal migratory movements may complicate this picture, as wetlands are used at different times by different waterbird species for reproduction, migratory stopover, or winter refuge over the course of their annual cycles [

 <xref rid="pone.0192702.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Environmental conditions can also fluctuate seasonally [

 <xref rid="pone.0192702.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], thus resulting in varying resource and habitat availability for waterbirds throughout the year [
 <xref rid="pone.0192702.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Finally, species co-occurring in space and time throughout the annual cycle may have different conservation requirements [
 <xref rid="pone.0192702.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Thus, prospective exercises aimed at horizon-scanning waterbird responses to climate- and human-driven environmental changes should combine accurate knowledge of environmental factors structuring waterbird communities with knowledge about species requirements throughout the annual cycle [
