  <title class="title">Habitat associations from an independent dataset.</title>
  <p class="p">Analyses on habitat associations for the waterbird community using an independent, coarser, but longer time series on monthly surveys within the same study area and for four consecutive annual cycles (2004â€“2009). These analyses were used to validate the general results and the robustness of model outputs on habitat associations obtained from our own point-counts.</p>
