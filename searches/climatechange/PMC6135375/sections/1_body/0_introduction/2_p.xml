<p class="p">Having knowledge of the distribution and the niche of a species is important because such information is critical in ecological research and, without a doubt, for effective methods for biological conservation. Ignorance of the distribution of a species prevents us from knowing their history or what resources it uses, or how variations in birth rate, mortality and migration affect certain populations. It also prevents us from knowing the action and the effect of intra- and interspecific interactions on it, and of the environment as well.</p>
