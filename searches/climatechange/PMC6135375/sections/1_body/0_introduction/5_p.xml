<p class="p">Although desirable, knowing the exact distribution of a species is impractical and unrealistic. Timed collections, while effective, are lengthy and burdensome, especially in times of ecological crisis where environmental habitats are at serious risk of disappearing in relatively short time. Therefore, the use and application of ecological niche modeling (ENMs) are justifiable, especially because of their ability to generate habitat suitability areas hypotheses based on the probable relationship between certain environmental variables and the occurrence sites of species studied [
