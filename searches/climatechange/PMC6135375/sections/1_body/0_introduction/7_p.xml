<p class="p">Based on the geographical distribution of ceratophrids currently available, we verified if the protected areas in South America were effective at holding the distribution of the territory of this amphibian species, especially because the anthropic impact in its environmental. Furthermore, we sought to know the habitat suitability area of family representatives and how and why this area changed across the time. We also seek evidences about the effect of global warming on species distribution in the coming decades and what can be done to mitigate or perhaps avoid any possible reduction in the area of distribution of these animals in the near future.</p>
