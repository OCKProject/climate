<p class="p">Although known for nearly three hundred years, our knowledge and comprehension about the geographical distribution of species of the family Ceratophryidae leaves much to be desired [

 <xref rid="pone.0202813.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. What we know about them is restricted to sparse information on their feeding habits, reproduction and development of a few species [
