<p class="p">Different from the other Ceratophryidae species, 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">crawelli</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">calcarata</italic> are expected to demonstrate hyper-expansions of their areas of habitat suitability in the next 62 years that will greatly exceed their present distributionsâ€“extending even further than they did during the last glacial maximum. That predicted hyper-expansion is explained in our model by variations in minimum temperatures during the coldest and driest months.
