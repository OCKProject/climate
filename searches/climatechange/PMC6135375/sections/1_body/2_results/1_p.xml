<p class="p">The niche ecological models produced for eleven species of ceratophrids—across subsets of environmental variables of the past, present and future—resulted in a total of 55 predictions (more 33 maps of ecological reserves, whose areas were geometrically extracted of the input features). In the ‘distributions’ generated, the area potentially occupied by species (during some moments in history) showed some interesting variations throughout in time and of the geographical space.</p>
