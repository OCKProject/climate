<p class="p">The Earth's climate, consequently its biosphere, has undergone profound changes due to the Pleistocene glaciations that occurred over the last few thousand years. Given the current concerns about future extinctions in the tropics, it is prudent to examine with special attention the effects of climate fluctuations on the diversity and distribution of species, both in the past and especially in the future, because the decrease in current estimates of biodiversity, caused by habitat destruction and emission of greenhouse gases, are comparable to estimated reductions during glacial intervals [

Therefore, this would justify making a parallel between the likely effects of current climate change on biodiversity with those that occurred during the Quaternary without running the risk of making erroneous observations and arriving at false conclusions.
