<p class="p">Many transformations occurred in the paleovegetation of South America during glacial periods to interglacial and vice versa, with faunas and floras receding and expanding their ranges over time as a result of global climate change. For the Ceratophryidae, this was no different and necessarily such cycles (retraction and expansion) can will happen again, with possible worsening because of the result of human activity in this century, an at a much shorter period of time than that observed during the Quaternary, something that will be greatly detrimental to the survival of ceratophrids and that also can cause extinction of others species, an event comparable only those that have already occurred during the Permo-Triassic and Cretaceous-Tertiary [
