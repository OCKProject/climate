<p class="p">When developing public policies for the demarcation of environmental reserve areas, the last thing that is contemplated is if the geographical space is appropriate or not for the viability of populations of species, whether animal or plant. This is a subject that does not arouse much interest or popular mobilization, so the areas are generally designed with regard to tourism potential and fitted to private property areas and/or land of economic interest [

Moreover, with a serious aggravating future, environmental reserves may give way with changes in economic interests and also increased demands for resources. This will aggravate even further the problem of the conservation of species and generate a serious impasse; therefore, to be viable, the environmental preservation/conservation areas will need to be adjusted as the spatial distribution of biodiversity changes in the near future [
 <xref rid="pone.0202813.ref086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>]. This will be necessary if we want these reserves to be functional by offering guarantees of future existence of the species they harbor and consequently also for future generations of humans. But how will this be possible with the massive and continuous destruction of habitats?
