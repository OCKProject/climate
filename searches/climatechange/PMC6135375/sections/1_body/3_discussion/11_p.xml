<p class="p">Much of the optimism of our future projections for ceratophrids are, at best, unlikely scenarios, especially when considering the rapid pace of degradation of habitats and the lack of effectiveness of environmental preservation/conservation areas in the long term [

This leads us to conclude that although we may consider a likely limit to the future expansion of distribution for these amphibians, our results suggest a broad expansion of dry climates in South America in the XXII century and hence retraction of forested environments, similar to what occurred during the Pleistocene [
