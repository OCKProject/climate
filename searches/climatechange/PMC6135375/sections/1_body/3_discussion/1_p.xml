<p class="p">First, we must point out something important about our results. The data are treated here in a superficial time plan, that is, in a relatively short period of time. This means that comparisons between the effects of climate change in South America since the Last interglacial and up to the year 2080 are not as absurd or disparate as they may seem, because the species treated here are the link between these two historical moments and can be easily inserted into the current diversity and biogeography as in the Quaternary without major problems [
