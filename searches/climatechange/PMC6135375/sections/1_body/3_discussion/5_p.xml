<p class="p">The Quaternary was characterized by fairly rapid climate fluctuations, where it affect the distribution of faunas and floras, extinguished many species (mainly mammals and birds) and gave rise to many others in less than a million years [

For ceratophrids, it is possible that they were already well adapted when they survived the changes of the Quaternary, responding to them with few extinctions and following the dynamics of biomes with which they remained associated and seemingly dependent on for millennia [
