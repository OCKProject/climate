<p class="p">In the particular case of ceratophrids, according to our results, by the year 2080, most of the distribution area of 50% of these frog species will be still included in environmental preservation/conservation areas, which means that half of them will not be vulnerable in the next 65 years. However, this situation becomes alarming when considering habitat destruction coupled with the lack of legal support of protected areas, and in this case, it is very possible that four species will be almost extinct by the turn of this century:

 <italic class="italic">stolzmanni</italic> (see data of the IUCN). If there is a possibility of this happening to ceratophrids, animals that are well adapted to water stress (because of climate changes over the past 140 000 years), the chances of other species of the global amphibiofauna of becoming extinct or extremely vulnerable are much higher. Recent studies showed that the world herpetofauna will endure large losses by 2080 due to global climate change, disease and defaunation caused by humans [
