 <xref rid="pone.0202813.ref061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. In the latter case, we can locate almost all ceratophrids that in response to Quaternary climatic fluctuations increased their area of habitat suitability (probably the effective occupation area) in the glacial phase, something very well represented in our projections. During the Last glacial maximum, the temperature was milder and the dry areas much larger. In contrast, during the wet stages (interglacial), we observed shrinkage of the distribution areas of these species of frogs, which indicates a higher relation of these amphibians to the steppe grasslands than rainforests.
