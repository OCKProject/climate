Because it is not so simple to discriminate these components, much caution is necessary in the use of projections to indicate a land mass as an effective occupation area of a particular species, either in the past or in the present [

Having secured this, our models showed fluctuations in precipitation affecting the area of habitat suitability of almost all species of ceratophrids during the Last interglacial, remaining an important variable, less in present day, and it seems that it will also be in the coming decades. In contrast, we found that temperature had effected on these toads regarding ‘occupation area’ during the Last glacial maximum, where we found a greater territorial expansion compared to today and the Last interglacial.
