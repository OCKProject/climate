<p class="p">The survival of the human species will require a new social model that is based on cooperativity, the responsible and equitable distribution of resources, as well as an education based on the real needs of human society and other species. This will force us to think differently, to reshape our interpersonals relations and to see nature, not as a thing which we preyed upon for centuries, but as a part of ourselves. Only then can we ensure a future not only for ceratophrids but also for all other species and ecosystems.</p>
