<p class="p">While we can look at the past and imagine detailed scenarios, it is difficult to predict how ceratophrids, and also many other amphibians [
 <xref rid="pone.0202813.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>], will react to environmental change and the gradual increase in temperature as a result of current climate changeâ€”probably aggravated by humans. During the glacial phase, the temperature was milder compared to interglacial periods and in these two stages, there was no environmental degradation on a scale as fast, deep and broad as currently observed. This, by itself, unlike today, already provided a good chance of survival to many animal and plant species. Thus, based on this perspective, it may be that the possible expansion of distribution areas proposed by our models is false positive indicators of the future of ceratophrids instead of representing truly optimistic scenarios for them. On this account, it may be that those new areas cannot be colonized by these amphibians. For example, while a cougar can walk kilometers after kilometers, and thus access to new areas, the same is not valid for most toads. In this case, we recommend that the projections be viewed with caution and not as empirical evidence in treating the future of these animals because of the possible overestimated probabilities in P
