<p class="p">In our study the climatic data of the past, present and future are continuous variables that are part of GIS layers obtained from the WorldClim portal [
 <xref rid="pone.0202813.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. They were derived from the monthly temperature and rainfall values in order to generate more biologically meaningful variables. In our study, the bioclimatic variables represent annual trends (e.g., mean annual temperature, annual precipitation) seasonality (e.g., annual range in temperature and precipitation) and extreme or limiting environmental factors (e.g., temperature of the coldest and warmest month, and precipitation of the wet and dry quarters).
