<p class="p">The distribution study of the species of Ceratophryidae in paleoclimatic conditions was conducted in the GIS layers of the Last interglacial (~ 120 000â€“140 000 BP) and the Last glacial maximum (~ 21 000 years BP). The first layer is in a resolution of 30 arc-seconds [
 <xref rid="pone.0202813.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>], the other at 2.5 arc-minutes. The latter was generated by the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase II (PMIP2). The original data was made available by CMIP5, being downscaled and calibrated (bias corrected) using WorldClim 1.4 as baseline 'current' climate. We performed this analysis in attempt to verify how the area of habitat suitability of ceratophrids probably changed (shifted, widened or decreased) over time. This information is of great importance for large-scale conservation plans, since it is predictive of key regions where species are likely to suffer the effects of habitat destruction [
