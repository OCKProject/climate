 <xref rid="pone.0202813.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>], we decided to apply the term areapause to spatial limits (outlines) of the suitable area of the species. The proposal of this new term, inspired in the astronomical term heliopause, suggests that the distribution is stopped because of some ecological pressure and because the species is no longer able to adjust to certain areas of the geographical space. Areapause is a virtual term to the most outer border of the distribution (varying according of method and descriptors). Different factors can determine the spatial limit of the distribution of a species. In our study, it was shown by potential distribution, indicted by abiotic factors, here designed through of climatic variablesâ€”Grinnellian niche [
