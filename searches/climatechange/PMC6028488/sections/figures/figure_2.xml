  <p class="p">Contributions for different timings of potential losses in a game with up to four rounds. In a game with Ω rounds, for four different risk curves, we show the average contributions of two players (large panels) and the resulting risk probability (small panels) with a potential loss in 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold> every round, 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> the first round, 
   <bold class="bold">c</bold> the last round, or 
   <bold class="bold">d</bold> a random round. It is assumed that individuals lose everything, i.e., 
   <italic class="italic">α</italic> = 1 for all individuals. 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold> Multiple losses in the four-round game lead to increased contributions, in particular in the first round. 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> If the risk is only present in the first round, no further contributions emerge, as expected. 
   <bold class="bold">c</bold> if the risk is only present in the last round
