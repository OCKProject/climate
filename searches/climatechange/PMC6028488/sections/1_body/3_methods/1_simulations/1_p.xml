 </sup>. This means players do not know the structure of the game and cannot apply advanced reasoning about their possible actions. Instead, each individual has a fixed mode of behavior, i.e. it follows a certain contribution behavior that only depends on the previous total contributions. Individuals play many games and their success in these games determines how likely it is that their strategy will be adopted by the future generation. The outcome of each interaction depends on the strategy used by each player, which is hard-coded for any individual

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>,

 </sup>. Each strategy is defined by a threshold, 
 <italic class="italic">τ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 </sub> (that depends on the collective contributions accumulated over all rounds so far, 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 </sub>) and the contributions above and below the threshold for each round (
 <italic class="italic">τ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 </sub>; 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 </sub>, 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 </sub>). Thus, an individual will contribute an amount 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 </sub> if 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 </sub> ≤ 
 <italic class="italic">τ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 </sub> and 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">r</italic>

  <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 </sub> &gt; 
 <italic class="italic">τ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 </sub>. As an example, consider a game with two players and two rounds and no risk, 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic> = 2 and Ω = 2. The strategy of player one is {(0.0;0.1,0.0), (0.2;0.1,0.5)}, where the first set of three numbers definesthe strategy in the first round and the second set of three numbers defines the strategy in the second round. Player two has strategy {(0.1;0.5,0.1)
 <sub class="sub">round1</sub>, (0.7;0.2,0.5)
 <sub class="sub">round2</sub>}. Since the pot is empty in round 1 (
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> = 0), we have 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> ≤ 
 <italic class="italic">τ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> for player one, who thus invests 0.1. For player two, we also have 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> ≤ 
 <italic class="italic">τ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>, which leads to an investment of 0.5. Thus, in round 2 we have a pot of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> = 0.6. Consequently, for player one 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> &gt; 
 <italic class="italic">τ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, which results in an investment of 0.5. For player two, we have 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> ≤ 
 <italic class="italic">τ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> results an investment of 0.2. As a result, the total investment after two rounds is 1.2. Thus, player one obtains a payoff of 1 − 0.1 − 0.5 = 0.4 and player two 1 − 0.5 − 0.2 = 0.3. Players cannot spend more than what they have, we do not allow negative payoffs.
