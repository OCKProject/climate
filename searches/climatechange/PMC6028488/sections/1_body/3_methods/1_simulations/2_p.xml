<p id="Par21" class="p">In one generation, many games with several rounds 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 1,2,...,Ω are played between groups of individuals chosen at random (herein we typically concentrate on the two-player game, but in methods we show that this is not a fundamental restriction of our model; see Methods section: Group Size). Each individual’s final payoff, 
 <italic class="italic">π</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">i</italic>
 </sub>, is then calculated as the average payoff of all games played by the individual in that generation. This payoff 
 <italic class="italic">π</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">i</italic>
 </sub> is translated into a fitness value 
 <italic class="italic">f</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">i</italic>
 </sub> = exp[
 <italic class="italic">π</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">i</italic>
 </sub>]
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>
 </sup>. Since payoff determines fitness, this means that the strategy that incurs the highest payoffs also has the highest probability of being transferred into the next generation.
