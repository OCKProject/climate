 </sup>, we also analyze the expected contributions under wealth inequality and risk asymmetries for a one-round game. This method has broad applications, it allows us to understand the effect of general risk functions and their implications if we implement them into experimental setup. These experimental and theoretical insights could then be used to extrapolate how changes in perceived risk could affect climate change negotiations. This general framework can be applied to any risk function as has been previously demonstrated for a homogeneous situation

Since the heterogenous setup of the game is inherently complex, we limit our analysis to the single round setup and consider a 2 player game, and ask how much would a focal player
