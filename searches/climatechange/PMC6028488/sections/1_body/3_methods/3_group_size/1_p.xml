<p id="Par28" class="p">While we concentrate on the case of 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic> = 2 in the main text, our model allows for various group sizes. We find that large groups of such as 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic> = 8 players typically contribute less than two-player groups in a single round game (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> versus Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). However, the multi-loss game quenches the group size effects (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1a</xref>). Thus, just like the inclusion of time in general collective-risk, facilitates coordination
