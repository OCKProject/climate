<p id="Par3" class="p">Collectively working to manage climate change is one of the most difficult social challenges we face today. It is imperative to find a solution, because failing can mean disaster for our own future and generations to come. However, in spite of the obvious consequences, achieving cooperation at the global level remains a challenge because individuals are tempted to reduce their efforts while taking advantage of everyone else’s contributions

 </sup>. Such selfish behavior lies at the core of the tragedy of the commons—a classic problem showing how the pursuit of individual gain leads to the overexploitation of a resource

 </sup>. Social dilemmas are often modeled as public goods games where individuals decide to contribute to a collective good. Each individual receives a benefit that depends linearly on the total contributions

 </sup>. But in light of dangerous climate change, the typical linear public good game is insufficient and, thus, the collective-risk game with multiple rounds, threshold effects and partial returns was devised

 </sup>. Contrary to the usual case of a collective benefit, this game is concerned with the prevention of a collective loss. The collective-risk game is usually played over several rounds. In each round, individuals must decide how much they contribute to a public good. If the total contributions exceed a specified target amount, the risk of a collective loss vanishes. In contrast, failure to reach the target implies that individuals lose all their belongings with some probability. This setup is motivated by dangerous climate change, “the game we cannot afford to lose”
