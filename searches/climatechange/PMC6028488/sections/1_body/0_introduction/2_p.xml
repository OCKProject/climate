 </sup>: loss is devastating because individuals are deprived of all their possessions, risk is typically characterized by threshold effects, and a single potential loss occurs at the end of the game. However, real global scale environmental crises that may be triggered by climatic events—ranging from devastating heat waves, storms, floods or droughts over shifts in monsoonal precipitation patterns to a collapse of parts of the Antarctic or Greenland ice sheets—are currently unpredictable with respect to their impact and timing. Also, in the context of climate change, there is an ongoing discussion about predicting when and how drastic the effects will be
