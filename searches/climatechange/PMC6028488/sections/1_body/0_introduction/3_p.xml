<p id="Par5" class="p">To shed further light on cooperative behavior given such uncertainty, we develop a collective-risk game where multiple losses can occurâ€”similar to the experiment by Milinski et al.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>
 </sup> where losses may happen in every round when an intermediate target is missed. Having a potential loss in every round also introduces situations where losses are not devastating, i.e., individuals do not lose everything. In contrast to the typical single catastrophic event that leads to full losses and the sudden termination of the game

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>
 </sup>, we further explore the effects when a loss occurs at a fixed time, such as the start or end of a game, or at a random time, where individuals do not know if and when a disaster will occur. In addition, we consider factors that play a key role in decision making: wealth inequality, heterogeneity in risk probability and heterogeneity in the distribution of individuals within a group. In such collective-risk dilemmas, heterogeneity, risk, and coordination play a large role in decision making

 </sup>. Most often, heterogeneity renders negative outcomes. Since nations and individuals vary on several factors, it is difficult to assess which of these factors has the largest influence on climate change decisions. For instance it is unclear how individuals should interact under wealth inequality: previous work has shown that the amount of contributions also depends on the shape of the risk function
