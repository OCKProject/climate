<p id="Par9" class="p">In our model, contributions help avoid a collective loss in each future round of the game. Contributions made early on in the game are not in vain, as they reduce the risk of events leading to a loss in future rounds—but they cannot recover what has already been lost in earlier rounds. Thus, it would be socially optimal to contribute as early as possible and to distribute contributions evenly among players

 </sup> to understand and identify the set of stable contributions under various risk scenarios. This implies that we focus on stationary solutions of the behavior dynamics in a large population (typically 100 individuals) from individuals interacting in groups within a game (to disentangle group effects from risk effects we first focus on the pair-wise case,

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>)). Evolutionary stability implies that a player with an altered contribution scheme would have a lower payoff and thus be less successful

 </sup>. In the case of the rich and a poor scenario, the evolutionary processes are independent—we assume two distinct populations. This setup ensures that poor players will preferentially adopt behaviors that have been beneficial for other poor players, but not try to imitate the behaviors of rich players (and vice versa).
