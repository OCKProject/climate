<p id="Par15" class="p">Qualitatively, the game with multiple losses elicits a similar temporal pattern of contributions as the game where the loss occurs in the first round (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a, b</xref>). The game where the loss event is in the last round elicits a similar amount of contributions as the game where the potential loss event is in a random round—unless there is a threshold effect where players tend to increase their contributions over time when the loss event happens in the last round. However, the timing for these contributions differs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c, d</xref>). In the game where a climatic event is fixed to the last round, we recover wait and see behavior
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>
 </sup> or the Schelling behavior of equal contributions across all rounds
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>
 </sup>. When the occurrence of a loss is predetermined and exhibits strong threshold effects, individuals can time their contributions and only contribute in the round just before the expected loss. Moving beyond this particular case, we find that act quickly is most robust instead. Furthermore, our results show that one should not only act early, but also contribute sufficiently to ensure protection in the future.
