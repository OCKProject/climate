<p id="Par14" class="p">So far, we have studied the case of a potential loss in every round of the game, including the possibility of recurrent events. However, the actual timing of catastrophic events associated with climate change is still controversial

 </sup>. These studies have found that low and intermediate loss probabilities lead to a withdrawal of effort by individuals. To put these findings into perspective, we explore the effects of different timings of losses on contributions. In addition to a potential loss event in every round or only in the last round, we now consider scenarios with a potential loss only in the first round or in a single random unknown round within the game. The random round captures, most closely, our current state since the true timing of when climate change will lead to catastrophic losses is unknown

 </sup>. It seems natural to assume that individuals will behave as if climate events hit at random times.
