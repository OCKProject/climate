<p id="Par13" class="p">In the case of linear risk curves and multiple rounds, intermediate-sized losses elicit sizable contributions (for linear risk curves with very steep slopes, contributions are reduced accordingly (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Similar effects on contributions occur using power function risk curves. Furthermore, linear and power function risk curves illustrate that contributions can be largest at intermediate values of 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>, if contributions have only small effects on the probability to lose, or, if it requires a lot of effort to reduce risk. Intuitively, the prospect of having nothing left depresses cooperative effort when risk is high. By comparison, contributions for risk curves with threshold are increasing in 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). This curve shows that in the one-round game contributions are low when risk curves start at low risk for low contributions (small 
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>), but in the four-round game reach those of the curves with high initial risk, provided 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> is large (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1d</xref>). Interestingly, we find that for the game with multiple losses, high risk probability at low contributions and full losses are not necessary to observe cooperative behavior.
