<p id="Par12" class="p">High values of 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> imply that contributions are beneficial because large potential losses can be avoided. Consequently, contributions tend to increase with 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b, c</xref>). At high 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> individuals contribute approximately half of their endowment in two-round games with linearly declining risks. They tend to give slightly more if threshold effects are present. Moreover, individuals succeed in eliminating risk almost entirely when this can be achieved with relatively little effort. If 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> is small, losses are minor—individual contributions, therefore, remain relatively low. Intermediate values of 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> lead to differentiated amounts of contributions, because of the complex interactions between the fraction of wealth lost and the risk curve. This effect becomes especially apparent in the four-round game (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1d</xref>). Moreover, the longer the game lasts, the more individuals contribute at intermediate values of 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>—it can even make sense to contribute less if 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> increases, as some risk curves demand such high contributions that the remaining wealth becomes negligible and it is beneficial to maintain higher risks. However, as the number of rounds increases, intermediate losses may accumulate over the course of the game, adding up to a large overall loss. The effects of timing have only recently become apparent, experimental evidence and theoretical framework all pointing to the trend that increasing round number increases cooperation
