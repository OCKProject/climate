<p id="Par11" class="p">It is clear that risk can influence cooperative behavior in various ways. However, in reality the precise shape of the risk curve is unclear. For example, climate scientists generally do not agree on the exact position of thresholds and how steep the change in risk is

 </sup>. To take this ambiguity into account, we vary the shapes of our risk curves. This also allows us to better understand how certain risk curve characteristics affect contributions. For example, how are contributions influenced by sudden changes in risk or by risk that does not decrease much with collective effort?
