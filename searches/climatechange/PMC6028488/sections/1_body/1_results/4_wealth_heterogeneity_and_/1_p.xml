<p id="Par16" class="p">Up to this point we have assumed that the risk perceived by the players is identical. This is far from the current situation where nations are impacted differently from one another, for instance a climate disaster can affect poor nations at a greater magnitude than rich nations. We incorporate influential factors such as wealth inequality and heterogeneity in risks into our evolutionary model, as shown in the Methods section where a complete description of the methods is given and the full range of heterogeneity effects is explored. To put these findings into perspective, we explore the effects of heterogenous loss fractions across different timings of loss events. Intuitively, we expect that low values for the loss fraction 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> would reduce contributions while higher values should promote contributions irrespective of the heterogeneity between the players. However, the drastic effects of the timing of the events on contributions between rich and poor players was not as intuitive (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Random unpredictable-risk events increased overall contributions from the poor players relative to the game with a single predictable events (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a–d</xref>). Surprisingly, the games with multiple loss events resulted in higher contributions by the rich player even for low values of the loss fraction 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> ≤ 0.2. For high 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> and for multiple loss events the rich players contributed more than 60% of their initial wealth. Heterogeneity between players only re-emphasized act quickly behavior, which is most robust in the natural cases where multiple losses are possible or the event is unpredictable (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a, b</xref>). Just as in the homogenous case in the game where a climatic event is fixed to the last round, we recover the Schelling behavior of equal contributions across all rounds, (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4c</xref>)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>
 </sup>. For all other cases with uncertainty and heterogeneity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a, b, d</xref>), we find that act quickly is most robust.
