<p id="Par19" class="p">The framework presented here may bring us a step closer towards understanding the best actions of individuals in real and often complex situations such as the environmental and global challenges heading our way. In the case with multiple potential losses, failure to act collectively can have severe consequences. By the same token, failure to protect the climate can result in devastating losses. As we have seen in our model, multiple potential losses induce a very different kind of cooperative behavior, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>. However, multiple losses are not the only factors that affect decisions. One additional factor is group size, see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>, large groups typically reduce cooperation—but we show that timing can quench its effects
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>
 </sup>. Another additional factor is perceived risk, which strongly influences decision making. Our simulations show that wealth inequality can be the factor that may quench risk effects rather than hinder it, as shown in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>. Small differences in the risk perceived between parties can lead to negotiation failures for reducing global green house gas emissions; since some parties do not fear climate impact while others have had several drastic climatic events and thus consider risks in their decisions
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>
 </sup>. However, our results indicate that under risk heterogeneity, players with heterogeneous wealth contribute more than player of equal wealth, as observed in Supplementary Figures 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>. Unfortunately, including any form of heterogeneity, such as wealth inequality or risk asymmetries
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>
 </sup>, can complicate an already difficult situation even further. Differences in wealth can alter decisions because the diverse incentives cause overall uncertainty
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>
 </sup>; wealth inequality is usually associated with negative outcomes
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>
 </sup>, however, this also depends on whether subjects felt that this inequality is merited or not. For instance, privileged subjects that feel they were inappropriately endowed equalized their profits with the less fortunate subjects
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>
 </sup>. In contrast, subjects who justified their endowments made no efforts to equalize
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>
 </sup>. Here, we show that even in situations complicated with heterogeneity and uncertainty in the timing of losses, the trends remains the same: it is beneficial for individuals to increase their efforts from the start, ensuring that contributions are sufficient not only for now, but also in the future. Our model thus predicts that immediate climate action can be advantageous at the individual level for a wide range of risk and heterogeneous scenarios.
