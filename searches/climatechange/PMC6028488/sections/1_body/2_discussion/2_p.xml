<p id="Par18" class="p">Our general setup explores cases where the risk of a collective loss is unpredictable or can recur, and individuals can experience a range of mild and catastrophic scenarios, see Figs.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>. In contrast to wait and see, which is most successful for a game with a single loss in a fixed round (i.e., the timing of risk is known) and where the risk curve exhibits strong threshold effects, here we obtain an act quickly behavior where individuals reduce the risk by contributing a substantial amount in the first round. This is a striking difference between our current work and previous research on climate cooperation. Moreover, our results show that catastrophic scenarios are not necessary, as we observe contributions as long as individuals can make a difference and change the risk they face.
