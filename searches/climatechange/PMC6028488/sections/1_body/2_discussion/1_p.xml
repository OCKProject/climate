<p id="Par17" class="p">Many unsettled questions about climate change remain. In particular, it is unclear how fast the probability of severe climate change events declines for increasing event amplitudes. An intense event does not have to have a direct effect on losses and may only affect individuals in the distant future. Further uncertainties in the risk probability can manifest because of uncertainties regarding the magnitude of destruction incurred by climate events or uncertainties about the appropriate discounting

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>
 </sup>. Taken together, these unsettled grounds give rise to a long chain of structural uncertainties
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>
 </sup>. To reflect some of these uncertainties, we have expanded on the typical assumptions of the literature on collective risk to capture some aspects of our current state. The collective-risk game was developed to study social dilemmas involving risk of a collective loss such as the mitigation of climate change effects
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>
 </sup>. A main conclusion drawn from this literature is that a high loss probability promotes contributions
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>
 </sup>. The collective-risk game became known as the climate game, but it assumed that there is a single loss in the last round of the game and that individuals lose all their belongings. This may be questionable in reality
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>â€“
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>
 </sup>. Thus, we have developed a collective-risk game where individuals are faced with the risk of a loss in each round, in a single fixed round or a random round. Another distinct characteristic of our game is that individuals may retain some of their belongings after an event.
