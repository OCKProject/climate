 <xref rid="B109-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">109</xref>], in comparing models to forecast salmonellosis cases in Adelaide (Australia) found decreased rainfall was associated with salmonellosis cases. It is possible that this finding was due to interaction with other variables such as temperature or the unique local climate [

 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B110-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">110</xref>] suggest that under extreme conditions, including drought, when the soil contains high concentrations of 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic> there may be greater internalization of the pathogen in lettuce relative to optimal irrigation conditions.
