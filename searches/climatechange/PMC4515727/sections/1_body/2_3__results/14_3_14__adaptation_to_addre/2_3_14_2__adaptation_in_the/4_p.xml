<p class="p">Water consumption can also be reduced by managing the timing of irrigation so that it targets the sensitive stages of crop development. In the case of corn, for example, yield losses may be reduced significantly by preventing water deficits at critical times in development; notably during the reproductive stages [

 <xref rid="B294-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">294</xref>]. Even when plants are subjected to drought conditions, the timing and duration of the event must also be considered since plant processes can often recover following a period of drought if critical management actions are taken at the correct time (e.g., irrigation during flowering). Water conservation strategies and the timing and use of water (water management and irrigation timing) represent simple solutions that can be managed in response to need, when and where required (

As such, farmers may need to balance trade-offs between production and the risk of drought in their choice of what to plant next season. Planting seeds representing a diversity of cultivar tolerance may prove beneficial in this case [
 <xref rid="B299-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">299</xref>]. The combined use of existing drought tolerant cultivars with physiologically sensitive timing of irrigation can serve to reduce water demands during key stages of development. Furthermore, since drought stressed plants and livestock are also more vulnerable to diseases, competition from invasive species and pests, strategies that increase genetic and crop diversity across fields and the landscape may represent adaptations that will provide overall benefits to both health and production [
