 <xref rid="B287-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">287</xref>]. A media analysis of adaptations undertaken in Canada during the 2001–2002 drought showed that the most frequently mentioned actions included measures related to irrigation, conservation and the management of water resources, insurance and other financial assistance programs (e.g., Canadian Farm Income Program, Net Income Stabilization Account), as well as government based low water responses [
 <xref rid="B288-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">288</xref>]. Irrigation in particular is one of the most broadly referenced agricultural adaptations to drought in the literature [
 <xref rid="B289-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">289</xref>]. The use of irrigation systems is increasing across Canada and irrigation is becoming more and more common in regions that had previously relied on rain and subsurface water (Saskatchewan has an Irrigation Strategy to grow and extend the use of irrigation across the province as part of their Water Security Plan

 <xref rid="B335-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">335</xref>]). In Prince Edward Island the growing reliance on irrigation in potato farming and requests for new deep well licenses created serious concerns regarding the sustainability of groundwater supplies and whether or not a moratorium instituted over a decade earlier was still required [

 <xref rid="B291-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">291</xref>]. In November, 2014, a decision was made to uphold the moratorium. In more arid regions where water supplies are finite, like the Okanagan region of southern British Columbia, water demands are managed through a combination of monitoring and management among users (e.g., managing water catchments, use of high elevation dams, reservoirs and instituting seasonal use restrictions). In Alberta’s Oldman Dam water shortages have even been managed using a system of “sharing the shortage” in which users agree to share the reduced allocation of water due to drought [
 <xref rid="B292-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">292</xref>]. In 2001, partial allotments of 60% were successfully used to ensure the delivery of water supplies to all licensees.
