 <xref rid="B130-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">130</xref>], but the relationships amongst mosquito abundance, infection prevalence, WNV risk and seasonal variations in drought and rainfall can be complex, geographically variable, habitat/environment-specific and difficult to predict [
 <xref rid="B131-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">131</xref>]. In addition to altering the mosquito vectorsâ€™ environment, drought can impact risk from mosquito-borne diseases by affecting contact rates between the vectors and reservoir hosts, thereby influencing the prevalence of infection in mosquitoes [

 <xref rid="B118-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">118</xref>]. Evidence for this mechanism comes particularly from studies on mosquito-bird transmitted viruses [

 <xref rid="B132-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">132</xref>]. In California (U.S.) drought may have contributed to an increase in human WNV cases by reducing populations of non-competent host birds, allowing for greater contact of mosquitoes with reservoir-competent host birds and possibly humans [
 <xref rid="B131-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">131</xref>]. In the southeastern U.S., SLE outbreaks are associated with rainfall following drought, which is largely due to the behavior of the main vector
