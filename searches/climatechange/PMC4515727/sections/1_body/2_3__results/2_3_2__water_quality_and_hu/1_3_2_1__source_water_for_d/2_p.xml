<p class="p">Nutrient-loading is known to lead to eutrophication and is associated with cyanobacterial (algal) bloom development in all provinces [
 <xref rid="B68-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. Some cyanobacteria produce toxins that are harmful to humans and blooms can impact water bodies used as sources of drinking water and for recreational water activities [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. In Nebraska (U.S.), for example, drought was considered a contributing factor to a cyanobacteria bloom in 2004 that resulted in reports to public health of impacts such as gastrointestinal illness and the issuance of health alerts and advisories for nearly 100 lakes [

 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B70-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>] carried out a hypothetical analysis of the vulnerability of Quebecâ€™s provincial drinking water systems to toxic cyanobacteria and their results suggest that existing systems in that province would be able to cope with this risk, even within the context of climate change. In Ontario, there was a significant increase in algal blooms between 1994 and 2009 [

Climate change may lead to changes in the frequency and duration of algal blooms, as well as increases in the amount of toxins they produce or an increase in the prevalence of toxin-producing species overall in temperate regions [

 <xref rid="B71-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. Warmer temperatures anticipated with climate change may promote algal blooms through mechanisms such as reducing the mixing of water, allowing algae to rise to the surface more quickly and by increasing the salinity of freshwater bodies [
