<p class="p">The combination of drought with extreme precipitation may also impact water-, food- and vector- borne diseases. The most commonly cited impact of climate change on water-borne disease is the anticipated effects of increasing frequencies and amounts of heavy rainfall impacting the likelihood that untreated and pathogen-carrying water is consumed by Canadians [
 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. Drought can amplify the impacts of a subsequent extreme rainfall event. During a drought event the soil can become compacted, thereby increasing runoff and the likelihood of water contamination and water-borne illness from precipitation events that follow [
