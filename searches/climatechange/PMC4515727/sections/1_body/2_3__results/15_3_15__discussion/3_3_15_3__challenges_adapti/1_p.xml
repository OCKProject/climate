<p class="p">Measures taken to adapt to drought between 2000 and 2006 over the Canadian Prairies were expensive, their effectiveness varied and challenges were associated with their implementation [

A number of barriers to agricultural adaptation to drought were highlighted during the drought of 2001â€“2002 in Canada, including the lack of research and a lack of funds, as well as problems relating to institutions and processes [
 <xref rid="B288-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">288</xref>]. A study of water management systems in the North American Pacific Northwest found that water management decisions were centred around an assumption of stable conditions and this was compounded by a lack of access to regionally specific climate information [
 <xref rid="B312-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">312</xref>]. Challenges have also been noted in simply obtaining high quality local hydrologic information from climate change datasets [

 <xref rid="B185-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">185</xref>,
 <xref rid="B313-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">313</xref>]. The paucity of such information makes it difficult for communities to develop more integrated climate adaptation plans which reduce drought risks.
