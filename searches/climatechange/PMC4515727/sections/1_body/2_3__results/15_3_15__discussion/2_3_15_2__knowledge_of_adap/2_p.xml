<p class="p">Potential adaptations to directly or indirectly reduce health risks from drought are plentiful, particularly those that address agricultural impacts of climate change and weather variability. Few adaptations are discussed specifically in the context of drought but are often put forward to address secondary concerns (e.g., vector-borne diseases). Factors influencing agriculture and agricultural practices are complex and sometimes contradictory, ranging from public level issues driven by policy, legislation and international agreements, to environmental and community issues relating to how land is used and the local impacts [
