 <xref rid="B47-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Pregnant women in their third trimester, diabetics and immunosuppressed individuals were thought to have increased risk of developing a disseminated case of Valley fever [

In addition to the very young (particularly those who have received rotavirus vaccines) and the elderly, those who are immunocompromised are at greater risk of developing acute gastrointestinal illness from water-borne diseases [
 <xref rid="B95-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">95</xref>]. Very young children and seniors overlap with those susceptible to heat as identified above and may also be at greater risk from decreases in water quality and availability [
 <xref rid="B60-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Children under five years of age and adults over 50 years old are also at increased risk of developing a disseminated case of Valley fever [

Drought can also lead to disruptions of heating and cooling systems that rely on water to function, and these disruptions may result in health impacts on individuals when it is not possible to maintain health-protective temperatures [
