<p class="p">Farther east, droughts do occur in southern Ontario and Quebec, although these events are usually shorter, smaller in area, less frequent and less intense [
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Nonetheless, there have been major drought occurrences in the East during the last century [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] resulting in severe impacts, including low water levels in the Great Lakes [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Between 1920 and 1999, southern Ontario experienced major droughts in 1930, 1933, 1934, 1936, 1963, 1998, and 1999 [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Ontario was also impacted by drought in 2001–2002 [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Great Lakes’ water levels have shown considerable decadal-scale variability during the 20th century with no evidence of any long-term trend. However, lower Great Lakes’ water levels have coincided with the droughts of the 1930s, early 1960s and from early 2000 to the present [
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>].In 2011, water levels in the Great Lakes–St. Lawrence Rivers system reached record low levels and some activities/sectors in Ontario watersheds were asked to reduce water consumption under the Ontario Low Water Response Plan (OLWR)[

 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] found that freshwater discharge rates decreased over a period of 37 years for the majority of key rivers feeding the Hudson, James and Ungava Bays. This watershed is fed by water from five provinces, the territory of Nunavut andfour U.S. states, covering an area that is equivalent to one-third of Canada [
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Along the East Coast, droughts in the Atlantic provinces are infrequent. However, a side effect of their rarity is that these regions have lower adaptive capacity to deal with droughts, making the region more susceptible to drought impacts [
 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. The Atlantic provinces were affected by the drought of 2001–2002, with river flows in the Atlantic Provinces dropping to a 20-year low [
