<p class="p">Canada is considered a country with abundant water resources; however, these resources and the demands on them are distributed unevenly across the country [
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] resulting in varied vulnerability to, and impacts from, drought. For example, 98% of the Canadian population resides in the South, which only provides 38% of the water yield (Water yield is the volume of freshwater resources for a defined geographic area and time period. It is an estimate of the amount of renewable water and non-renewable glacial melt) [
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. In the North, the per capita water yield is 98 times greater than in the South [
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The water yield in the Prairies is a fraction (3%â€“12%) of that in the Great Lakes, Maritime Coastal or Pacific Coastal drainage regions and decreased between 1971 and 2004 [
