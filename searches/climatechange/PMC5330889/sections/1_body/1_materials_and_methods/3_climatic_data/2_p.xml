<p class="p">We used 19 bioclimatic variables at a 5.0‐arc‐minute spatial resolution (often referred to as “100 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>” resolution) to visualize the climatic niches of AIWs and assess these climatic niches using climatic niche divergence analysis and habitat suitability modeling (Hijmans, Cameron, Parra, Jones, &amp; Jarvis, 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). These climatic data were downloaded from the WorldClim database (

 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). A multicollinearity test was performed for 19 bioclimatic variables (Merow, Smith, &amp; Silander, 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Variables with Pearson correlation coefficients of &gt;0.8 or less than −0.8 were removed to eliminate multicollinearity in the ENM parameter estimates (Merow et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). The remaining eight bioclimatic variables were related to the distribution and physiological performance of the plants. Eight future bioclimatic variables, which match present‐day variables, were assessed using the pixel maps of three global climate models, that is, mohc_hadgem2, csiro_mk3_6_0, and cccma_canesm2 (for the period 2,070–2,099), downloaded from the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (

Representative concentration pathways (RCPs) of 4.5 (mean, 780 ppm; range, 595–1,005 by the year 2100; low‐concentration scenario) and 8.5 (mean, 1,685 ppm; range, 1,415–1,910 by 2100; high‐concentration scenario) were used to model future species distributions. RCP 8.5 assumes larger cumulative concentrations of carbon dioxide than RCP 4.5, resulting in a different pattern of climate change in response to varying concentrations of greenhouse gases and other pollutants (
