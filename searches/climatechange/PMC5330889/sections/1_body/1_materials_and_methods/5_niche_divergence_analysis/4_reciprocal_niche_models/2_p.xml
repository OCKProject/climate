<p class="p">Maxent modeling was also used to generate RNMs to compare the niche shift between native and invasive ranges for the eight AIWs (Medley, 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). For each species, a model was calibrated with the occurrences from the native range and projected onto the invasive range before being compared with the projections from model calibrated with the occurrences from the invasive range (Medley, 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Similarly, a model was calibrated with the occurrences from the invasive range and projected onto the native range before being compared with the projections from model calibrated with the occurrences from the native range (Medley, 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). We used the following classes to facilitate the interpretation of niche overlap: 0–0.2 (no or very limited overlap), 0.2–0.4 (low overlap), 0.4–0.6 (moderate overlap), 0.6–0.8 (high overlap), and 0.8–1.0 (very high overlap; Rödder and Engler
