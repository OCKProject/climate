<p class="p">Based on the method proposed by Warren et al. (
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>), we used Maxent modeling to project the habitat suitability maps using the occurrence records from the invasive range, native range, and combined invasive and native ranges. Maxent modeling was performed using default values for the habitat suitability maps (Warren et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Niche breadth, a metric with values ranging from 0 to 1, represents the correlation between the environmental range and the habitat suitability of a plant species. In other words, niche breadth is an indicator of the expansion potential of AIWs (Warren et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). ENMTools 1.4.4 was used to compute the climatic niche breadth using the habitat suitability maps based on invasive ranges, native ranges, and both invasive and native ranges (Warren, Glor, &amp; Turelli, 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Warren &amp; Seifert, 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Paired 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>‐tests were used to evaluate the differences in the climatic niche breadth among the invasive ranges, native ranges, and combined invasive and native ranges. The similarity between climatic niches in the native and invasive ranges was examined based on niche overlap (i.e., 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>) using ENMTools 1.4.4 (Warren et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> ranges from 0 (no similarity) to 1 (completely overlapping; Warren et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). A null model was created to test climatic niche divergence between the native and invasive ranges. The background randomization test in ENMTools 1.4.4 was then used to test the null model that the observed niches and the AIW background environment were divergent using Maxent modeling (McCormack, Zellmer, &amp; Knowles, 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Warren et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). First, the observed niche overlap of each AIW between native and invasive distributions (
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>
 <sub class="sub">obs</sub>) was determined using the Maxent modeling of the occurrence records of native and invasive regions. Second, the background randomization test was used to generate 100 pseudoreplicate datasets for Maxent modeling based on the combined native and invasive ranges (Hill, Hoffmann, Macfadyen, Umina, &amp; Elith, 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Each pseudoreplicate dataset included an equal number of background points within native and invasive ranges to compute the simulated niche similarity from null distributions (
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>
 <sub class="sub">null</sub>). The same process was repeated with Maxent modeling based on each of the 100 pseudoreplicate datasets in each direction (i.e., by comparing either the native or invasive range with the combined range); this is typically sufficient to reject the null hypothesis with high confidence (Warren et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Zengeya, Robertson, Booth, &amp; Chimimba, 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Finally, 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>
 <sub class="sub">obs</sub> from the native and invasive ranges were compared with 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>
 <sub class="sub">null</sub> by a one‐tailed test. For the equivalence test, significance was determined for those values outside of the 95% confidence limits of 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>
 <sub class="sub">null</sub>. Niche divergence was inferred when 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>
 <sub class="sub">obs</sub> &lt; 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>
 <sub class="sub">null</sub> (Edwards &amp; Keogh, 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Warren et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>).
