<p class="p">Based on the method developed by Broennimann et al. (
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), a PCA approach was used to test the differences in climatic niche between native and invasive ranges by quantifying niche overlap (Schoener's 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>; henceforth, 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>), niche stability, and expansion into the climatic niche space (Cornuault, Khimoun, Cuneo, &amp; Besnard, 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Guisan et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). First, based on the observed occurrences for each species, a two‐dimensional climatic space was defined by the first two axes identified by the PCA. (Broennimann et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Kumar et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Second, this climatic space gridded with the first two principal components (PCs) was defined with 100 bins along each axis, thus partitioning the 2D climatic space into the gridded PCA climatic spaces (at a resolution of 100 × 100 cells), in which each cell corresponds to a unique combination of climate conditions (i.e., available environments; Cornuault et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Dellinger et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Here, a kernel function was used to smooth the climatic space defined in the gridded PCA climatic spaces based on the first two PCs (Petitpierre et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Third, the observed 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>
 <sub class="sub">obs</sub>) was measured based on the occupancies in the climatic space defined by the gridded climatic spaces (Petitpierre et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Niche stability is the proportion of the invasive distribution that overlaps with the native distribution (Petitpierre et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Niche expansion is the proportion of the invasive distribution located in conditions that differ from those of the native distribution (or 1—stability; Petitpierre et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Expansion measured in this way characterizes true climatic niche shifts (Petitpierre et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Randomizations of the data were repeated 100 times, generating null distributions of simulated 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>
 <sub class="sub">null</sub>) values for comparison with 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>
 <sub class="sub">obs</sub>. For the equivalence test, the null hypothesis was rejected if 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>
 <sub class="sub">obs</sub> was outside of the 95% confidence limits of 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>
 <sub class="sub">null</sub>. Niche divergence was inferred when 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>
 <sub class="sub">obs</sub> &lt; 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>
 <sub class="sub">null</sub> (Callen &amp; Miller, 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). The “ecospat” package in R was used to conduct this analysis (
