<p class="p">First, the models were projected for the habitat suitability maps of AIWs under RCP 4.5 (the low‐concentration scenario) and RCP 8.5 (the high‐concentration scenario) based on the occurrence records of both invasive and native ranges and the bioclimatic variables in the three global climate models for the period 2,070–2,099. The current and future habitat suitability maps for each AIW were created using a binary distribution (i.e., a presence–absence pixel map) generated in ArcGIS 10.2 (Esri; Redlands, CA, USA) by reclassifying Maxent model pixels according to the 10th percentile training presence values (Callen &amp; Miller, 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). The habitat suitability maps for all eight AIWs were superimposed to produce the overall habitat suitability of AIWs under current‐, low‐, and high‐concentration scenarios.
