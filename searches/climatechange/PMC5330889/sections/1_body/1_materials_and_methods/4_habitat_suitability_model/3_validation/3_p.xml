<p class="p">A binomial test (based on the training omission rate) was also used for model validation based only on present data. The training omission rate is the proportion of training occurrence records among the pixels of predicted absences (Phillips, Anderson, &amp; Schapire,

 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). These are one‐sided tests (namely, one‐sided 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>‐values) for the null hypothesis that the Maxent modeling performs no better than random selection from the set of all models with similar proportional predicted areas (Phillips &amp; Dudík, 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Phillips et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). A training omission rate of &lt;17% was considered a good model performance (Phillips et al.,
