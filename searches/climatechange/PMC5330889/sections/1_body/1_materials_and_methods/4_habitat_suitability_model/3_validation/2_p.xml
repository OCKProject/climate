<p class="p">To assess the predictive capacity of the models, model predictions were compared with real observations (occurrences and pseudo‐absences) using the area under the curve (AUC) of a receiver‐operating characteristics plot (Fielding &amp; Bell,

 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1988</xref>). This AUC measure allows us to test whether the obtained predictions differ significantly from a random prediction. As a rough guideline, models with AUC values below 0.7 were too poor to be considered in further analyses (Phillips &amp; Dudík,
