<p class="p">AIWs are uncultivated and useless invasive plant species that seriously threaten the economy and ecosystem in the invasive ranges (Li,

 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). At least two studies have examined the impact of climate change on the expansion of Chinese AIWs from the American continent (Qin, DiTommaso, Wu, &amp; Huang,

 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), but these studies did not test climatic niche divergence and thus may not accurately predict habitat suitability. To address such practical issues, we examined climatic niche divergence between native and invasive ranges and predicted the habitat suitability of eight representative AIWs in China under climatic change. We tested the following two hypotheses: (1) climatic niches of AIWs are divergent between native and invasive ranges (i.e., the American content and China), and (2) climate change can increase the habitat suitability of AIWs in China.
