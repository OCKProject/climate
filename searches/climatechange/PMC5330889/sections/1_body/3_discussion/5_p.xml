<p class="p">To address the practical issues related to the projected range extensions, we used the following measures. First, we needed to take measures to prevent and control the expansion of AIWs in southern provinces, such as Guangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, Jiangsu, Chongqing, and Guangdong, where extensive invasion of AIWs is expected to occur under the current climatic conditions (Adhikari et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Second, in consideration of the predicted changes in habitat suitability, we must develop an effective indicator of biological invasibility and design long‐term management plans for AIWs in Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Qinghai, and Tibet, where invasion is expected to occur under climate change (Crossman, Bryan, &amp; Cooke,

 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Finally, we need to attach importance to the prevention and control of 
 <italic class="italic">A. retroflexus</italic> expansion because this species has very high habitat suitability and could have clear increases in habitat suitability in the future (Beaumont et al.,
