<p class="p">We found that the eight AIWs from the American continent could potentially expand widely in southern China (i.e., into a low latitude) owing to high habitat suitability and were expected to shift to Qinghai and Tibet (regions of higher altitude) as well as Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, and Gansu (regions of higher latitude), indicating the need for measures to prevent and control AIW invasion at the country‐wide level. In particular, this shift was more obvious in the high‐concentration scenario than in the low‐concentration scenario. These results are consistent with previous studies showing that plant species had the ability to move to some regions of higher altitude and latitude under climate change conditions (Donoghue &amp; Edwards,
