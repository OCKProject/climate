<p class="p">Some studies have shown that climatic niche conservatism exists widely among terrestrial plant invaders, such that the transferability of ENMs supports the projection of habitat suitability of plant species in the invasive ranges based on observed habitat suitability in the native ranges (Petitpierre et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Callen &amp; Miller, 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). However, many factors, including human activity and climate change, may promote the adaptation of plant species to novel climatic conditions in non‐native ranges and result in climatic niche divergence between native and invasive ranges (González‐Moreno et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Martínez‐Cabrera et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32684-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Our findings provide strong support for this argument and suggest that climatic niche shifts must be evaluated before examining the potential distribution of plant invaders using ENMs, especially under climate change conditions (Warren &amp; Seifert,
