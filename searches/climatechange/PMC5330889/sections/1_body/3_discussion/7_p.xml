<p class="p">In conclusion, our findings provide a solid basis for the use of ENMs and raise questions about the mechanistic underpinnings of broadscale geographic patterns. We analyzed the impact of nonclimatic factors changes across time and space on the niche shift of AIWs (and even invasive plant species) between native and invasive ranges and measured the potential effects of AIWs on the economy and ecosystem of the invasive regions in the future due to climate change and integrated ENMs into the management of invasion risks.</p>
