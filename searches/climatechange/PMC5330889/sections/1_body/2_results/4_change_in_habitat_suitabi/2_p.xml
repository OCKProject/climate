<p class="p">Based on the MESS maps, novel climates for all eight AIWs were projected to occur in Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Qinghai, Tibet, and Xinjiang under the low‐ and high‐concentration scenarios (Figures 
 <xref rid="ece32684-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and S1). Compared with the low‐concentration scenario, the novel climates increased under the high‐concentration scenario (Figures 
 <xref rid="ece32684-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and S1). The average habitat suitability was the highest in

 <xref rid="ece32684-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>). The average habitat suitability of all eight AIWs across all pixels increased significantly as the gas concentration increased (0.266 ± 0.065 in the present day, 0.284 ± 0.106 under the low‐concentration scenario, and 0.296 ± 0.146 under the high‐concentration scenario;
