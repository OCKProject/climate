<p class="p">Climatic niche expansion (within the invasive range, but outside of the native one) was 0.189 ± 0.130 in the invasive range (

The average climatic niche breadth of the AIWs based on the invasive ranges, native ranges, and combined invasive and native ranges were 0.284 ± 0.046, 0.142 ± 0121, and 0.313 ± 0.077, respectively, and the ENMs differed significantly among these range classes (
