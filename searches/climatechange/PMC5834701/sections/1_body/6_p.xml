<p class="p">We can perform an approximate validation of the altimeter-based GMSL acceleration estimate by examining other satellite and in situ measurements of the components that contribute to the GMSL acceleration. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission provides estimates of the cryospheric contributions to the acceleration of sea-level rise, including Greenland, Antarctica, and small ice caps and mountain glaciers (

 <xref rid="t02" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, Greenland and Antarctica account for most of the observed GMSL acceleration (
