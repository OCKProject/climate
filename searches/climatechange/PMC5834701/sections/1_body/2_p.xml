<p class="p">There is considerable interannual variability in the GMSL time series due to changes in TWS, mainly driven by El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) effects (

 <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref"/>–
 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>). We use a multivariable empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis to isolate the ENSO effects (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>) and remove them from the GMSL curve. This reduces the GMSL acceleration estimate by 0.033 mm/y
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, resulting in a final “climate-change–driven” acceleration of 0.084 mm/y
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. Climate-change–driven in this case means we have tried to adjust the GMSL measurements for as many natural interannual and decadal effects as we can to try to isolate the longer-term, potentially anthropogenic, acceleration––any remaining effects are considered in the error analysis.
