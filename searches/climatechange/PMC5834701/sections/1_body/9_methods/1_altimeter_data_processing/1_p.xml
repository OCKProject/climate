<p class="p">The altimeter data were processed following the recommendations set forth in ref. 
 <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>, including the latest orbits, tide models, sea-state bias models, water vapor corrections, etc. Following ref. 
 <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>, the “cal mode” correction to the TOPEX data was not applied, because the correction degraded comparisons to tide-gauge sea-level measurements, and because later investigation showed it should not have been applied in the first place. Not applying the cal-mode correction slightly increases the estimated sea-level acceleration. Measured GMSL was corrected for the effects of Glacial Isostatic Adjustment with a global model, which increased the GMSL rate by 0.25 mm/y (
