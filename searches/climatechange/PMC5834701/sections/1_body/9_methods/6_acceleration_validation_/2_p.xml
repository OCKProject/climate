<p class="p">Constraining the thermosteric contribution to sea-level acceleration is hampered by the large discrepancies and related uncertainties that exist in ocean heat content datasets (
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>). The root cause of these discrepancies has been attributed to errors in the raw data and mapping methods used to infill data gaps, which are particularly large in the southern oceans, but substantial progress has been made recently in dealing with these issues (
 <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>). Given the systematic biases imparted by both data errors and infilling methods, a simple averaging across available datasets is not an effective means of minimizing bias (
 <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>). Rather, the optimization of mapping methods is likely to offer a suitable best estimate for quantifying both thermosteric contributions to acceleration and their uncertainty. Here we use the estimate provided from ref. 
 <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>. Comparison with independent data, such as the top of atmosphere (TOA) radiative balance also provides insight (
 <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>). We find the TOA reconstruction of ref. 
 <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref> to be broadly consistent with the value of acceleration derived from ref. 
 <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>.
