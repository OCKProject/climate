<p class="p">The computation of the effects of the eruption of Mount Pinatubo on GMSL using the NCAR LE of models (
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>) is described in ref. 
 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>. Because this model ends in 2010, we assumed an exponential decay from 2010 to the present. This correction increases the quadratic acceleration estimate by 0.02 mm/y
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. The error in this correction was estimated from the variance of the NCAR LE at 0.01 mm/y
