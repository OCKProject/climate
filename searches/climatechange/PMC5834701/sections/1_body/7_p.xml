 <xref rid="t02" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> summarizes estimates of the contribution of these components to the acceleration of GMSL. While the time periods are shorter than covered by the altimetry record, they provide a rough validation of the altimeter-based acceleration estimate. Shortening the altimeter record to match GRACE increases the acceleration, but also significantly increases the error bar. The main consequence of the shorter time periods is the potential influence of interannual and decadal variability. Nevertheless, the agreement between the climate-changeâ€“driven acceleration (adjusted for ENSO and Pinatubo effects) observed from 25 y of satellite altimetry and independent acceleration estimates from the components contributing to GMSL is quite good.
