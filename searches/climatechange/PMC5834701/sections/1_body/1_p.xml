<p class="p">The satellite altimeter record of GMSL is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref> (
 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>). These data reflect a recent update to the TOPEX measurements discussed in ref. 
 <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref> following earlier empirical work by refs. 
 <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref> and 
 <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>. The acceleration obtained by fitting a quadratic to this updated 25-y record is 0.097 mm/y
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. As described in ref. 
 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>, the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 caused a decrease in GMSL just before the launch of TOPEX, followed by a slow recovery that resulted in an apparent deceleration of sea level of −0.02 ± 0.01 mm/y
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> over the 25-y record. To isolate the climate-change–driven acceleration, we remove this effect (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>), which increases the acceleration of the adjusted GMSL record from 0.097 to 0.117 mm/y
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>.
