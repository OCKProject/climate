<p class="p">Our estimate of the 25-y GMSL acceleration is 0.084 ± 0.025 mm/y
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (1σ) after removing the Pinatubo effect and accounting for the impact of ENSO variations. The probability that the acceleration is actually zero is less than 1%. The error includes both the altimeter drift error and the impact of decadal variability. When taken with a rate of sea-level rise of 2.9 ± 0.4 mm/y (epoch 2005.0), the extrapolation of the quadratic gives 654 ± 119 mm of sea-level rise by 2100 relative to 2005, which is similar to the processed-based model projections of sea level for representative concentration pathways 8.5 in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (
 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>). Stated alternatively, the observed acceleration will more than double the amount of sea-level rise by 2100 compared with the current rate of sea-level rise continuing unchanged. This projection of future sea-level rise is based only on the satellite-observed changes over the last 25 y, assuming that sea level changes similarly in the future. If sea level begins changing more rapidly, for example due to rapid changes in ice sheet dynamics, then this simple extrapolation will likely represent a conservative lower bound on future sea-level change. In contrast, few potential processes exist to suggest that this estimate is too high. Projections over shorter time frames (25, 50 y, etc.) are therefore likely more reliable, but will also be more sensitive to internal climate variability and volcanic eruptions.
