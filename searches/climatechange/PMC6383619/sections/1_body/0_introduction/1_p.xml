<p id="Par2" class="p">Since the turn of the twenty-first century, political actors such as states and international organisations have developed and promoted a discourse that links climate change and security (e.g. Commission of the European Communities 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2009</xref>; UN Security Council 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2007</xref>; Department of Defense 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2015</xref>). The extent, significance and practical implications of this discourse have generated many academic studies (e.g. Parsons 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2010</xref>; Scott 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">2008</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2012</xref>; Trombetta 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2008</xref>; Von Lucke et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">2014</xref>; on the actual links between climate change and security, see notably Barnett 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2003</xref>; Barnett and Adger 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2007</xref>; Gemenne et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2014</xref>; Gleditsch 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2012</xref>; Hsiang and Burke 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2014</xref>; Scheffran et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">2012</xref>). At the same time, the expansion of the security agenda and 9/11 have generated fears about the power of nuisance of non-state actors operating at sea, such as terrorists, pirates, smugglers and even illegal fishers (e.g. African Union 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2012</xref>; Council of the European Union 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">2014</xref>; French Government 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2015</xref>; HM Government 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2014</xref>). The upsurge of piracy at the Horn of Africa in 2007/08 has also strengthened this trend. This has resulted in a growing narrative emphasising the need to control ocean space (Germond 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">2015</xref>), which translates into maritime security practices by states and international organisations, such as counter-piracy and counter-human smuggling operations, maritime surveillance and the adoption and implementation of dedicated norms and regulations.
