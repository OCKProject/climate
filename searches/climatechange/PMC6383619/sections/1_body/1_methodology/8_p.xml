<p id="Par12" class="p">To proceed with corpus analysis, we used LancsBox, which is a newly developed software and one of the very few corpus linguistics tools which supports the investigation of collocation in context, i.e. collocation networks. It visualises the collocations in the form of graphs of the network of words that collocate with each node word; by this means, the relationship between a node word and its textual environment can be revealed (Brezina et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">in prep</xref>; Brezina et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2015</xref>). Few other corpus linguistics tools, for example Wordsmith Tools (

However, the process involves mainly manual comparison of the associations between the keyword and its collocates (ibid). LancsBox, on the other hand, builds the networks automatically and therefore is ideal for the present study, which investigates predominantly the collocation networks formed by the two groups of node words relating to

 <italic class="italic">maritime security</italic>. It enables us to have an insight into lexical interconnections between the two topics.
