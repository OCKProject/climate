<p id="Par13" class="p">Based on the word pairs of Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, we first identified collocates to each node, which are the words that co-occur with the node. We then used the mutual information (MI) statistic to choose the most pertinent words nodes by selecting a cut-off frequency of 5, a cut-off statistical value of 6 and a span of ± 5 words regardless of punctuation. The cut-off frequency is the number of times the token appears in the corpus for it to be included in the graph. For this study, any token with a frequency below 5 is considered too rare to be taken into consideration. The collocates must be within a span of five words to the left or right of the keyword. The associate measure MI score is a common measurement tool used in corpus linguistics. It is used for this research because it favours strongly related low-frequency collocates (e.g. displacement, risk, etc.) over highly frequent but loosely associated collocates (e.g. the, in, of, etc.). Application of the method described above led to remove from the search nodes of Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> those with none or very few collocates. The final node words retained are asterisked in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>.
