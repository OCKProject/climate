<p id="Par11" class="p">In the starting phase, we formed all possible word pairs by pairing a node from the climate change group and a node from the maritime security group. For example, 
 <italic class="italic">climate change</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">maritime security</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">climate change</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">unlawful acts</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">global warming</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">piracy</italic>, etc. As a control measure, we also paired up nodes from the climate change group with nodes from the non-criminal group. Collocations of these control pairs were examined as well.
