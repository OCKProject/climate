The concept of collocation in corpus linguistics has been researched for at least 60 years. It was first introduced as a technical term by Firth (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">1968</xref>: 181) of a given word. To date, Firth’s view that collocation is a frequent co-occurrence of patterns of two lexical items has been widely accepted by corpus linguists (e.g. Sinclair 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">1991</xref>; Hoey 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">1991</xref>; Stubbs 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">1995</xref>; Hunston 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2002</xref>; McEnery et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2006</xref>).
