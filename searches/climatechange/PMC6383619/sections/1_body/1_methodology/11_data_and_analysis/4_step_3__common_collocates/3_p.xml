<p id="Par23" class="p">As can be seen in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>, only eight common collocates between climate change and maritime security were found in the entire corpus of the IMO. Most pairs had only one common collocate. Logically, one of the node word pairs, 
 <italic class="italic">climate change</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">maritime cyber risk</italic>, had no common collocates at all. The rare common collocates show a common emphasis on the institutional framework (&lt;UN&gt;, &lt;united nations&gt;, &lt;framework&gt;, &lt;global&gt;) and on the need to do something in a proactive way (&lt;combat&gt;). The most relevant common collocate (also found in TablesÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>) was found in the 
 <italic class="italic">climate change</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">human trafficking</italic> node word pair: &lt;migration&gt;. Indeed, as mentioned above, migration (and displacement) is also a collocate of climate change. Thus, the only occurrence of an indirect link between climate change and maritime security can be found via migration. The literature has suggested that climate change (negatively) impacts on food security and population well-being, then potentially generating (illegal) migration or human trafficking, with migrants travelling (or being trafficked) by sea (Jasparro and Taylor 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2008</xref>; Kaye 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2012</xref>), thus a link to maritime criminality and maritime security issues.
