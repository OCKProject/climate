<p id="Par26" class="p">On the other hand, however, links were observed between 
 <italic class="italic">climate change</italic> and the node word 
 <italic class="italic">pollution</italic> in the control group, which contains the node words related to non-security (i.e. safety) maritime issues. As we checked the concordance lines of the common collocates presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref> (i.e. &lt;reduce&gt;, &lt;harmful&gt;, &lt;responding&gt;, &lt;warming&gt;, &lt;environment&gt;, &lt;atmospheric&gt;), 
 <italic class="italic">climate change</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">pollution</italic> were both linked to harmful environmental effects. For example, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig" class="xref">11</xref> shows the concordance lines of 
 <italic class="italic">environment</italic>, a common collocate of 
 <italic class="italic">climate change</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">pollution</italic>, in which climate change is directly addressed as a threat to the environment, in the same way pollution is. This confirms that there seems to be a stronger narrative link between climate change and non-security maritime issues, although connections between 
 <italic class="italic">climate change</italic> and other node words in the control group (i.e. 
 <italic class="italic">marine environmental protection</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">maritime accident</italic>) are not strong according to textual data.
