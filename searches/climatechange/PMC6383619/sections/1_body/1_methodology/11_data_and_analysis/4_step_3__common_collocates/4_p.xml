 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref> shows a graph of common collocates between 
 <italic class="italic">climate change</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">migration</italic>. In addition to the direct collocation between climate change and migration, common collocates do not indicate any more precise connection with maritime security. Building on this, Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref> shows the concordances of some common collocates (i.e. &lt;displacement&gt;, &lt;degradation&gt;) between 
 <italic class="italic">climate change</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">migration</italic> adding a qualitative insight. Examples of concordance tend to corroborate the existence of indirect links between climate change and maritime security via potential increased migration, although concordances also refer to land migration.
