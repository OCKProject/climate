<p id="Par25" class="p">We then took a closer look at the concordance lines of each common collocate, in order to find further possible links between climate change and maritime security. Once again, the concordance lines of the eight common collocates did not show evidence of narrative links between climate change and maritime security. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref> and Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>, for example, present the concordance lines of 
 <italic class="italic">combat</italic>, a common collocate of 
 <italic class="italic">climate change</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">armed robbery/smuggling</italic>. None of the concordance lines show a link between 
 <italic class="italic">climate change</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">armed robbery/smuggling</italic>, beyond the fact that the word &lt;combat&gt; is anyway used in two different lexical contexts, i.e. dealing with the threats posed by real criminals versus dealing with the negative impacts of climate change.
