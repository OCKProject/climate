 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> shows the visualisation of the collocates of 
 <italic class="italic">climate change</italic>. Collocates which are closer to the node word are stronger than the ones that are further apart. Collocates with a darker colour in the dot are more frequent than the ones with a lighter colour. The positions (R or L) of the collocates on the graph echo their positions on the concordance lines as well. Concordancing is “a means of accessing a corpus of text to show how any given word or phrase in the text is used in the immediate context in which it appears” (Flowerdew 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">1996</xref>, p.87). A concordance line is a line from a text of the corpus which contains the node word to be studied. Data show that climate change in the IMO narrative is mainly associated with (1) institutional processes/frameworks (e.g. &lt;cop&gt;, &lt;conference&gt;, &lt;unfccc&gt;, &lt;framework&gt;, &lt;united nations&gt;) and (2) policy requirements/settings (e.g. &lt;adaptation&gt;, &lt;mitigation&gt;, &lt;address/addressing&gt;, &lt;responding&gt;, &lt;reduce&gt;, &lt;combat&gt;, &lt;urgent&gt;). This fits with the technical discourse adopted by international organisations in the field of environment and development (e.g. Ferguson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">1990</xref>) as well as a tendency to favour short-term, problem-solving approaches.
