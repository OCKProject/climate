<p id="Par18" class="p">Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> lists statistics of the collocates of 
 <italic class="italic">climate change</italic>. The ‘Position’ column shows whether the collocate is located on the left or right of the node word 
 <italic class="italic">climate change</italic> on average. ‘Frequency (corpus)’ shows the total frequency the collocate appears in the corpus. ‘Frequency (coll.)’ shows the frequency of its collocation with the node word 
 <italic class="italic">climate change</italic>. It is worth noting that the collocates are arranged in descending order of significance, given by the MI scores. We can see that the 10 most strongly collocated words are indeed a mixture of institutional processes (i.e. &lt;cop&gt;, &lt;unfccc&gt;), policy requirements (i.e. &lt;adaptation&gt;, &lt;mitigation&gt;, &lt;mitigate&gt;) and negative impacts of climate change (i.e. &lt;warming&gt;, &lt;degradation&gt;, &lt;displacement&gt;). This mirrors findings from Fig.
