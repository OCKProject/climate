<p id="Par17" class="p">Four interesting collocates appear when it comes to negative impacts of climate change: &lt;disaster&gt;, &lt;gender&gt;, &lt;displacement&gt; and &lt;migration&gt;. Disaster may refer to the effects of climate change on natural ecosystems but also on human systems, since an increased frequency of natural disasters (especially in the poorest regions of the world) can negatively impact on human security via health and food supply issues. Also, extreme weather events and disasters can damage the maritime economy and negatively impact on food security (Allison et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2009</xref>). The reference to gender issues may well point at the supposed gender dimension of the impacts of climate change, i.e. women are either more vulnerable to these effects or, on the contrary, better prepared to respond to these changes (for a critical discussion of these propositions, see Arora-Jonsson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2011</xref>). Displacement and migration are interesting collocates, since, represented as potential negative outcomes of climate change, they can point towards an indirect link between climate change and maritime security narratives, which will be further discussed below.
