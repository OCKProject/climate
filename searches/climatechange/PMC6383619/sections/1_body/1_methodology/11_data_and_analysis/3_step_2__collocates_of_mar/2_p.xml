<p id="Par20" class="p">The investigation of collocates of the node word 
 <italic class="italic">human trafficking</italic> (also from the 
 <italic class="italic">maritime security</italic> group) shows that &lt;migrant/s&gt; and &lt;migration&gt; are the most frequent collocates (besides &lt;smuggling&gt;) (c.f. Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). Unsurprisingly, &lt;migrant&gt; is among the most collocated words to 
 <italic class="italic">human trafficking</italic>. This points to the fact that migration is both related to climate change and to maritime security in the IMO narrative, which will be further discussed below.
