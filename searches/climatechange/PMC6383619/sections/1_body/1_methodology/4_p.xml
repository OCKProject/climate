<p id="Par8" class="p">As this study aims to look at how strongly climate change is linked to maritime security in the IMO textual production (c.f. below for a discussion of the building of the corpus), it is fundamental to examine how frequent node words of one group co-occur with node words of another group (e.g. 
 <italic class="italic">climate change</italic> vs. 
 <italic class="italic">maritime security</italic>) in the corpus collected. In other words, the connections between individual collocates should be determined.
