<p id="Par14" class="p">Finally, using LancsBox GraphColl function, we investigated whether the narrative demonstrates a causality link (or at least a link) between the impacts of climate change at/or from the sea and the occurrence of maritime criminality/maritime security issues. We started by independently analysing the main collocates of 
 <italic class="italic">climate change</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">maritime security</italic>, so as to get a picture of both narratives separately. We then tried to find out how 
 <italic class="italic">climate change</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">maritime security</italic> were interrelated including through an indirect link between climate change and maritime security such as via the discussions of (illegal) migration. The complete methodology is summarised by the organigram of Fig.Â
