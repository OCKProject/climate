  <p class="p">A graph of common collocates between 
   <italic class="italic">climate change</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">migration</italic> (We needed to consider a large number of collocates before shared items appear. This speaks to the weakness of the narrative link between concepts but also hinders readability. However visual distinction between individual collocates is not required in statistical methodologies such as corpus linguistic. Such figures are visual representations of the complexity of lexical interconnections.)
