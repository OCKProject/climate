<p id="Par23" class="p">Octopus were collected from inshore waters along the NSW coast at Nambucca Heads (n = 17; −30° 38′ 46′′, 153° 0′ 12′′) and Swansea (n = 30; −33° 5′ 9′′, 151° 38′ 20′′) during February 2014; and at Ulladulla (n = 5; −35° 19′ 20′′, 150° 31′ 29′′), Merimbula (n = 29; −36° 53′ 42′′, 149° 54′ 25′′), and Eden (n = 8; −37° 4′ 18′′, 149° 54′ 33′′) during May 2013. Sites along the Victorian coastline were Mallacoota (n = 29; −37° 33′ 22′′, 149° 45′ 36′′) and Cape Conran (n = 3; −37° 48′ 49′′, 148° 43′ 37′′) with samples collected during May 2013. Samples also were collected off north-eastern Tasmania (n = 61; −39° 43′ 36′′, 148° 27′ 17′′) during April, September and December 2011. The centre of the known historical distribution included Nambucca Heads, Swansea, and Ulladulla; sites at the polewards edge of the historical distribution were Merimbula and Eden, whereas sites at the range extension zone were Mallacoota, Cape Conran, and Tasmania (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Octopus from Tasmania were collected on board of the 
 <italic class="italic">FV Farquharson</italic> using black plastic shelter pots (0.3-m long × 0.1-m high × 0.1-m wide) laid on the seafloor at depths of 35–46 m. Octopus were euthanized by commercial fishers and immediately put in watery ice in an insulated container. A tissue sample was taken from the arm of every specimen and octopus carcasses were returned to the fishers. Octopus from Ulladulla were collected during diving activities whereas specimens from all other sites along the coast of mainland Australia were collected by hand while snorkelling at depths of 1–3 m. These animals were anesthetized by immersion in a 2% MgCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> solution, a tissue sample was taken and octopus were released after recovery. All tissue samples were fixed in 95% ethanol.
