<p id="Par34" class="p">The eight scenarios were examined in two successive steps. In the first step, five scenarios were examined: Scenarios 1 and 2 assumed successive independent divergence suggesting historical diversification; scenarios 3 and 4 assumed a single admixture event, and scenario 5 assumed two successive admixture events. We chose the scenario with the highest posterior probability (best fitted topology) from the first step. In the second step, three scenarios based on the best fitted topology selected in the first step were examined to refine changes in effective population size. These scenarios assumed a common origin of the sub-groups with successive divergence to test the hypothesis of recent colonization due to range extension. Thus, in the second step scenarios 6 and 7 considered changes in the effective number of founder specimens after bottlenecks and in the effective population size of cluster 4 at different generation times. Scenario 8 also considered changes in the effective number of founder specimens after bottlenecks and in the effective population size of other clusters (e.g. cluster 2).</p>
