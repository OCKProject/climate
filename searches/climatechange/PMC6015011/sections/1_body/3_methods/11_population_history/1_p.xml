 </sup>. The ABC approach relies on gene genealogy, demographic history and ancestral polymorphisms to explain evolutionary causes of present-day genetic variation, and thus can be used to discriminate among putative evolutionary scenarios. This approach is commonly used to distinguish the effect of contemporary recurrent gene flow from the effects of historical connectivity

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" class="xref">91</xref>
 </sup>. The ABC algorithm compares summary statistics of simulated datasets for each historical scenario and/or demographic events with summary statistics of the observed data. The posterior probability and distribution of parameters of each scenario are estimated and alternative scenarios can be compared.
