<p id="Par35" class="p">To perform the ABC analysis a reference table with 3,000,000 coalescent-simulated data sets for each scenario was built, from which summary statistics parameter values were used in prior distributions (Supplementary TablesÂ 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S13</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S17</xref>). Posterior probabilities were computed for each scenario applying linear discriminant analysis on summary statistics to find the best-supported scenario based on the direct approach estimates (500 selected data sets). The level of confidence in the chosen scenario was evaluated by estimating the type I and type II error rates based on simulated datasets. The marginal posterior distribution of each parameter was estimated based on the best model. The goodness of fit of the model-posterior parameter distribution combination was evaluated with the data. The scenario with the highest posterior probability (non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals) under the direct approach was then chosen as the best-supported scenario.
