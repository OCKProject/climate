 <sub class="sub">2</sub>0, 6.25 µL of MyTaq Redmix (Bioline), 0.075 µL of 10 mM forward primer, 0.25 µL of 10 mM reverse primer, 0.20 µL of 5pmol/µL fluorophore labelled primer, and 1 µL (18–37 ng) of DNA. PCR conditions were modified slightly to optimize PCR products for some samples, such that 1 µL of 25 mM MgCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (Promega) was added in place of water. The number of cycles was reduced from 35 to 30, and the final extension was reduced from 5 to 3 min. Capillary separation of PCR products was performed by the Australian Genome Research Facility Ltd (AGRF). Genotypes were scored by eye using Geneious Pro v. 5.6.4
