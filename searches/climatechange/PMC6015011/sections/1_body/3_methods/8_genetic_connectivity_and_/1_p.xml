 </sup> to examine if genetic differentiation (F
 <sub class="sub">ST</sub>) was explained by isolation by geographical distance (km) between collection sites (excluding Ulladulla, Eden, and Cape Conran with &lt;17 samples). Isolation by year of collection was also tested for between collection sites, i.e. 2011 (Tasmania), 2013 (Mallacoota and Merimbula), and 2014 (Swansea and Nambucca Heads). A Spearman’s correlation analysis also was carried out to discount any effect of the sampling scheme by testing for an association between loci and year and depth of collection. In addition, AMOVA implemented in Arlequin v. 3.5.1.3
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">75</xref>
 </sup> was used to test for partitioning of genetic variation among collection sites.
