<p id="Par12" class="p">Migration rates were asymmetric between sites, with higher migration rates from Merimbula to the other sites (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>; Supplementary Table S11). Migration rates were asymmetric between the common Group Ot1 and the distinct Group Ot2, with greater migration rates from the common Group Ot1 towards the distinct Group Ot2 (0.095 ± 0.029 SD), than from the distinct Group Ot2 towards the common Group Ot1 (0.025 ± 0.008 SD). Merimbula had the highest level of self-recruitment (0.914 ± 0.024) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>; Supplementary Table S11). Both groups Ot1 and Ot2 had high levels of self-recruitment with slightly higher self-recruitment in Ot1 than in Ot2 (0.975 ± 0.008 and 0.905 ± 0.029, respectively).
