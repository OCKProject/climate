<p id="Par7" class="p">A total of 182 individuals of the common Sydney octopus, 
 <italic class="italic">Octopus tetricus</italic>, were genotyped for seven microsatellite loci (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Approximately 85% of pairs of loci (89 out of 105 tests over sites with ≥17 samples) were in linkage equilibrium (Supplementary Tables S1, S2). Exclusion of loci involved in linkage disequilibrium comparisons did not improve exploratory analyses. Moreover, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was met in 90% of each of the site-locus comparisons (Supplementary Tables S3, S4); therefore, all loci were included in further analyses. There was no evidence of large-allele dropout; stuttering was suggested for loci Ovul02 and Ovul16, as indicated by the shortage of heterozygote genotypes with alleles of one repeat unit difference. Moderate levels of null alleles (false homozygotes) were found in loci Ovul01 (10%), Ovul02 (14%), Ovul05 (≤19%), Ovul16 (≤13%), and at Tasmania (&lt;14%); however, allele frequency bias was corrected. There were some differences in the results estimated from uncorrected data compared with results estimated from corrected data for null alleles. Therefore we present and discuss results based on corrected data where any bias is rectified. Results based on uncorrected data are presented in the Supplementary information online for comparative purposes only.
