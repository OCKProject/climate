 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> estimations provided further detail of the population structure and complemented DAPC and Structure results. There was no significant differentiation between Nambucca Heads, Swansea, and Merimbula (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>; Supplementary Table S9). Low but significant F
 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> values indicated that Mallacoota was different from all other sites, except from Swansea. Tasmania was different from all sites along mainland Australia (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>; Supplementary Table S9). Exploratory analysis of population differentiation indicated that Ot2 Tasmanian individuals were differentiated from all other sites including the Ot1 Tasmanian individuals (F
 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> = 0.147, P &lt; 0.001). Thus, from the F
 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> estimations we inferred that the common Group Ot1 was comprised of sub-group 1 (Nambucca Heads, Swansea, and Merimbula), sub-group 2 (Mallacoota), and sub-group 3 (Ot1 Tasmanian individuals). The distinct Group Ot2 was comprised of the sub-group 4 (Ot2 Tasmanian individuals). The F
 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> analysis at the Group level confirmed that the common Group Ot1 was significantly different from the Group Ot2 (F
 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> = 0.157, P &lt; 0.001). The Mantel test indicated that the level of genetic differentiation among collection sites was not significantly correlated to geographic distance (P = 0.258) or year of collection (P = 0.096). Accordingly, the Spearman’s correlation analysis suggested that only two loci were significantly correlated to year of collection (Ovul01, r
 <sub class="sub">s</sub> = 0.231, P = 0.002; Ovul08, r
 <sub class="sub">s</sub> = 0.148, P = 0.047). Two loci were associated to depth of sampling (Ovul01, r
 <sub class="sub">s</sub> = −0.230, P = 0.002; Ovul05, r
 <sub class="sub">s</sub> = −0.176, P = 0.018) (Supplementary Table S10). The AMOVA detected significant percentages of genetic variation among collection sites (3.3%, d.f. = 7, SS = 30.950, VC = 0.062, P &lt; 0.001).
