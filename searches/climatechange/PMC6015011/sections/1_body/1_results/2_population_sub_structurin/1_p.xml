<p id="Par8" class="p">Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC) suggested five clusters (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S5 and Table S6): (1) green, (2) blue, (3) orange, (4) purple, and (5) red, with 40 Principal Components explaining &gt;80% of cumulated variance. Clusters one to four were largely overlapped, i.e. comprised of a mixture of individuals from along the entire distribution and there was no clear differentiation between these clusters. Therefore, clusters one to four were pooled in the common Group Ot1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, right panel). Cluster five (red) was separated from the rest of the clusters and was mostly comprised of individuals from Tasmania in the range extension zone (n = 27), but also contained a few individuals from Nambucca Heads (n = 1), Swansea (n = 1) and Merimbula (n = 1) in the historical distribution zone; this distinct group was termed Ot2 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, right panel). Tasmania (n = 61) was thus sub-structured with 56% (n = 34) individuals that belonged to the common Group Ot1, and with 44% (n = 27) individuals that belonged to the genetically distinct Group Ot2. DAPC analyses carried out on a range of subsets of the dataset, i.e. (a) at all sites within mainland Australia only, (b) at the historical distribution zone only, (c) at the range extension zone only, (d) Tasmania only, and (e) not including the distinct Group Ot2, showed similar population structure. The software Structure suggested only four clusters (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S5 and Table S6), for which individual allocation was not as obvious as for DAPC. Most individuals assigned to clusters one to four in DAPC were allocated to clusters one to three by Structure, which comprise the common Group Ot1. Most individuals assigned to cluster five in DAPC were allocated to cluster four by Structure, which comprise the distinct Group Ot2 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>; Supplementary Table S6 and Fig. S7).
