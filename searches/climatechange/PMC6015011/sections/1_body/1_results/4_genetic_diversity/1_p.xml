<p id="Par10" class="p">Allelic richness was moderate with more than seven alleles at each site; the number of private alleles and heterozygosity in the range extension zone were higher than for the historical distribution zone, and inbreeding coefficients were not significant (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>; Supplementary Tables S3, S4). Overall, moderate levels of genetic diversity were observed across sites and loci, and genetic diversity was similar at the range extension compared with the historical distribution zone (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>).
