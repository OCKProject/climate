<p id="Par13" class="p">Heterozygosity excess as an indication of genetic bottleneck was detected under the Stepwise Mutation Model (SMM) at all sites, except for the sign test for Nambucca Heads. Under the Two-Phase Mutation Model (TPM), heterozygosity excess was detected at Tasmania. Genetic bottleneck effect was also detected at the distinct Group Ot2 and at the Group Ot1 under the SMM and the TPM. Tests under the Infinite Allele Model (IAM) and the mode-shift test did not detect genetic bottleneck effects at any site (TableÂ
