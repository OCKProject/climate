In the second step, scenario 6 had the highest cumulative posterior probability (P = 0.968) and was selected as the most accurate model of demographic history for our data. In this scenario, sub-group 4 (distinct Group Ot2) diverged from sub-group 1 (Nambucca Heads, Swansea, and Merimbula) relatively early in the history of the population (t3, 95% CI). One genetic bottleneck occurred to sub-group 4 relatively early in time (t2b), with a subsequent increase in the size of its population, from 
 <italic class="italic">Ne</italic> = 286 (N4b) to 
 <italic class="italic">Ne</italic> = 7,930 (N4) at t2 (95% CI). Sub-group 1 experienced a recent genetic bottleneck (t0b), with a posterior decrease in the size of its population from 
 <italic class="italic">Ne</italic> = 8,570 (N1b) to 
 <italic class="italic">Ne</italic> = 7,220 (N1). Sub-group 2 (Mallacoota; 
 <italic class="italic">Ne</italic> = 4,200) diverged from sub-group 1 at t2 (95% CI), whereas sub-group 3 (Ot1 Tasmania; 
 <italic class="italic">Ne</italic> = 5,060) diverged from the admixture of sub-groups 1 and 2 at t1 (95% CI) (Fig.
