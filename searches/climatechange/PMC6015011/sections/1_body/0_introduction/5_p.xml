<p id="Par6" class="p">Examination of the genetic structure, level of connectivity and genetic diversity of range shifting populations will provide valuable information on the genetic signatures during range shifts and may allow forecasting of successful colonisations as a function of gene flow and genetic diversity

 </sup>. Therefore, using 
 <italic class="italic">O. tetricus</italic> as a model range extending marine species, this study aims: (1) to describe the population genetic structure of 
 <italic class="italic">O. tetricus</italic> along eastern Australia, including extension areas; (2) to quantify the genetic diversity of the range extension area versus other population components; (3) to determine the level of gene flow between historical and range extension areas; (4) to identify the source populations that contribute to the range extension area; (5) to determine if there is evidence of genetic bottlenecks that may negatively affect the persistence of 
 <italic class="italic">O. tetricus</italic> at the extended areas; and (6) to describe the recent evolutionary history of this range extending species.
