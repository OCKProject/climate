 </sup>. However, a range of different barriers influence the connectivity and genetic patterns of marine populations in comparison to terrestrial populations; these include water masses, currents, eddies, and coastlines, among other factors. As a consequence, the nature and magnitude of genetic patterns and evolutionary processes related to marine range shifts may differ from those that occur in the terrestrial realm. Therefore it is important to perform marine field-based studies that can increase our understanding of genetic patterns and evolutionary processes related to marine range shifts and help validate theoretical models.
