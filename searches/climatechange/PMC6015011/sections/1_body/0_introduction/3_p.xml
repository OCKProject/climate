 </sup>. Consecutive genetic bottlenecks or founder effects, where the size of the population is reduced or where only few individuals establish in new areas and subsequently become isolated, can result in genetic drift and inbreeding depression

 </sup>. There are exceptions where invasive populations have overcome the negative impacts of the loss of genetic diversity via multiple introductions that aid the increase of genetic recombination, confer high phenotypic plasticity to the founder population, and strengthen its ability to respond to natural selection
