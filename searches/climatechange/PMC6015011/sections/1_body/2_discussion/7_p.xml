<p id="Par21" class="p">This study suggests that the range shift of 
 <italic class="italic">O. tetricus</italic> is characterized by a genetically diverse range extension zone. Constant gene flow from a diversity of source areas along the entire distribution may promote relatively high genetic diversity and counteract genetic bottleneck effects at extension areas. Therefore, the genetic signatures examined in this study suggest that 
 <italic class="italic">O. tetricus</italic> is well placed to be able to persist in its range extension zone provided that no demographic or environmental effect negatively affects the population.
