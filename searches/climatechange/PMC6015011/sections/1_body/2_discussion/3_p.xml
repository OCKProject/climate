A relatively high level of heterozygosity suggests that Tasmania is within the leading edge of the range extension; this finding is consistent with the genetic pattern observed at the leading edge of range shifts of Quaternary trees in response to climate change

 <italic class="italic">O. tetricus</italic> thus appears to consist in the polewards relocation of the population, with characteristics of recent and rapid demographic expansions
