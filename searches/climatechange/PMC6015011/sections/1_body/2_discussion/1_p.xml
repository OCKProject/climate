<p id="Par15" class="p">The key findings of this study are that genetic differentiation was detected between sites present within the historical distribution and the range extension zones, and also within the range extension zone. The population was sub-structured in one common group along eastern Australia and Tasmania (Group Ot1), and a distinct group mainly comprised of individuals from Tasmania (Group Ot2). Migration rates were asymmetrical with greater migration occurring from the historical distribution zone towards sites at the range extension zone. The genetic diversity at the range extension zone was comparable to that detected at the historical distribution area. Genetic bottleneck effects were detected at sites within the historical distribution and range extension zones. Population history simulations suggest that the distinct group diverged from the common group relatively early in the history of the population.</p>
