<p id="Par19" class="p">Collection sites of this study are exposed to a gradient of temperatures from NSW (annual average SST 20.2 ± 0.2 SE °C at −32° 31′ 15′′ and 152° 28′ 45′′) to north-eastern Tamania (annual average SST 15.2 ± 0.2 SE °C at −39° 33′ 45′′ and 148° 13′ 45′′). Such a gradient of environmental conditions also may have aided in shaping the population structure of

 <italic class="italic">O. tetricus</italic> range and shares more similar environmental conditions (i.e. temperature) with the range extension zone than other sites further equatorward. Such similarities may further facilitate the capacity of founder individuals to respond to selective pressure at the range extension zone
