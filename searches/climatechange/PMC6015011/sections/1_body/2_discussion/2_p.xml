 <italic class="italic">O. tetricus</italic> between NSW and Tasmania using mitochondrial DNA
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>
 </sup>. In contrast, Ot2 individuals were common in Tasmanian waters but uncommon along the east coast of mainland Australia. This finding is consistent with the increase in size of the Group Ot2, detected by the Approximate Bayesian Computation analysis (ABC), probably from a genotype that is relatively uncommon in the historical distribution zone. The differentiation and expansion in size of the Group Ot2 was likely favored by high self-recruitment, rapid population turnover and high reproductive capacity

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>
 </sup>. However, the range extension of 
 <italic class="italic">O. tetricus</italic> appears to be rather complex. A genetic break was detected in Tasmanian waters between the Group Ot2 and Ot1 Tasmanian individuals. This genetic break is beyond the scope of this study and requires further investigation to understand the mechanisms that may cause limited mixing of both groups despite coexisting in the same area, e.g. differential selection, non-random mating or short-term departures from local panmixia. In addition, the ABC simulations estimated that the Group Ot1 appeared in Tasmanian waters more recently than the Group Ot2, which diverged early in the history of the population. These signatures suggest that 
 <italic class="italic">O. tetricus</italic> historically diverged between Tasmania and mainland Australia, and secondary contact occurred due to the recent expansion of the mainland population polewards towards the south.
