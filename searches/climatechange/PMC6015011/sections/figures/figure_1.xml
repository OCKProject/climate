   <italic class="italic">O. tetricus</italic> individuals were detected for the first time off Victoria and off north-eastern Tasmania. The pie charts indicate the percentage of individuals from each site that correspond to each cluster assigned by colour (Cluster 1 – green; Cluster 2 – blue; Cluster 3 – orange; Cluster 4 – purple; Cluster 5 – red). The right panel is the graphic representation of the percentage contribution of individuals to clusters using Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components with the genetic structure being captured by the first three principal components. The Group Ot1 is comprised of individuals from all sites. The distinct Group Ot2 is predominately comprised of individuals from Tasmania (indicated in red). The map was modified from
