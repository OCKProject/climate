  <p class="p">Hierarchical Approximate Bayesian Computation analysis of population history scenarios of the range extending 
   <italic class="italic">Octopus tetricus</italic> along the east coast of Australia. In step 1, the scenario 4 was selected as the most likely population topology. In step 2, scenario 6 was selected as the most accurate model of demographic history for our data. Sub-group 1 – Nambucca Heads, Swansea, and Merimbula; Sub-group 2 – Mallacoota; Sub-group 3 – Ot1 Tasmania. The common Group Ot1 is comprised of the sub-groups 1 to 3. Sub-group 4 – distinct Group Ot2 predominately comprised of individuals from Tasmania. Ulladulla, Eden and Cape Conran were not included in this analysis due to their small sample sizes (n &lt; 17). The colours represent different sub-groups and changes in the size of their population. Times are not to scale. Selected scenarios at each step are indicated by posterior probabilities (Pp) in bold font.
