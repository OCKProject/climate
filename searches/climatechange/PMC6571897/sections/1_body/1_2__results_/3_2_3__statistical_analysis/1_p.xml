<p class="p">Pearsonâ€™s correlation analysis was carried out for all tested variables: climate data indices, ripening phenology, and grape quality traits, separately for the two grape growing areas. The results revealed that for the white berry varieties (western sub-area) berry quality traits, such as TA and pH of berry juice at harvest, were affected by thermal availability (WI, HI) and extreme summer events, while TSS were significantly correlated with harvest date (

The PCA extracted two components with 59% of the cumulated variance for white grape varieties and three components for red varieties (66%) (

For the white grapes, principal component 1 (F1) was related to weather variables and bioclimatic indices according to a gradient based on thermal potential (HI, WI, extreme thermal events: negative loadings). Principal component 2 (F2) was related to berry quality according to a gradient based on TSS (positive loading) and TA (negative loading).
