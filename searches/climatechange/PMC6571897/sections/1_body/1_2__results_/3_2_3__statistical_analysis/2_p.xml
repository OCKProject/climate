 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00121-f009" class="xref">Figure 9</xref>a,b depicts the PCA result for white and red grape varieties, respectively, with the individual variables projected in the PC1–PC2/PC3 plane. Within the white varieties (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00121-f009" class="xref">Figure 9</xref>a), the cv GR predominates in the positive values of F2, while cv CH in the negative ones. These varieties showed changes based on F1 gradient. Exceptionally-dry climatic conditions determine a higher strew across the F2 for these varieties, especially for very hot and warm seasons. For the red grape varieties principal component 1 (F1) was related to the thermal potential of sites (HI, WI, and GST); component 2 (F2) illustrated thermal extreme events (T

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00121-f009" class="xref">Figure 9</xref>b), and F2–F3 (data not shown) outlined a comparable climatic gradient. The varieties M, CS, and CF were located on negative values of F3 (III and IV quadrant), whereas the varieties A and S were mainly associated with the I and II quadrants.
