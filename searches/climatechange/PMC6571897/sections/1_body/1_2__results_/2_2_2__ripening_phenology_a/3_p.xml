<p class="p">In the red varieties the amount of TSS in the C. sauvignon (CS) and Sangiovese (S) berries decreased linearly, whereas in C. franc (CF) and Merlot (M) varieties it increased more evidently (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-08-00121" class="xref">Figure S2</xref>); for the autochthonous Aleatico (A) variety, no significant trend was identified. Berry TSS final concentration was also evaluated with respect to the number of days with a maximum temperature (Tmax) equal or exceeding 30 Â°C during the growing season (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00121-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>b). Opposite trends in TSS final concentration were exhibited by the red varieties in relation to extreme climate conditions, so that no correlation between these two variables was assessable. Harvest dates and berry qualitative traits were reported for each growing season in the considered time span (
