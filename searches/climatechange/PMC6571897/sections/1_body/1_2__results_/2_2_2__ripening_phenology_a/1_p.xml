 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00121-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>a). In particular, a linear trend in the number of days needed to reach ripening was exhibited by the CH. No trend in harvest dates was recorded for the autochthonous GR, which showed instead the highest variability (JDmax = 264, JDmin = 218) in harvest date. The red grape varieties displayed a different trend (

In particular, the autochthonous Aleatico (A) variety showed no significant trend in the date of ripening (JDmax = 258, JDmin = 232); the Sangiovese and C. sauvignon varieties displayed a delay in fruit maturity as proved by the higher number of days necessary for the technological ripening, whereas Merlot and C. franc showed anticipated harvest dates. Yields over time, provided by winery registers only for a limited set of varieties (CH, GR, and M), are reported in
