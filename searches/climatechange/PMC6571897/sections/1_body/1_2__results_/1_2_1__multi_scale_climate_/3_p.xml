<p class="p">In the area where the white grapevine varieties (western sub-area) were cultivated, the Growing Season average Temperature (GST) was 19.7 °C in the first sub-period (1995–2004), and 20.5 °C in the second sub-period (2005–2015). Consequently, classification of local climate regimes in the western area changed from ‘warm–hot’ to ‘hot–very hot’, following a classification provided by Nesbitt et al. [
