<p class="p">Climate analysis showed a trend toward rising temperatures during the summer, as demonstrated by the number of days with daily maximum air temperature (Tmax) exceeding 30 °C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00121-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>a), together with a linear decrease in the number of days with daily minimum temperature (Tmin) equal or below to 0 °C. No significant trends were observed for these two variables in the area of red grape production, situated in the western sub-area (data not shown). The Cool night Index (CI) outlined an increasing trend in the average Tmin in early autumn (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-08-00121" class="xref">Table S1a,b</xref>. Both Winkler index (WI) and Huglin index (HI) in grapevine growing areas showed increasing values over time. The ombrothermic diagrams (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-08-00121" class="xref">Figure S1</xref>) indicate a restricted period of dryness encompassing June to August. Precipitations were concentrated in the growing season (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-08-00121" class="xref">Table S4</xref>), while 35–40% of total annual precipitation in both sub-areas occurred out of season. Changes over time in the value of the Seleaninov hydrothermic coefficient are also reported in
