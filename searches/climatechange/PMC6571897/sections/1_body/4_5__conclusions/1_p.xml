<p class="p">This overall analysis allows qualifying the thermal responses of some local and international grapevine varieties to climate change on a local scale. The phenology of grapevine and berry ripening indices are extremely sensitive to climate and highly genotype-specific. Climate characterization and permanent monitoring of phenological traits and berry biochemistry in accordance to international protocols, are efficient tools to define environmental vulnerability (or resilience) of worldwide known grape-wine growing areas. Integrated data analysis allows identification of trends and correlations between grapevine phenology and climate variability, addressing strategies for future planning of viticulture practices, in line with local climate variability. Local-scale knowledge of climate impact on grapevine phenology should be integrated into regional models predicting susceptibility of vines to pest diseases, improving goodness of fit of local-scale models grounded on information collected with dedicated on-farm surveys. Innovation technologies may also increase on-farm availability of integrated climate information, and improving winegrowers’ environmental awareness. In other words, local climate should be increasingly seen as a key factor of farms’ competitiveness. Based on local knowledge, in the scenario of predicted climate change, winegrowers could better address the adjustment of variety assortment that assures the maintenance of grape quality attributes, contributing to high quality wines and market competiveness. Finally, the comprehensive analysis of on-farm micro-climatic traits may contribute significantly to identification of both ecological and economic niches where viticulture could be successful regardless global adverse climate conditions.</p>
