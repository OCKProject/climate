Climate characteristics were investigated on a large but spatially-detailed scale, offering a separate analysis for the whole PDO ‘Orvieto’ district and for the two study sub-areas. Climate analysis at the large scale was carried out based on time-series (1995–2015) data of average temperature and precipitation provided by public regional weather stations installed in the PDO. At a detailed scale, climate data of temperature and precipitation were provided by on-farm weather stations. In particular, climatic variables for the whole PDO came from a weather station (Code: 06SENSI) based in the center of the area of production and belonging to a regionally controlled network of stations that provide open-source data (

The following climate variables were recorded: daily average temperature, maximum and minimum temperature, and precipitations. Daily data were organized on a month or year scale. Precipitations were split in two data sets depending on the hydrological periods: the hydrological summer (growing season; May-October northern hemisphere) and hydrological winter (off-season; November–April northern hemisphere) as reported in OIV, 2015 [

At farm level, two whether stations (Netsens s.r.l Italy, model MeteoSense 2.0) provided the same daily climatic variables, periodically downloaded by the winegrowers. Single measurements were kindly provided by each winery for the periods 1995–2015 and 2004–2015, respectively, in the western and eastern sub-areas. To define climate change effects on grapevine varieties’ behavior and performances, historical data provided by each winery for variety phenology and grape quality traits (expressed as sugar and organic acid content), were also acquired. Statistical analysis was run on empirical data with the aim to describe the effect of climate changes on grapevine phenology and grape quality.
