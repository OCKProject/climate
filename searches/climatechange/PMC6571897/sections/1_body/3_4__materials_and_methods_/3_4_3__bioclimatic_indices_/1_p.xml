<p class="p">Air temperature data recorded continuously over the last 20 years (1995â€“2015) was processed to calculate bioclimatic indices, based on daily temperature profile (minimum, maximum, and daily average) characterizing land suitability to grapevine growth and wine production in a given geographical area. Bioclimatic indices adopted in this study (
