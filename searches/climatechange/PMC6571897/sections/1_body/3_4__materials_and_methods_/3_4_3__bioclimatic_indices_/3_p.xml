<p class="p">Agro-phenological data were available for the last 20 years (1995–2015) for the white grapevine varieties (vineyards located in the western sub-area), and for the last 10 years (2004–2015) for the red grapevine varieties (vineyards located in the eastern sub-area). In both cases, given the vineyard age, the investigated time span represents the period of vine’s full maturity. Data on variety phenology—in our study the full ripening stage following BBCH classification (technological ripening) [
 <xref rid="B75-plants-08-00121" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]—and qualitative metrics for berry quality, like total soluble solids (TSS) (°Brix), titratable acidity (TA) (mg Tartaric acid l-1), and pH, were acquired by winery registers. Owners of both wineries have registered the occurrence of the harvest date for each variety over time. Furthermore, variables related to grape composition were also determined for each variety at harvest, by standard on-farm determination (refractometer and winery’s laboratory analysis). Wineries also provided historical series of yield records for some varieties, only (CH, GR, and M). Data were analyzed for the white and red grapevine varieties separately. Data on plant protection, were derived from the number of total pesticide treatments applied yearly (2000–2015) against Downy mildew (
