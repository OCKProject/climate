In particular, Western and Eastern areas of the Tiber River differ in elevation (100–200 m a.s.l. and 220–380 m a.s.l., respectively) and soil typology (volcanic vs sedimentary) [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00121-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, right). Representative and homogeneous vineyards were identified within each farm. The selected vineyards were also homogeneous for age (year of planting: 1995), training system (vertical shoot positioning training system, either cordon or Guyot), and employed rootstocks (mainly Paulsen 1103). All the selected viticultural surface areas had a southern exposition, and were planted on weakly mineral and moderate deep soil (regosol) [
