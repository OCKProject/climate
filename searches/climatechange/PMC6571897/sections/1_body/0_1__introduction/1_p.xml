<p class="p">Climate, a main component of the ‘terroir’ notion, is a key factor for grapevine geographical distribution across the world [

 <xref rid="B5-plants-08-00121" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Thanks to the high plasticity to environmental shocks, grapevine cultivation is diffused all over the world, adapting to different physiographic conditions as far as latitude and elevation are concerned (
 <uri xlink:href="www.OIV.org" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.OIV.org</uri>). Nonetheless, grapevine performances are influenced by climate variability—primarily by thermal availability—and this species has been increasingly recognized as a bio-indicator of global warming [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-08-00121" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Climate adaptation strategies are especially required to minimize climate change impact on viticulture [

 <xref rid="B8-plants-08-00121" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The increase of the winegrower’s awareness of the need to adapt vineyard management to new climatic conditions has been reported to cope with this issue. Re-assortment of genetic resources plays an important role in this field [

Understanding climate risk and improving preparedness to climate impacts—in addition to the development of new technical strategies for vineyard management—is considered at the base of the adaptive capacity of grapevines, and is an intrinsic property supporting resilience of local agricultural systems [
