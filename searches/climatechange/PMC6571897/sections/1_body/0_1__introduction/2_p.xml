<p class="p">Assuming that limiting factors for high-quality productions, such as air temperature and water availability, vary significantly at the farm’s scale, the grapevine physiological response to microclimate is influenced by the vineyard’s characteristics (e.g., soil, exposure, planting density) and/or management practices (e.g., soil management, pruning, water management). In particular, understanding climate changes at the farm scale is pivotal to optimize efforts for adapting vineyard management practices to climate variability [
