<p class="p">In the Mediterranean basin, one of the largest grapevine production areas in the world, warming has been causing shifts in grapevine phenology, changes in disease and pest patterns, therefore affecting the need of agrochemical use, ripening times and wine styles [

Italy is a Mediterranean country with typical vine productions and important grape-wine growing areasâ€”mainly based on traditional agronomic practices. Nonetheless, vineyard cropping surface areas decreased continuously in the last decades as a result of land-use changes, soil consumption, and agriculture abandonment in marginal areas [
