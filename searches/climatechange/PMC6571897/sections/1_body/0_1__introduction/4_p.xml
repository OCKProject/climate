<p class="p">The present study provides an integrated approach grounded on the measure of a set of physical and biological data able to assess the genotype-related response to microclimate variation, with the final aim to orient technical decisions for improving vineyard management. In particular, the specific objectives of the study were: (i) to provide a climate variability assessment in a traditional grape-wine growing study area (Umbria, central Italy) at both large scale and farm scale; (ii) to measure the adaptive response to climate change of seven grapevine varieties (two autochthonous and five international) as far as ripening phenology and berry quality are concerned; and (iii) to measure the effect of changing climate on the main grapevine diseases’ frequency. Our results underline the genotype-specific response of grapevine to climate change, and the usefulness of permanently monitoring micro-climate regimes with the aim to develop specific adaptive viticultural practices for resilient and sustainable productions on a farm’s scale.</p>
