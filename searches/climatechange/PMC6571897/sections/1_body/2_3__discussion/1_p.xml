<p class="p">The empirical results of this study give an indication of the multiple relationship among grapevine phenology, berry quality (including potential bunch healthiness), and climate change in a traditional region devoted to high quality wine productions in central Italy. An integrated evaluation of physical (climate factors) and biological variables (berry ripeness date, TSS and TA content) is proposed in this study with the aim to inform management practices ranging from choice of grapevine varieties to planning water resource management, phytosanitary defense, and harvest organization. It is widely recognized that analysis of time-series climate data is a key approach for the adoption of adaptation strategies in climate sensitive agro-systems, including vineyards [
