<p class="p">Climatic alteration also affects the bunch potential healthiness. Climate variability affects the patterns of plant diseases by changing the geographical distribution of pathogens or affecting the physiology of the hostâ€“pathogen interaction or the pathogen evolution under altered climatic conditions [

In the study area, the total number of phytosanitary treatments increased exponentially in the last 15 years, particularly against the downy mildew. This evidence suggests the importance of the on-farm monitoring and the opportunity to develop decision support innovation for precision viticulture and sustainable productions.
