<p class="p">A special focus is devoted to analyzing the occurrence of extreme climate events in grape-wine growing areas (e.g., late spring frost, extended hot days, extreme rainfalls) [

 <sub class="sub">max</sub> &gt; 30 °C) during last phases of berry ripening increased significantly over the past 20 years. The warmest growing seasons were 2003 and 2015. In particular, the 2003 vintage was classified as ‘too hot ‘ and ‘moderately dry’, according to the classification by Tomasi et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-08-00121" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Furthermore, the 2015 vintage was ‘very hot’ but with most of the seasonal precipitation centered in the ripening phonological phase from July to September. Physiological implications of the simultaneous occurrence of high temperatures and excessive water availability in the late phases of berry growth are known and well documented [
