<p class="p">Berry biochemistry was correlated to thermal regime variation. This result has to be discussed separately for the white and red varieties, under different oenological targets. The PCA results helped to understand which climate variables mostly affect berry ripening at farm level and within variety groups. The tested white varieties exhibited linear reduction in berry TA in respect to the increasing number of extremely hot days (Tmax &gt; 30 °C) in the ripening period, below the optimum for white vinification [

 <xref rid="B2-plants-08-00121" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. All the tested red grape varieties showed different trends for sugar accumulation (TSS) and total acidity (TA). In particular, the varieties Sangiovese and C. sauvignon, belonging to the first cluster (‘warm climate-maturity’; optimum GST, 17–19 °C), exhibited a clear trend to postponement of the harvest date and reduction of TSS. In the second cluster group, the cv C. franc and cv Merlot, indeed, anticipate harvest time and increase TSS accumulation. Nonetheless, TSS concentration—a key biochemical parameter of red vinification [
 <xref rid="B57-plants-08-00121" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]—did not exhibit certain trend (increase vs decrease) with respect to extreme temperature frequency, proving the importance of specific investigation to assess carbohydrate allocation under climate variability. The measured high variability may be explained with the strong genotype-related response to climate change, having berry quality a multiple and complex nature controlled by many interconnected genetic factors [
