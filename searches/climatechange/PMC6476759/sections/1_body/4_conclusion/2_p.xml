<p class="p">The unique responses of bay scallop larvae exposed to multiple coastal zone stressors presented here provide a novel assessment of how biochemical and physiological pathways are differentially affected by these stressors and provide mechanistic insight into their harmful effects. A core set of transcripts elicited by all stressors indicate biochemical pathways associated with energy production and stress are broadly implemented by shellfish larvae. Exposure to HABs elicited the largest responses in terms of both the number of differentially expressed transcripts and the level of expression. While exposure to 
 <italic class="italic">C. polykrikoides</italic> elicited the up‐regulation of multiple biochemical pathways meant to mitigate immediate oxidative damage and generalized stress, exposure to 
 <italic class="italic">A. anophagefferens</italic> suppressed cellular defense mechanisms and energy production pathways likely contributing to delayed mortality. Exposure to low pH and elevated temperature elicited more modest responses with regard to the number of transcripts differentially expressed by scallop larvae, although transcripts associated with shell formation were responsive to acidification. Differences in transcriptomic profiles and survival of bay scallop larvae between abiotic and biotic stressor treatments may, in part, be a result of multiple modes of action (e.g., direct toxicity and food‐limitation) associated with exposure to harmful algae. Collectively, results indicate that future global change stressors will impact marine life in numerous ways that will threaten to bay scallop populations existing within at‐risk locales.
