<p class="p">Total RNA was extracted after 48 hr exposure from duplicate biological samples pooled from two replicates from each treatment using a Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit according to manufacturer instructions. Quantity and quality of extracted total RNA were assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Libraries were prepared using 500 ng of total RNA with an Illumina Truseq kit and then sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 at the Columbia Genome Center (NY, USA). These sequence data are deposited in the Sequence Read Archive through the National Center for Biotechnology Information under accession no.
