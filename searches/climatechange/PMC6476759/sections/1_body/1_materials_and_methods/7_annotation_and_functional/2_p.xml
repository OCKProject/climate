<p class="p">Functional annotation was conducted using the Trinotate pipeline (Haas et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) preserving annotation assignments from Swissprot (Boeckmann, 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). In addition, KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) biochemical pathways for each contig were identified with KEGG Automatic Annotation Server (KAAS) using the partial genome single‐directional best‐hit method (Kanehisa et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>; Moriya, Itoh, Okuda, Yoshizawa, &amp; Kanehisa, 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Transcripts receiving KEGG assignments were binned by KEGG module. All annotations discussed in the text should be considered putative. For genes discussed herein, consensus annotations were derived based upon available data. If multiple annotations were detected, only one was reported.
