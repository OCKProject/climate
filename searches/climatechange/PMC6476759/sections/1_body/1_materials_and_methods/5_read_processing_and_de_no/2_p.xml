<p class="p">Raw sequence quality was visualized using FastQC then cleaned and trimmed using Trimmomatic version 0.36 (paired‐end mode, 4‐bp‐wide sliding window for quality below 15, minimum length of 50 bp). Sequenced reads from all treatments were digitally normalized according to the Khmer protocol (Brown, Scott, Crusoe, Sheneman, &amp; Rosenthal,
