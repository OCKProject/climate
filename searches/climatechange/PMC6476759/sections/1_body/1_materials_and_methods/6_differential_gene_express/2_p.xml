<p class="p">Sequence reads from each treatment and replicate (

 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) and counted within RSEM v1.2.19 (Li &amp; Dewey, 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) using parameters recommend by the RSEM authors. Differential expression between experimental treatments and the control were compared using DESeq2 with an adjusted 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>‐value of ≤0.05 as the statistical cutoff (Love, Huber, &amp; Anders, 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Expression levels for genes identified in previous studies to be associated with climate change stressors and/or harmful algal exposure (e.g., heat shock protein, antioxidant self‐defenses, immune functions, energy capture, and calcification) were targeted for discussion.
