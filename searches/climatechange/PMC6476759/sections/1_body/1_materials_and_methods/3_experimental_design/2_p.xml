<p class="p">Bay scallop larvae were obtained from the Cornell University Cooperative Extension (Southold, NY) using wild‐collected broodstock from the Peconic Estuary, NY, USA. This is a mesotrophic estuary that experienced blooms of

 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>) and has experienced annual blooms of

 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). The estuary experiences peak temperatures of ~26°C in summer and pH levels generally between 7.9 and 8.1 (SCDHS 1985–2017). Larval‐staged individuals were included in analyses as this particular life‐stage represents a critical bottleneck in the life‐history of the bay scallop and early‐larvae are highly sensitive to environmental stress (Shumway &amp; Parsons,
