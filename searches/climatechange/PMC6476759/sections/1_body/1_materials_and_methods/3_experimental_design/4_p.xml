<p class="p">Every other day, all larvae from each experimental vessel were carefully passaged onto a 64 μm sieve, rinsed with filtered (0.2 μm) seawater, and enumerated via an inverted microscope coupled with a digital Nikon
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> camera and image analysis software (NIS Elements imaging software; version 3.22.11) to assess larval survival. After enumeration, larvae were resuspended in clean vessels amended as described above. For harmful algal treatments, fresh aliquots of phytoplankton cultures were added to exposure vessels at concentrations described above after each water change. An antibiotic solution (1% v/v final concentration; 
 <italic class="italic">see above</italic>) was included in each vessel to minimize bacterial contamination. After 48 hr, ~7,000 larvae (3.5 L) were carefully removed from each experimental vessel and concentrated onto a 64 μm sieve, transferred to cryovials, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C until RNA extraction (
