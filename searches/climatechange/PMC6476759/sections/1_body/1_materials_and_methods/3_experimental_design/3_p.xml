Treatments were administered in four, replicate 8‐L polyethylene vessels filled with 0.2 μm filtered seawater (salinity = 30) collected from eastern Shinnecock Bay (NY, USA; 40.8845°N, −72.4414°W) and maintained in temperature‐controlled water baths at 24°C. An antibiotic solution (1% v/v final concentration; 10,000 I.U. penicillin, 10,000 µg/ml streptomycin, 25 mg/ml amphotericin B) was included in each vessel to minimize bacterial contamination.
