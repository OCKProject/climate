Prior to, and upon the completion, of experiments, duplicate water samples from the control and acidification treatments were collected for dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) analysis. Briefly, water from experimental replicates was carefully transferred to 300 ml glass vials, preserved with a saturated mercuric chloride solution, and sealed until analysis. Levels of DIC from control and low pH treatments were determined using an Environmental Gas Analyzer
