 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Additionally, ocean warming has expanded the distribution and lengthened the blooming season of several harmful algae within temperate zones of the Northern Hemisphere (Gobler et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). The organism‐level (e.g., survival, growth, and development) impacts of these stressors have been well‐studied, but less is known regarding their physiological and mechanistic effects. There is a growing body of knowledge regarding the gene‐level responses of organisms exposed to climate change stressors (Chapman et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; De Wit, Durland, Ventura, &amp; Langdon,

 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0110" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Studies of this type provide insight regarding the physiological impacts of climate change on marine life and reveal sensitive biochemical pathways. Recently, De Wit et al. (
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>) investigated differential gene responses of Pacific oyster (
 <italic class="italic">Crassostrea gigas</italic>) larvae exposed to acidification and reported a down‐regulation of genes associated with shell growth (e.g., nacrein, papilin, and chitin‐binding proteins), suggesting that low expression of these genes may be associated with slower larval growth in acidified environments. In a similar study, Goncalves et al. (
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) observed larvae originating from adult, Sydney rock oysters (
 <italic class="italic">Saccostrea glomerata</italic>) exposed to acidification during gametogenesis expressed a greater abundance of transcripts encoding antioxidant enzymes, heat shock, and cytoskeletal proteins compared to larvae originating from adults reproductively conditioned at ambient pH. Studies assessing gene‐level responses within marine life exposed to harmful algal blooms have, however, been rare. Further, while the effects of climate change stressors on organism physiology have been described, studies comparing the effects of multiple stressors on biochemical responses have also been rare. While some studies have assessed gene responses among oysters exposed to acidification (
 <italic class="italic">see above</italic>), few have assessed the responses to other stressors or the responses of other commercially and ecologically important bivalves.
