<p class="p">Here, we used high‐throughput transcriptomic sequencing (RNA‐Seq) to identify gene expression responses of 
 <italic class="italic">A. irradians</italic> (bay scallop) larvae exposed to elevated temperature, acidification, and two species of harmful algae, 
 <italic class="italic">A. anophagefferens </italic>and 
 <italic class="italic">C. polykrikoides</italic>. Along with identifying pathways uniquely invoked by each stressor, a secondary goal of the study was to assess biochemical pathways commonly expressed in response to all stressors. Collectively, our findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms by which larvae respond and potentially defend themselves against these stressors and the mechanisms by which they are harmed, information that may aid in the preservation of marine resources in the future.
