<p class="p">Illumina sequencing yielded on average 67 million paired‐end reads, of which 62 million remained after trimming (Supporting Information Table 
 <xref rid="ece35100-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). A combined assembly with Trinity produced 753,305 contigs (

 <italic class="italic">N</italic>
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 1,614 bp) after clustering at 98% identity. Of this clustered set of contigs, 26% contained open reading frames (ORFs; Supporting Information Table 
 <xref rid="ece35100-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>) and between 80% and 90% of reads aligned to this clustered contig set which were then used for differential expression analysis (Supporting Information Table 
 <xref rid="ece35100-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). Annotations from SwissProt revealed information for ~20% of the clustered contigs while KEGG provided assignments to 18% (Supporting Information Table
