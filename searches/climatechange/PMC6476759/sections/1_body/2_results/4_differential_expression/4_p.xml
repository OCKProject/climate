<p class="p">A core of 21 genes was differentially (

 <xref rid="ece35100-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Of those, 13 had increased abundance, seven of which were annotated and found to encode reticulocyte‐binding proteins (reitculocyte‐binding protein 2 homolog a), organic cation transporters (isoform B), mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase (tim21), protein synthesis (tryptophan‐tRNA ligase), endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins (subunit 10), multivesicular body (subunit 12B—vesicular trafficking), and a leucine‐rich repeat‐containing protein (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35100-tbl-0006" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>). The remainder of transcripts (8) had decreased transcript abundance relative to the control (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35100-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) of which, two were annotated and identified as a tektin‐3 (cytoskeleton component) coding gene and a polybromo‐1 transcription factor (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35100-tbl-0006" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>).
