<p class="p">Analyses of KEGG pathways revealed multiple biochemical pathways that were affected by exposure to each stressor with substantial differences in expression patterns observed between treatments (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35100-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Larvae exposed to 
 <italic class="italic">C. polykrikoides</italic> displayed the largest increase in transcript abundance (i.e., normalized read count) for many of the KEGG metabolic pathways relative to the other treatments (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35100-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The weakest metabolic response (i.e., minimum normalized read count) was in the high temperature treatment where high‐abundance reads were only observed for KEGG pathways involved in biosynthesis of polyphenolic compounds and degradation of aromatic compounds (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35100-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The control, low pH, and 
 <italic class="italic">A. anophagefferens</italic> treatments elicited similar metabolic responses for many of the KEGG modules including those involved in purine/pyrimidine metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, RNA polymerase, sugar metabolism, and vitamin biosynthesis (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35100-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>).
