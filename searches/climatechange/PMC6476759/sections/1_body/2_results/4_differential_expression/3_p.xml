<p class="p">The number of transcripts differentially expressed among scallop larvae exposed to both harmful algae was one‐ to two‐orders of magnitude greater than the other treatments. For example, larvae exposed to

 <italic class="italic">A. anophagefferens</italic>, a majority (87%) were observed at reduced abundance whereas when exposed to

 <xref rid="ece35100-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Transcripts with the largest increases in transcript abundance among both harmful algal treatments included those encoding for RNA‐binding proteins (e.g., protein quaking), phosphatases (e.g., enolase‐phosphatase), and ribosome‐binding proteins (40s ribosomal protein S2 and 60S ribosomal protein L3; Tables
