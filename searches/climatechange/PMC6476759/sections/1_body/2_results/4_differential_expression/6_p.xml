<p class="p">Exposure to either harmful algal species yielded the most intense responses among KEGG‐mapped pathways. Larvae exposed to 
 <italic class="italic">A. anophagefferens</italic> displayed the greatest abundance of transcripts involved in the synthesis of DNA, carbohydrate metabolism, polyamine biosynthesis, cysteine and methionine metabolism, central carbohydrate metabolism, lipopolysaccharide metabolism, aminoacyl tRNA synthesis, proteosome complexes, protein processing, and lipid metabolism (Figure

 <italic class="italic">C. polykrikoides</italic> exhibited the greatest number of transcripts associated protein synthesis (RNA polymerase, histidine, arginine, proline, lysine, aromatic amino acid metabolism etc.), cellular metabolism (ATP synthesis, sugar metabolism, other carbohydrate metabolism, glycan metabolism, and fatty acid metabolism), immune response (bacterial secretion), membrane transport (mineral and organic ions), and nucleic acid synthesis and repair (e.g., DNA &amp; RNA polymerase, purine and pyrimidine metabolism, replication system, RNA processing, repair systems Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35100-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Compared to other treatments, larvae exposed to harmful algae (either species) exhibited greater expression of pathways associated with sterol synthesis, spliceosomes, ribosomal proteins, DNA polymerase, cysteine and methionine metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism. Transcripts associated with these pathways were expressed at relatively lower abundances among the remaining treatments (Figure
