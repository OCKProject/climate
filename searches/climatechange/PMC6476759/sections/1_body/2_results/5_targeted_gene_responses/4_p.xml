<p class="p">Transcripts corresponding to electron transport (e.g., oxidative phosphorylation) were also differentially expressed among larval treatments (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35100-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>a–d). The expression of multiple transcripts encoding for cytochrome 
 <italic class="italic">c</italic> oxidase, succinate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, and NADPH dehydrogenase was up‐regulated by larvae exposed to 
 <italic class="italic">C. polykrikoides </italic>while fewer such transcripts were differentially expressed by larvae in the 
 <italic class="italic">A. anophagefferens</italic> treatment (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35100-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>a–d). Only one transcript associated with mitochondrial activity was differentially expressed within the elevated temperature treatment and was expressed at lower abundance relative to both harmful algal treatments (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35100-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>a–d). No transcripts associated with electron transport were observed differentially expressed by larvae within the low pH treatment (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35100-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>a–c).
