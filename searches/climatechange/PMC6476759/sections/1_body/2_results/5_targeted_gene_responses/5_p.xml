<p class="p">With regard to genes associated with larval shell synthesis, chitin‐binding (e.g., protein obstructor‐E) and lipoproteins transcripts were differentially expressed by larvae in experimental treatments (Figure

 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). Exposure to 
 <italic class="italic">C. polykrikoides </italic>stimulated an up‐regulation of a large portion of differentially expressed transcripts associated with shell formation while exposure to 
 <italic class="italic">A. anophagefferens</italic> caused a majority to be suppressed (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35100-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>a). Mixed responses were observed among larvae exposed to thermal stress and acidification with larvae subjected to thermal stress exhibiting no differential expression of lipoproteins, but up‐regulated two (comp359259_c0_seq1 &amp; comp415920_c1_seq5; see Supporting Information Tables 
 <xref rid="ece35100-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3–S5</xref>) and down‐regulated three (comp404974_c0_seq2, comp408153_c0_seq5, comp418944_c0_seq1; see Supporting Information Tables 
 <xref rid="ece35100-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3–S5</xref>) transcripts corresponding to chitin‐binding. Larvae subjected to acidification exhibited significantly higher levels of two chitin‐binding transcripts and significantly lower levels for another. Large differences, however, were observed in the magnitude of expression between the two transcripts whereby the abundance of chitin‐binding transcripts in acidification treatments was increased by several orders of magnitude (e.g., comp394498_c0_seq1 &amp; comp382237_c0_seq1; See Supporting Information Tables

 <xref rid="ece35100-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>c—inset) and the single lipoprotein transcript observed to be down‐regulated was lowered by several orders of magnitude (comp 427695_c0_seq1; See Supporting Information Tables
