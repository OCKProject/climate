<p class="p">Several transcripts associated with generalized stress responses and/or self‐defense mechanisms were differentially expressed by larvae in each treatment but at varying levels of intensity. For example, larvae exposed to both harmful algal species responded by altering the expression of several transcripts associated with antioxidant defense mechanisms (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35100-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a–c). Specifically, larvae exposed to 
 <italic class="italic">C. polykrikoides </italic>up‐regulated multiple transcripts associated with catalase, peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase whereas exposure to 
 <italic class="italic">A. anophagefferens</italic> caused similar transcripts to be down‐regulated (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35100-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a–c). Within the acidification treatment only a single transcript corresponding to peroxidase (comp973279_c0_seq1; see Supporting Information Tables 
 <xref rid="ece35100-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3–S5</xref>) was observed to be differentially (
 <italic class="italic">padj</italic> &lt; 0.05) expressed and there were no antioxidant transcripts differentially expressed by larvae exposed to thermal stress (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35100-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>b).
