<p class="p">A large number of transcripts (1,117) associated with the cytoskeleton were up‐regulated by larvae exposed to 
 <italic class="italic">C. polykrikoides </italic>whereas the majority of those expressed by larvae within the 
 <italic class="italic">A. anophagefferens</italic> treatment (107 of 142) were down‐regulated (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35100-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>a). Fewer cytoskeletal transcripts were differentially expressed among larvae exposed to low pH and elevated temperature (28 and 43, respectively), but when exposed to low pH, larvae up‐regulated 20 cytoskeletal transcripts whereas when exposed to high temperature, larvae down‐regulated 28 cytoskeletal transcripts (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35100-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>a). Similarly, 192 transcripts corresponding to heat shock proteins (e.g., Hsp 70, 74, and 90) were observed differentially expressed among 
 <italic class="italic">C. polykrikoides</italic>‐exposed larvae with the majority (184) of those being up‐regulated (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35100-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>b). Fewer heat shock protein transcripts were differentially expressed among 
 <italic class="italic">A. anophagefferens</italic>‐exposed larvae, but the single transcript observed to be up‐regulated exhibited an increase in abundance by several orders of magnitude (Figure
