<p class="p">Similar to previous studies involving larval scallops exposed to acidification (Talmage &amp; Gobler, 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0090" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>,
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0091" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>), significant reductions in survival were observed during this study (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35100-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Beyond survival, our findings revealed specific pathways invoked by larval scallops exposed to acidification. For example, scallops reared at low pH increased the expression of transcripts associated with antioxidant defense (e.g., peroxidase) and heat shock proteins. Similar responses by 
 <italic class="italic">C. virginica</italic> have been reported (Goncalves et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Tomanek, Zuzow, Ivanina, Beniash, &amp; Sokolova, 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0099" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) whereby acidification‐exposed larvae up‐regulated several antioxidant enzymes and transcripts associated with generalized stress responses suggesting that, beyond inhibiting early‐larval calcification (Gobler &amp; Talmage, 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Waldbusser et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0101" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), acidification causes substantial oxidative stress (Goncalves et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Tomanek et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0099" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Alternatively, overexpression of these enzymes may arise indirectly via an elevated metabolic rate as evidenced by the up‐regulation of genes associated with cellular metabolism (e.g., cytochrome 
 <italic class="italic">c</italic> oxidase; 
 <italic class="italic">detailed above</italic>). Further, Waldbusser et al. (
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0102" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) documented that exposure to acidification induced elevated respiration in larval shellfish suggesting an increased abundance of antioxidants may be a response to metabolic processes that are simulated by high CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> conditions (Goncalves et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Larvae within the low pH treatment also differentially expressed 20 transcripts associated with cytoskeleton production, responses that may also be related to oxidative stress. Cytoskeleton‐associated microfilaments are a common target of reactive oxygen species (Dalle‐Donne, 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>) and/or are an additional means by which cells defend themselves against oxidative stress (Dalle‐Donne, Giustarini, Rossi, Colombo, &amp; Milzani, 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>; Dalle‐Donne, Rossi, Giustarini, Colombo, &amp; Milzani, 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). While the overall number of transcripts associated with the cytoskeleton that were differentially expressed by larvae exposed to acidification was relatively low, the magnitude (i.e., log
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>‐fold change) of expression for some transcripts (e.g., comp405629_c0_seq11 &amp; comp425670_c0_seq4; see Supporting Information Tables 
 <xref rid="ece35100-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3–S5</xref>) were increased by several orders of magnitude suggesting that some of these cytoskeleton transcripts may also be involved in shell synthesis which is compromised by acidification (Waldbusser et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0102" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>).
