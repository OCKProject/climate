<p class="p">Beyond antioxidant defenses, transcripts associated with early‐larval shell growth were differentially expressed among larvae exposed to acidification. Similar to prior studies involving larval bivalves subjected to acidification (De Wit et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>), transcripts associated with early‐shell growth were suppressed. Specifically, two transcripts involved in early‐shell synthesis (De Wit et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>) were found to be up‐regulated, however the single transcript that was suppressed by acidification was down‐regulated by several orders of magnitude more than those that were up‐regulated. Conversely, as discussed above, the up‐regulation of certain cytoskeletal‐associated transcripts may be related to early‐shell formation by larval scallops. Chitin‐binding proteins, an essential component for early‐shell and nacre formation (Schonitzer &amp; Weiss,

 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). Further, the concomitant differential expression of transcripts associated with cellular metabolism and protein synthesis (see Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35100-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>) by larval scallops exposed to acidification is likely required to support broad cellular defenses and shell growth.
