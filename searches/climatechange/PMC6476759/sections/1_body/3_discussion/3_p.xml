<p class="p">Universal stressor responses of bay scallops exposed to coastal zone stressors included the down‐regulation of transcripts associated with the transcription factor, protein polybromo‐1 suggesting stressors either inhibit the expression/transcription of these proteins or that scallop larvae divest energy associated with these ATP‐dependent (Porter &amp; Dykhuizen, 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) pathways into other processes in response to stress. Other responses inhibited by all stressors included transcripts associated with tektin‐3, components of ciliary and flagellar microtubules, again suggesting that this is a particularly sensitive or expendable pathway and that energy associated with this process is simply diverted to others in response to an environmental stressor. Transcripts that became more abundant following exposure to all stressors included those involved with reticulocyte‐binding (protein 2 homolog a), membrane transport (organic cation transporter, isoform B), cellular metabolism (mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase subunit TIM21), protein synthesis and transport (tryptophan‐tRNA ligase, ER membrane protein complex subunit 12B, multivesicular body subunit 12 B), and nuclear transport (leucine‐rich repeat‐containing protein 59; see Table 
 <xref rid="ece35100-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Collectively, the overexpression of these transcripts suggests that energy production mechanisms are up‐regulated in response to stressors, allowing for increased synthesis of certain proteins, presumably those involved with a generalized stress response.
