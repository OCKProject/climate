<p class="p">Beyond antioxidant‐associated genes, other transcripts expressed at greater abundances among 
 <italic class="italic">C. polykrikoides</italic>‐exposed larvae include those associated with a generalized stress response. Specifically, 184 transcripts associated with Hsp (e.g., Hsp 70, 74, and 90; see Supporting Information Tables 
 <xref rid="ece35100-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3–S5</xref>) were expressed at greater abundances within 
 <italic class="italic">C. polykrikoides</italic> treatments than in all other treatments including larvae subjected to thermal stress. The expression of Hsp transcripts were several orders of magnitude greater among 
 <italic class="italic">C. polykrikoides</italic>‐exposed larvae than levels of the few transcripts differentially expressed by larvae exposed to brown tide, acidification, and thermal stress (see Supporting Information Tables 
 <xref rid="ece35100-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3–S5</xref>). Prior work indicates Hsp are expressed by a wide range of organisms in response to numerous stressors/toxicants (Hofmann,

 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>; Kim, 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>). Heat shock proteins within bay scallop larvae exposed to 
 <italic class="italic">C. polykrikoides </italic>are likely indicative of a generalized defense response and may be expressed to prevent the damage of and/or promote the repair of proteins subjected to ROS (Gorman, Heavey, Creagh, Cotter, &amp; Samali,
