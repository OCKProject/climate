<p class="p">In recent decades, 
 <italic class="italic">C. polykrikoides </italic>blooms have become increasingly widespread across the Northern Hemisphere (Kudela &amp; Gobler, 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Climate change, and ocean warming in particular, have enabled and expansion of blooms that grow faster and persist longer (Griffith, A.W., Doherty, O.M., and Gobler, C.J. 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2019</xref>). Blooms of 
 <italic class="italic">C. polykrikoides</italic> are capable of causing large‐scale die‐offs of marine organisms, especially among caged and aquacultured organisms (Griffith, Shumway, &amp; Gobler, 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>; Kim, 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>; Kim, Lee, &amp; An, 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>). While multiple harmful modes of action related to this alga have been proposed (Kim, Lee, Lee, Kim, &amp; Jung, 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>; Kim et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>; Onoue &amp; Nozawa, 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1989</xref>), the majority of evidence suggests lethal effects are associated with the production of ROS (Kim et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>; Tang &amp; Gobler, 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0093" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009a</xref>,
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0094" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009b</xref>), compounds capable of causing severe oxidative damage (Miller, Suzuki, Ciftci‐Yilmaz, &amp; Mittler, 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Wise, 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0106" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>; Yu, 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0109" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1994</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that the enzymes catalase and peroxidase can mitigate lethal effects of this alga (Griffith &amp; Gobler, 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Tang &amp; Gobler, 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0093" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009a</xref>,
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0094" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009b</xref>). Consistent with these findings, multiple antioxidant‐associated transcripts were differentially expressed by larvae exposed to 
 <italic class="italic">C. polykrikoides</italic> and at levels significantly greater than those exhibited by larvae in other treatments. Specifically, the number of differentially expressed transcripts corresponding to catalase and superoxide dismutase activity were two‐ to ten‐fold greater among larvae exposed to 
 <italic class="italic">C. polykrikoides</italic>. The majority of transcripts associated with peroxidase were either not differentially expressed or were observed at lowered levels than in other treatments whereas 45 unique transcripts were differentially expressed at higher levels by larvae exposed to 
 <italic class="italic">C. polykrikoides</italic>. In addition to a greater variety of unique transcripts, levels of expression (i.e., log
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>‐fold change) of specific transcripts were several orders of magnitude greater than those of larvae in the remaining treatments (see Supporting Information Table 
 <xref rid="ece35100-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). Collectively, findings suggesting these enzymes are overexpressed in response to ROS exuded by 
 <italic class="italic">C. polykrikoides</italic> and/or are a generalized stress response to ROS as a consequence of heightened metabolism in larvae (Hégaret et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>).
