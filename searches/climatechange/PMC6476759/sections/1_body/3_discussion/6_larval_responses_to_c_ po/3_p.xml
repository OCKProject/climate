<p class="p">Differential expression of cytoskeleton‐associated transcripts by larvae exposed to 
 <italic class="italic">C. polykrikoides </italic>(e.g., 1,117 transcripts) exceeded levels exhibited by larvae in all other treatments. The cytoskeleton, and associated proteins, are integral components of eukaryotic cells governing cellular movement, cell division/growth, translation, and cell signaling (Chuong et al.,

 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). Hence, enhanced expression of numerous cytoskeleton‐associated transcripts may be an indication that these cellular components are vulnerable and/or a common target of ROS or that these transcripts are broadly expressed by larval scallops to defend themselves against externally or internally sourced ROS (Dalle‐Donne, Giustarini, et al.,
