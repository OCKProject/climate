<p class="p">In addition to generalized responses, larvae exposed to 
 <italic class="italic">C. polykrikoides</italic> stimulated the expression of several transcripts associated with electron transport (e.g., cytochrome 
 <italic class="italic">c</italic> oxidase, malate dehydrogenase, NADPH dehydrogenase, and succinate dehydrogenase). Elevated levels of these transcripts are presumably required to support broad responses employed by larvae to defend against 
 <italic class="italic">C. polykrikoides,</italic> specifically those involved in preventing oxidative damage. Given the number of unique transcripts differentially expressed and the magnitude of expression, scallop larvae presumably invest significant amounts of energy into cellular defense when exposed to 
 <italic class="italic">C. polykrikoides</italic>. Even under ideal conditions, large amounts of energy are required by bivalve larvae to precipitate their initial shell (e.g., &lt;48 hr; Waldbusser et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0101" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Frieder, Applebaum, Pan, Hedgecock, &amp; Manahan, 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Hence, responses elicited by 
 <italic class="italic">C. polykrikoides</italic> may exhaust energy reserves within rapidly developing larvae contributing to their mortality. Beyond direct toxicity and the ability to deplete energy reserves within larval bivalves, 
 <italic class="italic">C. polykrikoides</italic> may adversely affect larval shellfish via food‐limitation, as cells may be too large to be efficiently captured and ingested by early‐stage bivalve larvae (Helm et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>; Raby et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>). Post‐hatch (i.e., after prodissoconch I shell formation) shellfish larvae are reliant upon exogenous food sources (Helm et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>; Waldbusser et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0102" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) and bivalve larvae (e.g., veliger‐stage; 185–260 µm), including bay scallops, readily ingest algal particles from 5–15 µm in length whereas the capture and ingestion of larger particles is significantly lower (Raby et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">C. polykrikoides</italic> cells are considerably larger (~35 µm long; Gobler et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) than particles optimally ingested by shellfish larvae and bay scallop larvae, at the time of harvest (48 hr), were smaller (~100 µm) than those included in other studies (see Raby et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>), thus less likely to ingest cells larger than 15 µm (Helm et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). Hence, beyond direct toxicity via the exudation of toxicants (i.e., ROS) and the subsequent diversion of energy from homeostatic processes, 
 <italic class="italic">C. polykrikoides</italic> may indirectly impact larval shellfish via food‐limitation which may, in part, contribute to the broad transcriptomic responses observed among exposed larvae.
