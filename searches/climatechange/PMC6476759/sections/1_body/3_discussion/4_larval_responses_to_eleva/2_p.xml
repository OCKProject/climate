<p class="p">Unlike previous investigations challenging larval scallops to thermal stress (Talmage &amp; Gobler, 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0092" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>), survival within the elevated temperature treatment was only slightly reduced and not significantly relative to the control, perhaps in part, due to the short duration of this experiment (10 days). Further, while the optimum temperature for the normal development of bay scallop larvae is 24°C (Shumway &amp; Parsons, 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>), bay scallops have a geographic range that extends south to the Gulf of Mexico (Blake &amp; Shumway, 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>; Clark, 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1965</xref>) where larvae may commonly experience extended periods of 30°C. Transcriptomic responses of larval scallops exposed to thermal stress (~30°) were relatively modest with only a few transcripts associated with known biochemical pathways (e.g., degradation of aromatic compounds and synthesis of polyphenolic compounds) being observed at greater abundance than in the other treatments. The expression of transcripts associated with generalized stress response (e.g., Hsp 70 and cytoskeleton‐associated proteins), antioxidant responses, energy capture, and shell growth were less intense (i.e., log
 <sub class="sub">2 </sub>fold change) than responses by larvae exposed to harmful algae (see Supporting Information Tables 
 <xref rid="ece35100-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3–S5</xref>). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that among stressors included in the current study, elevated temperature was the least impactful at the transcriptional level, but when combined with others stressors (e.g., hypoxia, low pH, and exposure to harmful algae) more severe outcomes may occur (Pörtner, 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Further, it is likely that more extreme temperatures would have elicited a broader and/or stronger response.
