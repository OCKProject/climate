<p class="p">Bay scallop populations along the eastern US have been in decline during the past four decades, trends partly driven by estuarine stressors that are predicted to intensify this century. Here, we documented the transcriptomic responses of larval bay scallops exposed to acidification, warming, and harmful algae revealing unique physiological and biochemical pathways affected in larvae and potential adaptive mechanisms employed by larval scallops to cope with stress. The multiple stressors included here allowed for direct comparison of unique and shared transcriptomic responses among larvae exposed to varying abiotic and biotic stressors common to marine habitats within the geographic range of the bay scallop.</p>
