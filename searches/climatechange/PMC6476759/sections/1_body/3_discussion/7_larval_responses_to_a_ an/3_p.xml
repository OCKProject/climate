<p class="p">Similar to 
 <italic class="italic">C. polykrikoides</italic>, multiple modes of action have been proposed for 
 <italic class="italic">A. anophagefferens </italic>including direct toxicity via the exudation of extracellular toxicants and food‐limitation (Bricelj &amp; MacQuarrie,

 <italic class="italic">A. anophagefferens </italic>cells (~2 µm) are poorly retained by scallop larvae and also inhibit the ingestion of co‐occurring, non‐toxic algal species (Gallager et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1989</xref>), thus leading to a poor nutritive state. Multiple harmful modes of action (e.g., food‐limitation and production of toxicants) between the two harmful algal species may, in part, explain the large differences in the overall differential expression between the biotic and abiotic stressors included in this study. Given that both harmful algae are sources of poor nutrition and the near‐opposite transcriptomic responses by larvae between the two treatments, starvation may not have been the primary driver of gene expression between the two treatments. Hence, the intense and acute toxicity of 
 <italic class="italic">C. polykrikoides</italic> led to the mass up‐regulation of genes to repair and defend, whereas the noxious but less intense toxic properties of 
 <italic class="italic">A. anophagefferens</italic> led to a mass down‐regulation of biochemical pathways that protected larvae in the short‐, but not long‐term.
