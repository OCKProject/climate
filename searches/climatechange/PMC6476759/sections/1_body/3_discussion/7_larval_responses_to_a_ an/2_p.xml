<p class="p">Numerous studies have reported on the toxicity of 
 <italic class="italic">A. anophagefferens </italic>to bivalve shellfish (Bricelj &amp; MacQuarrie, 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Gallager, Stoecker, &amp; Monica,

 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0100" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1988</xref>) including larval bay scallops (Gallager et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1989</xref>), findings consistent with those observed here as final (10 day) survival of larvae exposed to 
 <italic class="italic">A. anophagefferens </italic>was &lt;1%. Exposure to 
 <italic class="italic">A. anophagefferens </italic>resulted in an order of magnitude fewer differentially expressed transcripts compared to 
 <italic class="italic">C. polykrikoides</italic> exposure but also an order of magnitude larger response than those elicited by acidification and thermal stress. Further, while scallop larvae exposed to 
 <italic class="italic">C. polykrikoides </italic>displayed broad, up‐regulation of multiple pathways, exposure to 
 <italic class="italic">A. anophagefferens</italic> substantially reduced the abundance of many transcripts. Specifically, antioxidant defenses, other generalized stress responses (e.g., heat shock and cytoskeleton proteins), and transcripts associated with electron transport were all largely down‐regulated. These responses are consistent with prior reports suggesting that exposure to 
 <italic class="italic">A. anophagefferens </italic>interferes with chemosensory function (Gallager et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1989</xref>) and causes physiological incapacitation of bivalve larvae (Bricelj &amp; MacQuarrie, 
 <xref rid="ece35100-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) as well as highlights differing harmful mechanisms between the two HABs. While exposure to 
 <italic class="italic">C. polykrikoides</italic> stimulated broad increases in the expression of numerous biochemical and physiological pathways, at levels that were likely not energetically sustainable for developing larvae, exposure to 
 <italic class="italic">A. anophagefferens </italic>causes a down‐regulation of defense mechanisms. The differing survival trends between the two harmful algae (rapid mortality from 
 <italic class="italic">C. polykrikoides, </italic>slower mortality from 
 <italic class="italic">A. anophagefferens</italic>), combined with the transcriptomic response provides insight into the associated mortality mechanisms. The ROS‐like toxicants released by 
 <italic class="italic">C. polykrikoides</italic> were seemingly a more acute threat to larvae, yielding an intense transcriptomic response and rapid mortality after 48 hr. In contrast, suppression of multiple biochemical pathways among scallops exposed to 
 <italic class="italic">A. anophagefference</italic> may have been of benefit in the short‐term, as survival after 48 hr did not differ from the control. Over 10 days, however, these responses were not sustainable, as the 10‐day survival rate for both harmful algae treatments was &lt;3% and significantly lower than all other treatments.
