<p id="Par3" class="p">It has been proven that human activity has an important impact on climate change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>]. Targeted communication is necessary to engage people to adapt towards a more climate friendly behaviour. Previous literature suggests that a lack of basic knowledge on climate change is one of the largest perceived barriers to taking action [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. Thus, the framing of the issue by the media has a critical influence on the perception of urgency and willingness to respond [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>]. Subsequent studies allow to better understand what communication methods are most effective in inducing behaviour change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>]. In particular, two media-impact studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>] have shown that framing climate change as a public health concern rather than as an environmental issue is one of the elements that would help increase the involvement of the public in engaging with climate change. The goal of this 4CHealth’s
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1" class="xref">1</xref> contribution is to understand how information on climate change and health is communicated in two different forms of media, the French newspaper,
