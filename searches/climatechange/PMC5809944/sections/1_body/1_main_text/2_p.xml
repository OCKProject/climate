<p id="Par6" class="p">The analysis of 
 <italic class="italic">Le Monde</italic>’s articles demonstrated an evolution in the communication surrounding climate change and in its framing. Between 1990 and 2015, 4465 articles mentioned “climate change”; however, only 599 of those articles also mentioned “health” (13,4%) and merely 189 of these linked climate change to its health outcomes (4.2%). Despite the low number of published newspaper articles displaying the health outcomes of climate change, the issue has been gaining prominence in 
 <italic class="italic">Le Monde</italic> since 2000, which leads us to believe that the public health frame is becoming more pertinent in climate change reporting. However, the sections in which they appear demonstrate the media’s tendency to frame climate change as an environmental issue [
