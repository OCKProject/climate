 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>]. The frequency of studies relating to the health impacts due to climate change in peer-reviewed scientific publications has also increased over the past 25 years [

This is particularly true of the French media potentially arising from reporting both before and during the COP 21 climate negotiations held in Paris in December 2015. Most articles linking climate change and health in 
 <italic class="italic">Le Monde</italic> mentioned extreme climate change events (31%) followed by infectious diseases (23%) and environmental migration related impacts (18%). Malnutrition (10%) and respiratory diseases (8%) and others (10%) remain less represented. However, highlighting the health risks associated with climate change is an ineffective communication method according to Maibach et al. (2008) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>], if it is not accompanied by relevant information regarding potential solutions. Furthermore, “information about the potential health benefits of specific mitigation-related policy actions appears to be particularly compelling” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>]. Even though an increase of the reference to health co-benefits since 2000 is noticeable, we observed that only very few of the analysed articles (16%) provide information about health benefits which relate to regulation policies in favour of climate change.
