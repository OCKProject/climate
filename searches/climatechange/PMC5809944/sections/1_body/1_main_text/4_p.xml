<p id="Par8" class="p">On social media, the number of tweets indicating the link between climate change and health, in terms of impacts or co-benefits, has increased during the COP21. A study based on data extracted using Radarly, an extraction tool of social media content (Linkfluence), was conducted to analyse posts including the hashtag “#COP21” from June 15th 2015 (date of the publication of the Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change [

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). In the run up to the conference, an increased number of health-related posts were monitored. While during the first months, institutional actors expressed a growing interest in the health-related issues of climate change, this topic was endorsed by a diverse range of actors, from the health field (such as Doctors for Climate or the 
 <italic class="italic">Ordre des Médecins</italic> in France) to the industrial sector and the civil society. The climate health campaign initiated by the Global Climate Health Alliance, which was very often referenced, as well as the World Health Organization’s call for urgent action to protect health from environmental changes, played an important role in the increase of attention paid to the topic in social media.
