<p class="p">There were two significant relationships found between image ratings and questionnaire responses. There was a moderate positive correlation between the average relevance ratings of the 
 <italic class="italic">most relevant</italic> images and participants’ NEP Scale scores, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>(60) = 0.419, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.001. This shows that participants with more pro-environmental beliefs or more interest in the environment were more likely to give the 
 <italic class="italic">most relevant</italic> images their high relevance ratings (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 5A</xref>). There was also a moderate positive correlation between the average relevance ratings of the 
 <italic class="italic">least relevant</italic> images and participants’ NEP Scale scores, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>(60) = 0.31, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.003. This shows that participants with more pro-environmental beliefs, again, more likely to give the 
 <italic class="italic">least relevant</italic> images their low relevance ratings (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 5B</xref>).
