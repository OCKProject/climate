 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-15-01943" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>], including such parameters as exposure to temperature change, exposure to heat waves, changes in labor productivity, exposure to floods, exposure to drought, changes in the incidence and geographic range of climate-sensitive infectious diseases, and food security and under-nutrition. This gave rise to the Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change, which published its first annual report in 2017 [

The Countdown monitors an evolving set of indicators related to health impacts, health system preparedness, mitigation and adaptation activity, finance and policy. The Countdown is accompanied by country-specific reports that explore similar trends at a national level for selected countries (
