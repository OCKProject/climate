<p class="p">Indicators need to be grounded in the national context. An example of developing nationally relevant health indicators is from the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC). The RGC, with support from various organizations and agencies, established an overall national M&amp;E framework for climate change adaptation, including a framework for health. Major priorities for health adaptation identified by the Ministry of Healthâ€™s National Climate Change Action Plan for Public Health include vector- and water-borne diseases and the health impacts of extreme weather events. M&amp;E indicators are needed to guide programming and policy development, establish early-warning systems, increase public awareness, and develop assistance programs, within the context of limited resources and capacity, as well as high vulnerability.</p>
