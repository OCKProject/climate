<p class="p">There are several areas where additional research could provide useful insights for developing local to national measures of how effectively health sector policies and programs increase resilience to climate change and for communications regarding those indicators:

   <p class="p">Assessing and prioritizing the health risks of climate change over spatial and temporal scales. Health systems traditionally prioritize surveillance and monitoring based on either the current burdens of disease or the potential for infectious diseases to cause epidemics. Climate change will likely affect both, with changes in the magnitude and pattern of climate-sensitive health outcomes as the climate continues to change. Proactive prioritization using environmental information (e.g., projected changes in temperature and precipitation) could prevent additional morbidity and mortality. These indicators would relate to processes, (e.g. utilization of environmental information) as well as outcomes, (e.g. early warning of a vector-borne disease outbreak).</p>

   <label class="label">(2)</label>
   <p class="p">Assessing and managing risk from a systems perspective, taking into consideration the multiple environmental and social drivers of the geographic range, seasonality, and incidence of health outcomes. More research is needed to understand the best way to use surveillance data to identify disease thresholds, interface with emergency preparedness, and project future burdens. For example, indicators are needed to monitor the robustness of health surveillance systems as climate change-related health threats emerge and intensify in some regions, including indicators of emergency preparedness to better protect population health. Research is needed to identify key environmental variables to include in surveillance systems linked to health outcome data or to establish proxy data (e.g., pollen, harmful algal blooms). Further, long-term studies are needed to help quantify the relationships between meteorological variables and health outcomes, and allow for evaluation of shifting distributions of vectors and pathogens across time.</p>

   <p class="p">Use of projections of climate change health impacts under different climate and socioeconomic futures to design and implement interventions, to direct disease surveillance strategies, to make choices regarding early warning systems, and to develop other programs to avoid, prepare for, and cope with the changes and new threats expected to arise. This includes identifying how indicators can be used to identify disease thresholds in different geographic regions. This may be most effectively achieved through co-design of indicators with stakeholders [
