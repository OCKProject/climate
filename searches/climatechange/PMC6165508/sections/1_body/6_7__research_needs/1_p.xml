<p class="p">M&amp;E for adaptation will be increasingly called upon to describe the effectiveness of current efforts and to estimate the adaptation gap that will need to be filled to promote resilience within the context of a changing climate, which means the research needs are significant. Research is needed regarding the most appropriate and effective indicators among those discussed above as well as their use, negotiation of barriers and constraints, and dissemination of best practices across health systems. Indicators of the health risks of and adaptation to climate change should feature (i) sensitivity (i.e., the extent to which the metric accurately detects changes in health status or institutional performance), (ii) construct validity (i.e., the extent to which the metric measures what is intended), and (iii) usefulness (i.e., metrics are practical and easily understood by public health practitioners, decision-makers, and other personnel). This research should build on and complement the international and national efforts on indicator development and refinement summarized in
