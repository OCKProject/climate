Evidence-based public health efforts dovetail with those of implementation science, which is focused on the dissemination of effective interventions and practices [

With modifications to account for the differences between climate change and other exposures, following an evidence-based public health approach and applying the principles and approaches of implementation science would support climate change adaptation by identifying the most effective interventions to protect health and well-being in a changing climate, supplementing current approaches [
