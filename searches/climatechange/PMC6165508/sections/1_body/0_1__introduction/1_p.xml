<p class="p">Health adaptation indicators for monitoring, evaluation, and learning (M&amp;E) are needed to track the health impacts of climate change, and efforts to adapt and build resilience. This tracking includes three main elements: (1) 
 <italic class="italic">vulnerability, risk, and exposure</italic> for both populations and health systems; (2) 
 <italic class="italic">impacts</italic> on population health and on health systems; and (3) 
 <italic class="italic">adaptation and resilience</italic> in populations and health systems, across scales from local to national. M&amp;E indicators should help identify good adaptation practices for replication and scaling up. The knowledge gained can inform iterative risk management of health systems, based upon learning, so that future adaptation actions are appropriately designed, refined, and implemented.
