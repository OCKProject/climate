<p class="p">Given this wide range of challenges, standard indicators for climate-sensitive health outcomes will not adequately capture the processes of changing risks, adaptation effectiveness, and resilience. In addition to monitoring the health impacts of climate change, indicators of vulnerability and exposure, health system resilience, and learning and knowledge management are needed. Indicators should reflect not only outputs such as early warning systems [
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-15-01943" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], but also system changes that ensure longer-term resilience. Examples include institutional agreements to support data sharing and analysis, professional development strategies enabling staff to integrate new data streams and models into adaptation planning, and commitments to maintain sufficient human and financial resourcesâ€”all of which can be tracked. Accordingly, indicators of institutional engagement [
