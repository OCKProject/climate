<p class="p">Some relevant indicators sit outside of the health sector. Monitoring climate and health and evaluating health system resilience does not occur solely within health systems. Indicators of exposure, for example, are monitored by weather and climate services, and some indicators of vulnerability, such as socioeconomic or geographic vulnerability, are typically measured by other government departments. Some indicators of system resilience, particularly those related to infrastructure, are monitored by other sectors, such as electrical power, while other relevant indicators related to risk distribution, (e.g., insurance coverage) are monitored by the public and insurance sectors. While the health sector is not responsible for developing or monitoring these indicators, they are relevant to core service provision and should be a part of a comprehensive package of climate-related indicators.</p>
