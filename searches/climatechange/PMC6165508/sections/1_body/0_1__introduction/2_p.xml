<p class="p">Standard health system M&amp;E is not designed to track and foster health sector resilience, defined as “the capacity of health actors, institutions, and populations to prepare for and effectively respond to crises; maintain core functions when a crisis hits; and, informed by lessons learned during the crisis, reorganize if conditions require it.” [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-15-01943" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. In particular, current M&amp;E approaches are not designed to incorporate or act upon information regarding significant environmental shifts or other hazards that have implications for operations and population health. The challenges that climate change adaptation present to standard health system M&amp;E include:
 <list list-type="bullet" class="list">
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">The need to recognize the role of weather, seasonality, climate variability, and long-term climate change on health outcomes and health sector operations.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">The need to consider decisions and their impacts over multiple overlapping time-scales.</p>

   <p class="p">The need to acknowledge and address the inherent uncertainty in the rate, magnitude, and pattern of climate change for any one location [

  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">That climate change will have multiple, interacting downstream health effects, (e.g., on food and water security) and these one-to-many relationships complicate the development of specific indicators.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">That future climate change trajectories depend on current mitigation choices, making it difficult to determine how to bound indicators temporally.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">That adaptation decisions in health and other sectors will have significant impacts on the burden of climate-sensitive health outcomes and on health sector operations, and the many-to-one relationship can make it difficult to identify indicators of principal relevance to health.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Due to inherent uncertainties and long-term trends, a significant element of climate change adaptation relates to institutional learning and knowledge management to facilitate iterative risk management, in which information regarding changing hazards associated with climate change is continuously integrated into processes that prepare for and manage health risks over time [
