<p class="p">Developing, monitoring, and evaluating indicators of risks and effectiveness of adaptation options requires human and financial resources. Although there is widespread agreement of the importance of M&amp;E within health systems, the extent to which expertise and financial resources are available is highly variable. Further, developing and maintaining the requisite datasets requires investments in surveillance and monitoring programs, and in capacity building in resource constrained situations to implement and maintain these programs and associated analyses [
