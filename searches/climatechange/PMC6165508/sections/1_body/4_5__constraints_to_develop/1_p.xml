<p class="p">A wide range of constraints and barriers to health sector adaptation present multiple challenges to developing and implementing indicators. An inherent uncertainty is what indicators will be needed at what points in time as the climate continues to change and health risks emerge [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-15-01943" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]; for instance, indicators related to sea level rise and related migration will become relevant at different points in time. Better understanding is needed of the multiple drivers of adverse climate-sensitive health outcomes and how they could interact with climate change and development scenarios in ways that could alter risks over time. Understanding is also needed of how the multiple upstream drivers of adverse health outcomes could interact in ways that could alter health burdens and adaptation effectiveness. For example, the top five upstream drivers of infectious disease threats in Europe are (in order of importance) travel and tourism, food and water quality, natural environment, global trade, and climate [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-15-01943" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. This suggests that indicators in health systems need to be linked with indicators in other sectors to ensure information is collected to support efforts to prevent possible future disease outbreaks, including addressing mismatches of datasets and ownership issues.
