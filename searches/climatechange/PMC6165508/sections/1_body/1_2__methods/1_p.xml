<p class="p">In this paper, we review major efforts to identify indicators relevant to climate change and health. Based on this review and extensive experience with health adaptation, we discuss three categories of indicators that should be considered for more comprehensive climate change and health M&amp;E programs: (1) indicators of health vulnerability, exposure, and risk related to climate variability and change; (2) indicators of climate change impacts on population health and health systems; and (3) indicators of adaptation processes and of health system resilience, including coordination and collaboration across scales and with other sectors. We then discuss constraints on indicator development and application, and explore application of the principles discussed through the example of indicator development for the Ministry of Health in Cambodia.</p>
