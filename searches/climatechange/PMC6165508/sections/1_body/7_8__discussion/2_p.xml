<p class="p">Despite being oft repeated, adaptation is not only (or sometimes even primarily) local. Whilst most climate change impacts are indeed experienced locally, such as floods, reductions in crop yields, or spread of disease, these localized impacts can have national and international ramifications that require action beyond the local level. For example, the heatwaves and fires in and around Moscow in 2010 affected wheat exports that had consequences for other countries, including impacts on food security [

The growing risks from climate variability and change, and increasing interest from development partners, mean that many local actors are implementing adaption options designed by and for local human and natural systems, such as mangrove restoration to reduce vulnerability to storm surges. Ideally, these should be embedded within national adaptation and development plans, to ensure the adaptation options implemented directly or indirectly promote achieving national development objectives, including the protection of human health and well-being.
