<p class="p">Evidence of adverse health impacts attributable to climate change on health is growing [

 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-15-01943" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. These trends underscore the urgent need for a suite of indicators to monitor and evaluate the ability of communities and nations, and their health systems, to prepare for and effectively manage the health risks of a changing climate. The uncertainties and complexities of climate change and of future development choices mean that any set of indicators need to be flexible, providing a strong element of learning to inform institutional learning and knowledge management. Established M&amp;E indicators for health systems need to be modified to provide the information needed to track the effectiveness of adaptation.
