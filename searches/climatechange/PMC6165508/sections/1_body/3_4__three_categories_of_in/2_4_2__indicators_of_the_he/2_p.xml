<p class="p">In some countries, it may be possible to model an aggregate measure of the overall burden of disease that could be attributed to a changing climate, such as disability adjusted life years (DALYs) or years of life lost (or a comparable metric) from climate variability and climate change, respectively. Other indicators can be added, depending on the local or regional climate-related exposures that can cause adverse health outcomes, such as injuries, illnesses, and deaths attributed to wildfires, or the numbers of asthmatic episodes associated with high pollen events.</p>
