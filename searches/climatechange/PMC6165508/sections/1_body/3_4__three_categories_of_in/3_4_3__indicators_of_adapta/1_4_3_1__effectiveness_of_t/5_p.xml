<p class="p">There is limited consensus on the criteria for determining whether an adaptation program or project is a success, with evaluations taking different approaches [
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-15-01943" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Indicators of success are typically observable, concrete process measures describing program implementation. Examples include indicators of the extent and effectiveness of plans incorporating climate resilience measures in water safety plans, infectious disease control programs, etc.; and indicators of the effectiveness of measures implemented to manage climate-sensitive health outcomes, including the success (or not) of approaches to adaptive management, the extent to which adaptive capacity is being built based on the number of people trained following a project, and other related issues.
