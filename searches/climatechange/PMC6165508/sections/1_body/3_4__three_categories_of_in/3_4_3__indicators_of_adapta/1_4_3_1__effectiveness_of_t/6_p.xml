 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-15-01943" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], addressing the awareness of longer-term climatic trends, organizational diversity, internal monitoring, and learning management to facilitate self-regulation and vertical and horizontal integration (with other health system levels and other sectors). Examples include monitoring the frequency with which vulnerability and adaptation assessments are updated, and tracking progress on integrating health into National Adaptation Plans through the Paris Agreement and Nationally Determined Contributions and the extent to which they are implemented. Indicators also could measure the awareness of the health risks of climate change, as measured by the number of general practitioners and other health personnel trained in climate change; and the extent of public awareness of and actions to address the health risks of climate variability and change. Other relevant indicators include pathways established for integrating and regularly updating environmental information, the presence of knowledge management systems and their application in building resilience, and indicators of coordination across the health system and with other sectors that provide services essential to health system function.
