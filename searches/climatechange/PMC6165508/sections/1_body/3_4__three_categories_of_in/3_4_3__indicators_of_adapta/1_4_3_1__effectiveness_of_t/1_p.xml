<p class="p">Health adaptation aims to reduce the burden of climate-sensitive health outcomes. Accordingly, indicators of adaptation effectiveness might track changes in the geographic range, seasonality, and incidence of climate-sensitive outcomes. Since adaptation occurs within the context of changing state and national development patterns, indicators should also track adaptive capacityâ€”the capacity of individuals, communities, and health systems to manage increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather and climate events and changing burdens of climate-sensitive health outcomes.</p>
