<p class="p">Outcome indicators are suitable for evaluation and can provide strong indications of whether adaptation goals are being met. Outcome indicators also provide information that is useful for assessing system performance, particularly when compared with a counterfactual expressing an adaptation goal. For instance, process indicators may track implementation of an extreme heat early warning system, while outcome indicators related to all-cause mortality rates can help determine how well the early warning system is protecting health during periods of extreme heat exposure.</p>
