<p class="p">Population health vulnerability is the summation of all risk and protective factors that determine whether an individual or subpopulation experiences adverse health outcomes from exposure to a climate-related hazard [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-15-01943" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Vulnerability indicators are designed to assist health officials and others to identify populations that are at particular risk for adverse health outcomes because of climate change. Indicators of vulnerability to the health risks of climate change are, in many instances, already being collected. Examples include the numbers of those living in poverty, the numbers of children and pregnant women, the numbers with chronic diseases that increase susceptibility to adverse climate-sensitive health outcomes, and the number of people/communities exposed to extreme weather and climate events (e.g., floods and drought).
