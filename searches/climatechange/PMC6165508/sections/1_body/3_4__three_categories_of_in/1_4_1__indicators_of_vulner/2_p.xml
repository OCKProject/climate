<p class="p">In addition, countries collect data on access to health care services, the status of the public health and health care delivery infrastructure, access to and quality of education, availability of resources, health insurance coverage, and other social determinants of health that influence vulnerability [

In addition, indicators of relative wealth or poverty and income inequality provide information on socioeconomic factors that can interact with climate-related hazards in determining sensitivity to climate variability and change. Geographic indicators of increased risks for specific climate-sensitive health outcomes due to, for example, the baseline climate or location, provide additional information on vulnerability. In health systems, factors influencing vulnerability include the ability of healthcare facilities to manage an extreme event. Additionally, data are collected on the extent to which communities and regions are exposed to climate-related hazards, such as heatwaves, flooding, and drought. Effectively monitoring vulnerability calls for developing integrated programs that provide information needed by a range of sectors, at useful geographic and temporal scales based on the risks that need to be managed.
