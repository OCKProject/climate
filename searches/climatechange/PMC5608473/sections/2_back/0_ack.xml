 <p class="p">We thank Gregg Verutes for his assistance with the InVEST Coastal Vulnerability model, and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation of Myanmar, Department of Meteorology and Hydrology of Myanmar and colleagues at WWF for sharing data and providing feedback and encouragement. We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on Coupled Modelling, which is responsible for CMIP, and we thank the climate modeling groups for producing and making available their model output. For CMIP the U.S. Department of Energy's Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison provides coordinating support and led development of software infrastructure in partnership with the Global Organization for Earth System Science Portals. Climate scenarios used were from the NEX-GDDP dataset, prepared by the Climate Analytics Group and NASA Ames Research Center using the NASA Earth Exchange, and distributed by the NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS). We thank the Wildlife Conservation Society Programme Myanmar, Birdlife International and Conservation International for sharing Key Biodiversity Area data. These data represent a subset of global Important Bird Areas developed and maintained by the BirdLife partnership and KBAs developed and maintained by Conservation International and partners.
