  <title class="title">Change in ES supply and susceptibility of townships to ES losses from loss of natural vegetation in the 2040s with climate change relative to baseline climate conditions.</title>
  <p class="p">Change is shown across three freshwater services: a) sediment retention for drinking water quality, b) regulation of dry-season baseflows for drinking water availability, and c) inland flood risk reduction for flood-prone villages. For each climate change scenario, change in ES supply is shown in the left column and change in susceptibility to loss is shown in the right column. Susceptibility to loss is measured as the percent change in service with loss of natural vegetation between the climate change scenario for the 2040s and historic climate conditions.</p>
