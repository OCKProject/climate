<p class="p">The CV model produces a qualitative estimate of how changes to natural habitats can affect coastal communities’ exposure to storm-induced erosion and flooding [
 <xref rid="pone.0184951.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. By considering biological and geophysical factors along the coastline, the model differentiates areas with relatively high or low exposure to erosion and inundation during storms, and indicates the role that natural habitats play in helping reduce that exposure. Combining these results with global population information can show areas along a given coastline where humans are most vulnerable to storm waves and surge, and where natural habitats play the greatest role in protecting people. The output used from this model is “habitat role,” an index indicating how much protection coastal natural habitat provides to each shoreline segment. Habitat role is calculated as the difference in exposure to coastal storms between current habitat and a total loss of coastal habitats. This approach represents an extreme scenario of conversion but is useful for gauging relative importance of ecosystems at the national scale.
