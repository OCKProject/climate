<p class="p">Baseflow represents the amount of precipitation that enters streams through subsurface flow, both during and between rain events, and is computed based on a local water balance and hydrologic routing. The index used in this study represents baseflow over the entire year. For both the flow retention and the baseflow indices, results are presented as the difference between the current landscape and the hypothetical alternate landscape in which all natural vegetation has been converted to agriculture.</p>
