 <xref rid="pone.0184951.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. It relies on the widely-used Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) to compute soil loss based on climate, soil, topographic, and land use/land cover (LULC) information. The model converts soil loss estimates into sediment export, i.e. the amount of sediment observed in streams after retention by vegetation. In this study, we computed sediment retention maps as the difference in sediment export (expressed in tons/pixel) between the current LULC and a hypothetical extreme scenario where the current landscape was entirely converted to agriculture. In other words, this is the sediment retention benefit of maintaining the current vegetation. We chose agriculture as the alternative scenario for this heuristic experiment since agricultural expansion is an important driver of deforestation and is expected to increase as Myanmarâ€™s agriculture sector becomes increasingly export oriented [
