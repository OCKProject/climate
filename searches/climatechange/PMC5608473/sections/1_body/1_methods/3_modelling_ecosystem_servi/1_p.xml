<p class="p">To map and quantify the biophysical supply of the focal ES, we used the InVEST 3.2.0 Sediment Delivery Ratio (SDR), Seasonal Water Yield (SWY) and Coastal Vulnerability (CV) models [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0184951.s001" class="xref">S1 Appendix</xref> for more details about the models and data inputs. InVEST is a suite of quantitative, spatially explicit, production function-based ES models. Model outputs used in this study, described in detail below, are proxy variables that are interpreted in relative terms, rather than physical quantities. Additional information on model uncertainty and value interpretation is provided in the SI.
