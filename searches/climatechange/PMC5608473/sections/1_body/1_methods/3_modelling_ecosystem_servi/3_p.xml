<p class="p">The SWY model estimates the amount of runoff production and relative contribution to baseflow of different parts of the landscape. Based on monthly precipitation, reference evapotranspiration, and LULC runoff properties, the model computes two indices representing quickflow and baseflow. Quickflow represents the amount of precipitation that is converted to direct runoff, entering streams soon after a rain event, and is computed based on the NRCS curve number method [
