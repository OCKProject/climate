<p class="p">To understand the degree to which areas important for providing the focal ES coincide with biodiversity conservation priorities, we examined the overlap between Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) [

 <xref rid="pone.0184951.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>], and hotspots of ES provision in Myanmar. KBAs are sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity [
 <xref rid="pone.0184951.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Shapefiles for KBAs in Myanmar were obtained from BirdLife International

 <xref rid="pone.0184951.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. We defined ES hotspots as the top 20% of service provision area for each of three freshwater services: sediment retention for drinking water quality, dry-season baseflow for drinking water availability and inland flood risk reduction for flood-prone villages. We combined these to identify which areas were hotspots for one, two or all three of these services, and overlaid these with maps of terrestrial KBAs (making up 16.3% of Myanmar’s area) and protected areas (PAs, making up 7.4% of Myanmar’s land area) and determined the amount of overlap. The observed area of overlap was determined using ArcGIS. We compared observed overlap with the amount expected by chance based on the joint probability distribution assuming independence, both among hotspots for different services and between ES hotspots and biodiversity priority areas (KBAs and PAs). The probability of multiple independent events co-occurring is the product of the probabilities of each event occurring separately. Expected overlap by chance was calculated in this way using Excel, based on the fraction of Myanmar’s land area covered by each ES hotspot (by definition, 0.2), as well as by KBAs (0.163) and PAs (0.074).
