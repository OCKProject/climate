<p class="p">The low and high ends of the range of climate change estimates, along with baseline climate, were translated into inputs for the InVEST models. See 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0184951.s001" class="xref">S1 Appendix</xref> for details. The SDR model includes climate in the form of annual average rainfall erosivity, which we calculated based on annual precipitation amount summed from the monthly projections. The SWY model includes precipitation amount, number of rainfall events and reference evapotranspiration all at the monthly time scale. Reference evapotranspiration was calculated from precipitation amount and temperature using the Modified Hargreaves method [
 <xref rid="pone.0184951.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Both precipitation amount and number of rainfall events were obtained directly from the baseline or projected climate data. We modeled SWY under the low and high ends of the climate range using either all low or all high estimates of precipitation amount, number of rainfall events or temperature. Sea-level rise projections were used in the CV model. All climate estimates were used at their native resolution. To calculate ES supply and benefits under climate change, we again compared the current landscape with a hypothetical alternate landscape (conversion to agriculture for SDR and SWY models; complete loss of mangroves, seagrasses and marshes for the CV model).
