<p class="p">Baseline and future climate conditions for temperature and precipitation were developed from the NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP) dataset (NASA, 2015). The resolution of both the observed and the projected products is .25 degrees by .25 degrees. For temperature and precipitation (total amount and number of rainfall events &gt; 0.2 mm), monthly means of long-term average climatology were projected for the 2040 (2031â€“2050) time period for each 0.25 degree gridcell and calendar month. The combination of 21 climate models and two climate forcing scenarios, or Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) [
 <xref rid="pone.0184951.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], yielded 42 potential outcomes for the projected time period. For each gridcell and calendar month, the 25
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentile of numerically ranked model results for RCP 4.5 was defined as a low estimate for changes in climate, while the 75
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentile of numerically ranked model results for RCP 8.5 was defined as a high estimate. These points in the model output distribution represent a range of likely future climates. Because the 25
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> and 75
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentiles are defined separately for each calendar month and gridcell, different GCMs can occupy the 25
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> and 75
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentiles in different months and locations. This approach broadens the range of possible outcomes compared to selecting a single GCM based on the spatially and temporally averaged 25
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> and 75
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentiles of the distribution.
