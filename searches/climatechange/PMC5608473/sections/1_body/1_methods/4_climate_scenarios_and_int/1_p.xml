<p class="p">We used downscaled estimates of temperature, precipitation and sea level under baseline climate conditions (1980–2005 for temperature and precipitation, 2000–2004 for sea level rise) as well as projections of future climate conditions. To represent the uncertainty in climate projections, we used the bounds of a range of future climate conditions, rather than a single average estimate.</p>
