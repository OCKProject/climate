<p class="p">There are a few limitations that need to be considered when interpreting the climate information and projections. First, the combination of limited historical climate data and a highly spatially heterogeneous climate associated with complex topography and coastlines may in turn affect the skill of the climate projections, which by necessity given the data shortages are based upon a modeled representation of baseline climate (and therefore subject to any limitations within the NEX-GDDP dataset). Second, while the projections presented here are designed to capture a range of possible outcomes, as with all climate projections, deep uncertainties render it impossible to develop truly probabilistic projections Finally, these climate scenarios were not translated into climate change-induced projected changes in LULC; further changes in ES provision are likely depending on future land use change, driven by the direct response of vegetation to climate change or human responses to shifting rainfall and temperature increases, but were not modeled due to a lack of national-scale information at sufficient resolution.</p>
