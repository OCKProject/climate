<p class="p">Sea-level rise was projected for the 2050s (2050â€“2059) time period. Twenty-four models were used from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) to account for thermal expansion of the ocean and dynamically-driven changes in relative ocean height, with other data sources and methods accounting for land-based ice loss and changes in land water storage [

 <xref rid="pone.0184951.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Due to the lack of long-duration tide gauge data in Myanmar, local land subsidence or uplift could not be accounted for in the sea level rise projections. The low estimate for sea level rise was derived from the 25
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentile of the combined RCP 4.5 and 8.5 numerically ranked model outcomes, and the high estimate was derived from the 75
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentile of the combined numerically ranked RCP 4.5 and 8.5 outcomes. The spatial resolution of the sea level rise was 1.0 degree.
