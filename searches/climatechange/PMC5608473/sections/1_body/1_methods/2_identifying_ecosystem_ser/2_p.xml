<p class="p">We modeled the supply of these services under baseline climate conditions and under the bounds of a range of possible future climate conditions. We then integrated measures of biophysical supply with information on the location and number of beneficiaries to determine where ES provision is greatest, as well as to understand which beneficiaries would be most impacted by ES losses. Finally, we compared hotspots of ES provision with other, established priority areas for conservation–specifically, currently-protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas–to determine where and the degree to which conservation has the potential to contribute to multiple objectives. We provide additional details about each step in the following sections.</p>
