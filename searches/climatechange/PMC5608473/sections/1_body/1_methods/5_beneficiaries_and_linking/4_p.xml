<p class="p">We translated the biophysical metrics of ES supply from the InVEST models into importance for ES provision by weighting supply by the number of beneficiaries receiving a particular service from a particular place [

For drinking water quality and dry-season water availability, we multiplied supply by the number of surface water-dependent households located in all downstream watersheds. Because the SDR model outputs estimates of sediment loads (in tons), whereas drinking water quality is generally more affected by sediment concentration, the supply of sediment retention for drinking water quality was standardized by the catchment size serving surface water-dependent households. We therefore use catchment area as a proxy for runoff volume to compare sediment concentration across catchments, rather than sediment loads. In the case of flood risk reduction, we weighted supply by the number of downstream villages, as household counts were not available at this resolution. For coastal vulnerability, we weighted supply by the total population located within 3 km of the focal habitat.
