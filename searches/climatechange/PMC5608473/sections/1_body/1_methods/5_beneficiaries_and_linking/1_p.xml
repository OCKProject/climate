<p class="p">We used data on the location and needs of people and infrastructure to assess the provision of ES benefits. We considered two benefits from sediment retention: drinking water purification and reservoir function. In the case of drinking water purification, the beneficiaries included households reliant on surface water for drinking. We determined the number of households per township using surface water for drinking based on the 2014 Myanmar Population and Housing Census [

Because some areas were not enumerated in the 2014 census, our results underestimate the level of service provision in these parts of the country, particularly Kachin, Rakhine and eastern Shan states. In the case of reservoir function, we considered reservoirs as beneficiaries and used the GRanD database [
 <xref rid="pone.0184951.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>] to determine the location of these facilities. While this database omits many smaller reservoirs in Myanmar, no additional information on reservoir location was available at the time of analysis. Therefore, our results provide a conservative estimate of sediment retention services for reservoir function.
