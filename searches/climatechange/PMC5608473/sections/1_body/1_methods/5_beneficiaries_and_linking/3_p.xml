 <xref rid="pone.0184951.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] to map the watersheds contributing surface water to towns, villages and dams. These watersheds served as servicesheds for water purification and dry-season water availability, based on the assumption that people relying on surface water use nearby water bodies in the case of drinking water-related services. In the case of flood-affected villages, we assumed these same watersheds constituted the servicesheds that influenced inland flood risk. For coastal vulnerability, we considered the total population living within 3 km of a focal shoreline segment as beneficiaries, calculated from population density data from WorldPop [
