<p class="p">Hotspots of current service provision (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184951.g006" class="xref">Fig 6</xref>) vary by service, but their overlap was greater than would be expected solely by chance. Across the three services considered, 1.9% of the country fell in the top 20% for all three services (vs. 0.8% expected if random overlap), 13.9% in the top 20% for two services (vs. 9.6% if random). Concordance between the hotspots for dry-season base flows for drinking water available and for inland flood risk reduction was the greatest, with 42% overlap. There was 32% overlap between hotspots for inland flood risk reduction and sediment retention for drinking water quality, and 25% overlap between dry season baseflows and sediment retention.
