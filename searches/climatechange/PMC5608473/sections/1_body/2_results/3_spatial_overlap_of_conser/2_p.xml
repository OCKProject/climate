<p class="p">The designated KBAs cover 16.3% and existing PAs cover 7.4% of Myanmar’s land area, with over 99% of PAs also falling within a KBA. Overall, overlap between ES hotspots, KBAs and existing PAs was also greater than expected simply from chance (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184951.g006" class="xref">Fig 6</xref>): the area falling into the top 20% for at least one of the three services is 41.2% of Myanmar’s land area, but 50% of KBAs and 62.3% of PAs, representing 20% and 51% greater congruence than random. However, areas in the top 20% for all three services fell outside of KBAs or PAs more often than expected (8.1% vs 16.3% expected for KBAs, and 5.2% vs 7.4% expected for PAs). Twenty-nine percent of the sediment retention hotspot fell within KBAs, along with 25% of the inland flood risk reduction hotspot, but only 13% of the dry-season baseflow hotspot. PAs, which cover less than half the area of KBAs, included 17% of the inland flood risk reduction hotspot, 14% of the sediment retention hotspot and only 5% of the dry-season baseflow hotspot.
