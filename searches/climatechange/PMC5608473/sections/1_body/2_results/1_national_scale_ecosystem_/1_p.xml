<p class="p">The biophysical supply of ES, indicating the potential to provide ES benefits, varies within Myanmar and along its coastline as a function of climate and topography, along with properties of the current vegetation and the assumed alternative land use (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184951.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>, left column). For example, natural vegetation contributes most to sediment retention in currently forested areas situated on steep slopes, especially near to streams. Not only is soil loss higher in the areas converted to agriculture, but it is also less likely to be retained by the degraded landscape downslope before reaching the stream. Natural vegetation increases dry-season baseflows in areas with dense forest, where deep-rooted trees contribute to higher infiltration rate. Natural vegetation plays the greatest role in reducing inland flood risk in places with dense forest and high precipitation, where peak flow is higher. Mangroves are very effective at reducing coastal vulnerability to storms, especially compared to seagrass beds [
