<p class="p">The degree to which people are susceptible to reductions in drinking water quality and dry-season water availability, as well as to increases in inland flood risk and vulnerability to coastal storms also varies spatially and by service (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184951.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). Townships in mountainous areas in the north, west and south would experience the greatest increase in sediment loads in drinking water sources with loss of natural vegetation. In contrast, loss of natural vegetation would lead to the greatest reduction in dry-season baseflows for townships near Myanmarâ€™s eastern border, and to the greatest increase in inland flood risk index in the west. Townships in the southern portion of the Dawei peninsula and in southern Rakhine state to the north would experience the greatest increases in coastal vulnerability with the loss of coastal habitats.
