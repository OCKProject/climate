<p class="p">Regardless of climate change scenario, the parts of the landscape that currently provide the greatest amounts of services under baseline climate conditions are likely to remain important under the climate change scenarios considered here (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184951.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>). We considered hotspots as the area that fell within the top 20% of provision for a given service and climate scenario (baseline, low estimate for climate change, high estimate for climate change). Hotspot areareas were consistently classified as hotspots across all three climate scenarios in 95% of instances for sediment retention for drinking water quality, 79% of instances for dry-season baseflows for drinking water availability, and 92% of instances for inland flood risk reduction.
