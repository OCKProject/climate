<p class="p">For all GCMs, calendar months and Myanmar regions, temperatures are projected to rise as the century progresses, with the largest warming associated with RCP 8.5, which corresponds to current global emissions trends. In general, slightly more warming is projected in interior regions than in southerly and coastal areas. Precipitation is projected to increase in most, but not all GCMs. In general, precipitation increases are projected to be largest in the monsoon season. See Supporting information (

Changes in average ocean height are expected to be essentially homogenous across the entire Myanmar coast and by season. As noted in the Methods, changes in the elevation of the land itself will be heterogeneous with deltas especially prone to land subsidence; however, land elevation changes were excluded from this analysis due to the absence of tide gauge data.
