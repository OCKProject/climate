<p class="p">Projected changes in climate are expected to alter ES provision in multiple ways. Under the high estimate for changes in climate showing increasing precipitation, natural ecosystems are expected to play even greater roles in retaining sediment, regulating dry-season water availability and reducing inland flood risk (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184951.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>, fourth column). At the low end of the range of projected future rainfall, in which annual precipitation declines slightly even as variability and intensity of the strongest rainfall events likely increases, supply of some services may be reduced in certain areas. This is particularly the case for sediment retention and for dry-season baseflow regulation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184951.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>, first and second columns). For sediment retention, reduced precipitation lessens expected erosion with loss of natural vegetation, resulting in reduced service provision (median = -4% reduction in avoided sediment loss as compared to baseline climate conditions), while increased precipitation under the high estimate leads to increased erosion with loss of natural vegetation and therefore increases the service provided by retaining natural vegetation (median = 23% increase in avoided sediment loss).
