<p class="p">Precipitation changes are likely to also alter both the amount of sediment reaching reservoirs and being retained by upstream vegetation. For the 15 reservoirs assessed in this study, sediment export to reservoirs in the absence of any land use change was estimated to decrease by an average of 3.4% (standard deviation (SD) = 1.2%) at the low end, but increase by 23.3% (SD = 3.3%) at the high end of the range of likely climate change. In addition, the amount of sediment retained upstream decreased an average of 3.4% (SD = 1.2%) under the low estimate and increased 23.3% (SD = 3.4%) under the high estimate.</p>
