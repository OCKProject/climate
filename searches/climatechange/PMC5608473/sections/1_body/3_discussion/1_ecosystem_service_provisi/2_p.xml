<p class="p">In addition, our results highlight two ways that climate change through the 2040s is likely to affect the role of natural ecosystems and the ES they provide. First, even if existing vegetation and land use remain unchanged, climate change may negatively affect water resources and increase flood risk. For example, under the high end of the climate change range, we found an increase in soil loss and higher transport of sediment to streams due to increases in the amount of precipitation. Although existing natural vegetation can buffer this process, it cannot fully mitigate it, as suggested by the difference in sediment export to reservoirs between the high end of the climate change range and baseline climate conditions, even in the absence of vegetation change.</p>
