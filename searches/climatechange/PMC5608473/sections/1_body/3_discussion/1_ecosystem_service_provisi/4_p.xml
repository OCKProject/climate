<p class="p">Our assessment therefore suggests that conservation of natural vegetation in these areas is likely to secure valuable benefits for the people of Myanmar today and in coming decades. We note that our analyses assume no major shifts in vegetation type or function occur over this time scale. Accounting for the effects of climate change on ES through changes in vegetation and ecological processes would be a valuable next step. Climate change effects could include direct ecological responses to changes in climate conditions, as well as indirect effects through human activities due to climate change, including land conversion and changes in agricultural practices. Detailed national-scale information on the effects of climate change on vegetation in Myanmar is lacking. However, global models suggest that Myanmarâ€™s vulnerability to vegetation shifts from climate change is relatively low [

Climate feedbacks, shocks, surprises, and extreme climate events not captured by the climate methods described here, which are much more difficult to model and predict, could also compromise the ability of these systems to deliver services at their full capacity.
