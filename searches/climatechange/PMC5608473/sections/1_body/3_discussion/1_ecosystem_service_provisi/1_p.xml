<p class="p">Our results confirm that biophysical measures of ES supply alone are inadequate for determining the areas that deliver the greatest ES benefits to people or infrastructure (

Instead, priority ES provision areas are shaped by variation in the spatial distribution of ES supply and demand, including variation in demand between beneficiary types (e.g., people dependent on surface water for drinking water vs. reservoirs). While the importance of considering both ES supply and demand has been widely acknowledged [
