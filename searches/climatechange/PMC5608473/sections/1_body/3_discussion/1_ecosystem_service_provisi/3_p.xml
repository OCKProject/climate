<p class="p">Second, we find that the higher level of ES provided by natural vegetation under the high end of the climate change range is associated with increasing vulnerability of beneficiaries to vegetation loss. This suggests that the effects of climate change may be two-fold: both worsening environmental conditions and worsening the consequences of losing natural capital. To maintain baseline levels of water quality, water availability and flood risk likely requires more than preserving existing stocks of natural capital. Nature-based solutions, such as habitat restoration, can be considered alongside traditional, engineering-based approaches [

At the same time, it is important to recognize that necessary interventions to enhance ecosystems and their resilience can be challenging to effectively complete, and do not replace the need to protect existing natural capital [
 <xref rid="pone.0184951.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. Even with climate change likely to affect levels of ES provision, we find that the places providing the greatest ES benefits under baseline climate conditions are likely to remain important into the 2040s, under the range of climate change estimates we considered (
