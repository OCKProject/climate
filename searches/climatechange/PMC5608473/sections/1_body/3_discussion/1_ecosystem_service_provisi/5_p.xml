The differences in ES provision between the two ends of the climate change range demonstrate this. This said, greenhouse gas emissions scenarios have proven to be historically conservative, with subsequent revisions toward expected higher emissions. With current global emissions rates tracking RCP 8.5, planning for the change in provision under this scenario would be the most conservative means of reducing risk.</p>
