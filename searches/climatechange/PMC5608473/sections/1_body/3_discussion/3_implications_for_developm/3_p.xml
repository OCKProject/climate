<p class="p">Because regional- and state-level land use planning and climate change adaptation planning will play an important role in Myanmar’s development trajectory, refining and updating this national assessment to provide information relevant to decision-making at these levels will also be important. This is especially critical given that national ES priorities based on total population are heavily influenced by the country’s largest urban centers and may not reflect regional priorities or the needs of rural populations [
