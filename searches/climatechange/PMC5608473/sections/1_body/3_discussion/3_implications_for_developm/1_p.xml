<p class="p">Our results provide a starting point for integrating ES information into national land use, development and climate adaptation planning in Myanmar. A number of national policies and strategies, including a Green Economy Strategy and Framework, Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan, Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan and Land Use Policy, are currently being developed or have been already adopted. Information on ES will be key to ensure successful implementation of these policies and guide decision-making when it comes to land use and investments that can create economic, social and environmental benefits, including resilience to the impacts of climate change. By highlighting areas where loss of natural ecosystems would have outsized negative consequences for Myanmarâ€™s people and existing infrastructure, the national assessment can guide land use planning for agricultural expansion and resettlement plans, as well as inform the location and design of infrastructure projects such as roads, transmission lines, canals and hydropower and other energy projects.</p>
