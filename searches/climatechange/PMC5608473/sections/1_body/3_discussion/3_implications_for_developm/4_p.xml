<p class="p">Finally, assessment of additional ES, and their response to land use change and climate change, would be a valuable step for future work, at both the national and sub-national levels. The services assessed here were particularly limited by the availability of spatial data, both ecological and socio-economic. The societal and economic value of many other ES such as non-timber forest products, nursery and breeding habitat contributing to fisheries, and wild insect pollination contributing to crop production are likely quite high [
 <xref rid="pone.0184951.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>], but a lack of comprehensive data prevents a detailed understanding of how production of services varies spatially, where ES benefits flow to, and how the value might change with forest loss or climate change.
