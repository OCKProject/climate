<p class="p">In interpreting the maps provided in this study, several points should be noted. First, the outputs of the biophysical models are best used to assess relative spatial or temporal differences. Given that the uncertainties around future estimates of climate change have large effects on biophysical predictions, a robust interpretation of results consists in identifying areas that are consistently identified as hotspots of services. Second, the weighting approach used to combine ES supply and demand is subject to limitations of multi-criteria analyses [

 <xref rid="pone.0184951.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. Finally, we assess ES benefits by comparing existing LULC to a scenario in which natural vegetation was converted to agriculture. While the alternate scenario reflects national trends, refining these scenarios in order to explore likely or potential futures at the regional level would provide an opportunity to increase the relevance of our results to decision making.
