<p class="p">Although we find that the most important areas for drinking water quality regulation, dry-season water availability and inland flood risk reduction overlap more than would be expected by chance, there is substantial variation due to differences in both the biophysical processes underlying service provision and the location of beneficiaries. Securing ample levels of these services for the people who rely on them will likely require management that targets different services separately. Our results mirror findings from elsewhere in the world [

In particular, ES priority areas that fall within KBAs but outside established protected areas could be managed to secure benefits to people and contribute to biodiversity conservation. Conservation of areas outside KBAs might also help secure connectivity among current conservation priority areas, as well as enhance the ability of species and ecosystems to adapt to future climate regimes [
