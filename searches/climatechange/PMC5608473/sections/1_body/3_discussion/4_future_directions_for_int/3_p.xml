<p class="p">Advances in data and modeling would provide a more precise and nuanced understanding of future changes in ES provision with climate change. In particular, future assessments would benefit from: i) assessing the impacts of climate change on ES through changes in vegetation and land management; ii) accounting for the impacts of extreme weather events on natural capital and ES; iii) better baseline data to improve projections; and iv) improved accounting for and communication of uncertainty. Integration of climate information into ES assessments would be enhanced by the capacity to model a greater diversity of linkages between climate, ecosystems and ES. The ability to assess impacts of climate change on ES through changes in vegetation and land management, as previously discussed, as well as improved accounting for the impacts of extreme weather events, rather than relying on annual or monthly climate data, would be especially valuable. These efforts would benefit from more comprehensive observed baseline climate and land use data, requiring investment, integration of local expert knowledge, local capacity building, and collaboration across countries and sectors. Finally, in line with recognized challenges for ES assessments in general [
 <xref rid="pone.0184951.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>], a more complete accounting for uncertainty in ES outcomes would increase the robustness of assessment results. This includes uncertainty inherent within the InVEST models as well as originating in the data used, including both biophysical factors governing ES supply and the demographic, socio-economic, political and institutional factors governing demand for and access to ES benefits.
