<p class="p">Our assessment process also highlighted trade-offs among analysis complexity, knowledge ownership by stakeholders and decision-making relevance. More sophisticated, dynamic models would provide a more precise characterization of the effects of climate change on natural capital and ES provision. However, this inherently increases data requirements and analytical complexity, resulting in proportionate difficulty in developing local capacity to replicate and build on assessments, potentially affecting the impact of assessments on planning decisions. Balancing this trade-off between complexity, feasibility and utility can be difficult, and requires consideration of the ultimate aims of producing integrated ES and climate assessments: is it to provide a foundation for locally-based knowledge production, shape stakeholder thinking, inform a specific policy or decision, or some combination? Different answers require different approaches [
