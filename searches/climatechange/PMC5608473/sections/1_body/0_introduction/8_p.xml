<p class="p">To understand the degree to which these conclusions are sensitive to climate change, we assess whether the source and magnitude of benefits, as well as the susceptibility of beneficiaries, change under future climate scenarios. We use downscaled temperature and precipitation projections from 21 General Circulation Models (GCMs) [

 <xref rid="pone.0184951.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. To evaluate the complementarity between ES and other conservation objectives, we assess the degree to which the most important ES provision areas overlap with protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs; sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity). Finally, reflecting on our experiences integrating ES and climate information in Myanmar, we suggest priority directions for a decision-relevant applied research agenda.
