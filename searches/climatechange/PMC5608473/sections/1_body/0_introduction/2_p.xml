<p class="p">While the science and tools to support these efforts are advancing rapidly, substantial gaps remain between the promise of ES-based approaches and their application in common practice. ES assessments routinely focus on ecosystem properties and processes without considering whether and for whom actual benefits are produced [

These gaps hinder the use of ES information for decision-making that is aimed at delivering durable gains in human well-being through an understanding of synergies and trade-offs between development activities and benefits from nature.
