<p class="p">In this context, there is a critical and immediate need for national-scale information on natural capital and the benefits it provides–both for local livelihoods and the larger economy–to contribute to planning the country’s national development pathway. Here we map and quantify how Myanmar’s natural capital provides key benefits to the country’s people and infrastructure, both under baseline climate conditions and a range of projected future climate conditions. This assessment resulted from a 2014 request by then-president of Myanmar, U Thein Sein, after seeing early outputs from this study at a sub-national scale. Specifically, we investigate at a national scale: 1) where natural ecosystems in Myanmar have the greatest potential to provide benefits in the form of four ES: sediment retention, regulation of dry-season water availability, flood risk reduction, and coastal storm protection; 2) where, given the locations of people and infrastructure that rely on these services, natural ecosystems are currently providing the greatest benefits; and 3) which beneficiaries are most susceptible to losing ES benefits from loss of natural vegetation.</p>
