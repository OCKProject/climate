<p class="p">Here we provide a practical example from Myanmar to demonstrate how natural capital and climate change information can be integrated with data on the location and dependence of people and infrastructure on ES in order to contribute to development planning. Myanmar provides an excellent opportunity to advance natural capital assessment approaches and integrate their results into development policy and planning. After decades of restrictive military rule that both limited economic development and influenced the rate and nature of natural resource exploitation, the country now faces a unique crossroads: unlike so many countries that have prioritized economic development, but at great cost to their natural wealth, Myanmar may still have time to choose a path that allows for economic development while preserving ecosystems and the critical services they provide to the countryâ€™s citizens and its economy.</p>
