<p class="p">The extremely high diversity of soil microorganisms makes it difficult to establish links between individual microbial taxa and specific functions (Allison &amp; Martiny, 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Shifts in community structure can give a first indication of when and how microbial adaptation will influence the rate of ecosystem processes (McGuire &amp; Treseder, 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>), and hence, identifying the responses of microbial communities to change is an important first step to determining the functional consequences for ecosystems (Wallenstein &amp; Hall, 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Zak, Pregitzer, Burton, Edwards, &amp; Kellner,
