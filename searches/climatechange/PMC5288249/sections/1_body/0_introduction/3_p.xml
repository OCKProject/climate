<p class="p">Soil microbial communities carry out the bulk of decomposition (Swift, Heal, &amp; Anderson, 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1979</xref>) and catalyse many important processes that drive terrestrial carbon and nutrient cycling (Schlesinger, 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1991</xref>). Changes in precipitation and temperature can affect soil microbial communities directly by altering their growth and activity but also indirectly via effects on the vegetation (Bardgett, Freeman, &amp; Ostle, 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Plant‐mediated effects include changes in plant growth, biomass allocation, photosynthetic rate, litter quality, and water use efficiency, which are all likely to affect soil microbial communities (Gutknecht, Field, &amp; Balser, 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). At the same time, plant growth is also strongly influenced by the soil microbial community because plant nutrient requirements are largely met by the breakdown and mineralization of organic matter, which requires the combined activities of many different microorganisms (Burns et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). This reciprocal exchange of resources between plants and soil microbial communities underpins ecosystem function, succession, and recovery from disturbance (Reynolds et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0101" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>) and is hence central to ecosystem responses to global change.
