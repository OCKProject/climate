<p class="p">Contrary to the widely held view that high functional redundancy of microorganisms confers resilience and resistance of communities to perturbations, soil microbial communities are generally sensitive to change and not immediately resilient after disturbance (Allison &amp; Martiny, 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Shifts in microbial community composition in response to disturbance arise primarily as a result of variation in the growth rates and resource‐use efficiencies of the constituent organisms, as well as their inherent resistance and acclimation capacities (Schimel, Balser, &amp; Wallenstein, 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). In general, soil fungi have higher C:N biomass stoichiometry, slower growth and turnover rates, and higher potential carbon use efficiency compared to bacteria (Waring, Averill, &amp; Hawkes, 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). The lower nutrient requirement of fungi and their ability to degrade recalcitrant plant litter gives them an advantage when resource quality is low, whereas rapid growth and turnover make bacteria better competitors for labile, high‐quality substrates (Waring et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). These general patterns of resource use and turnover support the widely held view that soil food webs dominated by fungi are more resistant to climate changes, whereas bacteria‐dominated systems are more resilient (De Vries et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012a</xref>). Nonetheless, there are also substantial differences in the physiologies, adaptive capacities, and resource use of organisms within a given taxonomic group, which will shape community‐level responses to climate change.
