<p class="p">Although there are multiple lines of evidence that climate change can rapidly affect soil microbial communities (Allison &amp; Martiny 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>), long‐term experiments are required to assess indirect effects via changes in plant species composition, especially in systems with stress‐tolerant, slow‐growing vegetation. Importantly, differences in the resource use and adaptive capacities of generalist and specialist soil microorganisms also make plant‐mediated effects of climate change much harder to predict than the direct effects of changes to the abiotic environment. As a result, community‐level responses to long‐term chronic changes could differ substantially from the immediate responses to short‐term perturbations (Schimel et al.,
