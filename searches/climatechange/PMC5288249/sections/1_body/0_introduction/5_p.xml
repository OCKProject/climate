<p class="p">Soil microbial communities that experience high natural variation in environmental conditions are likely to be dominated by generalist taxa with broad tolerances and resource use (Wallenstein &amp; Hall, 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). By contrast, taxa with specialist functions or high resource specificity are likely to be more sensitive to disturbance (Schimel, 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>). The responses of these subordinate taxa to climate changes may be particularly important for the functioning of nutrient‐poor systems because species‐rich plant assemblages have high chemical diversity (van der Heijden, Bardgett, &amp; van Straalen, 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>), which requires greater microbial resource specificity and reduces functional redundancy (Waring et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). As soil microbes facilitate nutrient‐driven niche partitioning in plants (Reynolds &amp; Haubensak, 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>), changes in microbial community structure or activity as a result of altered resource availability will feed back to affect plant nutrient availability.
