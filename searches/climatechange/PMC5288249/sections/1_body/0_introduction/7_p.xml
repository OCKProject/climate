<p class="p">We investigated long‐term changes in soil bacterial and fungal communities at the Buxton Climate Change Impacts Study (henceforth “Buxton”), where temperature and rainfall have been manipulated since 1993. Although the vegetation in this nutrient‐poor ancient grassland has proven remarkably resistant to change at the community level (Grime et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>), there has been substantial small‐scale turnover in plant species composition within microsites (100 cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) in response to summer drought and winter heating treatments (Fridley, Grime, Askew, Moser, &amp; Stevens, 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Detailed existing data on plant species composition and plant traits in small‐scale microsites within the treatment plots (Fridley, Lynn, Grime, &amp; Askew,

 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) make this experiment an ideal platform to investigate potential links between plant and microbial responses to long‐term change. We hypothesized that long‐term climate manipulations would alter soil microbial communities and that the shifts in soil fungal and bacterial community structure would be related to changes in plant species composition via the quality of plant inputs to the soil.
