<p class="p">Our study highlights the importance of considering long‐term and indirect effects of climate changes on soil microbial communities, especially in nutrient‐poor systems with slow‐growing vegetation. Whereas climate changes can rapidly modify the abiotic environment, comprehensive shifts in community‐level plant functional traits are likely to become more relevant and more apparent over time. The unexpected drought response of soil fungi and the links between microbial communities and key plant functional traits in our study suggest that microbial resistance or acclimation to direct climate change effects could be subsumed by altered plant species composition in the long run, with as yet unknown consequences for ecosystem function.</p>
