<p class="p">Vector fitting to NMDS ordinations of plot‐level data revealed that the heating and watered treatments had little or no effect, but there were substantial changes in soil microbial communities in the drought plots. There was only a minor effect of the summer drought treatment on the whole soil fungal community (
