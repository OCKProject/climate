<p class="p">Pairwise concordance between plant species composition and soil fungal or bacterial communities in microsites within each treatment was investigated using Procrustes rotation (Procrustes function) based on the most stable NMDS solutions for all three communities; the Procrustes statistic was tested with 9,999 permutations (protest function). As no vegetation survey was conducted in the soil microbial sampling year (2011), we first compared plant species composition from the 2008 and 2012 surveys and then performed separate comparisons for each year. Plant species composition was highly correlated between survey years (Procustes correlation:
