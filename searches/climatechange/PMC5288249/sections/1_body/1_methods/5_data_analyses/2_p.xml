 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), and all multivariate analyses were performed using the vegan (Oksanen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) package. As soil depth and pH within microsites were inversely correlated, we used the first axis scores from a principal components analysis of multiple soil depth and pH measurements to characterize each microsite (Fridley et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; henceforth “microsite scores”). For each microsite, we also included plant species data from Fridley et al. (

 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>); leaf dry matter content (dry‐to‐fresh mass ratio); and leaf C:N ratio. Community‐weighted trait values were calculated by taking the weighted average of trait values of those species present in a given microsite from their abundances, using visual cover classes (0–4, 5–24, 25–49, 50–74, 75%+; Fridley et al.,
