<p class="p">To differentiate the responses of dominant and subordinate fungal and bacterial taxa, we performed all ordinations with and without the most abundant TRFs. We used conservative cutoff points so that &lt;10% of all taxa were considered abundant. Consequently, dominant taxa were defined as those with total relative TRF abundance &gt;0.75% across all plots for fungi and &gt;1% for bacteria; all other TRFs were considered as subordinate taxa.</p>
