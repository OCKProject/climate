<p class="p">The effects of climate treatments on soil fungal and bacterial community composition at the plot level were examined by permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PerMANOVA; adonis function) after testing for homogeneity of dispersions among treatments (betadisper function); models were tested with 9,999 permutations constrained within blocks of replicate plots (permutest function). We used nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) based on Bray–Curtis dissimilarities to represent shifts in soil microbial communities (metaMDS function); stable solutions with stress scores &lt;0.2 and

We then used vector fitting to the NMDS ordinations (envfit function) to determine the effects of microsite, climate treatments, extracellular enzyme activities, and key plant traits; significance values were generated with 9,999 random permutations stratified within experimental blocks.
