<p class="p">Soil depth varies substantially across the study site, and as the most pronounced differences in plant species composition were observed between the shallowest and deepest microsites within plots (Fridley et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>), we collected two soil samples from each of the two shallowest (0–7 cm soil depth) and the two deepest (&gt;20 cm depth) microsites per plot in September 2011. To exclude immediate abiotic effects of the treatments, we sampled 1 month after the end of the annual drought and rainfall treatments but before the start of the winter warming treatment. We used a 1‐cm‐diameter punch corer to minimize disturbance to the vegetation and the sampling depth in all microsites was ≤10 cm. Two of the shallowest microsites were bare bedrock and no samples were collected; all other samples were composited to make one sample per microsite, making a total of 78 samples. All samples were transported to the laboratory on ice and frozen at −20°C on the same day.
