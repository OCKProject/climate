<p class="p">The Buxton study was established in 1993 on calcareous grassland in Derbyshire, UK. Climate treatments are applied to 3‐m × 3‐m plots in five fully randomized blocks; a full description of the site and experimental design is given in Grime et al. (

The treatments sampled in the present study were: “heated” to 3°C above ambient temperature from November to April; “drought” in which rainfall is excluded during July and August; “watered” with water supplementation of 20% above the long‐term average from June to September; and nonmanipulated controls. Between 2006 and 2008, eight 10‐cm × 10‐cm microsites were established in each plot; the microsites were characterized by detailed measurements of surface soil pH (0–3 cm depth) and soil depth (Fridley et al.,
