<p class="p">To investigate the effects of climate treatments on soil microbial communities, we performed community fingerprinting using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) analysis of soil bacteria and fungi. This low‐cost high‐throughput method can perform as well as deep sequencing when investigating ecological patterns in microbial communities at local to regional scales (van Dorst et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) and provides qualitatively similar data for modeling community dynamics (Powell et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). DNA was extracted from 0.25 g of soil and resuspended following Griffiths, Whiteley, O'Donnell, and Bailey (
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>) as described in Sayer et al. (
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Briefly, we targeted the bacterial 16S rRNA gene using the primers 63F and 530R (Thomson, Ostle, &amp; McNamara, 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) and the fungal ITS region using the primers ITS1‐F and ITS4 (Klamer &amp; Hedlund,

 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). Forward primers were labeled at the 5′ end with 6FAM fluorescent dye, and PCR was conducted in 50 μl reaction volumes using 50 ng of template DNA. Amplicons were purified using PureLink PCR purification kits (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and digested using restriction endonuclease MspI for bacteria (Thomson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) and Taq1 for fungi (Jasalavich, Ostrofsky, &amp; Jellison, 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>; Singh, Dawson, Macdonald, &amp; Buckland, 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Fragment analysis was performed using a 3730 DNA analyser (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) and individual terminal restriction fragments (TRFs) were binned manually using Genemarker software (SoftGenetics, PA, USA). Prior to statistical analyses, the intensity of each TRF was converted to relative abundance based on the total intensity of all detected TRFs; for plot‐level analyses, we used the mean abundance of each TRF from the four microsites per plot. This approach provides a semiquantitative measure of abundance to assess differences in soil microbial community structure among sites but precludes measures of diversity (Bent, Pierson, &amp; Forney, 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) and excludes rare species (Woodcock, Curtis, Head, Lunn, &amp; Sloan, 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>).
