<p class="p">Long‚Äêterm climate treatments at Buxton modified the communities of bacteria and fungi in the soil. Whereas the relative abundances of dominant microorganisms were similar among treatments, we observed changes in subordinate fungal and bacterial taxa. We found evidence for potential links between the observed changes in soil microbial community structure and specific traits of the plant communities within microsites.</p>
