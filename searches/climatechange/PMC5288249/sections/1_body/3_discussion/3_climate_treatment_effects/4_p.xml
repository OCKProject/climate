<p class="p">Drought also altered bacterial community structure in the soil but subordinate taxa were not disproportionately affected (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32700-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>b,d) and only six taxa were entirely absent from the drought plots. As the treatments were applied during two summer months each year, the high resilience of bacteria to short‐term “pulse” disturbances (Shade et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) could allow most soil bacterial taxa to persist in all treatments and microsites. Furthermore, dormant organisms, which are included in our community fingerprints (Rastogi &amp; Sani, 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>), can persist under unfavorable conditions, and rapid growth rates would allow dormant bacteria to recover rapidly after the end of a treatment period (Shade et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>).
