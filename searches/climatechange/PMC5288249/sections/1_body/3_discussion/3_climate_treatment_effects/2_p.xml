<p class="p">In contrast to previous studies, we found a strong effect of drought on soil fungal community structure in microsites within the climate treatments, which was largely a result of changes in the relative abundances of subordinate fungi (Figures 
 <xref rid="ece32700-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>c and S2). This was unexpected because fungi are widely regarded as drought‐tolerant (Harris, 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1981</xref>; Schimel et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) and previous studies have reported high resistance of soil fungi to drought treatments (De Vries et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012a</xref>; Fuchslueger, Bahn, Fritz, Hasibeder, &amp; Richter, 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Yuste et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). We propose two possible explanations for this apparent discrepancy:

  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Changes in the abundances of fungal taxa may be more important and more readily apparent in grasslands such as Buxton, because fungal decomposers are more important in systems with low soil fertility and slow‐growing perennial plant species (De Vries et al., 
    <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012b</xref>). Conversely, many of the studies reporting high resistance of soil fungi to drought were conducted in productive grasslands with bacteria‐dominated soil food webs (e.g. De Vries et al., 
    <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012a</xref>,
    <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">b</xref>; Fuchslueger et al., 
    <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>).

   <p class="p">To our knowledge, our study is the first to distinguish the responses of dominant and subordinate microbial taxa to long‐term climate treatments. On the one hand, the dominant taxa were largely unaffected by drought, which supports the hypothesis that they are likely to be generalists with a broad range of tolerances (Wallenstein &amp; Hall, 
    <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). On the other hand, 32% of all subordinate fungal taxa were entirely absent from the drought treatments. As subordinate taxa represent only a small proportion of the total fungal community, these changes would go undetected in studies using indiscriminate or low‐resolution methods such as microbial biomass or lipid biomarkers, because those measurements would primarily reflect changes in most abundant taxa.
