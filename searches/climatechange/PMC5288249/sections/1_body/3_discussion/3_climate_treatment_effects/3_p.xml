<p class="p">We used general fungal primers that do not specifically target mycorrhizal fungi, and consequently, the observed shifts in the drought treatments will mainly reflect differences in the abundances of decomposer and pathogenic fungi (Klamer &amp; Hedlund,

 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Nonetheless, a previous study at Buxton showed that the drought treatments reduced the density of extraradical mycorrhizal hyphae in the soil (Staddon et al.,
