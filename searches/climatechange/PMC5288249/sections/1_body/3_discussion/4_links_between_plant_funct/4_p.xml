<p class="p">Changes in the relative abundance of subordinate taxa were also related to functional traits associated with the quality of plant material (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32700-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b,d), but intriguingly, the concordance between plant and microbial communities decreased when dominant taxa were excluded. This suggests that the observed links between microbial community structure and vegetation within microsites could be associated with resource quality, rather than with particular plant species. Species‐rich plant assemblages have high chemical diversity, which requires greater microbial resource specificity and reduces functional redundancy (van der Heijden et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). The substantial losses of subordinate fungal taxa in the drought plots could therefore indicate greater sensitivity of specialists with high resource specificity or competitive exclusion by organisms that have benefitted from the changes in plant inputs. As the relative abundances of the dominant microbial taxa remained largely unchanged (Fig. S1), the shifts in soil microbial community structure among climate treatments were largely driven by the responses of subordinate taxa and we propose that changes in plant inputs within microsites represent a plausible mechanism for the shifts in subordinate soil microbial taxa.
