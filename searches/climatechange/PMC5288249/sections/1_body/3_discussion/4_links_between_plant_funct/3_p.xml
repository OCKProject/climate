<p class="p">Changes in soil microbial communities in the drought plots were related to the high leaf construction cost of slow‐growing, stress‐tolerant vegetation (Figures 
 <xref rid="ece32700-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ece32700-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>; Fridley et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Shifts in the relative abundances of microbial taxa could therefore reflect increased abundance of organisms that are able to degrade recalcitrant plant material, with concomitant declines in taxa dependent on labile, nutrient‐rich plant material. Shifts in the soil fungal community were also related to leaf dry matter content, whereas changes in soil bacteria were related to differences in plant C:N ratios (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32700-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). These relationships indicate that shifts in the abundances of specific taxa could be linked to decomposition processes because fungal decomposers are specialized in degrading tough, nutrient‐poor carbon sources, whereas many soil bacterial groups preferentially use more labile plant material and have higher nutrient requirements (De Boer, Folman, Summerbell, &amp; Boddy,
