<p class="p">Theoretically, the soil microbial communities at Buxton should be adapted to drought because they naturally experience high variation in soil moisture (Schimel et al.,

 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Nonetheless, 17 years of chronic summer drought altered soil microbial communities and the relationships between soil microbial community structure, plant species composition, and plant traits within the microsites at Buxton provide evidence to support our hypothesis for indirect effects of climate change on soil microbial community structure via plant inputs. The climate treatments at Buxton have resulted in distinct plant communities in microsites within the drought and heated plots (Fridley et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). A recent study of community‐weighted plant traits demonstrated greater investment in leaf material by slow‐growing, stress‐tolerant plant species in the drought plots, whereas the plant traits in the heated plots reflect greater productivity of more competitive species (Fridley et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32700-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). We hypothesized that shifts in plant traits representing the quality and quantity of resources available to microorganisms could explain some of the observed changes in soil microbial communities.
