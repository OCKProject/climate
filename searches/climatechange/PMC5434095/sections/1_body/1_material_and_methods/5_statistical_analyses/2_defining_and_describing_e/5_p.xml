<p class="p">To investigate whether population trends were related to extreme population responses, each species' long-term change in abundance was plotted against the maximum absolute population crash or explosion (that qualified as an extreme) for that species, and also against the mean of all extreme crash or explosion events experienced by that species during the study period. These two metrics should reveal whether extreme population changes have a long-term effect on population size (e.g. if numbers were high and crashed in year 5, and stayed low thereafter, there would be a negative relationship between year and population size; but if there was density-dependent recovery, there would be no relationship, or even a positive relationship). Species that did not show any extreme population change values (
