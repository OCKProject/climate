<p class="p">There are many different approaches to defining an extreme event, including identifying observations at the tails of a given frequency distribution (typically, and arbitrarily, selecting 5 or 10% of the data), or those above or below an absolute critical threshold (e.g. [

 <xref rid="RSTB20160144C36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]). In the context of our study species, the percentile approach would mean that all species would be assigned at least one good year and one bad year, irrespective of the spread of year-to-year changes in index across their study periods. We therefore identified extreme changes as those beyond species-specific thresholds, defined by the median value over the study period ± two median absolute deviations (MAD) [
