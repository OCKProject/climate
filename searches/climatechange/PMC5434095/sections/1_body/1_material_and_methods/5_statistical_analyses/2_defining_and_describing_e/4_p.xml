<p class="p">We investigated the degree of association between the occurrences of explosions/crashes across all years by correlating the proportion of Lepidoptera (or birds) experiencing population crashes each year to the proportion of Lepidoptera (or birds) experiencing population explosions, using Spearman's rank correlations. We then identified ‘consensus’ years, during which more species experienced extremes in the same direction (crash or explosion) than would have been expected by chance, based on a one-tailed exact binomial test using the observed frequencies of crashes and explosions within each group (Lepidoptera or birds, with Bonferroni correction for multiple-year testing).</p>
