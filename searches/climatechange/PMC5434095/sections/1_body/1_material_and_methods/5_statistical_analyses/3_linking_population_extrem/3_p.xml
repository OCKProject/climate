 <xref rid="RSTB20160144TB1" ref-type="table" class="xref">tableÂ 1</xref>) using a Fisher's Exact-Boschloo test. For this test, we used a contingency table which summed the number of occasions when species consensus years coincided (or not) with years with extreme climate (with up to 1-year lag). Then, in order to investigate more generally if extreme population responses were associated with ECEs, the summed number of Lepidoptera or bird species experiencing an extreme event (crash or explosion) each year was plotted against (i) the three-dimensional Euclidian distance from the PCA origin, (ii) drought index, and (iii) daily minimum temperature of coldest 30 days, as we hypothesized these would be the main drivers of population change for our focal species groups. In each case, we accounted for a direct and a 1-year lagged effect. As such, statistical inference was Bonferroni-corrected for multiple (
