<p class="p">Each period of population change refers to the change in index values (counts) between years, for example between 1968 and 1969. Each climatic year also corresponds to a 12-month period (with the exception of drought index), such that the climate referred to as ‘1969’ refers to the climatic period from 1 September 1968 to 31 August 1969 (
 <xref rid="RSTB20160144TB1" ref-type="table" class="xref">table 1</xref>). The data for these two years would be compared to consider direct (lag 0) effects of climate on population change (e.g. the 1969 climate compared to the 1968–1969 population change). Population crashes and explosions were also related to climatic conditions in the previous year (climatic year ‘1968’, lag 1). We considered lagged effects because impacts of ECEs can be direct (e.g. population growth in response to a warm summer), or delayed by a year or more due to species' long generation times or through altered natural enemy or food abundances.
