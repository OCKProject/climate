<p class="p">We included butterfly and moth species for which there were at least five sites with non-zero counts in every year of the time series (37 years for butterflies and 45 for macro-moths), and birds which were sufficiently well monitored by both CBC and BBS surveys. Migrant birds and true-migrant Lepidoptera were excluded, because extreme population changes of such species may not be a result of climate experienced solely in our study area, although the English populations of the most mobile species will still experience some exchanges with regions outside the study region. Thus, we included 178 macro-moth species, 29 butterfly species and 31 bird species in our analyses (listed in electronic supplementary material, table S1). Butterflies and moths were analysed together as they belong to one taxonomic order (Lepidoptera), while we hypothesize that birds will differ in their response to climate, and so they were analysed separately.</p>
