<p class="p">For each macro-moth and butterfly species, we obtained national indices of abundance in two steps: first, for each species, we related the species' annual count data per site to year (as a fixed factor) in a generalized mixed effects model with site as a random intercept, and a Poisson error distribution. We then took the fixed (year) coefficients from each species' model, which quantify the annual relative abundances of species.</p>
