<p class="p">We obtained species data for butterflies, moths and birds from the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS; [
 <xref rid="RSTB20160144C28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]), the Rothamsted Insect Survey (RIS; [
 <xref rid="RSTB20160144C29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]), the Common Bird Census (CBC; [
 <xref rid="RSTB20160144C30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]) and the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS; [
 <xref rid="RSTB20160144C31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]). These schemes are national networks of standardized count surveys using either territory mapping (CBC), fixed-location line transects (UKBMS and BBS) or fixed-location light traps (RIS). Butterfly count data (species' abundances for individual sites each year) were collected from 1665 sites spanning the years 1976–2012. Macro-moth count data (species' abundances for individual sites each year) were from 295 sites spanning the years 1968–2012. National population indices of birds spanned the years 1968–2012, combining data from the CBC, which ended in 2000, with data from the BBS which started in 1994 (see [
 <xref rid="RSTB20160144C10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]). There were no bird data for the year 2001 because foot-and-mouth disease severely restricted access in that year.
