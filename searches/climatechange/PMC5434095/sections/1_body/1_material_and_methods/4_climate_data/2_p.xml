<p class="p">We downloaded gridded climate data for the period 1965–2011 from the UK Met Office website (

These data provide daily estimates of minimum and maximum temperature, and monthly rainfall estimates, at a spatial resolution of 5 × 5 km on the Ordnance Survey National Grid reference system. From these data, we derived a set of 13 annual climate variables that may correlate either directly (physiological limits) or indirectly (i.e. relevance for habitat, food or host plants) with the population dynamics of our study species (electronic supplementary material, tables S1 and S2). Further analyses were conducted on spatial mean values, calculated across England, for each year in the population time series.
