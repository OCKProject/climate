<p class="p">We reduced levels of collinearity in the climate data using the following procedure, whereby highly correlated variables (Pearson's |
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>| &gt; 0.7) were sequentially removed. For each pair of correlated variables in turn, starting with the most strongly correlated pair, the variable that was collinear with the greatest number of other climate variables was removed; where a pair of variables was collinear with the same number of other variables, the one with the largest mean absolute correlation was removed. The seven retained climate variables included measures of rainfall seasonality, drought, temperature range, growing degree days as well as coolness and hotness (
