<p class="p">In every year of our time series, at least three species of Lepidoptera and/or birds showed an extreme response in population size, and some species experienced extreme population crashes while others simultaneously experienced extreme population explosions in nearly every year. These findings give support to our first hypothesisâ€”that the responses of species to climatic variability are individualistic (i.e. most years are associated with extreme population changes in some species). We also found support for our second hypothesis: population crashes tended to be more frequent than population explosions during periods of rapid climatic change (as new conditions are experienced by populations that are potentially locally adapted to historical conditions). Furthermore, population crashes were more extreme than explosions (explosions are constrained by the intrinsic rate of population growth whereas it is possible for all individuals to die). Thirdly, we did find that there were six statistically unusual consensus years when many species experienced extreme population changes, and we obtained support for the hypothesis that these events were associated with climatically extreme years. Finally, we found only limited and weak support (among birds) for the hypothesis that long-term population trends are correlated with extreme population responses, probably because the processes that are operating in most years (which are not extreme) are usually more important determinants of long-term trends than are rare extremes. We conclude that extreme population events are individualistic despite occasional consensus years, and are likely to be linked to climatic extremes (from the perspective of each species), but that these extreme events are only weak predictors of long-term population trends for the taxa we consider.</p>
