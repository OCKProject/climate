<p class="p">An additional reason why a link between extreme population events and long-term trends may not be apparent could be related to historical extreme events (constraints) that are no longer in operation. Climate warming may be just as likely to reduce or remove some historical constraints as to impose new ones. For example, the insectivorous Dartford warbler 
 <italic class="italic">Sylvia undata</italic> was virtually extinguished from England by the severe winter conditions of 1961/1962 [
 <xref rid="RSTB20160144C48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>], but this bird species has subsequently increased in abundance and expanded its distribution in the absence of such a severe winter cold constraint [
 <xref rid="RSTB20160144C14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Dartford warblers still do worse in cold winters, but these temperatures are now insufficiently cold to determine the overall population trend. This phenomenon would lead to little or no correlation across species in their most extreme population responses and their overall population trends. Species may be released from historical constraints (including extremes), just as they may be hampered by novel ones.
