<p class="p">It would seem reasonable to suppose that populations exhibiting major crashes would tend to decline in the long term, and those experiencing population explosions would increase. However, extreme events are rare, and many smaller population changes in ‘normal’ years might fully compensate for such extreme events. Density-dependent responses to extremes may also prevent any long-term consequences of extreme events from being realized. Our data suggest that any impact of single extreme events on long-term trends is limited (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20160144F5" class="xref">figure 5</xref>). In particular, for Lepidoptera and bird species experiencing population crashes (either as the most extreme event they experienced or as the average of all extreme events), some of them showed long-term declines and others showed long-term increases. The same was true for Lepidoptera that experienced population explosions. It was only in birds where species explosions tended to be linked to more positive long-term population trends.
