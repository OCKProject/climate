<p class="p">Linking all of these extreme population changes to variation in the climate is difficult, given that extreme population responses took place in every year and lagged responses can occur. Moreover, some population explosions and crashes may have nothing to do with the climate, or with the interaction between the climate and other species. Biological interactions that take place within communities, including exaggerated (over-compensating) responses to density-dependent interactions, can potentially generate population fluctuations in the absence of external drivers.</p>
