<p class="p">In general, we demonstrated an overall lack of association between climate and population responses across all years. However, we did find that consensus years (when many species showed extreme changes) were more likely to occur in years that were also extreme from a climatic perspective. With such rare events (six consensus years), we should be cautious about attributing them to specific climatic conditions. Nonetheless, five of the six consensus years appear to be associated with either cold winters (historic extremes that may be becoming less frequent and extreme), and with hot and dry summers (extremes that may increase in frequency and strength). Similarly, when we looked across all extreme responses rather than just the consensus years, we found associations with drought (for Lepidoptera) and winter cold (for birds). It should be noted that there were some years which were climatically extreme but did not generate biological consensus years; but given that birds and Lepidoptera differed in their dynamics (i.e. responding most strongly in different years) it is entirely feasible that other taxa that we did not study responded strongly in those years.</p>
