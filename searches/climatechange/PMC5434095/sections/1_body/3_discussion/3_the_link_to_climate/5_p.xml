<p class="p">Three of the six biological consensus years took place in the same year as a climatic extreme, but the negative effects of hot and dry conditions in 1976, and of extreme winter cold in 2010/2011, were mainly observed as lagged population responses (around a quarter of the Lepidoptera species crashed in 1976/1977). The summer of 1976 was hot, and also experienced the greatest drought index in the 45-year time series, owing to hot and dry conditions stretching back to the spring/summer of 1975 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20160144F1" class="xref">figureÂ 1</xref>). This apparent lag in Lepidoptera response may be an issue of detection rather than a true biological phenomenon; individuals may have died in the summer of 1976, but it was not until the 1977 generation failed to emerge that this was noticed. For example, numbers of the Adonis blue butterfly

 <italic class="italic">Hippocrepis comosa</italic> dried up and caterpillars then starved [

 <italic class="italic">Aphantopus hyperantus</italic> also crashed [
 <xref rid="RSTB20160144C43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] and so it seems likely that direct effects of the 1976 drought were largely responsible for the subsequent population crashes of other Lepidoptera. Impacts of summer drought conditions upon birds are likely to be weaker than for Lepidoptera (bird populations did not change abnormally in 1975/1976 or 1976/1977), although there is some previously documented evidence for lagged effects on some bird species that feed on soil invertebrates (e.g. [
