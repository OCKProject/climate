<p class="p">There was also a tendency for the magnitudes of crashes to be greater than the magnitudes of increases. We interpret this as arising because it is, in principle, possible for all individuals within a large population to die simultaneously when they experience an extreme event, whereas population growth is constrained by the intrinsic rate of increase of a species. Nonetheless, for insects, the potential fecundity of individuals is high, and so extreme population growth can occasionally be achieved, especially for species that can accomplish multiple generations within a single year.</p>
