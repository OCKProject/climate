<p class="p">Although species generally differed in the years they found to be extreme, there was some agreement across species. First, there was evidence that species groups as a whole tended to respond in the same direction in a given year (i.e. experiencing either crashes or explosions), presumably in response to the same (climatic) drivers. Second, we detected six ‘consensus years’ in which a statistically significant excess of species exhibited crashes or population explosions. Furthermore, each of these years was characterized by near unanimity in the direction of the extreme population response. Although we should be cautious in interpreting five consensus (generally) bad years to one consensus good year as an excess of negative extreme events, we also found significantly more (by 46%) crashes than population explosions across the entire dataset. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that more bad than good events are expected when the climate is changing rapidly. If populations show some degree of local adaptation to historical conditions, they may show extreme population collapses under novel conditions (even if they subsequently recover through adaptation to the new conditions).</p>
