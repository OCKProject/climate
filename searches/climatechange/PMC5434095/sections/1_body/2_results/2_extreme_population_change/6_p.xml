<p class="p">The existence of common drivers that acted across multiple species was supported by the detection of five ‘consensus’ years for Lepidoptera (1975/1976, 1976/1977, 1992/1993, 2006/2007 and 2011/2012) during which statistically unusual numbers of species showed population explosions or crashes (at

Only one of these (1975/1976) was a consensus good year, while the other consensus years were generally bad years, during which nearly all extreme population changes (54 out of 59 in 1976/1977, 25 out of 26 in 1992/1993, 30 out of 32 in 2006/2007 and 42 out of 42 in 2011/2012) were negative (
