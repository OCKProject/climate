<p class="p">Out of a possible 10 178 species-by-year combinations, 374 (3.7%) population crashes and 257 (2.5%) population explosions were detected: an excess of crashes over explosions (two-tailed exact binomial test, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 631, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Crashes also tended to be larger in their absolute magnitudes than explosions in both Lepidoptera (Welch two-sample

 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = −3.82, d.f. = 454.05,

 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = −2.41, d.f. = 116.71, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.02). For Lepidoptera, crashes (mean = −0.52, range −1.03 to −0.22) were on average around 13% greater in magnitude than explosions (mean = 0.46, range 0.21 to 1.30). Similarly for birds, crashes (mean = −0.13, range −0.48 to −0.03) were on average 18% greater in magnitude than explosions (mean = 0.11, range 0.04 to 0.23).
