<p class="p">At a species-specific level, there were 38 cases across the study period (for seven birds, five butterflies and 21 moths) when an extreme population explosion was preceded by an extreme population crash, which represents 15% of the 257 population explosions that happened in total. Similarly, there were 31 cases (for two birds, five butterflies and 21 moths) when an extreme population crash was preceded by an extreme population explosion, representing 8% of the 374 population crashes. These may represent some combination of density-dependence, delayed climatic effects, delayed climatic effects mediated by density dependence, and coincidence when favourable conditions were followed by unfavourable conditions, or vice versa.</p>
