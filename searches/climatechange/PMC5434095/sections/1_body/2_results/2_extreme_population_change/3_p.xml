<p class="p">We detected a significant negative association between the proportion of Lepidoptera experiencing population crashes and the proportion experiencing population explosions across years (Spearman's rank correlation: 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> = 22 284.09, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 <sub class="sub">s</sub> = −0.57, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), indicating that when multiple species did exhibit extreme changes in the same year, they tended to respond in the same direction. This was not significant for birds (
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> = 13 689.1, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 <sub class="sub">s</sub> = −0.11, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.49). Extreme population changes were, nonetheless, expressed in different directions in 41 of the 44 years considered (i.e. the populations of some species crashed and others exploded in the same year). Furthermore, even in the most extreme years (see below), most species did not exhibit extreme population responses, demonstrating the individualistic nature of the extreme population changes exhibited by species.
