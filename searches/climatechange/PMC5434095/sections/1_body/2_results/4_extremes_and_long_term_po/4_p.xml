<p class="p">When we repeated this analysis for birds, we did find an effect of extreme events. We found that bird species experiencing population explosions (as single events, or the mean of their species-specific extremes) tended to have more positive long-term population trends than bird species that exhibited crashes (for single events,

The different results for Lepidoptera and birds suggest that there may be taxonomic differences (perhaps linked to generation times) in the association between extreme events and long-term trends.
