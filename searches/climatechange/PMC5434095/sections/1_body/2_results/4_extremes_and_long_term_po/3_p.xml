<p class="p">For Lepidoptera, we first compared two groups of species: those for which the single most extreme event was a crash, and those for which the single most extreme event was a population explosion. We found no association between extreme population change and trend (one-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test: 
 <italic class="italic">W</italic> = 3439.5, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.19; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20160144F5" class="xref">figure 5</xref>
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>). We then took the mean of all extreme events exhibited by each species. Again, there was no difference between the long-term population trends of ‘crashing’ and ‘exploding’ species (
 <italic class="italic">W</italic> = 3583, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.45; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20160144F5" class="xref">figure 5</xref>
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>). Regardless of the direction and magnitude of the extreme, some species showed long-term increases, and others showed long-term declines.
