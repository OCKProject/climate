<p class="p">Five of the 10 climatically extreme years (1978/1979, 1985/1986, 1989/1990, 1994/1995 and 1995/1996) did not coincide, with or without lag, with any of the consensus population change years in either Lepidoptera or birds. Given that extreme events tended to happen in different years for Lepidoptera and birds (

 <italic class="italic">Passer montanus</italic> declined in association with some, but not all, cold winters (
