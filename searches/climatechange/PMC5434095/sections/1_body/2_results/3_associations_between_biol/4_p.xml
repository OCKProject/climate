<p class="p">The one consensus good year for populations was 1975/1976, when 9% (

Subsequently, significant numbers of Lepidoptera (54 of 207 species, 26%) experienced population crashes between 1976 and 1977. However, while 1976/1977 was the year with the most Lepidoptera crashes (54 of 207 species), a few Lepidoptera (four species) still experienced population explosions in the same year. This suggests that there can be cumulative effects, and that some climatic extremes may generate opposite direct and lagged effects (in this case, explosion followed by crash).
