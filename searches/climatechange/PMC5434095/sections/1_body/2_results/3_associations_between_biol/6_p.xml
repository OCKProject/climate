<p class="p">We then considered extreme population changes in all years in relation to PCA scores, drought and winter cold. There was no correlation between three-dimensional distance from the PCA origin (a measure of how climatically unusual a year was) and the proportion of species experiencing an extreme event (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20160144F4" class="xref">figure 4</xref>). The relationships between species' responses, drought and winter cold were also noisy for both Lepidoptera and birds (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20160144F4" class="xref">figure 4</xref>), with only two significant relationships detected after Bonferroni correction. The first significant relationship was for drought index of the previous year and the proportion of Lepidoptera species experiencing an extreme change (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20160144F4" class="xref">figure 4</xref>
 <italic class="italic">d</italic>). The second was a significant negative correlation between the proportion of birds experiencing an extreme population change and daily minimum temperature of the coldest 30 days (

 <italic class="italic">e</italic>). However, in both cases, the correlations ceased to be significant (after Bonferroni correction) once the largest consensus year was removed (1976/77 for Lepidoptera,

 <sub class="sub">40</sub> = 1.45, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.22,

 <sub class="sub">38</sub> = −2.81, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = −0.41, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.01). This reinforces the view that consensus years are genuinely unusual. In the analyses above we reported the proportion of species experiencing an extreme change (both explosion and crash), but results were qualitatively the same when analysing those experiencing crashes or explosions, separately (see electronic supplementary material, figures S1 and S2, respectively).
