 <xref rid="RSTB20160144C4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. The precise sequence of climatic events and the time of year when these events occur may affect whether a species' biological response is rapid life cycle development and increased reproduction leading to population growth, or increased mortality leading potentially to extinction. In the context of this paper, climate change represents a change to the frequency, severity and sequences of different weather events, which may lead to increases in the frequency of some forms of extreme events such as those associated with heat, drought or flooding, but decreases in others, such as those associated with cold [
 <xref rid="RSTB20160144C5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. It has been suggested that such extreme events may generate substantial population responses and community transitions, and that these rare events could be as important in determining ecological responses to climate change as are long-term changes to the average climatic conditions that a population experiences [
 <xref rid="RSTB20160144C6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. However, rigorous assessment of the frequencies and impacts of extreme population responses are constrained by the limited availability and spatial/taxonomic coverage of long-term population data [
 <xref rid="RSTB20160144C7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], and also because a given sequence of climatic events will not necessarily generate a consensus response in organisms [
 <xref rid="RSTB20160144C6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] due to interspecific differences in species' ecological traits and sensitivity to climate. Previous studies have highlighted the individualistic nature of species' responses to different aspects of the climate at different times of year [

 <xref rid="RSTB20160144C11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] although, in general, such studies have focused on describing responses to climatic means, rather than extremes. Here, we assess the extent to which extreme population responses are individualistic (i.e. whether there is an agreement among species about which years are ‘extreme’), and evaluate whether extreme population responses are important determinants of species' long-term population trends.
