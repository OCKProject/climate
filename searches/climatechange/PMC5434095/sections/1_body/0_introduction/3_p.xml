<p class="p">Extreme climatic events (ECEs), by their very nature, are outside of the norm experienced by organisms and to which species may be (locally) adapted. As such, we hypothesize that extreme events are more likely to drive negative rather than positive population changes. Therefore, we also assess whether extreme species' responses are more frequently negative, and whether these events are commonly associated with unusual climatic conditions. Previous approaches to understanding the importance of ECEs for biological communities have been either to identify such an event (e.g. a drought) and then see if some or many species responded to it or, alternatively, to seek an explanation for one-off extreme population changes that have been observed [
 <xref rid="RSTB20160144C12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Such studies have provided strong evidence of population crashes in response to unusual climatic conditions, especially in relation to extreme droughts, winter freezing, unseasonal cold and excessive heat ([

 <xref rid="RSTB20160144C21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]). However, there is potential that the results could be unrepresentative if the choice of year, climatic event or species under consideration have been influenced by the events themselves. Hence, the choice of study species may not be appropriate to elucidate the frequencies of rare events or their long-term importance during a period of climatic change. As Bailey &amp; van de Pol [

 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="RSTB20160144C22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] discuss, a major drawback of many studies linking ecological and climatic extremes has been a focus on the impacts of single climatic events, over short time periods, leaving questions remaining about the long-term implications of extreme events (but see [
 <xref rid="RSTB20160144C23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]). Here, we remove these potential biases by taking a multi-species approach, analysing data over a relatively long, continuous time period to find out whether extreme population changes tend to take place in, or following, years that are also climatically extreme. To do this, we utilize long-running population dynamic data at a national scale for 238 species from two broad taxonomic groups (31 birds and 207 Lepidoptera in England), to identify group- and species-specific differences in population responses to ECEs. For each species, we identify years when they show unusually high levels of population growth or decline, and assess whether the proportion of species exhibiting extreme population changes each year are associated with particular climatic conditions.
