<p class="p">For linguistic simplicity, throughout this article we refer colloquially to population ‘crashes’ (steep year-to-year national population declines—see Material and methods), population ‘explosions’ (rapid increases), ‘bad years’ (years in which crashes take place), ‘good years’ (years in which explosions take place), ‘consensus bad years’ and ‘consensus good years’ (years with a significant excess of population crashes or explosions, respectively). We consider the hypotheses that: 
 <list list-type="simple" class="list">
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">(i) most years are associated with extreme population changes in some species (because biological responses to the environment differ among individual species and between higher taxonomic groups);</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">(ii) population crashes tend to be more frequent than population explosions during periods of rapid climatic change (as new environments are experienced), and crashes are more extreme than explosions (because the latter are constrained by the intrinsic rate of population growth whereas, in principle, all individuals could die simultaneously);</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">(iii) consensus years are associated with unusual climatic conditions in the same or previous year; and</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">(iv) long-term population trends are correlated with extreme population responses.</p>
