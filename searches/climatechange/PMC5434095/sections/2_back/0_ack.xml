 <p class="p">We thank the thousands of people, mainly volunteers, responsible for monitoring Lepidoptera and bird populations (UKBMS, BBS, CBC and RIS surveys). The UKBMS is run by Butterfly Conservation (BC), the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) and the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), in partnership with the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC), and supported and steered by the Forestry Commission (FC), Natural England (NE), Natural Resources Wales (NRW), Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA) and Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH). Light-trap data were provided by the RIS, a National Capability supported by the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); we thank P. Verrier, C. Shortall, and the survey volunteers for these data. Rothamsted Research is a national institute of bioscience strategically funded by BBSRC. Climate data were provided by the UK Met Office. CBC was funded by the BTO and JNCC, and BBS by the BTO, RSPB and JNCC (on behalf of CCW, NE, CNCC and SNH), with fieldwork conducted by BTO members and other volunteers. Bird population trends for England data were provided by a partnership jointly funded by the BTO and JNCC.</p>
